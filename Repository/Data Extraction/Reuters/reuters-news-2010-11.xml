&lt;p&gt; * SEC investigating CDO made up of other CDOs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Hedge fund Magnetar invested in the CDO
 (Adds statements from Magnetar spokesman, JPMorgan spokeswoman
and JPMorgan loss on the deal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 1 (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators are
investigating whether JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) adequately
disclosed that a hedge fund helped to select assets for a $1.1
billion package of subprime mortgages, while betting against
parts of the deal, investigative journalism website ProPublica
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ProPublica, citing people familiar with the probe, said
hedge fund Magnetar bought the riskiest piece of the package in
a bet against the mortgage market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2007 deal, called "Squared," was a collateralized debt
obligation, or CDO, made up of pieces of other CDOs, ProPublica
said. Those portions of CDOs were in turn backed by mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ProPublica said Magnetar often bought the riskiest parts of
such deals and then made side bets against the deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan kept large parts of Squared on its own books
without any hedge and it lost about $880 million on the deal,
ProPublica reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC's investigation is part of its wider probe of the
CDO market and it is not clear how far the investigation has
progressed, ProPublica said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steven Lipin, a spokesman for Magnetar at public relations
firm Brunswick Group, disputed the ProPublica story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Contrary to ProPublica's assertions, Magnetar did not have
a strategy to bet against the mortgage market," Lipin said in
an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and an independent manager originated the deal
before Magnetar agreed to invest in it, he said, adding that
Magnetar did not select the assets for Squared or require that
any specific assets be put into that transaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokeswoman said the bank and other firms have
received an inquiry from the SEC about the CDO business. "We
are cooperating fully with the inquiry," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEC spokesman John Nester had no comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares closed down 0.55 percent at $37.42.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, the SEC sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) over another CDO transaction. The SEC accused Goldman
Sachs and one of its vice presidents of putting together a CDO
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co helped to
choose the underlying assets and bet against them.

law which is incrementally phasing in tougher emission standards. The
state aims to achieve 1990 GHG emission levels by January 1, 2020.

			Nicola Walter Design  D&#233;cor Announces Partnership with Healthy 
      Dwellings to Offer the Ultimate in Healthy Home Design
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Healthy Dwellings, a New York based environmental assessment company, 
      and Nicola Walter Design and D&#233;cor, Inc., a New York based 
      boutique-style interior design and decorating firm, have entered into a 
      partnership to bring together their expertise to answer the question of 
      what is the ultimate healthy indoor living space.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "This is a great opportunity to bring together the best of both worlds: 
      the design components including such elements as feng shui and harmonic 
      conversion along with mitigation of environmental stressors like VOC&#8217;s 
      and electromagnetic fields,&#8221; said Nicola Walter, owner and founder of 
      Nicola Walter Design  D&#233;cor, Inc. "Health and well being in our living 
      space is as much about the visible elements of design as it is about the 
      invisible elements, or stressors, that our bodies deal with on a daily 
      basis."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A design consultation considers every possible element in the home and 
      is chosen for a purpose&#8230; to promote health and harmony. From the shape 
      and color of a pillow to the special radio frequency shielding fabric 
      incorporated into the curtains, no detail is without purpose. &#8220;Health 
      and harmony is our main priority and we put great time and thought into 
      our recommendations. We include the principals of Building-Biology in 
      every project,&#8221; states Matthew Waletzke, a certified building biology 
      environmental consultant and owner and founder of Healthy Dwellings. 
      Building-Biology originated in Germany and is the study of how our 
      health can be affected by our indoor environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Public demand for healthy living spaces and green design is on the rise. 
      The goal of Healthy Dwellings and Nicola Walter Design  D&#233;cor Inc. is 
      to utilize green and environmentally sustainable products wherever 
      possible. &#8220;Well-being through design and health go hand in hand. Just 
      because something is made from recycled plastic does not mean it is 
      healthy for us&#8221; said Mr. Waletzke. The team also goes beyond healthy 
      design by utilizing environmentally conscious contractors on their 
      projects. They truly are setting a new standard for the ultimate healthy 
      home.

			Havoline to Move Under Chevron Brand in North America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Move Increases Marketing Support and Sales Opportunities for Leading 
      Premium Motor Oil Brand 
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Products Company today announced that beginning mid-2011 it will 
      consolidate its Texaco Havoline&#174; lubricant product line &#8211; in 
      North America &#8211; under the Chevron brand. The updated Havoline product 
      line will feature the Chevron logo. By rebranding Havoline in North 
      America, the company will create a more comprehensive Chevron product 
      line while providing expanded marketing and sales opportunities &#8211; across 
      the continent &#8211; for the Havoline brand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launched in 1904, Havoline is recognized worldwide as a leading premium 
      passenger car motor oil, lubricant and coolant brand. The Havoline 
      product line is sold regionally under the master brand that provides the 
      greatest marketing advantage &#8211; Texaco in Europe and Latin America, 
      Caltex in Asia Pacific and Africa, and now Chevron in North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Moving the Havoline product line under the Chevron family is the 
      natural next step in consolidating our North America lubricants, 
      coolants, additives and chemicals products under one master brand,&#8221; said 
      Doug Hinzie, vice president, Americas, Chevron Lubricants. &#8220;In 2008, the 
      company began this process by successfully bringing its commercial and 
      industrial product lines under the Chevron master brand. With this move, 
      the Havoline brand will achieve greater visibility, increased retail 
      opportunities, expanded marketing support and the benefits of being part 
      of the Chevron brand, which enjoys a much larger presence than Texaco in 
      North America. This change is one component of our long-term plan to 
      reinforce and grow the Havoline brand &#8211; one of the most enduring, 
      respected and valued brands in the lubricant market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the move, the premium Havoline brand will experience 
      increased distribution through Chevron Lubrication Marketers and Chevron 
      retail locations. Texaco retail fuel stations will also offer the 
      Chevron branded Havoline product line.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of this effort Chevron will grow its premium-branded, Havoline 
      xpress lubes, with the Chevron master brand endorsement as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The only visible change to the Havoline product line will be the 
      inclusion of the Chevron logo. Most importantly, Havoline motor oils 
      will continue to offer outstanding engine protection to customers across 
      North America.

      Options IT Leverages IBM to Deliver Private Cloud Environment for 
      Financial Services Firms
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Options PIPE&#174; platform helps firms execute faster and more 
      efficient trades
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Options 
      IT, a leading provider of high-performance financial technology 
      Infrastructure-as-a-Service to buyside and sellside firms, has leveraged IBM 
      (NYSE: IBM) to deliver private cloud technology to financial services 
      clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Options IT private cloud solutions enable clients such as hedge funds, 
      proprietary trading shops or trading desks inside of investment banks to 
      take advantage of global trading opportunities by facilitating a virtual 
      plug and play technology environment for their trading models and other 
      financial applications via the Options 
      PIPE platform. By leveraging an existing global platform, firms are 
      able to greatly reduce the time to market for launching new trading 
      strategies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As the global markets have become increasingly fragmented, trading 
      strategies have become increasingly reliant on sophisticated trading and 
      risk management models,&#8221; said Nigel Kneafsey, CEO, Options IT. &#8220;And as 
      the costs of managing the trading strategy have risen, we&#8217;ve seen a 
      dramatic shift in the number of firms outsourcing the underlying 
      technology infrastructure, management and market connectivity needed to 
      run a competitive financial services business. With the Options PIPE 
      clients can plug their applications into an existing private cloud 
      infrastructure, pay only for the resources they use, and have the 
      ability to move their strategies around the globe, on-demand, when the 
      opportunities arise.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In today&#8217;s competitive global business environment, companies are 
      recognising the need to reduce complexity and cost in order to increase 
      their business agility,&#8221; said Andy Park, Cloud Leader, IBM UK and 
      Ireland. &#8220;To do so, many organisations are accessing key business 
      applications through cloud deployments. IBM expects the global cloud 
      computing market to grow at a compounded annual rate of 28 percent from 
      $47 billion in 2008 to $126 billion by 2012.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Options IT&#8217;s private cloud infrastructure platform leverages IBM 
      BladeCenter&#174; technology, located at each of its 18 global data centres. 
      Rapid provisioning of new servers enables Options IT to quickly scale 
      services up or down depending on market conditions and customer demand. 
      The compact architecture minimises rack-space requirements, reducing 
      costs, and enables Options IT to pass those efficiencies along to their 
      clients.

			Here are highlights from Friday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Expedia Gathers Momentum
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Expedia Inc.&#8217;s (Nasdaq: EXPE) 
      second quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus by 38 cents or 69.1%, 
      on revenue that beat by 5.1%. As a result, Expedia shares were up 3.29% 
      in after-market trading yesterday.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Revenue
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue for the quarter was $987.9 million, up 18.5% sequentially and 
      15.9% year over year. Expedia&#8217;s results are indicative of secular growth 
      trends in online travel spending, as borne out by all product lines in 
      the last quarter. Currency had a 3 percentage point impact on sequential 
      comparisons.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Revenue by Segment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leisure customers remained the largest revenue contributors, generating 
      nearly 83% of revenue. Corporate customers (Egencia) were under 4%, 
      while TripAdvisor brought in the remaining 13%. The three categories 
      grew 20.5%, 11.2% and -2.8%, respectively from the June quarter of 2010. 
      They were up 12.2%, 43.3% and 29.6%, respectively from the year-ago 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While strength in the leisure category was expected, given online 
      trends, growth at Egencia comes as a welcome change. The corporate 
      segment has been sluggish in the recent past, given the recession in the 
      U.S. However, Expedia stated that both large companies and small and 
      medium-sized ones had started to increase their travel expenditure. In 
      the last quarter, Expedia added some big names, such as Procter  
      Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) 
      and NASDAQ. With a stronger outlook for both leisure and corporate 
      travel, advertisers are also coming, which helped revenue in the last 
      quarter. TripAdvisor, in particular, did exceptionally well, recording 
      third-party revenue growth of 59%. This business is growing at a $500 
      million annual runrate, with the international portion posting 
      triple-digit year-over-year growth in each of the last 4 quarters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Revenue by Channel
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Around 68% of total revenue was generated through the merchant business 
      (direct sales), another 20% came through the agency model (where Expedia 
      operates as an agent of the supplier) and roughly 12% came from 
      Advertising and Media. The three channels witnessed 23.4%, 10.1% and 
      8.3% sequential growth, respectively in the last quarter. Growth rates 
      from the year-ago quarter were 13.4%, 12.0% and 41.0%, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Revenue by Product Line
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hotel and Air, the two main product lines grew 14% each from the 
      year-ago quarter. The increase in Hotel revenue came from a 13.8% 
      increase in room nights, helped by a 4% increase in the average daily 
      rate (ADR). This was the biggest ADR increase since December 2008. The 
      flattish revenue per night was encouraging, given the large number of 
      hotel additions in the recent past. The increase in ticket revenue was 
      attributable to a 10% increase in ticket volumes and 4% increase in the 
      revenue per ticket. Airfares were up 9.0%, indicative of stronger demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Revenue by Geography
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Around 60% of Expedia&#8217;s quarterly revenue was generated from the 
      domestic market, with the remaining 40% coming from international 
      sources. The domestic market grew 10.7% sequentially and 13.0% from a 
      year ago. The international market was much stronger, growing 32.2% 
      sequentially and 20.2% from last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bookings and Revenue Margin
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gross bookings were $6.9 billion in the last quarter, up 3.1% 
      sequentially and up 16.5% year over year. The percentage of bookings 
      converted to revenue (revenue margin) was 15.0%, an increase of 192 bps 
      sequentially and a decline of 5 bps from the year-ago quarter. The 
      international revenue margin was better than the domestic. All segments 
      (except Egencia) and channels contributed to the sequential increase. 
      All segments and channels had weaker revenue margins than in the 
      year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Margins
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 80.8%, up 98 bps 
      sequentially and 64 bps year over year. Credit card processing costs, 
      customer services and telesales expenses continued to increase, as the 
      number of transactions increased from 16.9 million in the June quarter 
      to 18.1 million in September. However, volume increases offset the 
      impact in the last quarter and Expedia currently expects the trend to 
      continue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The operating expenses of $512.9 million were up 10.7% sequentially. 
      However, the operating margin was 28.8% increased 462 bps sequentially, 
      while declining just 6 bps from September last year. All expenses 
      declined as a percentage of sales from the previous quarter. Sales and 
      marketing expenses were up significantly from a year ago.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating Income before Amortization (OIBA) increased from $256.4 
      million in September 2009 to $293.7 million in the last quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Net Income
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a pro forma basis, Expedia generated a net income of $267.5 million, 
      or a 27.1% net income margin compared to a $120.9 million, or 14.5% in 
      the previous quarter and $135.1 million or 15.8% net income margin in 
      the same quarter last year. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per 
      share (EPS) were 93 cents compared to 42 cents in the June 2010 quarter 
      and 46 cents in the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Our pro forma estimate excludes intangibles amortization charges on a 
      tax-adjusted basis, but includes deferred stock compensation. Our pro 
      forma calculations may differ from management&#8217;s presentation due to the 
      inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Including the special items, the GAAP net income was $257.9 million (90 
      cents a share) compared to $114.3 million (40 cents a share) in the 
      previous quarter and $117.0 million (40 cents a share) in the year-ago 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Balance Sheet
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cash and short term investments totaled $1.55 billion at quarter-end, up 
      $427.2 million during the quarter. However, Expedia raised debt during 
      the quarter, which resulted in a net debt position of $90.4 million. 
      Including long term liabilities, the debt to total capital ratio was 
      42.2%, still at very manageable levels. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) 
      went down from 43 to around 38 days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company generated $4.4 million of cash from operations and spent 
      $40.2 million on capex, $19.7 million on dividends and $195.9 million on 
      share repurchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Expedia reported a solid third quarter and we believe there are secular 
      growth divers in the company&#8217;s business. Aside from growth prospects in 
      the domestic market, Expedia has tremendous growth opportunities 
      internationally, particularly in the Asia/Pacific market, where online 
      penetration is still low. Of course, the company will continue to face 
      challenges from players like Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN), 
      Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE: OWW) 
      and Travelocity in all its endeavors. There are just a couple of factors 
      that are holding back shares right now. The first is Google Inc&#8217;s 
      (Nasdaq: GOOG) 
      venture into the travel market, which is likely to increase costs for 
      Expedia. The other is the incidence of occupancy taxes, which remains a 
      hotly debated and contested issue today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We have a short term Hold rating on Expedia shares, which translates to 
      a Zacks #3 Rank.

			Here are highlights from Friday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chevron Fails to Deliver
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) 
      &#8211; the second largest U.S. oil company &#8211; reported weaker-than-expected 
      third-quarter 2010 profits. Earnings per share (excluding 
      foreign-currency effects) came in at $2.06, below the Zacks Consensus 
      Estimate of $2.15. This was mainly on account of costs related to the 
      Gulf of Mexico (&#8220;GoM&#8221;) drilling moratorium and lower U.S. volumes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result, Chevron could not match the soaring profit gains posted by 
      other integrateds, such as ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM),
			ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) 
      and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE: RDS.A) 
      though it was the latest to benefit from higher commodity prices and 
      stronger refining margins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a brighter note, Chevron&#8217;s adjusted earnings per share improved 14.4% 
      &#8211; from $1.80 to $2.06. Quarterly revenue rose 6.6% (from $46.6 billion 
      to $49.7 billion) and was 3.3% above our projection amid stronger oil 
      and gas realizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shares of Chevron have lost more than 1.9% as of this blog post in 
      Friday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Upstream
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s total production of crude oil and natural gas increased 
      marginally (by 1.3%) from the year-earlier level to 2,738 thousand 
      oil-equivalent barrels per day (MBOE/d), driven by volume gains in 
      Thailand and Brazil, which were almost offset by normal field declines 
      in the U.S. and downtime associated with maintenance and repairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. output dipped 7.1% year-over-year though Chevron&#8217;s international 
      operations (accounting for 75% of the total) experienced a 4.6% rise in 
      volumes. Gains on the overseas production front were supported by higher 
      realized oil/gas prices. However, these factors were more than offset by 
      higher expenses, resulting in a 4.6% year-over-year drop in upstream 
      earnings to $3.6 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Production Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite lackluster volume growth during the quarter, Chevron&#8217;s 
      production outlook remains one of the most robust in its peer group, 
      with a number of major deepwater projects scheduled to come online 
      during the next few years. Major start-ups during the last few months 
      include the Tahiti and Perdido in the Gulf of Mexico, Frade offshore 
      Brazil and Tombua-Landana in Angola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recently, Chevron announced its plans to invest approximately $7.5 
      billion to develop two large fields &#8211; Jack and St. Malo &#8211; in deepwater 
      GoM. The company has also acquired a 70% operated interest in three 
      deepwater concessions in Liberia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Downstream
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s downstream segment's earnings jumped to $565 million during 
      the quarter, as against a profit of $262 million in the previous-year 
      period. The positive comparison can be attributed to improved refined 
      products margins and higher earnings from chemical operations (primarily 
      from the 50%-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC), partially 
      negated by lower refined product sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Capital Expenditure  Balance Sheet
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron spent $6.1 billion in capital expenditures during the quarter, 
      up 33.0% from the year-earlier level. Approximately 89% of the total 
      outlays pertained to upstream projects. As of September 30, 2010, the 
      company had $11.0 billion in cash and total debt of $10.6 billion, with 
      a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of about 9.4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Share Repurchase Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron further informed that it will restart quarterly buybacks of up 
      to $1 billion of its common stock starting from the fourth quarter of 
      2010. The San Ramon, California-based oil behemoth is targeting a 
      quarterly repurchase rate of $500 million to $1 billion as part of a 
      program earlier approved by the Board of Directors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Recommendation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Notwithstanding the earnings disappointment, we remain encouraged by 
      Chevron&#8217;s longer term operational outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We like Chevron&#8217;s strong pipeline of development projects and impressive 
      recent exploration successes that will drive its long-term success. The 
      company&#8217;s high oil price sensitivity and rebounding downstream 
      operations add to the positive sentiment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, production shortfalls associated with PSC (Production Sharing 
      Contract) interest reductions, exploration results and unpredictable 
      refining performance continue to keep us on the sidelines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As such, we are currently Neutral on Chevron shares with a Zacks #3 Rank 
      (Hold).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Deckers Beats, Lifts Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Deckers Outdoor Corporation (Nasdaq: DECK), 
      the maker of a variety of footwear, recently delivered 
      better-than-expected third-quarter 2010 results on the heels of strong 
      demand for the product lines under the UGG and Teva brands, prompting 
      management to lift its fiscal 2010 outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The quarterly earnings of $1.07 per share outdid the Zacks Consensus 
      Estimate of 93 cents, and rose 24.4% from 86 cents earned in the 
      prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Behind the Headline
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deckers said that total net sales jumped to $277.9 million, up 21.7% 
      from the prior-year quarter, comfortably surpassing the Zacks Consensus 
      Revenue Estimate of $266 million. The company&#8217;s sustained focus on new 
      product introductions and geographic expansion have helped achieved 
      robust growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Domestic sales for the quarter rose 14.3% to $204.7 million, whereas 
      international sales soared 48.2% to $73.2 million. International sales 
      now represent 26.3% of total sales up from 21.6% in the year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The international markets provide a significant growth opportunity, and 
      we remain optimistic about the company&#8217;s incremental sales and earnings 
      potential. Internationally, the company distributes its products 
      throughout Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada and Latin America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      UGG brand net sales grew 20.2% to $255.8 million and Teva brand net 
      sales surged 51.7% to $13.7 million. Combined net sales of Deckers&#8217; 
      other brands for the quarter soared 26.5% to $8.4 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sales for the retail store business surged 63.3% to $20.2 million, 
      propelled by the rise in same-store sales by 17.9%, and the opening of 8 
      new stores since the prior-year quarter. The company increased its 
      domestic in-store shops to about 100. In China, the company opened 3 new 
      UGG retail stores. Sales for the company&#8217;s eCommerce business climbed 
      3.8% to $8.7 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite a 12.6% increase in cost of goods sold, gross profit jumped 
      33.7% to $131 million during the quarter, whereas gross profit margin 
      expanded 420 basis points to 47.1%, reflecting better sales mix, direct 
      distribution for the Teva brand in the Benelux region, refunds of duty, 
      and margin improvement across all brands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management now expects the rise in manufacturing and materials costs to 
      touch the high-end of the previously provided guidance range of 5% to 
      10% in fiscal 2011 due to increase in commodity prices, which may dent 
      gross margin.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  RESTON, VA, Nov 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Netuitive, Inc., which provides a self-learning analytics platform for
cloud management, today announced a new integration with IBM Tivoli, a
leading systems management tool for large enterprises. 

    The enhanced, native integration is perfectly aligned with all of
Tivoli's management features and significantly expands the ability of
Netuitive to scale to the size of the IBM Tivoli estate. IBM Tivoli
customers can now better leverage Netuitive for automated performance and
capacity management in virtualized and cloud environments.

    Netuitive's analytics platform uses patented Behavior Learning technology
to replace manual, rules-based approaches with automated mathematics that
self-learns the operational behavior of IT systems and applications. It
allows enterprises to plug in and synthesize data streams from existing
monitoring sources across silos through Netuitive's analytics engine in
real time. It forecasts issues before they impact performance and
isolates root cause wherever a problem occurs. 

    The result is improved service-level visibility, automated problem
diagnostics and predictive analytics that enable organizations to manage
their performance and capacity proactively and end-to-end. 

    The new, native IBM Tivoli integration joins Netuitive's portfolio of
leading IT monitoring tools already integrated with Netuitive. These
include solutions from BMC, CA, Compuware, HP, Infovista, Microsoft,
NetApp, NetIQ, Oracle, TeamQuest, VMware, and others. 

    "The integration with IBM Tivoli is significant for our large enterprise
customers," said Nicola Sanna, CEO of Netuitive. "Anyone with IBM Tivoli
can now leverage Netuitive's analytics platform for real-time performance
and capacity management of physical, virtual and cloud infrastructures
across any aspect of the IBM Tivoli estate."

    For example, if you are running IBM WebSphere on Windows you can now
leverage Netuitive's analytics platform to analyze the performance of
everything from the applications running within WebSphere, to the
WebSphere servers themselves, to the operating system metrics, as well as
what is going on within the backend database.

    Recently categorized as "transformational" by Gartner, Behavior Learning
technology, which is at the core of the Netuitive solution, is being
recognized as a key advancement for proactively isolating major
performance issues connected to virtualization and cloud computing.(1)(2)

    About Netuitive
 Netuitive provides self-learning analytics software for
end-to-end cloud management. Netuitive technology replaces human
guesswork with automated mathematics and analysis to identify, forecast
and resolve IT problems before they impact quality of service. Hundreds
of customers, including seven of the 10 largest banks, rely on Netuitive
to manage their mission-critical applications. Industry recognition
includes the 2010 CODiE Award for "Best Systems Management Solution," the
2010 EMA Award for "Best Analytics," and the 2009 "Best of VMworld" Award
for Virtualization Management. For more information, visit
www.netuitive.com.

    In July, Gartner published the Hype Cycle for IT Operations Management,
2010(1) and the Hype Cycle for Real Time Infrastructure, 2010(2).
Behavior Learning was listed and was categorized as transformational in
both reports and was the only technology to achieve a transformational
categorization in the Hype Cycle for IT Operations Management, 2010. 

    (1) The Gartner Hype Cycle for IT Operations Management, 2010 was
published on July 12, 2010, and authored by Gartner analyst Milind
Govekar. 

    (2)The Gartner Hype Cycle for Real Time Infrastructure, 2010 was
published on July 22, 2010, and authored by Gartner analyst Donna Scott.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - China should let the yuan rise further to help its transition toward a consumption-based economy, although there is no clear evidence the currency is undervalued, a senior executive at Goldman Sachs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Higher inflation in China had contributed to rises in the yuan's real exchange rate, said Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs asset management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To allow further modest appreciation may make some sense," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not in China's own interest to keep accumulating foreign exchange reserves, the world's largest stockpile at $2.65 trillion at the end of September, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill said he suspected China would link the yuan's appreciation to a target on its current account balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yi Gang, a central bank vice-governor, has said that China is drafting a plan to limit its current account surplus to less than 4 percent of GDP over the next three to five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's current account surplus is getting close to 4 percent and such a promise will help make Beijing's stance more acceptable to other countries, particularly the United States, O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me that it would be quite a good idea for China to agree to this idea of a 4 percent current account surplus target," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a G20 meeting in South Korea last month, the United States proposed that countries set a target of capping either their current account surplus or deficit at 4 percent of gross domestic product. But there was no consensus on the U.S. proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Langi Chiang and Kevin Yao; editing by Stephen Nisbet)&lt;/p&gt;

      conjunction with the inventors and AVRS&#8217;s expert witness, have entered 
      into the final round of filings in the proceedings in the interference 
      between AVRS, Inc. (Senior party) and Allvoice (Junior party) that was 
      declared March 9, 2010 involving Allvoice&#8217;s patent No. 5,799,273 (&#8220;the

      Microsoft filed a motion for Partial Summary Judgment of Invalidity on

      involved in the interference.

      to this point. AVRS has reached the final stage of the interference 
      proceeding, and we are optimistic about achieving our objectives. We are

&lt;p&gt;  SUGAR LAND, TX, Nov 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- Global oil
and gas leader Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) (San Ramon, California) saw
mixed results in the third quarter of 2010 as improved pricing was offset
by higher expenses, rendering total revenues and earnings essentially
flat with those of third-quarter 2009. Net income was reported to be
$3.77 billion, a 1.64% decrease from the same period last year.
Industrial Info is tracking 109 active Chevron projects worldwide that
are worth a total of more than $69 billion, including the $18.5 billion
Gorgon LNG Production Plant on Barrow Island in Western Australia. For

bln-paper
 (Adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nidhi Verma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW DELHI, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Indian state-run explorer Oil
and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.BO) is examining a proposal to buy
U.S. energy major Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) holding in an oil block
in Angola, a top official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The proposal has come to us. We keep getting such
proposals and we are examining," said R.S. Butola, managing
director of ONGC Videsh, the overseas investment arm of ONGC.
"Definitely, we are interested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Butola said the talks were at initial stages and declined
to comment on the valuation of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the Angolan field stake buy would be a
welcome acquisition for India, which has been lagging China in
the hunt for natural resources as both countries seek to feed
their fast economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global petroleum firms Exxon Mobil and Total (TOTF.PA) want
to exit from Block 31 in Angola, Angolan Oil Minister Jose
Botelho de Vasconcelos said separately at an energy conference
in the Indian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not give any reason for the planned stake sale by
Exxon and Total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In Block 31, some of the companies are leaving the block.
Our state oil company Sonangol has the responsibility to find
other partners," the minister said, without commenting on the
likely deal size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, the Economic Times reported that ONGC was in talks
with the Exxon's Angolan arm, Esso Exploration, to buy the U.S.
energy major's 25 percent stake in Block 31 for about $2
billion. [ID:nBMA008743]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A unit of French oil major Total has a 15 percent stake in
the block, the paper said.
  The block will produce 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day
at its peak by 2012, the paper said, citing the website of the
United States Energy Information Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in ONGC, valued at about $63 billion, was trading
1.5 percent higher at 1,322.80 rupees at 0731 GMT in the main
Mumbai market .BSESN that was trading 1.7 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ONGC last week posted a 6-percent rise in quarterly profit
on higher earnings from crude sales, but missed street
estimates on higher subsidy payouts. [ID:nSGE69S02L]

&lt;p&gt; SYDNEY, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N), the
second-largest U.S. oil company, is considering a new
multi-billion dollar floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant
in Western Australia, according to a media report.

 James Blackwell, head of Chevron's Asia-Pacific exploration
and production, told the Australian newspaper floating LNG
would certainly be an option.

 The plant would be to develop Exmouth plateau resources
which are Chevron's farthest offshore, the paper said.

      David J. West, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Hershey 
      Company (NYSE:HSY), today announced that the Company&#8217;s Board of 
      Directors has elected J.P. Bilbrey Executive Vice President, Chief 
      Operating Officer, effective immediately. Bilbrey, currently Senior Vice 
      President, President Hershey North America, will continue to report to 
      West.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bilbrey brings 30 years of consumer packaged goods experience in the 
      United States and international markets to this newly created role. He 
      will be responsible for Hershey&#8217;s day-to-day operations and global 
      commercial activities, leading the Company&#8217;s supply chain as well as 
      realigned geographic regions, including the U.S.A., the Americas and 
      Asia. Bilbrey will also lead two newly created global strategic business 
      units (SBU). The Chocolate SBU and Sugar Confection SBU will be 
      responsible for building and leveraging Hershey&#8217;s global brands, 
      creating confectionery marketplace innovation and disseminating best 
      demonstrated practices around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;J.P. has an extensive record of success in delivering global growth and 
      in building successful teams at Hershey,&#8221; West said. &#8220;In this new role, 
      J.P. will ensure that we continue our unrelenting focus on building on 
      our competitive advantage in the U.S. while at the same time we focus on 
      developing other international markets. We will continue to make the 
      investments that will enable us to build scale in key growth markets 
      such as China and Mexico. This new structure will enable Hershey to 
      build formulas for repeatable success in our global markets. J.P.&#8217;s 
      global experience and knowledge of our business will ensure that more 
      and more consumers around the world will come to recognize the quality 
      and fun represented by Hershey&#8217;s brands.&#8221;

      &#8220;The Company is experiencing strong performance,&#8221; said James E. Nevels, 
      Chairman of the Board. &#8220;But we will not rest on our laurels. This new 
      structure will enable Dave West to have more focus on the strategic and 
      business development initiatives that will ensure Hershey delivers 
      disciplined global expansion while it maintains its current momentum. 
      The new structure also strengthens our regions and enables us to more 
      fully leverage our brands around the world. J.P. will lead the 
      international rollout of our consumer demand landscape, ensuring that 
      best practices and resources are shared globally.&#8221;

      America. In this position, he is responsible for leading Hershey&#8217;s U.S.

      Company&#8217;s turnaround since the creation and implementation of the 
      Company&#8217;s consumer demand landscape as well as in establishing Hershey&#8217;s 
      presence in markets around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prior to his current position, Bilbrey was Senior Vice President, 
      President Hershey International, where he was responsible for directing 
      the Company&#8217;s international businesses and the execution of its global 
      strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported disappointing sales on Tuesday, hurt by generic competition for its Lipitor cholesterol fighter and Effexor XR depression drug as well as weak revenue in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last of the large U.S. drugmakers to report third-quarter earnings, Pfizer (PFE.N) followed the example of most rivals with higher-than-expected profits -- largely from cost cuts -- but disappointing sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generic competition is causing pain, and this is just a taste of what Pfizer will be going through in the next few years," said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose shares fell more than 1 percent, said global sales of Lipitor fell 11 percent to $2.53 billion in the quarter. The arrival in recent months of Lipitor generics in Canada and Spain hurt the world's top-selling medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bigger threat to Pfizer comes in November 2011, when Lipitor loses U.S. marketing exclusivity. Pfizer bought Wyeth last year for $67 billion to replace vanishing Lipitor revenue with brands from its former U.S. rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a half dozen other Pfizer drugs also lose U.S. patent protection in the next few years, including impotence treatment Viagra and Xalatan for glaucoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effexor XR, a Wyeth anti-depressant that once had annual sales of $3 billion, was battered by cheaper U.S. generic versions launched over the summer. Sales of the pill plunged to $175 million in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As with the rest of the industry, patent losses are hurting the bottom line, and it's always especially tricky to gauge the real magnitude of patent erosion in overseas markets," Conover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMERGING MARKETS SALES FLAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest drugmaker is also counting heavily on fast-growing emerging markets to bolster results in coming years. But its sales in those markets, excluding the Wyeth brands, were essentially flat in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The flat growth rate was due to inventory adjustments, principally in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe," Ian Read, head of Pfizer pharmaceuticals, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although inventory changes cause Pfizer's emerging market sales to bounce around from quarter to quarter, the company said the sales have risen 6 percent for the year to date and the longer-term trend continues to look bright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's net earnings fell to $866 million, or 11 cents per share, from $2.88 billion, or 43 cents, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding merger costs and other special items, Pfizer earned 54 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 51 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company took a $701 million charge in the quarter for asbestos litigation involving its Quigley Co subsidiary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global revenue rose 39 percent to $16.17 billion, swelled by the addition of Wyeth products, but would have risen 40 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales lagged the consensus Wall Street forecast of $16.68 billion -- in contrast to the second quarter, when a weaker dollar helped Pfizer trounce analysts' sales estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer raised its full-year 2010 profit forecast to between $2.17 and $2.22 per share, from its prior view of up to $2.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company stuck to its 2012 outlook of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which suggests stability during the first full year after Lipitor goes generic in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Edward Jones analyst Linda Bannister said the decline of Pfizer shares on Tuesday suggests skepticism the company will emerge so intact from its ongoing patent cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's uncertainty whether they'll deliver, and how they're going to get there," Bannister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares are down 4.5 percent for the year to date, versus a slight gain for the drug group. They are trading at 8 times expected 2011 per share earnings, a considerable discount to most U.S. rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer were down 19 cents to $17.43 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with moderate gains for the drug sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Derek Caney, Maureen Bavdek and Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;

      looking for ways to better manage their securities, client and 
      counterparty data, and to do&#160;hierarchy management.

&lt;p&gt;MIDLAND, Michigan (Reuters) - For Andrew Liveris, the future of Dow Chemical (DOW.N) may involve smaller acquisitions akin to a strategy employed by tech titan IBM (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chief executive of the largest U.S. chemical maker said he is through with mega-buyouts and wants to focus on bite-sized deals aimed at growing globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I love the IBM model," Liveris told Reuters. "They got to a certain size and from that moment on, they did bolt-on technology MA, which they scaled up around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since gulping down rival Rohm  Haas for more than $15 billion in 2009, Dow has been trying to slash debt, sell stray assets and increase its earnings -- all while surviving the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the 13.5 percent rise in its share price so far this year lags the 41 percent gain registered by rival DuPont (DD.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In short, Dow has its hands full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the next 10 years of Dow will need a big-bang deal," he said. "I'm not saying you wouldn't do a half billion or a billion-dollar deal. But there's no need for the Rohm  Haas type of deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joint ventures, however, are on the radar, although Dow turned down at least one proposal earlier this year for a joint venture involving its highly lucrative plastics business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We resisted exiting at a low multiple," Liveris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, Dow's plastics businesses were set to be spun off into a joint venture with a Kuwaiti state-owned company before the Kuwait government scuttled the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That failed deal is set to go before an arbitrator next year in London, and Dow expects a ruling around July 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that has not stopped the company from considering other deals, Liveris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are actively working on several possibilities," he said. "We remain bullish on plastics."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Dow said it expects annual earnings of $3.50 to $5.50 per share in the "near term" [ID:nN01176333]. Last year, Dow earned 63 cents a share, and analysts on average expect earnings of $1.81 a share this year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liveris said he is confident the Rohm buyout is paying off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are on a path of progress," Liveris said. "Make no mistake about it, we will not veer from that path."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FAMILY TIME&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite his breakneck schedule -- he travels much of the year for Dow and sits on the Citigroup (C.N) board -- Liveris said he is never far from home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Married to his wife, Paula, for more than 20 years, he has three children, all of whom were born during various Dow assignments around the world, including in Hong Kong and Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liveris, 56, is a native of Australia of Greek heritage and does not hold U.S. citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what he did for the Halloween holiday, Liveris pulled out his phone -- Research in Motion's RIM.TO BlackBerry Torch -- and showed off his creations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I carved Halloween pumpkins: a dog, cat, a Cyclops, an American flag and a cross," he said. "I am very invested in my family -- it's all my discretionary time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This past weekend Liveris was designated an archon in the Greek Orthodox Order of St. Andrew the Apostle, an honor given for "outstanding service to the church," according to the order's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's the oldest honor in Christendom, first done in 48 AD by St. Peter," Liveris said. "It was one of the most emotional times of my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

      Inc. today announced general availability of the Accellion Secure

      Infrastructure Platform. By extending secure file transfer capabilities 
      to Microsoft Outlook 2010, Microsoft SharePoint 2010, and Microsoft

      According to Nicholas Owens, network engineer for Thomson Reuters, &#8220;In 
      our organization, SharePoint is used as our document repository for 
      storing all of our product information. We have a large number of 
      documents that are typically sent to customers, downloaded and then sent 
      via email. The Accellion SharePoint plug-in allows us to send these 
      files very efficiently and securely through our virtual Accellion 
      appliance, and more importantly, allows us to keep these files out of 
      the e-mail system and off of our employees&#8217; computers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, Nov 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
GreenGainers.com, a premier source for micro cap research, provides
wide-ranging due diligence and insight on stocks all over the market.
GreenGainers Investment Stock Reports primary focus is to alert our
valued subscribers to small cap and micro cap companies poised for
explosive movement in the market. Timing in the market is critical! To
receive our FREE comprehensive newsletter, please visit
http://greengainers.com/.

    GreenGainer Alerts Investors to the following Stocks: Citigroup
Inc.Copyright, JP Morgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), General
Electric Company (GE), Ambac Financial Group (ABK), The Boeing Company
(BA),Wilmington Trust (WL), Ford Motor (F), Trina Solar (TSL) and Tuesday
morning's premiere stock on our watch list: dPollution International Inc.
(OTCBB-RMGX).

    The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting higher prices for oil in the
second half of 2011 and 2012 as the global inventory surplus is
exhausted, this could mean renewed interest in alternative energy and
technologies which make more efficient use of fossil fuels possible and
financially attractive. One such company is dPollution International Inc.

    dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and distribution
rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology that reduces polluting
emissions and increases mileage. dPollution 's innovative products
improve engine performance by causing fuel to combust more efficiently
and completely. The technology works on all closed-combustion engines,
including those used in cars, trucks, buses, trains and heavy equipment.
For more information, visit http://greengainers.com.

    According to latest polls voters in California intend to cast a "No" vote
on Proposition 23, in effect keeping the state on track with the current
law which is incrementally phasing in tougher emission standards. The
state aims to achieve 1990 GHG emission levels by January 1, 2020.

    2010 Midterm Elections Impact On Green Technology 

    A major subtext of today's elections is the urgent need for financial
discipline. Candidates who have pledged to reign in government spending
are projected to be swept into Congress in record numbers. With the
National Unemployment Rate hovering around 10%, the voting public appears
to be in no mood for continued government waste.

    The public's seismic shift in attitude will strongly influence a new
trend that is already taking shape, clean technology that pays for
itself. The public is not against cleaning up the environment, but it
will no longer tolerate the government taxman reaching into its pocket to
make it happen. dPollution, a company on our watch list, is a major trail
blazer in this area. Their product lowers emissions and your gas bill at
the same time. To find out more about this cutting edge company please
visit our website: http://greengainers.com.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Nov 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IntelePeer Inc. (www.IntelePeer.com), a leader in the delivery of
communications via cloud-based infrastructure, today announced that
BriComp Computers, LLC has selected IntelePeer to provide hosted Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP) trunking connections to support unified
communications service offerings for Microsoft Lync 2010. 

    IntelePeer provides a comprehensive suite of on-demand communications and
SIP trunking services that are backed by deep communications expertise
and a proven Quick Start program to ensure partners' Microsoft Lync 2010
SIP trunk deployments are successful. Through its Cloud-based
infrastructure, Voice Peering Network and SuperRegistry(TM) of more than
422 million directly peered telephone numbers, IntelePeer simplifies
communications by delivering carrier-quality service over public or
private Internet Protocol (IP) connections directly to Microsoft Lync.
IntelePeer's patented platform provides real-time service availability
that spares customers from the need to change their data service provider
or existing communications equipment, eliminating the lengthy delays
associated with typical service deployments. 

    As part of the Microsoft Technology Adoption Program (TAP) to beta test
early releases, BriComp Computers, an independent IT consultant that
designs and builds infrastructure for Microsoft products, has been using
IntelePeer SIP trunking with the beta and now the current release
candidate of Lync 2010.

    "In addition to consulting, I write a blog on 'How-To' instructions for
configuring Microsoft Lync 2010 for Microsoft's TechNet online resource
center," said Brian Ricks, founder of BriComp Computers. "When I
evaluated IntelePeer's SIP trunking solution (www.IntelePeer.com), I was
impressed by the speed of deployment, flexibility and connection quality.
It's simply amazing that IntelePeer's SIP trunks work flawlessly right
out-of-the-box with the beta and now the current release candidate of
Microsoft Lync 2010." 

    "As a Microsoft Most Valuable Professional and expert in Microsoft
Unified Communications, Brian Ricks' endorsement carries tremendous
credibility," said Margaret Norton, general manager, enterprise for
IntelePeer. "We are focused on providing the necessary tools and support
to quickly and profitably roll out Microsoft Lync 2010 deployments. We
tailor our approach to fit each customer's need. With minimal up-front
cost and rapid turn-up, IntelePeer's SIP Trunking product delivers
superior quality and reliability."

      Obsidian Strategics, the makers of the Longbow&#8482; InfiniBand 
      range-extension, routing and encryption products, is pleased to announce 
      that it has joined IBM's PartnerWorld program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM was a major technology contributor to the open-standard InfiniBand 
      specification in 1999, and today successfully deploys InfiniBand in 
      numerous product lines, including its DB2 pureScale1 database 
      server clusters. Obsidian's technology team has been working with 
      InfiniBand since 2001, and today its Longbow family of products uniquely 
      provide secure, low-latency and high-bandwidth InfiniBand links over 
      standard optical wide area networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is exciting to watch InfiniBand flourish in data center 
      applications, outside the realm of pure supercomputing applications,&#8221; 
      said Dr. David Southwell, Obsidian's CTO. &#8220;Obsidian&#8217;s entry into IBM's 
      PartnerWorld program opens the possibility of exploring compatibility 
      and performance testing of DB2 pureScale configurations supporting 
      Longbow-enhanced stretched cluster links over regional and metro area 
      networks.&#8221;

      Obsidian Strategics&#8482; is the developer of Longbow&#8482;, a series of 
      InfiniBand products featuring range extension, routing and encryption. 
      Longbow technology allows an InfiniBand fabric, normally a short-range 
      network used in high-performance computing, to be extended via optical 
      fiber over varying distances. Longbow connects across Campus, Metro or 
      Global networks to enable unparalleled real-time backup over

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Nov 2 (Reuters) - The Nigerian subsidiary of U.S.
energy giant Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said it had made a rich gas
condensate discovery approximately 75 km (47 miles) off the
coast of Akwa Ibom state in the southeast of the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mobil Producing Nigeria, a joint venture with state-run
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), said the
discovery well in the Awawa Field in OML 104 was drilled to
almost 3,500 metres and encountered 50 metres of condensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Significant additional potential remains in untested deeper
targets ... as well as in adjacent fault blocks," the company
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the discovery was part of a programme to increase
oil and gas reserves and to supply power and natural gas to the
growing Nigerian domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite being Africa's largest oil and gas producer, Nigeria
is saddled with chronic power shortages because of the poor
condition of its domestic refineries and because weak regulation
has put many investors off trying to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government has introduced a new gas pricing regime to
try to encourage foreign energy firms to decrease flaring and
divert more of their gas towards the domestic power sector and
help meet the country's growing energy demands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gas demand from Nigeria's power sector is expected to grow
to 2.5 billion cubic feet per day by 2014 from 700 million now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Presidential adviser on energy Emmanuel Egbogah said earlier
the country had potential gas reserves of 600 trillion cubic
feet but that gas was still being flared because there was not
enough collection capacity in the system. [ID:nSGE6A10BL]

&lt;p&gt; * Cameron wants East London to rival Silicon Valley&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Google, Intel, Facebook expected to launch projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Estelle Shirbon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Nov 4 (Reuters) - The British government will create
a new "entrepreneur visa" and reform its intellectual property
laws to try to attract high-tech businesses, Prime Minister
David Cameron will announce on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cameron will set out plans to transform a stretch of East
London into a high-tech hub to rival Silicon Valley, starting
with new investments from the likes of Internet search leader
Google (GOOG.O), computer chipmaker Intel (INTC.O) and social
networking site Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Right now, Silicon Valley is the leading place in the world
for high-tech growth and innovation. But there's no reason why
it has to be so predominant," Cameron will say in a speech,
according to excerpts released in advance by his office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government last month announced a four-year plan of deep
cuts in public spending to tackle a record budget deficit.
Almost no area of government spending will be spared the axe and
half a million public sector jobs are expected to be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cameron says he wants to create better conditions for the
private sector to generate the jobs and growth that the public
sector will no longer be able to provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed new "entrepreneur visa" would allow people with
great business ideas and the backing of serious investors to set
up shop more easily in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposal comes at a time when the government is working
on plans to introduce a cap on immigration, in line with a
pre-election pledge from Cameron's Conservative party. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some in the Liberal Democrat party, the junior partner in
the two-party coalition government, are uncomfortable with the
cap. Business Secretary Vince Cable, a Lib Dem, has argued that
it would harm business interests by keeping top talent out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "entrepreneur visa" could be part of Cameron's response
to those concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COPYRIGHT LAWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cameron will also say that a company like Google could never
have started up in Britain because of a copyright system that is
not as open to innovation as it is in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So I can announce today that we are reviewing our
intellectual property laws, to see if we can make them fit for
the Internet age. I want to encourage the sort of creative
innovation that exists in America," he will say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cameron will also say that the government has had a series
of meetings since it came into office in May with technology
companies and venture capital investors to discuss ways to turn
East London into a world-class high-tech centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These talks have led to a series of commitments from
companies to invest in East London, previously a deprived
residential area which is already the focus of regeneration
efforts as it will host the London 2012 Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Projects will include an Intel research lab focusing on
performance computing and energy efficiency, an "innovation hub"
from Google where researchers, developers and academics can pool
ideas, and a permanent London home for Facebook's "Developer
Garage" programme for new talent in high-tech fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Network equipment maker Cisco (CSCO.O) will establish an
innovation centre in the Olympic Park, while telecoms group BT
(BT.L) will roll out superfast broadband in the area to give it
some of the fastest Internet speeds in Europe, Cameron will say.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP announced today that JP Morgan Chase  
      Co. (NYSE:JPM) and HSBC Securities Inc. (NYSE:HBC) face charges of 
      manipulating the market for silver futures and options in violation of 
      federal commodities and racketeering laws in a new lawsuit filed Tuesday 
      in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The suit &#8211; which alleges violation of the Commodity Exchange Act and the 
      Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act &#8211; alleges 
      that the two banks colluded to manipulate the market for silver futures 
      starting in the first half of 2008 by amassing huge short positions in 
      silver futures contracts they had no intent to fill, but did so to force 
      silver prices down to their benefit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The suit was filed on behalf of Carl Loeb, an independent investor in 
      silver futures and options, by Seattle-based Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro 
      LLP, a class-action and complex litigation firm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The practice of naked short-selling has long been a serious issue on 
      Wall Street,&#8221; said Steve Berman, co-counsel and managing partner at 
      Hagens Berman. &#8220;What we know about the scope and intent of JP Morgan and 
      HSBC&#8217;s actions in this short-selling scheme dwarfs any other similar 
      attempt to manipulate a commodities market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the complaint, JP Morgan amassed a sizeable short position 
      in silver futures and options in part through its March 2008 acquisition 
      of investment bank Bear Stearns. By August 2008, JP Morgan and 
      London-based HSBC controlled more than 85 percent of the commercial net 
      short position in silver futures contracts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The suit alleges that, starting in early 2008, the two banks began 
      manipulating the silver futures market by accumulating unusually large 
      &#8220;short&#8221; positions and then secretly coordinating enormous sales of 
      silver futures contracts on the Commodity Exchange, which is known as 
      &#8220;COMEX&#8221; and is part of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the lawsuit, JP Morgan and HSBC used a variety of methods 
      to coordinate their manipulation of the market for silver futures 
      contracts, signaling when to flood the COMEX market with short 
      positions, which caused the price of silver futures and options 
      contracts to crash.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The suit describes two &#8220;crash&#8221; events that were set in motion by JP 
      Morgan and HSBC, one in March 2008, and the other in February 2010, 
      after the defendants had amassed large short positions. In the wake of 
      both events, the suit alleges, COMEX silver futures prices collapsed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe that JP Morgan and HSBC&#8217;s scheme was carefully conceived and 
      coordinated to maximize their profits at the expense of innocent 
      investors who believed that they were trading in a market free from 
      manipulation,&#8221; Berman said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint also contains allegations that in September 2008 the U.S. 
      Commodity Futures Trading Commission launched an investigation that 
      would eventually consider allegations made by a London-based independent 
      metals trader named Andrew Maguire that the silver futures market was 
      being manipulated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint alleges that Maguire disclosed to the CFTC on Feb. 3, 
      2010, that he received a signal from the two banks of their intent to 
      drive down the prices of silver futures two days later, on Feb. 5, 2010. 
      Maguire&#8217;s information was correct and the price of silver dropped 
      dramatically between Feb. 3, 2010, and Feb. 5, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the lawsuit states that both JP Morgan and HSBC still 
      maintain highly concentrated holdings in short positions in silver 
      futures and options, giving both banks the ability to continue 
      manipulating the price of silver.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Plaintiffs&#8217; attorneys have asked the court to certify the case as a 
      class action and enjoin JP Morgan and HSBC from continuing their alleged 
      conspiracy and manipulation of the silver futures and options contracts 
      market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attorneys also ask the court to award damages and attorneys&#8217; fees to the 
      class.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is expecting to sell 5 million of its new controller-free Kinect gaming systems this holiday shopping season, potentially adding $750 million to the software company's revenue this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $150 device, which plugs into Microsoft's Xbox gaming console and allows users to play games simply by using gestures and voice commands, goes on sale at midnight in 30,000 stores across the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping to challenge Sony Corp's Move and Nintendo Co's Wii in the expanding motion-based gaming market, and reinvigorate the $60 billion global video game industry, which has been hit hard by the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, the company forecast 3 million Kinect sales, but the head of Microsoft's entertainment unit Don Mattrick raised the projection to 5 million in an interview with Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Presales have exceeded expectations," said Mattrick. "People are coming to us and saying this is must-have holiday item."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High demand for the Kinect may lead to shortages, Mattrick warned, which could crimp sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're anticipating that some of our partners will be sold out at points of time this holiday, and that's something we'll do our best to work through," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be midnight events at 5,000 U.S. stores to mark the launch of the new product. By late-afternoon, about 100 people had formed a line outside Toys R Us in New York's Times Square, where Microsoft is holding a splashy launch and is giving away free games to early customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, more than 30,000 U.S. stores will sell Kinect, including branches of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp, Best Buy Co Inc, GameStop Corp and online at Amazon.com. It goes on sale on November 10 in Europe and November 18 in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AIMING FOR NON-GAMERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which unveiled the system under the project name 'Natal' last year, is selling Kinect for $150 or as part of a package including a 4 gigabyte Xbox for $300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device itself is a roughly foot-long, thin black box with three camera sensors, which plugs into the back of the Xbox. It comes with one set of games called 'Kinect Adventures', scenarios where players navigate courses on fast-flowing rivers, underwater and in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be 16 other games available for the holidays, Microsoft said, including sports, dancing and fitness-themed titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sophisticated shooting games like Microsoft's Halo series are not expected to be available on the Kinect, as the company is aiming to spread the appeal of hands-free gaming to a wide audience rather than attract existing hardcore gamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Microsoft is hoping the new technology will help extend the role of its Xbox, which has sold 45 million units in the decade since launch, and introduce a concept that is expected to feature in forms of electronics and computers in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Microsoft hits 5 million Kinect sales, it would generate at least $750 million in new revenue, and likely spur more Xbox sales. Analysts expect the company to report $19.1 billion in revenue for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, up slightly from $19 billion in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell about 1.1 percent to $27.08 on Nasdaq late Wednesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle and Liana Baker in New York; Editing by Gunna Dickson and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

strategic decision to focus on larger markets with greater
growth potential, is expected to close in early 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Takes Various Rating Actions on JP Morgan 2005-LDP2
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded 16 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp. 2005-LDP2 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the expected losses on loans currently in special 
      servicing, Fitch expects classes L through NR to be fully depleted. As 
      of the October 2010 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been paid down by 13.8% to $2.57 billion from $2.98 billion 
      at issuance. Nine loans (1.7%) are currently defeased. As of October 
      2010, cumulative interest shortfalls affect classes L through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has designated 64 loans (21.2%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which 
      includes 25 specially serviced loans (10.9%). The largest specially 
      serviced loan (1.8%) is secured by a 363,333 square foot (sf) anchored 
      shopping center located in Memphis, TN. The loan transferred to special 
      servicing in January 2010 due to monetary default. The loan is 90+ days 
      delinquent and the special servicer is proceeding with foreclosure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest specially serviced loan (1.2%) is secured by a 293,276 
      sf anchored retail property located in Temecula, CA. The loan was 
      transferred in June 2010 due to maturity default. The special servicer 
      is in discussions with the borrower for a possible extension of the loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest specially serviced loan (1.1%) is secured by a 
      408-unit multifamily property located in Cordova, TN. The loan 
      transferred to special servicing in July 2010 for monetary default. The 
      loan is 90+ days delinquent and the special servicer is proceeding with 
      foreclosure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch stressed the value of the non-defeased loans by applying a 5% 
      haircut to 2009 fiscal year-end net operating income (NOI) and applying 
      an adjusted market cap rate between 7.25% and 10% to determine value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage commercial 
      mortgage backed securities (CMBS), each loan also underwent a refinance 
      test by applying an 8% interest rate and 30-year amortization schedule 
      based on the stressed cash flow. Loans that could refinance to a DSCR of 
      1.25 times (x) or higher were considered to pay off at maturity. Of the 
      non-defeased or non-specially serviced loans, 76 loans (48.6% of the 
      overall pool) were assumed not to be able to refinance, of which Fitch 
      modeled losses for 15 loans (15.4%) in instances where Fitch's derived 
      value was less than the outstanding balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has downgraded the following classes and revised Rating Outlooks, 
      Loss Severity (LS) ratings and Recovery Ratings (RR) as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.2 million class L to 'C/RR6' from 'B-/LS5';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$14.9 million class M to 'C/RR6' from 'B-/LS5';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.2 million class N to 'C/RR6' from 'B-/LS5';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7.4 million class O to 'C/RR6' from 'B-/LS5';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7.4 million class P to 'C/RR6' from 'B-/LS5 ';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.2 million class Q to 'C/RR6' from 'CCC/RR1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed and revised the LS ratings of the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$542.1 million class A-1A at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$250 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS5'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$367.4 million class A-3 at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$122.7 million class A-3A at 'AAA/LS5'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$561.3 million class A-4 at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$123.4 million class A-SB at 'AAA/LS5'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$247.9 million class A-M at 'AAA/LS3'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$50 million class A-MFL at 'AAA/LS5'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirmed the following class:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$29.8 million class F at 'BB/LS5'; Outlook Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The $12 million class NR is not rated by Fitch. Class A-1 has paid in 
      full. Fitch has withdrawn the ratings on the interest-only classes X-1 
      and X-2. (For additional information on the withdrawal of the rating on

economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, the company forecast 3 million Kinect sales,
but the head of Microsoft's entertainment unit Don Mattrick
raised the projection to 5 million in an interview with Reuters
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Presales have exceeded expectations," said Mattrick.
"People are coming to us and saying this is must-have holiday
item."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High demand for the Kinect may lead to shortages, Mattrick
warned, which could crimp sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're anticipating that some of our partners will be sold
out at points of time this holiday, and that's something we'll
do our best to work through," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There will be midnight events at 5,000 U.S. stores to mark
the launch of the new product. By late-afternoon, about 100
people had formed a line outside Toys R Us in New York's Times
Square, where Microsoft is holding a splashy launch and is
giving away free games to early customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, more than 30,000 U.S. stores will sell Kinect,
including branches of Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), Target Corp
(TGT.N), Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N), GameStop Corp (GME.N) and
online at Amazon.com (AMZN.O). It goes on sale on Nov. 10 in
Europe and Nov. 18 in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIMING FOR NON-GAMERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which unveiled the system under the project name
'Natal' last year, is selling Kinect for $150 or as part of a
package including a 4 gigabyte Xbox for $300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The device itself is a roughly foot-long, thin black box
with three camera sensors, which plugs into the back of the
Xbox. It comes with one set of games called 'Kinect
Adventures', scenarios where players navigate courses on
fast-flowing rivers, underwater and in space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There will be 16 other games available for the holidays,
Microsoft said, including sports, dancing and fitness-themed
titles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sophisticated shooting games like Microsoft's Halo series
are not expected to be available on the Kinect, as the company
is aiming to spread the appeal of hands-free gaming to a wide
audience rather than attract existing hardcore gamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, Microsoft is hoping the new technology will
help extend the role of its Xbox, which has sold 45 million
units in the decade since launch, and introduce a concept that
is expected to feature in forms of electronics and computers in
the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Microsoft hits 5 million Kinect sales, it would generate
at least $750 million in new revenue, and likely spur more Xbox
sales. Analysts expect the company to report $19.1 billion in
revenue for the current quarter, according to Thomson Reuters
I/B/E/S, up slightly from $19 billion in the year-ago quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares fell about 1.1 percent to $27.08 on Nasdaq
late Wednesday afternoon.

 (Changes sourcing, adds comments from memo)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 3 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
Vice Chairman Steve Black is stepping down from the
second-largest U.S. bank, according to an internal memo sent by
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black, who co-headed JPMorgan's investment banking unit for
five years until a management shake-up there last year, plans
to leave early next year, the memo obtained by Reuters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He is one of the finest and most capable executives I have
ever met," Dimon wrote in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black does not have any definite plans, but he told the
Wall Street Journal he may consider private equity or hedge
fund jobs, the newspaper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon and Black have known each other for 30 years, since
they worked at Smith Barney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Black now follows his former co-head of investment banking,
Bill Winters, in leaving the firm. Winters left after last
year's management changes, when Dimon named Jes Staley head of
JPMorgan's investment banking unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Winters and Black helped lead the firm through the
financial crisis, when complex debt securities linked to
subprime mortgages caused huge losses for rivals. They also
played a large role in JPMorgan's acquisition of Bear Stearns
in March 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon named Black vice chairman in January. At the time, he
agreed to stay with the bank for at least three years,
according to a memo written then by Dimon. [ID: nN28246158]

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, Nov 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
GreenGainers.com, a premier source for micro cap research, provides
wide-ranging due diligence and insight on stocks all over the market.
GreenGainers Investment Stock Reports primary focus is to alert our
valued subscribers to small cap and micro cap companies poised for
explosive movement in the market. Timing in the market is critical! To

    GreenGainer Alerts Investors to the following Stocks: Citigroup
Inc.Copyright, Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM), Bank of America (BAC),
General Electric Company (GE), Caterpillar Inc. (CAT), The Boeing Company
(BA), Ford Motor (F), Motorola Inc. (MOT), Intel Corporation (INTC) and
Wednesday mid-day premiere stock on our watch list: dPollution
International Inc. (PINKSHEETS: RMGX).

    The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting higher prices for oil in the
second half of 2011 and 2012 as the global inventory surplus is
exhausted, this could mean renewed interest in alternative energy and
technologies which make more efficient use of fossil fuels possible and
financially attractive. One such company is dPollution International Inc.

    dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and distribution
rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology that reduces polluting
emissions and increases mileage. dPollution 's innovative products
improve engine performance by causing fuel to combust more efficiently
and completely. The technology works on all closed-combustion engines,
including those used in cars, trucks, buses, trains and heavy equipment.

    According to latest polls voters in California intend to cast a "No" vote
on Proposition 23, in effect keeping the state on track with the current
law which is incrementally phasing in tougher emission standards. The
state aims to achieve 1990 GHG emission levels by January 1, 2020.

    2010 Midterm Elections Impact On Green Technology 

    A major subtext of today's elections is the urgent need for financial
discipline. Candidates who have pledged to reign in government spending
are projected to be swept into Congress in record numbers. With the
National Unemployment Rate hovering around 10%, the voting public appears
to be in no mood for continued government waste.

    The public's seismic shift in attitude will strongly influence a new
trend that is already taking shape, clean technology that pays for
itself. The public is not against cleaning up the environment, but it
will no longer tolerate the government taxman reaching into its pocket to
make it happen. dPollution, a company on our watch list, is a major trail
blazer in this area. Their product lowers emissions and your gas bill at
the same time. To find out more about this cutting edge company please
visit our website: http://greengainers.com.

    2010 Midterm Election Update

    Voters have given Republicans control of the House of Representatives in
a clear rejection of the Democrats' out of control spending practices,
and the Republican leadership has already indicated that rolling back
spending levels will be at the top of the post-election agenda.

    Bucking recent national trends, California's voters soundly rejected
Proposition 23 sending a clear message that they want a clean energy
future. California with the eighth largest economy in the world, will now
continue implementing the most stringent emission standards in the nation.

gaming market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company previously forecast 3 million Kinect sales, but
a Microsoft executive raised the projection to 5 million in an
interview with Bloomberg on Wednesday. The company later
confirmed the new figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There will be midnight events at 5,000 U.S. stores to mark
the launch of the new product, which Microsoft hopes will
reinvigorate the $20 billion U.S. video game market, which has
been hit hard by the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, 30,000 U.S. stores will sell Kinect, including
branches of Wal-Mart (WMT.N), Target (TGT.N), Best Buy (BBY.N)
and GameStop (GME.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; editing by Gunna Dickson)

			Energy Stocks Lead Market Higher
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RELATED TICKERS: Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM), 
      Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) 
      and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This morning the major stock market indexes are all trading sharply 
      higher. The move higher is broad based and comes as the U.S. Dollar 
      Index drops sharply. The one sector that is leading the markets higher 
      is the energy sector. Energy stocks accounts for about 20.0 percent of 
      the SP 500 Index, therefore, when this sector rallies the index will 
      often trade higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon Mobil Corp. (NYSE: XOM) 
      is trading higher again by 0.58 cents to $67.50. This stock has been 
      rallying since late August with the rest of the stock market. Exxon 
      Mobil Corp. is the leading energy stock due to it's massive market 
      capitalization. The stock continues to be very strong on the charts 
      trading above the daily 20, 50, and 200 moving averages. Please remember 
      Exxon Mobil Corp. and most other energy stocks will benefit from a weak 
      U.S. Dollar Index. The next important resistance level for Exxon Mobil 
      Corp. will be around the $70.00 level.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) 
      and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) 
      are also trading higher this morning by nearly 1.0 percent. These stocks 
      are the next most important stocks in the energy sector. However, the 
      daily charts on these stocks are not as strong as the Exxon Mobil chart. 
      Therefore, these stocks could decline sharply should the U.S. Dollar 
      Index start to catch a bid and put an end to this stock market rally.

			Here are highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Energizer Runs Low in 4Q
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Energizer Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ENR)
			reported fourth quarter 2010 non-GAAP earnings of 81 cents per 
      share, well below the Zacks Consensus of 95 cents, based on weak revenue 
      growth in the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Including charges and one-time items, earnings came in at $1.20 per 
      share in the quarter, well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 
      cents and up 126.4% year over year from 53 cents in the prior year 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energizer reported earnings per share of $5.60 for the fiscal 2010, on a 
      non-GAAP basis. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $5.72 per share, up 21.2% 
      y/y from $4.72 reported in the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gross margin was 46.6%, compared with 43.9% in the year-ago quarter, and 
      was favorably impacted by 40 basis points due to currency impact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although spending on advertising and promotion (AP) increased 27.2% 
      year over year (14.2% of total third quarter 2010 revenue versus 11.0% 
      in the year-ago period), profits improved due to lower product costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management did not provide any earnings forecast for the first quarter 
      of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, Energizer expects raw material and commodity costs in the range 
      of $20 million to $30 million, having an unfavorable impact on fiscal 
      2011 results as compared with fiscal 2010, primarily due to higher zinc 
      and steel costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energizer expects a favorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations 
      in the range of $20.0 million to $30.0 million for the fiscal 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energizer plans to spend approximately 11.5% to 12.0% of net sales on 
      advertising  promotion for fiscal 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite a weak fourth quarter, we continue to expect strong top-line 
      growth for Energizer going forward. Moreover, we believe that the 
      company will benefit from its restructuring initiatives, product 
      innovations and strong balance sheet in the near term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, intense competition from Panasonic Corp. (NYSE: PC) 
      and Procter  Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG), 
      inventory destocking and weak consumer environment are potential 
      negatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energizer is currently a Zacks #2 Rank stock (short-term Outperform 
      rating) and has an Outperform rating over the long term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Impressive 3Q for Stratasys
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Stratasys Inc. (Nasdaq: SSYS) 
      reported third quarter 2010 earnings per share of 15 cents, 3 cents 
      above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 12 cents per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Revenue
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stratasys reported third quarter 2010 revenue of $30.3 million, up 24.0% 
      from $24.3 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Growth in revenue 
      is attributable to an improvement in business conditions within the 
      company&#8217;s core market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumable and system unit sales were also encouraging, increasing 34% 
      and 39%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter. The 3D printer revenue 
      also increased by a staggering 88%, driven by robust sales of Hewlett 
      Packard Company&#8217;s (HPQ) Designjet lines of products that use Stratasys 
      components.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Segment-wise, revenues from Products came in at $23.9 million, up 
      32.8% from $18.0 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Services revenue 
      during the quarter was $6.29 million, up 0.1% from $6.28 million 
      reported in the year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;

      Stratasys did not provide any revenue or earnings guidance for the 
      fourth quarter of 2010. The company witnessed an improvement in market 
      conditions during the third quarter and remains optimistic about the 
      upcoming quarters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Conclusion
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the improving macroeconomic conditions, the company&#8217;s new 
      collaboration with technology major Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ)
			and the improving information technology spending will help the 
      company grow. However, we are a bit apprehensive about the company&#8217;s 
      high cost business model and stiff competition from big and small 
      players.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company has a Zacks #4 Rank (short-term Hold rating).

			Here are highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Marathon Profits Shoot, Stocks Drops
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) 
      &#8211; the fifth largest refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the 
      U.S. &#8211; reported a jump in its third-quarter 2010 profits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As has been the case with the larger rivals that have already reported, 
      such as ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), 
      ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) 
      and Royal Dutch Shell PLC (NYSE: RDS.A), 
      results were boosted by higher fuel prices. Much-improved downstream 
      margins also contributed towards Marathon&#8217;s strong results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earnings per share, excluding special items, came in at $1.00, 
      comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94 cents and 
      significantly ahead of the year-ago period adjusted profit of 61 cents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Quarterly revenue of $18.6 billion was up 28.3% from the year-earlier 
      level, and was 2.3% above our projection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Marathon estimates FOURTH quarter 2010 EP production available for sale 
      in the range of 410,000 &#8211; 425,000 BOE/d, excluding the effect of any 
      future acquisitions or disposals. Full year guidance is 390,000 BOE/d, 
      at the lower end of its previous guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Recommendation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite the robust third quarter results and the strong outlook, 
      Marathon shares currently retain a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into 
      a short-term Hold rating. We are also maintaining our long-term Neutral 
      recommendation on the stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We like Marathon&#8217;s large and geographically-diverse reserve base and 
      strong inventory of development projects (that provide visible 
      production growth over the coming years).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, the uncertain commodity-price environment and the heavy 
      downstream exposure will continue to weigh on Marathon&#8217;s revenue and 
      profitability, at least in the near term. As such, we see the stock 
      performing in line with the broader market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Corning Posts Weak Q3, As Expected
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Corning Inc&#8217;s (NYSE: GLW) 
      third quarter 2010 results were disappointing, with earnings missing the 
      Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents (4.0%) and revenue missing by 1.5%. 
      However, shares were down a mere 0.22%, since investors were already on 
      their guard, following press reports about the inventory correction in 
      the LCD TV market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Revenue
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corning reported revenue of $1.60 billion, which was down 6.4% 
      sequentially and 8.3% year over year. On September 14, Corning mentioned 
      that glass volumes for the quarter would be down 5% due to lower 
      utilization rates at Taiwanese and Japanese manufacturers. However, 
      volumes were even lower.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the fourth quarter, Corning expects display glass volumes to be flat 
      to down slightly for both the wholly owned and SCP businesses (in line 
      with the market). Glass prices are expected to decline, similar to the 
      second quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Telecom segment sales are expected to be down 10% sequentially from the 
      seasonally strong third quarter. Environmental Technologies is expected 
      to come in flat sequentially, Specialty Materials up 10%&#8722;20% (driven by 
      Gorilla Glass) and Life Sciences up 5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corning has lowered 2010 capex expectations from $1.2 billion to $1 
      billion. Capex expectations for 2011 remain at approximately $2 billion. 
      Funds will be used to build a Gorilla Glass manufacturing facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Corning&#8217;s third quarter results were disappointing, with both revenue 
      and EPS missing our estimates. We were of course not too surprised, 
      since the inventory correction was known to all and the magnitude alone 
      accounted for the variation from estimates. Corning stated that typical 
      fourth quarter demand would help burn off some inventory and hasten the 
      return to growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Considering the fact that Korean manufacturers are already increasing 
      utilization, this could be a slight positive. However, we don&#8217;t really 
      expect much improvement until after the first quarter of 2011. Telecom 
      will also take a turn for the worse. However, both Environment 
      Technologies and Specialty Materials (Gorilla Glass) are expected to 
      remain strong.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Given the mixed outlook, we believe the movement in share prices will be 
      limited. The stock, therefore, carries a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates 
      into a short-term "Hold" recommendation (1&#8722;3 months). Our longer-term 
      (3&#8722;6 months) rating remains "Neutral".

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The four largest U.S. banks face potential losses of $26 billion over the next several years from their exposure to private-label mortgages and potential losses from delinquency, analysts at Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private-label mortgages are those offered by private institutions, as against those by government-backed agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage said $28 billion of market cap was lost between -- Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Citigroup (C.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) -- as the market attempted to price in the potential impact of losses on private label securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage cut its price target on Bank of America, PNC Financial (PNC.N), and Wells Fargo and said that it favors JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Citigroup in the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its price target on U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), citing improved third-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the plus side, it said large banks have improved their credit portfolio and built capital ahead of Basel III implementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rachel Chitra in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

			Here are highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Misses on Top-Line
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) 
      reported third quarter earnings of 54 cents per share, 3 cents above the 
      Zacks Consensus Estimate, and 6% above the year-ago earnings of 51 
      cents. Performance was boosted by the Wyeth acquisition, which was 
      partially offset by increased expenses and lower revenues from legacy 
      Pfizer products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenues were up 39%, mainly due to the Wyeth acquisition, which added 
      $5.2 billion or 44% to the total. While foreign exchange negatively 
      impacted revenues by $160 million or 1%, legacy Pfizer products 
      negatively impacted revenues by $458 million or 4%. Third quarter 
      revenues came in at $16.2 billion, short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
      of $16.6 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      International revenues increased 33% to $9.1 billion, reflecting 35% 
      operational growth and a 2% unfavorable foreign exchange impact. 
      Meanwhile, US revenues increased 48% to $7.1 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the Wyeth acquisition, Pfizer operates through two segments: 
      Biopharmaceutical and Diversified. The Biopharmaceutical segment posted 
      third quarter revenues of $13.9 billion, up 31%. Wyeth products 
      contributed $3.9 billion to segment revenues with performance being 
      boosted by drugs like Premarin, Enbrel, and Prevnar. Foreign exchange 
      negatively impacted Biopharmaceutical segment revenues by 2% ($173 
      million).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, several Pfizer legacy products like Camptosar and Norvasc 
      continued to struggle during the quarter, mainly due to the presence of 
      generic competition. Moreover, Lipitor lost exclusivity in Canada and 
      Spain earlier this year and impacted legacy Pfizer&#8217;s performance by 4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Diversified segment posted third quarter revenues of $2.2 billion, 
      up 155%. Products like Centrum, Advil, and Caltrate and other Nutrition 
      products helped boost revenues. Foreign exchange fluctuations did not 
      have a material impact on Diversified revenues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Guides In-Line with Expectations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although Pfizer increased its 2010 earnings guidance, the revised 
      guidance was in-line with expectations. Pfizer now expects earnings in 
      the range of $2.17 - $2.22 on revenues of $67 - $68 billion. The company 
      was previously expecting earnings in the range of $2.10 - $2.20 on 
      revenues of $67 - $69 billion. The 2010 Zacks Consensus earnings 
      estimate currently stands at $2.22, towards the higher end of the 
      guidance range provided by the company. The Zacks Consensus revenue 
      estimate is currently $67.7 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer also maintained its long-term guidance for 2012. The company 
      expects to earn $2.25 - $2.35 per share in 2012 on revenues in the range 
      of $65.2 - $67.7 billion. Pfizer said that it remains on track to 
      achieve its goal of realizing synergies of about $4 - $5 billion from 
      the Wyeth acquisition by the end of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Neutral on Pfizer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Pfizer, which is supported 
      by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating). Near-term earnings growth 
      will come in the form of cost-cutting and share repurchases. While Wyeth 
      brings with it an attractive biologics platform and some complementary 
      products and businesses, we do not believe they are enough to sustain 
      long-term top-line growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We remain Neutral on Pfizer based on our reservations that Wyeth will 
      provide the opportunity to grow revenue for the long-term and the 
      substantially lower revenue growth due to key product patent expiration 
      from 2011 onwards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MasterCard Outshines; Profits Up
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MasterCard Inc.&#8217;s (NYSE: MA) 
      third quarter operating earnings per share of $3.94 came in dramatically 
      ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.54 and $3.45 in the year-ago 
      quarter. Net income for the reported quarter was $518 million, up 14.6% 
      from $452 million in the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results improved over the prior-year quarter due primarily to better 
      pricing, an increased number of processed transactions and reduced 
      operating expenses, which drove the operating margin higher. However, 
      increase in rebates and incentives and the flattish growth in number of 
      processed transactions were on the downside for MasterCard.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenue increased 4.7% year over year to $1.43 billion, above the 
      Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.41 billion. On a constant currency basis, 
      net revenue increased 7.3% over the prior-year period. The increase was 
      primarily due to a 7% favorable pricing changes, a 0.6% growth in the 
      number of processed transactions to 5.8 billion and a 15.4% increase in 
      cross-border volumes. Gross dollar volume increased 8.5% to $685 billion 
      during the reported quarter. As of September 30, 2010, MasterCard issued 
      1.6 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total operating expenses decreased 4.1% year over year to $662 million. 
      Currency fluctuation contributed 1.5 percentage points to the increase 
      in the expenses. The overall decrease was primarily attributable to a 
      6.7% decrease in general and administrative expenses. While advertising 
      and marketing expenses increased 4.7%, depreciation and amortization 
      expenses remained flat. The operating margin for the reported quarter 
      came in at 53.6%, up from 49.4% in the year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MasterCard's effective tax rate for the reported quarter was 32.3%, 
      marginally down from 32.9% in the year-ago period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of September 30, 2010, MasterCard&#8217;s net operating cash flow was $1.03

      September 30, 2010, cash and cash equivalents increased to $2.48 
      billion, long term debt reduced to $1 million, retained earnings 
      increased to $2.52 billion, while total equity was higher at $4.84

			Business Update
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the reported quarter, MasterCard enhanced its global debit 
      portfolio with new agreements that include Sovereign Bank, Chevy Chase &#8722; 
      now part of Capital One (NYSE: COF) 
      &#8722; and Delta Air Lines (NYSE: DAL) 
      in the U.S., Barclaycard in Germany and Qatar Islamic Bank. The company 
      also signed a memorandum of understanding with China Union Pay and got 
      into an agreement with Singtel, one of the larger mobile operators in 
      Asia, thereby expanding its presence in emerging growth markets and 
      channels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, on October 22, MasterCard completed the acquisition of DataCash 
      Group plc for about $526 million, expanding its e-Commerce merchant 
      gateway presence in Asia and Australia to European countries and other 
      global high-growth emerging markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MasterCard&#8217;s results have outshone its prime competitor, Visa Inc. 
      (NYSE: V), which 
      reported its fiscal fourth quarter earnings of 95 cents on October 27, 
      2010. This came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate but came in 
      substantially ahead of 74 cents reported in the year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MasterCard benefits from strong secular demand growth, meaningful 
      international exposure, high barriers, excellent pricing power, 
      risk-free balance sheet and impressive operating leverage. Also, the 
      above-average earnings growth, strong competitive position and leverage 
      to an eventual economic recovery will result in a relative valuation 
      premium.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, we are concerned about MasterCard&#8217;s resilience and ability to 
      raise prices, the detrimental effects of the Consumer Protection Act in 
      the U.S., and scope for increasing cash flow. Hence, the cautious 
      outlook over the near term justifies our Neutral recommendation.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9c824d/kiosks_and_interac) 
      has announced the addition of the "Kiosks 
      and Interactive Technology 2010" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Extensively updated in July 2010 to reflect the global economic 
      recession, this flagship report is the most comprehensive ever produced 
      on the kiosk industry. Based upon an extraordinary response to Summit 
      Research Associates's online survey and follow-on research, it provides 
      the industry installed base and revenue projections from the present 
      time through 2011. The 800+ page report includes 53 charts and tables, 
      examines the leading industry trends and discusses recent significant 
      projects. The report highlights the world regions offering the greatest 
      opportunities and provides additional insights into the future of this 
      fast-growing industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report includes detailed information on nearly 700 companies engaged 
      in the kiosk industry - providing specific contact information, primary

			CSC Wins Task Order to Provide Visa Support Services in Mexico for 
      U.S. Department of State
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CSC (NYSE: CSC) announced today that the U.S. Department of State Bureau 
      of Consular Affairs awarded the company a task order to provide 
      non-immigrant visa support services in Mexico. The task order, which was 
      awarded during CSC&#8217;s fiscal 2011 second quarter, has a two-year base 
      period and four one-year options, bringing the estimated total value to 
      $115 million. It was awarded under the Global Support Strategy (GSS) for 
      Overseas Consular Services indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity 
      (IDIQ) contract that CSC won in March 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the task order, CSC will provide non-immigrant visa 
      support services, including information, appointment, fee collection, 
      document delivery, greeter and offsite biometric collection in Mexico. 
      Non-immigrant visas are for international travelers (citizens of other 
      countries) coming to the U.S. temporarily; immigrant visas are for those 
      seeking to move permanently to the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This contract award is a testament to our efficient, innovative and 
      cost effective global visa services during the last decade,&#8221; said Aaron 
      Fuller, president of CSC&#8217;s North American Public Sector Enforcement, 
      Security  Intelligence Group. &#8220;We are pleased to continue supporting 
      the State Department&#8217;s goal to improve existing operations of current 
      visa applications services around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the GSS IDIQ, CSC will continue to compete for task orders around 
      the world to provide a range of visa-related support services for U.S. 
      embassies and consulates abroad.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      the global leader in Application Delivery Networking (ADN), today 
      introduced the F5&#174; 
      Application Ready Solution for Microsoft Lync Server 2010, which 
      ensures high availability and reliability for Lync Server 2010 services 
      so that customers can optimize their unified communications (UC) 
      environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to certify BIG-IP&#174; 
      Local Traffic Manager&#8482; for deployment with Lync Server 
      2010,&#8221; said Ashima Singhal, group product manager, Microsoft Lync. &#8220;F5&#8217;s 
      unique and continued investment in the Microsoft Corp. UC platform 
      demonstrates the company&#8217;s excellent understanding of how to ensure that 
      sophisticated application software is highly responsive and highly 
      available. Customers who invest in both the Microsoft and F5 platforms 
      benefit from an enterprise class solution to reliably deliver 
      communications features to end users that are easily manageable by IT.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As companies rely more heavily on UC to enrich employee interactions, 
      enhance communication, and lower costs, and as they consider deploying 
      voice over IP (VOIP) solutions, the reliability of their UC 
      infrastructure is more critical than ever. The F5 Application Ready 
      Solution provides a tailor-made environment to work with Lync Server 
      2010, ensuring high availability and resilience for real-time 
      communications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Key Benefits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The F5 Application Ready Solution for Lync Server 2010 offers customers 
      a tightly integrated, tested, and documented solution that provides the 
      following benefits:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Improves Availability &#8211; F5&#8217;s intelligent load 
        balancing, combined with SSL 
        offloading, TCP optimizations, and simple scalability, improve 
        performance to ensure a better user experience. UC client applications 
        are more responsive when supported by BIG-IP solutions because the 
        application health monitoring, intelligent load balancing, and 
        session-to-site level network optimization ensure the most reliable 
        delivery of Microsoft Lync services.
      
			
				Increases Administrator Efficiency &#8211; F5&#8217;s application 
        templates, Microsoft policies, and step-by-step configuration guidance 
        help reduce deployment cycles by one third.
      
			
				Eases Management &#8211; A single control point in the data center 
        enables enterprises to extend existing management and monitoring 
        systems by using Windows PowerShell or the F5 
        Management Pack&#174; for Microsoft System Center Operations 
        Manager and Virtual Machine Manager to control BIG-IP devices.

      &#8220;This release builds on the success of our Application Ready Solution 
      for Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 to offer enhanced 
      reliability and availability for customers who deploy Lync Server 2010,&#8221; 
      said Calvin Rowland, VP of Application Partner Programs at F5 Networks. 
      &#8220;F5 technology enables enterprise customers to deploy a highly 
      available, scalable deployment of Lync Server 2010. We look forward to 
      implementing the solution when Lync Server 2010 is released, and to 
      helping customers realize the highest return from their UC 
      infrastructures.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Unified Communications has the power to increase worker productivity 
      and lower the overall cost of corporate communications,&#8221; said Zeus 
      Kerravala, Distinguished Research Fellow at Yankee Group.&#160;&#8220;However, if 
      the performance of a customer&#8217;s UC solution is erratic, it will not 
      deliver the expected ROI. The F5 Application Ready Solution can deliver 
      the five-nines reliability that is required of corporate communication 
      systems.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      F5 has completed validation testing and has qualified for its 
      Application Delivery Controller (ADC) deployment for Lync Server 2010. 
      F5 will be exhibiting at the DevConnections 
      and Microsoft TechEd 
      Europe conferences in November.

&lt;p&gt; * Ministry says firms have applied for licences&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says drilling in 2008 did not yield positive results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds ministry comment, background, local paper)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRANKFURT, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Germany's most populous state,
North-Rhine Westphalia, home to mining and utilities, has
awarded exploration licences to ExxonMobil (XOM.N) and nine
other firms to search for unconventional gas, a newspaper said
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state's economy minister, Harry Voigtsberger, in a reply
to a Green Party query in the state parliament confirmed that
 huge areas might be explored by the companies, centering on the
north Muensterland region, said the Westdeutsche Allgemeine
Zeitung (WAZ).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report said some of the other companies were from
Australia and Canada, and that ExxonMobil was preparing to start
drilling in Borken, Steinfurt and Nordwalde in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An economics ministry spokeswoman in Duesseldorf said that
companies had secured licences for exploratory drilling of coal
bed methane, without naming the companies. It was unclear
whether and when drilling would take place, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The applications had been made to the Arnsberg district
government, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exploration technology, particularly for commodities such as
shale gas, has improved dramatically in recent years, making the
hunt for new resources cheaper and more promising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Germany has said it would like to reduce reliance on Russia,
which supplies more than 40 percent of its gas. Russia has been
involved in political and transit disputes with countries along
pipeline routes, such as Ukraine, several times in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ministry spokeswoman added that there were geological
formations in the state that could hold potential, but drilling
in 2008 by the Aachen technical university had not brought
positive results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local newspaper Borkener Zeitung in its online edition said
there were some local population concerns over whether new
drilling technologies for gas could take away water resources
needed for agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Vera Eckert and Matthias Inverardi; Editing by

 (Adds detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZURICH, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG's
(NOVN.VX) lung drug Onbrez reduced breathlessness more
effectively than Pfizer's (PFE.N) Spiriva in patients with a
deadly lung disease, a late-stage trial found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novartis also said on Wednesday the trial found chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients on Onbrez used
rescue medication less compared with those taking Spiriva, known
generically as tiotropium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said Onbrez was as effective as Spiriva in improving
lung function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news, which underscored the strength of Novartis's
pipeline, came after a recent raft of upbeat data, including
U.S. approval for multiple sclerosis drug Gilenya. This has
boosted sentiment in Novartis and the group now trades at a
premium to cross-town rival Roche (ROG.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COPD is a progressive, life-threatening respiratory disease
commonly caused by cigarette smoke and other harmful fumes and
particles, resulting in inflammation and narrowing of airways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It affects 210 million people worldwide and is projected to
be the third leading cause of death by 2020, Novartis said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Onbrez Breezhaler won European Union approval in COPD last
year, boosting Novartis's ambitions in respiratory medicine, a
field currently dominated by AstraZeneca (AZN.L),
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L)  and Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Until recently, Novartis was not on the radar as a major
force in lung drugs which are typically difficult to make
because of the inhaler devices needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The field is now becoming increasingly important to Novartis
as it develops new drugs and cheap generic versions of older
products such as Glaxo's Advair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novartis recently hit a setback, however, when its
experimental once-daily inhaled product QMF149, being developed
for asthma and COPD hit a delay. [ID:nLDE69K1SZ]

&lt;p&gt;  MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM, Nov 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Disney World Florida has announced the schedule for Mickey's Very Merry
Christmas Party, a special event held annually each winter at Florida's
Magic Kingdom theme park. Promising spectacular fireworks, live
entertainment and an enchanting holiday parade, Mickey's Very Merry
Christmas Party offers families an entirely different way to go about
Christmas this year.

    Although much of Britain enjoyed substantial snowfall towards the end of
last year, Christmas in the UK often proves to be a damp and dismal
affair. Usually too mild to produce significant amounts of snow and
almost always too cold to entertain any meaningful sunshine, the UK
climate is notoriously unforgiving over the festive period. As an
enduring recession adds extra bite to this year's winter, many UK
families might consider a timely departure from domestic tradition by
travelling abroad to warmer climes. Following a recent announcement by
Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, it would seem that festive
holidaymakers have every reason to head off to the Sunshine State this
Christmas.

    Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party will take place on 8 days in November
and 11 days in December. November 2010 dates include: Monday 8th,
Thursday 11th, Friday 12th, Tuesday 16th, Thursday 18th, Friday 19th,
Sunday 28th and Tuesday 30th. December 2010 dates include: Thursday 2nd,
Friday 3rd, Sunday 5th, Tuesday 7th, Thursday 9th, Friday 10th, Sunday
12th, Tuesday 14th, Thursday 16th, Friday 17th and Sunday 19th. Disney
World holidays are rarely as much fun as when Mickey is throwing a party
and, this Christmas, no less than 19 opportunities will be available for
families to experience the joys of a Disney Christmas adventure.

    As with most Disney World Florida holidays, Mickey's Very Merry Christmas
Party is expected to provide parents and children with a truly wonderful
experience. Numerous activities and special events have been planned for
this year's party, including the magical Castle Dream Lights on
Cinderella Castle. A 'surprise' guest appearance by Santa Claus at
Mickey's Once Upon a Christmastime Parade also promises to delight those
who have made the journey to Florida this year. 

    A spokesperson for Florida4Less, one of the UK's leading package holiday
operators, has suggested that Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party offers
the perfect end to a difficult year. The spokesperson commented: "The
economic situation in the UK prompted many people to abandon their summer
holidays abroad this year. Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party should
provide the perfect end-of-year tonic to families in need of a fun and
memorable Christmas getaway."

    Other activities and special events that are expected to feature at
Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party this year include: an exclusive
holiday fireworks display, live entertainment provided by everybody's
favourite Disney characters, complimentary cookies and hot cocoa and a
captivating snowfall on Main Street, USA. As with conventional Disney
World holidays, this year's festivities include meet-and-greet
opportunities with various Disney characters - perhaps even Mickey Mouse
himself. Tickets for Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party are now
available online. The purchase of an additional event admission ticket is
required in order to enjoy the full range of activities available at this
year's party.

12th, Tuesday 14th, Thursday 16th, Friday 17th and Sunday 19th. Disney
World holidays are rarely as much fun as when Mickey is throwing a party
and, this Christmas, no less than 19 opportunities will be available for
families to experience the joys of a Disney Christmas adventure.

    As with most Disney World Florida holidays, Mickey's Very Merry Christmas
Party is expected to provide parents and children with a truly wonderful
experience. Numerous activities and special events have been planned for
this year's party, including the magical Castle Dream Lights on
Cinderella Castle. A 'surprise' guest appearance by Santa Claus at
Mickey's Once Upon a Christmastime Parade also promises to delight those
who have made the journey to Florida this year. 

    A spokesperson for Florida4Less, one of the UK's leading package holiday
operators, has suggested that Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party offers
the perfect end to a difficult year. The spokesperson commented: "The
economic situation in the UK prompted many people to abandon their summer
holidays abroad this year. Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party should
provide the perfect end-of-year tonic to families in need of a fun and
memorable Christmas getaway."

    Other activities and special events that are expected to feature at
Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party this year include: an exclusive
holiday fireworks display, live entertainment provided by everybody's
favourite Disney characters, complimentary cookies and hot cocoa and a
captivating snowfall on Main Street, USA. As with conventional Disney
World holidays, this year's festivities include meet-and-greet
opportunities with various Disney characters - perhaps even Mickey Mouse
himself. Tickets for Mickey's Very Merry Christmas Party are now
available online. The purchase of an additional event admission ticket is
required in order to enjoy the full range of activities available at this
year's party.

&lt;p&gt; * Disney signs agreement with Shanghai firm over Disneyland&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Disney still awaiting final central govt approval for JVs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shanghai park expected to cost 25 billion yuan -Xinhua
 (Adds details, statement from Disney)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Melanie Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI, Nov 5 (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has
signed an agreement with a Shanghai company for the establishment
of a Disneyland theme park in the city, bringing its long-planned
park in mainland China closer to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal was reached with Shanghai Shendi Group, which was
specifically created for the development of the Disneyland
project, the official Xinhua news agency said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney confirmed the Xinhua statement and said it was still
awaiting final approval from China's central government regarding
the incorporation of the related joint venture companies and the
completion of regulatory procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For quite some time, we have been involved in discussions
with the Shanghai government about building a Disney theme park.
We can confirm the statement from the Shanghai government that we
have taken another step forward in the approval process," a
Disney spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shanghai's Disneyland is expected to cover around 4 sq km and
cost about 25 billion yuan ($3.75 billion), Xinhua said. Disney
itself gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not clear what the ownership structure of the park
would be like, but state media reported last year that an
investment company controlled by the Shanghai municipal
government would own a majority stake in the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney received approval to build a Disney theme park in
Shanghai a year ago, but discussions about the specifics have
been ongoing and few details have been released publicly.
[ID:nN03523281]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has long sought to build in Shanghai, a wealthy city
of about 20 million people that is ringed by the prosperous
Yangtze River Delta, home to tens of millions more potential
visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was less enthusiastic about building near Beijing, which
has fewer large population centres in the immediate vicinity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's foray into the China market has been mixed so far,
with its Hong Kong Disneyland park reporting a loss last year.

second-largest U.S. oil company, expects its 2010 contribution
to employee pension plans to be $600 million higher than it had
previously planned, due to a doubling of the U.S. contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had expected to pay $900 million into pension plans
this year, including $600 million for its U.S. plans and the
rest for international, but it estimated in a regulatory filing
on Friday that the U.S. plans would now get $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment
returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory
environments and other economic factors," the company said,
adding that more funding may be needed if investment returns
are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2009, the company had contributed $1.7 billion to its
pension plans, including a U.S. portion of $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman was not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disclosure comes amid a broader trend of investors
suffering from reduced returns on fixed-income investments due
to rock-bottom U.S. interest rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had said that at the end of 2009 it chose a 5.3
percent discount rate for its U.S. pension plan, which
accounted for 61 percent of its total pension obligation. That
was down from the 6.3 percent rate for the previous two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it also said a 1 percent increase in the 2009 U.S. rate
would have cut total pension plan expense for the year by about
$150 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also assumed a long-term rate of return of 7.8
percent on its U.S. pension plan assets at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A week ago, Chevron reported third-quarter net income of
$3.77 billion, down slightly from a year ago. [ID:nN29136104]

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in BP (BP.L) gained on Friday, with traders citing talk that Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) was considering a bid for the oil company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 10:29 a.m. EDT, BP shares were up 1.1 percent at 450 pence, having hit an intraday high of 451.35 pence on the rumor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP declined to comment and a spokesman for Exxon said in an email that it was "not our practice to comment on market speculation, rumors or media reports."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ruppert Pretterklieber, Joanne Frearson, Simon Jessop, Anna Driver and Simon Falush)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walt Disney has signed an agreement with a Shanghai company for the establishment of a Disneyland theme park in the city, bringing its long-planned park in mainland China closer to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal was reached with Shanghai Shendi Group, which was specifically created for the development of the Disneyland project, the official Xinhua news agency said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney confirmed the Xinhua report and said it was awaiting final approval from China's central government regarding the incorporation of the related joint venture companies and the completion of regulatory procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For quite some time, we have been involved in discussions with the Shanghai government about building a Disney theme park. We can confirm the statement from the Shanghai government that we have taken another step forward in the approval process," a Disney spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's foray into the China market has been mixed so far. Its Hong Kong Disneyland park, which opened to great fanfare, reported a loss last year and has at times struggled to attract as many visitors as hoped. Disney runs two other parks outside of the United States, in Paris and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has long sought to build in Shanghai, a wealthy city of about 20 million people that is ringed by the prosperous Yangtze River Delta, home to tens of millions more potential visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai's Disneyland is expected to cover about 4 square kilometers and cost about 25 billion yuan ($3.75 billion), Xinhua said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's 1.4 billion residents, and its growing middle class and powerful economy, have made it a compelling investment spot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Parks and Resorts division, which has roots stretching back to the early 1950s, accounts for roughly one-quarter of the company's sales. But the division has faced headwinds in recent quarters as the economic downturn has hurt attendance and hotel occupancy, particularly at its U.S. resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sally Huang in Beijing and Paul Thomasch in New York; Editing by Jason Subler)&lt;/p&gt;

    The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is forecasting higher prices for oil in the
second half of 2011 and 2012 as the global inventory surplus is
exhausted, this could mean renewed interest in alternative energy and
technologies which make more efficient use of fossil fuels possible and
financially attractive. One such company is dPollution International Inc.

    dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and distribution
rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology that reduces polluting

    2010 Midterm Elections Impact On Green Technology 

    A major subtext of today's elections is the urgent need for financial
discipline. Candidates who have pledged to reign in government spending
are projected to be swept into Congress in record numbers. With the
National Unemployment Rate hovering around 10%, the voting public appears
to be in no mood for continued government waste.

    The public's seismic shift in attitude will strongly influence a new
trend that is already taking shape, clean technology that pays for
itself. The public is not against cleaning up the environment, but it
will no longer tolerate the government taxman reaching into its pocket to
make it happen. dPollution, a company on our watch list, is a major trail
blazer in this area. Their product lowers emissions and your gas bill at
the same time. To find out more about this cutting edge company please
visit our website: http://greengainers.com.

    2010 Midterm Election Update

    Voters have given Republicans control of the House of Representatives in
a clear rejection of the Democrats' out of control spending practices,
and the Republican leadership has already indicated that rolling back
spending levels will be at the top of the post-election agenda.

    Bucking recent national trends, California's voters soundly rejected
Proposition 23 sending a clear message that they want a clean energy
future. California with the eighth largest economy in the world, will now
continue implementing the most stringent emission standards in the nation.

    2010 Midterm Election Wrap-up

    A tidal wave which swept the country yesterday signaled a clear rejection
of the Government's heavy handed and intrusive approach to managing the
economy. The message to Washington was clear: Return to Free Market
solutions, your micro-management is stifling economic growth. In fact it
could be argued that the government's heavily subsidized clean technology
projects have been a massive failure. These enterprises have so far not
produced any cost-effective solutions which work in the real world The
alternative is clear, allow people to be creative and let the market
decide the level of demand for their products and services. A perfect
example of this approach is a company called dPollution International
inc., which holds a patent on a revolutionary device which simultaneously
lowers emissions from internal combustion engines and makes them more
efficient thereby lowering fuel consumption costs. For further details

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has signed an agreement with a Shanghai company for the establishment of a Disneyland theme park in the city, bringing its long-planned park in mainland China closer to fruition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal was reached with Shanghai Shendi Group, which was specifically created for the development of the Disneyland project, the official Xinhua news agency said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney confirmed the Xinhua report and said it was awaiting final approval from China's central government regarding the incorporation of the related joint venture companies and the completion of regulatory procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For quite some time, we have been involved in discussions with the Shanghai government about building a Disney theme park. We can confirm the statement from the Shanghai government that we have taken another step forward in the approval process," a Disney spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shanghai's Disneyland is expected to cover about 4 square kilometers (1.5 square miles) and cost about 25 billion yuan ($3.75 billion), Xinhua said. Following the announcement, speculation about possible construction contracts helped lift shares of several building companies, including Shanghai Pudong Road and Bridge Construction Co (600170.SS), which rose 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not clear what the ownership structure of the park would be like, but state media reported last year that an investment company controlled by the Shanghai municipal government would own a majority stake in the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney itself gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's foray into the China market has been mixed so far. Its Hong Kong Disneyland park, which opened to great fanfare, reported a loss last year and has at times struggled to attract as many visitors as hoped. Disney runs two other parks outside the United States, in Paris and Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has long sought to build in Shanghai, a wealthy city of about 20 million people that is ringed by the prosperous Yangtze River Delta, home to tens of millions more potential visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Disney and other media companies, China's 1.4 billion residents, and its growing middle class and powerful economy, have made it a compelling investment spot. But it also has proven to be a difficult place to conduct business, with the government hesitant to allow too much foreign influence in the highly sensitive sectors of media and popular culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has caused a number of setbacks. In August, for instance, News Corp (NWSA.O) announced plans to sell control of its Chinese TV channels [ID:nTOE678080]. Google Inc (GOOG.O) earlier this year faced off against Beijing in a dispute over Web censorship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Disney, building the park in Shanghai caps years of on-and-off talks with Chinese authorities. A deal was finally outlined a year ago, before the News Corp and Google fallout, and was seen as a springboard for Disney to market and promote the rest of the entertainment business, from merchandise to film and television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's Parks and Resorts division, which has roots stretching back to the early 1950s, accounts for roughly one-quarter of the company's sales. But the division has faced headwinds in recent quarters as the economic downturn has hurt attendance and hotel occupancy, particularly at its U.S. resorts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney were up 15 cents at $37.18 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sally Huang in Beijing and Paul Thomasch in New York; Editing by Jason Subler and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

			Research and Markets: US Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Report: 50 
      Largest Companies Such as Pfizer and JJ Account for 80% of the $200 in 
      Combined Annual Revenue
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/e89128/pharmaceuticals_ma) 
      has announced the addition of the "Pharmaceuticals 
      Manufacture" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US pharmaceuticals manufacture industry includes about 1,500 
      companies with combined annual revenue of about $200 billion. Major 
      companies include Abbott, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Johnson  
      Johnson, and Pfizer. The industry is highly concentrated: the 50 largest 
      companies account for more than 80 percent of revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand for pharmaceutical manufacture is driven by the desire to cure 
      illness and disease. The profitability of individual companies depends 
      on their ability to discover and market new drugs. Large companies 
      benefit from their economies of scale in research, manufacturing, and 
      marketing. Small companies can compete effectively by specializing in 
      drugs that target one or two specific ailments. The industry is 
      capital-intensive: average annual revenue per worker is about $750,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The pharmaceutical manufacture industry is marked by rapid advances in 
      scientific knowledge that produce ever-more effective medicines. The 
      traditional drug manufacturing industry increasingly overlaps with the 
      biotechnology industry, which is a source of many new medical 
      treatments. To a large extent, traditional drug manufacturers are 
      becoming development and marketing companies that acquire new drugs from 
      smaller research companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drugs are chemicals with beneficial biological activity. Modern drug 
      development is an outgrowth of recent research into the specific causes 
      of illness and disease, coupled with advances in chemistry and 
      industrial technology that allow scientists to manufacture chemicals to 
      improve these conditions.

arthritis, a joint disease treated by injected drugs with $12 billion in
annual sales. Clearwire Corp., a wireless data network company mostly
owned by Sprint Nextel Corp., said Thursday that its third-quarter net
loss widened as rising expenses overshadowed subscriber growth. The
company also said it will lay off 15 percent of its employees in a move
to reduce costs due to a funding shortage.

			Africare Announces Key Partnerships with 
      ExxonMobil to Battle Malaria in Africa
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Announcement Made in Connection with Africare&#8217;s 40th Anniversary Gala
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Africare President Darius Mans announced today new investments from 
      ExxonMobil to extend their partnership in its fight against malaria. 
      ExxonMobil, which has long been a supporter of Africare, will fund three 
      key malaria prevention and intervention programs in Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;ExxonMobil has been an invaluable partner to bettering the lives of 
      those living in Africa,&#8221; said Africare President Darius Mans. &#8220;The 
      company's contributions &#8211; including not just funds, but their efforts to 
      provide on-the-ground support, lend business expertise and increase the 
      world&#8217;s awareness of the scourge of malaria &#8211; have saved countless lives 
      on the continent.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new grants, which total $1,425,000, will enable thousands of 
      additional children and families in Africa to receive the necessary care 
      for managing malaria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The new pilot Malaria Prevention Promotion in Nigeria will reach more 
        than 75,000 local contractors and suppliers and their families in the 
        Delta region of the country with a package of malaria prevention, 
        treatment and vector control services. The program also includes a 
        media campaign to educate thousands more people in the same area about 
        malaria prevention.
      
			
        Through a network of more than 2,000 community volunteers working with 
        the Caconda Community-Based Malaria Intervention program, 
        approximately 35,000 families in Angola will receive training and 
        assistance to manage malaria in their homes, including educational 
        materials, bed nets and access to medical treatment.
      
			
        An additional 600 volunteers &#8211; to a total of 2,640 &#8211; will be selected 
        and trained to reach families with health education through the Angola 
        Community Malaria Program. Volunteers are expected to reach 550,000 
        children under the age of five and women of child-bearing age via 
        51,000 house visits, health talks, plays and drama shows, and visits 
        to traditional healers and community leaders.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Africare is one of our long standing partners in the fight against 
      malaria. As one of the largest private foreign investors in Africa, we 
      know first-hand the health and economic impacts that malaria can have on 
      the workforce, their families and the communities where they operate,&#8221; 
      said Rex Tillerson, ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO. &#8220;We want to ensure that 
      families have access to the proper prevention and care, especially in 
      the most vulnerable communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In recognition of the company&#8217;s leadership and long-standing commitment 
      to combat malaria, Africare is presenting ExxonMobil with its inaugural 
      Corporate Service Award. Tillerson is accepting this award at Africare&#8217;s 
      annual Bishop John T. Walker Memorial Dinner in Washington, D.C. later 
      today. Africare is also awarding its Distinguished Humanitarian Service 
      Award to Dr. Ngozi N. Okonjo-Iweala, Managing Director of the World 
      Bank, for her contributions to improving the financial stability of 
      Africa&#8217;s economies, especially Nigeria. This year&#8217;s event will also 
      celebrate Africare&#8217;s 40th anniversary and honor Nelson Mandela for his 
      lifetime of service in South Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Africare
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Africare is a leading non-profit organization specializing in African 
      development assistance to improve the quality of life in Africa. It is 
      also the oldest and largest African-American led organization in that 
      field. Since its founding in 1970, Africare has delivered over $1 
      billion in assistance and support &#8212; over 2,500 projects and millions of 
      beneficiaries &#8212; to 36 countries Africa-wide. Africare has its 
      international headquarters in Washington, D.C., with field offices 
      currently in some 20 African countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ExxonMobil and Malaria
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) and ExxonMobil Foundation engage in a 
      range of philanthropic activities that advance education, health and 
      science in the communities where ExxonMobil has significant operations. 
      Globally, ExxonMobil provides funding to improve basic education and 
      combat malaria and other infectious diseases in developing countries. 
      ExxonMobil is the largest non-pharmaceutical corporate donor to malaria 
      research and development efforts and since 2000 has committed $193 
      million to Africa community outreach programs, including almost $70 
      million on programs to fight malaria. The company established its 
      Malaria Initiative in 2000 in support of the Abuja Declaration on Roll 
      Back Malaria in Africa and national malaria plans in countries where we 
      operate. Since then, ExxonMobil has developed on-the-ground 
      public-private partnerships to fight malaria at the community level, 
      progress treatment and vaccine research and raise awareness and 
      international support, and contributes to anti-malaria efforts in more 
      than 20 African countries.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Exxon no-comment, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 5 (Reuters) - Shares in BP (BP.L) gained on
Friday, with traders citing talk that Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) was
considering a bid for the oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1429 GMT, BP shares were up 1.1 percent at 450 pence,
having hit an intraday high of 451.35 pence on the rumour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP declined to comment and a spokesman for Exxon said in an
email that it was "not our practice to comment on market
speculation, rumors or media reports".

			Is Zacks Really Any Good?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      November 5, 2010 - RELATED TICKERS: Immunomedics (Nasdaq: IMMU), 
      Coca-Cola Amatil (OTC: CCLAY), 
      Wyndham Worldwide (NYSE: WYN), 
      Krispy Kreme (NYSE: KKD) 
      and TPC Group (Nasdaq: TPCG).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      I dabble in stock picking here and there, as part of an overall balanced 
      and hedged investment portfolio, and I decided to track the zacks rank, 
      buying into a stock when its listed as a #1, and selling as soon as it 
      is off the #1 rank. I subtracted out my trading costs, which are 4$ a 
      trade, and looked at the pretax return of my portfolio on a daily basis. 
      This is a very small subset of the data, but these are the results, 
      using a $2000 investment for each position. These are some of the 
      positions I closed from 10/28-11/4.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Immunomedics (Nasdaq: IMMU) 
      .62%/day
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Amatil (OTC: CCLAY) 
      .19%/day
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wyndham Worldwide (NYSE: WYN) 
      -.11%/day
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Krispy Kreme (NYSE: KKD) 
      .47%/day
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			TPC Group (Nasdaq: TPCG) 
      .098%/day
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Keep in mind this was just moving in and out of positions as Zacks made 
      the recommendations, and bigger gains may have been captured had I used 
      some of my own intuition, but when all the math is said and done the 
      portfolio return is 1.795%/day. Over 260 trading days this would work 
      out to a simple return of 466.7% over a year. I guess these guys know 
      what they are doing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Keep in mind, also this is not the only tactic needed for a good 
      investment portfolio, and that these gains were all during a great bull 
      market over the past couple months, and I was not going short any 
      positions.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      I just thought some people might find this interesting, happy trading :)

&lt;p&gt;  WATERLOO, ONTARIO, Nov 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Research In Motion (RIM) (NASDAQ: RIMM)(TSX: RIM) announced today
BlackBerry(R) Enterprise Server Express for IBM Lotus Domino - free
server software that wirelessly synchronizes email, calendar, contacts,
notes and tasks between BlackBerry(R) smartphones and IBM Lotus Domino
without compromising security. The software is available today at
www.blackberry.com/besexpress. 

    BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express uses the same robust security
architecture of the market-leading, premium BlackBerry(R) Enterprise
Server, and includes more than 75 of the over 500 smartphone controls and
IT security policies available with the premium version of BlackBerry
Enterprise Server software. It supports BlackBerry smartphones on
business data plans as well as most personal data plans(i). 

    "BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express is a free download that is designed
for businesses of all sizes. It provides an easy way for businesses to
get started using BlackBerry smartphones with IBM Lotus Domino and it's
also an ideal no-cost software solution for businesses that want to allow
their employees to connect their personal BlackBerry smartphones to their
work email," said Jeff McDowell, Senior Vice President, Enterprise and
Platform Marketing at Research In Motion. 

    "There's tremendous growth in work force mobility, from small businesses
through to major corporations, and there is clear evidence that shows how
smartphones can increase organizational responsiveness, improve
productivity and help employees make the most of their time," said Ed
Brill, Director, Messaging and Collaboration, IBM Software Group.
"BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express is a great opportunity for
businesses to cost-effectively extend Lotus Domino to more employees on
BlackBerry smartphones."

    With BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express connected to IBM Lotus Domino,
BlackBerry smartphone users will be able to:


--  Wirelessly synchronize email, calendar, contacts, notes and tasks 
--  Manage email folders and search email on the mail server from their
    smartphones 
--  Book meetings and appointments, accept meeting requests, check
    availability and forward calendar attachments 
--  Set an out-of-office reply 
--  Access files stored on the company network 
--  Use mobile applications to access business systems behind the firewall 


    For IT administrators, BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express includes:


--  A Web-based interface that allows remote administration and makes it
    easy to deploy applications over the air, connect and manage BlackBerry
    smartphones, and apply usage policies 
--  Over 75 IT controls and policies, including the ability to remotely wipe
    a smartphone and enforce and reset passwords 
--  Employee self-service tools for securing a lost or stolen device 


    BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express works with Domino Enterprise
Server and Domino Messaging Server. It can support multiple Lotus Domino
domain environments from a single Web-based administration interface and
can be run in parallel with the premium BlackBerry Enterprise Server
software for the same instance of IBM Lotus Domino.

    The premium version of BlackBerry Enterprise Server for IBM Lotus Domino
provides more extensive mobile device management capabilities, over 500
smartphone controls and IT security policies for more granular control,
and is required for add-on solutions such as BlackBerry(R) Mobile Voice
System, Chalk(TM) Pushcast(TM) Software, the BlackBerry(R) Clients for
IBM Lotus Sametime, Lotus Connections, and Lotus Quickr, and other
enterprise-grade systems. The premium BlackBerry Enterprise Server is
ideal for managing company-issued BlackBerry smartphones, whereas the
free BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express is an ideal option for securely
connecting employee-owned BlackBerry smartphones to the corporate network
without adding software licensing costs to the company.

    BlackBerry Enterprise Server Express for Lotus Domino is available today
in seven languages, including English, French, Italian, German, Spanish,
Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese.

    More information is available at www.blackberry.com/besexpress. 

    (i) Supports BlackBerry smartphones on business data plans as well as
personal data plans that include Internet access.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to add "of his" to headline to make plain Ballmer
selling 12 percent of his stake in company)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * CEO Ballmer sells $1.3 bln in Microsoft shares&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says sale for financial diversification and tax planning&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says will sell more shares by year end&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Still second-largest holder behind Bill Gates
 (Adds details on Ballmer, Gates' share holding)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, Nov 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer sold $1.3 billion worth of shares in
the company, cutting his stake by about 12 percent, but said
his first stock sale in seven years should not be taken as a
lack of confidence in the world's largest software firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said he will sell more shares by the end of the
year, in a move to diversify his investments and plan for
taxes, but the company sought to allay talk that the 54-year
old executive, who has been CEO since 2000, may be preparing an
exit from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even though this is a personal financial matter, I want to
be clear about this to avoid any confusion," Ballmer said in a
statement on the company's Website. "I am excited about our new
products and the potential for our technology to change
people's lives, and I remain fully committed to Microsoft and
its success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer, who was the first business manager at Microsoft
when he joined in 1980, has not shown any interest in stepping
down or leaving the company, despite some criticism from Wall
Street over the company's lagging shares, which are trading at
the same level as 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on Friday, Ballmer sold 49.3 million Microsoft
shares in the last three days, at prices just above and below
$27 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said he plans to sell up to 75 million shares by
the end of this year. If he does sell that many shares, that
would mean a 18 percent cut in Ballmer's stake, based on the
408 million shares he held before the sales in the last few
days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of Friday, Ballmer still holds about 359 million
Microsoft shares, or 4.2 percent of the company, worth about
$9.6 billion. That makes him the second largest shareholder
behind Chairman and co-founder Bill Gates, according to Thomson
Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gates, who holds about 621 million shares, or about 7.2
percent of the company, regularly sells shares in batches of 1
million or 2 million to fund his philanthropic foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were unchanged in after-hours trading on
Friday, after closing down 1 percent at $26.85 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Nov 7 Reuters) - A closely watched experimental drug for rheumatoid arthritis being developed by Pfizer Inc significantly reduced symptoms and improved physical function, according to data from a late-stage clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drug, tasocitinib, met two of three primary goals of the 611-patient Phase III study at two tested doses, compared with a placebo, the data show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the third primary goal, tasocitinib demonstrated a numerically higher measure of disease remission at three months than placebo, but that measure did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasocitinib belongs to a new class of oral drugs, known as JAK inhibitors, that impacts the signaling of proteins involved in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. It is a hot area of research with several other drugmakers pursuing similar medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the first oral medication for rheumatoid arthritis that has had a successful Phase III study this century," Dr Roy Fleischmann, the study's primary investigator, said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When it works, it really works," said Fleischmann, who will present the results at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in Atlanta this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasocitinib is considered one of the most promising drugs in Pfizer's developmental pipeline. It has garnered multibillion-dollar peak sales projections from analysts, which is not uncommon for a successful rheumatoid arthritis drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the study's first primary goal, 65.7 percent of patients who received 10 milligrams of tasocitinib twice a day achieved ACR20, meaning at least a 20 percent improvement in disease activity and symptoms, after three months of treatment. Nearly 60 percent of 5 mg patients reached ACR20, compared with 26.7 percent of those who received a placebo, researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study also measured much tougher to hit ACR70 rates, or at least a 70 percent improvement. At 10 mg 20.3 percent of patients achieved ACR70, while 15.4 percent hit that mark with the 5 mg dose. That compared with 5.8 percent on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second primary goal was a patient-reported gauge of improvement in physical functions, such as ability to fasten buttons. On that measure, the Pfizer drug more than doubled what would be considered to be a minimal clinically important improvement, Fleischmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a 0-to-3 scale in which 0 to 0.5 is considered normal function, patients began the trial with an average score of 1.5, which represents moderate-to-severe function limitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placebo led to a drop of just 0.19. Patients who received 10 mg of the JAK inhibitor experienced a drop of 0.57, while patients taking 5 mg improved by 0.5, or half a point on the scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's a major difference that's very meaningful to a patient. A patient can really tell the difference," Fleischmann said of the response to tasocitinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is a painful, chronic autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system attacks healthy tissue, causing inflammation in and around the joints. The condition affects 1.3 million people in the United States and about 1 percent of adults worldwide, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is commonly treated with injected biotech drugs, such as Humira from Abbott Laboratories, which is expected to have sales in excess of $6 billion this year, or Amgen Inc's Enbrel, which is on track for 2010 sales of more than $3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleischmann said patients being helped by the biologics are always asking for a version in pill form, making the JAK inhibitor a very attractive option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an oral pill taken every day, rather than an injection. It seems to work similar to biologics and it's certainly more convenient for patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All patients in the Pfizer-sponsored study had active moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis following an inadequate response to prior treatment with at least one other drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serious adverse events were reported in 25 tasocitinib patients, or 4.1 percent, with six cases of serious infection reported over the six months of the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we have not seen so far is the tuberculosis, or the opportunistic infections that we've seen with the biologics," Fleischmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less serious adverse events were reported in more than half of tasocitinib patients over the first three months of the trial. They included decreases in white blood cells and increases in bad LDL cholesterol, compared with placebo. There was also an increase seen in good HDL cholesterol as well as an increase in red blood cell count and in liver enzymes in some patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has a safety profile that is very reasonable because the benefit is so good and the risk relatively small," Fleischmann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; editing by Gunna Dickson and Diane Craft)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * $20.6 mln record award related to Bayou collapse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Federal judge upholds arbitration award&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman declines to comment
 (Adds background, details, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 8 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday
rejected Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) bid to throw out a
record $20.6 million arbitration award involving the
now-defunct Bayou hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan granted a
request by unsecured creditors of Bayou Group LLC to confirm
the award, which was made in June by an arbitration panel of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creditors had accused a Goldman unit that cleared trades
for Bayou of ignoring signs of fraud at the Connecticut hedge
fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bayou was run by Samuel Israel, who is serving a 20-year
prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2005 to defrauding
investors out of roughly $450 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's significant," said Ross Intelisano, a partner at Rich
 Intelisano LLP, representing the creditors. "It confirms the
largest arbitration award ever rendered against Goldman, and
provides a significant recovery for investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Ed Canaday declined to comment. It was
not immediately clear whether Goldman plans an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rakoff said he will issue a opinion to explain his reasons
for upholding the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the award stands, it could increase the requirements
that Wall Street banks set before clearing trades for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In court papers, Goldman called the legal foundation for
the arbitration award "demonstrably wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said the law is "crystal clear" that it cannot be
liable for money that Bayou deposited into and shuffled among
accounts at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP v.
Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee of Bayou Group LLC,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No.

			AFP Annual Conference&#8212;Despite all the value that hedging 
      provides, there is still a broad-based misperception on how hedges are 
      supposed to perform, says Reval (www.reval.com), 
      the leading corporate financial risk management solutions provider, 
      which will be presenting &#8220;Best Practices in Risk Management,&#8221; with 
      industry leaders Visa and Ford on Tuesday, November 9 from 8:30 am to 
      9:30 am CST at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center. Corporate 
      treasurers will learn best practice approaches to risk management from 
      exposure capture through performance measurement and hear what their 
      peers say they do&#8212;or don&#8217;t do&#8212;to benchmark hedge performance, when Reval 
      reveals the results of its 2010 Risk Benchmarking Survey.

      Fitch Takes Various Rating Actions on TOBs Issued by Goldman Sachs  Co.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the course of routine surveillance, Fitch Ratings has taken 
      various rating actions on tender-option bonds (TOBs) issued by Goldman 
      Sachs  Co.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term rating assigned to the bonds is based on the higher of the 
      rating assigned by Fitch to the applicable credit enhancer providing 
      support to the bonds and the rating assigned by Fitch to the underlying 
      bond deposited in the trust. The short-term rating assigned to the bonds 
      is based on the rating assigned by Fitch to the bank providing liquidity 
      to the bonds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A spreadsheet detailing the rating actions in question is available on 
      the Fitch Ratings website at 'www.fitchratings.com'

&lt;p&gt; * $20.6 mln record award related to Bayou collapse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Federal judge upholds arbitration award&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 8 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday
rejected Goldman Sachs Group Inc's (GS.N) bid to throw out a
record $20.6 million arbitration award involving the
now-defunct Bayou hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff granted a request by
unsecured creditors of Bayou Group LLC to confirm the award,
according to a one-page order, a copy of which Reuters
obtained. The order has yet to appear on the electronic court
docket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creditors had accused Goldman of failing to investigate
alleged fraud and fraudulent transfers at Bayou, which
unraveled in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's significant," said Ross Intelisano, a lawyer
representing the creditors. "It confirms the largest
arbitration award ever rendered against Goldman, and provides a
significant recovery for investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP v.
Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee of Bayou Group LLC,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kris Jenner, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price Healthcare Sciences Fund, thinks Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Merck  Co (MRK.N) could see their shares jump as much as 20 percent over the next 18 months if they can show progress in their experimental drug pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have historically been underweight in big pharma, but I am wary of getting complacent and thinking just because they have underperformed for so long that they will continue to do so," he said at the Reuters Health Summit in New York on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a very good opportunity over the next three to four years for these companies to demonstrate to the marketplace that the allocation of resources to research and development is not a wasteful bet," Jenner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The proof of the pudding lies in the next 18 months with Pfizer," he said, referring to strong data from clinical trials of experimental drugs. "They are starting from a base of public skepticism. Their very low valuations today reflect that view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenner said shares of big drugmakers trade at a large discount to the Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX, in contrast to a 50 percent or 60 percent premium to that benchmark a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, the failure of drugmakers to launch new products has soured investors on their prospects so badly that some stocks are priced with the expectation no new drugs will be approved, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRICED FOR NO GOOD NEWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer are trading at 7.8 times expected per share earnings in 2011, while Merck is trading at a multiple of 10.6. Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N), a diversified healthcare company that is less reliant on prescription drugs, is the costliest U.S. drugmaker, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 13.6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices have fallen so low, Jenner said, that companies may rebound sharply once their medicines are approved, or are shown to do well in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they just become less discounted, and a 9 (multiple) becomes a 10 or an 11, and they're still at a discount to the SP 500, you're talking about a 20 percent return."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Pfizer and Merck shares could rise by that magnitude, Jenner said, "I certainly think so," and added they have potential to get there within 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenner said one of Merck's most promising drugs is anacetrapib, a medicine designed to raise levels of "good" HDL cholesterol, although it will likely take years to complete needed studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenner's fund is focused more heavily than some of his competitors on high-growth, smaller biotech companies, but he tries to mitigate risk through diversification. The fund has outperformed nearly 80 percent of his peers over the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I view our portfolio like an armada, or flotilla of ships," he said. "It is an art form to have enough ballast in your portfolio that you can outperform in good and bad market conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing trend for big pharmaceuticals companies to buy biotechs will likely continue, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a scarcity value to companies that have a biologics capability," he said. "Over time we will see more and more acquisitions of companies that have biologics capacity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That could well include big biotech companies such as Biogen Idec Inc (BIIB.O) and small companies such as Human Genome Sciences Inc HGSI.O. He thinks Sanofi-Aventis SA (SASY.PA) will be successful in buying Genzyme Corp GENZ.O though at a much higher price than the $18.5 billion, or $69 a share, in its current hostile offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not meaningful Genzyme shareholders, but it seems anything between $75 to $80 a share certainly seems quite reasonable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Debra Sherman, Toni Clarke and Ransdell Pierson.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Veterans Day Observance in 11th Year
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      They have performed across the country, served the United States in the 
      D-Day invasion of Normandy in World War II and just returned from the 
      front lines of Afghanistan. They are the 82nd Airborne 
      Division &#8220;All-American&#8221; Chorus, and they will be at Coca-Cola 
      Headquarters in Atlanta this week to honor service members for Veterans 
      Day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To mark the 11th year of Coca-Cola&#8217;s Veterans Day observance, 
      the Company will host a ceremony to pay tribute to the men and women of 
      the U.S. Armed Services, including more than 900 veterans in the 
      Company, on Wednesday, Nov. 10. Sloan Gibson, President of the United 
      Service Organizations (USO), will provide a keynote address. Gibson is a 
      graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, earned both 
      Airborne and Ranger qualifications and served as an infantry officer in 
      the U.S. Army.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gibson will be joined by Sandy Douglas, President of the North America 
      Group, and Steve Cahillane, President and CEO of Coca-Cola Refreshments, 
      to present the 2010 Presidents&#8217; Veterans Award to Universal Orlando 
      Resort for its support and commitment to veterans and the Armed Forces 
      in 2009-2010. The 82nd Airborne Division &#8220;All-American&#8221; 
      Chorus will also present a moving a cappella performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This event is incredibly inspiring to me as we recognize co-workers who 
      have served or are serving in the military,&#8221; said Douglas. &#8220;The 
      remarkable part about their service is that it continues long after they 
      hang their uniforms in the closet for the last time. On this special 
      day, we also remember the families of those serving, for their 
      sacrifices are often deep and long as they wait patiently for the safe 
      return of their loved ones.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hundreds of Coca-Cola associates will &#8220;stuff&#8221; more than 10,000 care 
      packages for the USO at the Coca-Cola USO Care Package stuffing party on 
      Tuesday, Nov. 9. These packages will be distributed to boost the morale 
      of troops worldwide. The 82nd Airborne Division 
      &#8220;All-American&#8221; Chorus will also entertain during this event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the week-long Veterans Day observance, the Company will also 
      host its Sixth Annual VIP Veterans Day Dinner at Coca-Cola Headquarters 
      on Nov. 9, featuring a ceremony honoring veterans within the Company. 
      Coca-Cola will also participate in the 2010 Georgia Veterans Day Parade 
      and 2010 Freedom Ball on Saturday, Nov. 13 hosted by the Georgia 
      Veterans Day Parade Association.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The World of Coca-Cola has a special offer for members of the Armed 
      Forces and their families now through Nov. 14. Active and retired 
      members of the Armed Forces are always admitted to World of Coca-Cola 
      free, but during this period members may purchase up to four half-price 
      tickets for their friends and family. To take advantage of this special 
      promotion, military members and retirees simply present their valid 
      Armed Forces ID cards at the World of Coca-Cola ticket booth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company has a long-standing history of support for the 
      nation&#8217;s Armed Forces, dating back to 1941 and then-President of the 
      Company Robert W. Woodruff&#8217;s pledge to make Coca-Cola available wherever 
      U.S. troops were stationed around the world, a tradition that still 
      continues today.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - French investment bank Natixis (CNAT.PA)is due to clash with Wall Street heavyweight Goldman Sachs (GS.N) in a British court on Tuesday over a credit derivatives deal which Natixis wants scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dispute centers around whether or not Natixis, which is majority owned by French retail bank BPCE, can cancel a transaction on three credit default swaps with Goldman, which is claiming damages for breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing is due to start on November 9 in London's High Court, coinciding with the publication of Natixis' third quarter results. The size of the claim has not been revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has declined to comment on the row, while Natixis, through its law firm Stephenson Harwood, has said it will defend itself vigorously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The battle comes as several banks find themselves embroiled in lawsuits over who should bear the blame for risky debt instruments that left banks and investors nursing huge losses when the credit crisis broke in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival French bank Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) sued Germany's IKB for more than $1.68 billion in damages in late 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That dispute has since led to an indirect countersuit from IKB clients based in Jersey, which was filed last month. Agricole has said it is confident that IKB's counter-action is without merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup (C.N) is also facing legal action from several mortgage bond investors, while earlier this month Bank of America (BAC.N) won the dismissal of a lawsuit from investors who claimed its Countrywide unit had misled them in a mortgage securities deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's dealings in the subprime mortgage sector came under fierce scrutiny from regulators earlier this year, and in July the American bank agreed to pay $550 million to settle civil fraud charges over how it marketed a subprime mortgage product handled by French banker Fabrice Tourre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month a fund manager who invested in a Goldman subprime mortgage-linked security sued the company for fraud, in another case Goldman is contesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta and Lionel Laurent; editing by Elaine Hardcastle)&lt;/p&gt;

			Virtual Bridges Announces Immediate Virtual Desktop Infrastructure 
      Support for New IBM Cloud Service Provider Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			VERDE Solution Offers Easy, Affordable and Integrated VDI for Service 
      Providers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Virtual Bridges, Inc. today announced its flagship VERDE&#8482; 
      solution now provides virtual desktop management and provisioning 
      capabilities for the IBM Cloud Service Provider Platform. Working 
      together with IBM, VERDE is immediately available as an integrated and 
      enabled workload offering within the new IBM solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to IBM, the market for cloud services is expected to grow to 
      $89 billion by 2015. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), which allows 
      programs, applications, processes and data from remote PCs to be stored 
      and managed from a central location, is ideally suited for cloud 
      services and helping to drive growing demand. VERDE from Virtual Bridges 
      will enable service providers to capitalize 
      on this exploding market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Service providers can use VERDE to accelerate the delivery of 
      cost-effective cloud-based VDI workloads to businesses of all sizes. 
      This combination of IBM, Virtual Bridges and service providers ushers in 
      the next era of VDI, moving beyond the data center and into the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Cloud-based services are quickly emerging as a critical business model 
      for service providers,&#8221; said Lauren States, vice president of Cloud 
      Computing for IBM Software Group. &#8220;The new cloud service management 
      platform can help providers speed the time to market of new services, 
      including virtual desktop management, while helping lower the associated 
      costs and risk.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      VERDE provides a comprehensive, 
      end-to-end desktop virtualization solution combining online, off-line 
      and remote branch VDI solutions. Key advantages include the industry&#8217;s 
      first integrated and disconnected use solution, a single Gold Master 
      provisioning model, Distributed Connection brokering architecture, 
      flexibility to run Windows and Linux desktops, branch-level VDI at LAN 
      speeds, and desktop portability on a USB stick. From a deployment 
      perspective, VERDE&#8217;s flexibility 
      is designed to meet the needs of any customer, offering on-premise, 
      hosted and hybrid deployment modes while reducing total cost of 
      ownership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a great combination for blending the efficiency of IBM&#8217;s cloud 
      provisioning infrastructure with the best-of-breed VDI capabilities of 
      Virtual Bridges,&#8221; said James Kaylor, senior director of Information 
      Systems  Technology at the University of Pennsylvania, a joint customer 
      of IBM and Virtual Bridges. &#8220;The enabled VDI workload from Virtual 
      Bridges was tightly integrated and seamless to deploy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Cloud computing is expanding into many diverse areas but one of the 
      most exciting is the management and provisioning of virtual desktops,&#8221; 
      said Jim 
      Curtin, president and CEO of Virtual Bridges. &#8220;The combination of 
      IBM&#8217;s Cloud Service Provider Platform and VERDE delivers a powerful 
      service provider-ready solution that not only provisions the cloud 
      infrastructure but also the integrated virtual desktop &#8216;workload&#8217; on top 
      of it.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  PRINCETON JUNCTION, NJ, Nov 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Smart Card Alliance Payments Council, formerly the Contactless and
Mobile Payments Council, today announced an expanded council charter to
include all chip-enabled payments and payment applications in the United
States, including EMV, contactless payments, NFC-enabled payments and
applications, mobile payments, and chip-enabled e-commerce. The Council
also announced its new officers and steering committee, including new
co-chairs Simon Hurry from Visa and Oliver Manahan from MasterCard. 

    "With most of the world moving to EMV chip payments and experimenting
with other chip-based applications, the big question within the U.S.
payments industry is, 'How would chip affect the United States?'" said
Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the Smart Card Alliance. "The
Payments Council has worked tirelessly this year examining this very
question, providing extensive educational material on chip-enabled
payments -- including EMV, contactless and mobile payments, and
chip-based solutions that enable innovation and help address counterfeit
fraud."

    With its expanded focus on all chip-enabled payments, the Payments
Council published a number of resources for the payments industry this
year, including new Web resources for information and news on EMV ("EMV
Resources") and Near Field Communications ("NFC Resources"). The Council
also held a webinar on "Top 10 Reasons U.S. Should Consider EMV" and
published the white papers "Chip-Enabled Mobile Marketing," "EMV Chip
Cards Expected for Upscale U.S. Cardholders," "Fraud in the U.S. Payments
Industry," and "End-to-End Encryption and Chip Cards in the U.S. Payments
Industry," all available on the Payments Council Web site. 

    "The Payments Council is a valuable forum at which industry stakeholders
can align and provide direction for the future," said new co-chair Simon
Hurry, senior business leader, Visa Inc. "With momentum building for
mobile payments and other chip-enabled solutions, I am looking forward to
working with the Council to examine how these advancements will affect
the future payments infrastructure."

    "The Smart Card Alliance Payments Council is an organization that brings
together industry players that may have divergent disciplines but are
still focused on commerce," said new co-chair, Oliver Manahan, vice
president, MasterCard Worldwide. "We are in store for an exciting year in
the payments industry, with many contactless transit payment projects in
development, and buzz continuing to grow for mobile payment. It will be
valuable to discuss and debate the economic impacts related to chip-based
payments and applications in other areas, and create resources based on
those findings."

    The Payments Council is made up of over 150 individuals from over 50
organizations, including card issuers, payment brands, merchants,
financial payment processors, terminal vendors, card manufacturers, chip
vendors, systems integrators/consultants, and personalization bureaus.
The new officers are: 


--  Co-chairs: Simon Hurry, Visa and Oliver Manahan, MasterCard
--  Vice chair: Troy Bernard, Discover Financial Services
--  Secretary: Deborah Baxley, Capgemini

    Shares of Ford Motor Company have opened with a marginal loss on Monday
and now down 0.20% to $16.16. However, today the made a new 5-year high
of $16.39 in the first five minutes of trading session. Less than two
weeks after announcing major updates to Windows Azure at the Microsoft
Professional Developers Conference, Microsoft Corp. again showed the
breadth of its vision for cloud computing today when it unveiled Hyper-V
Cloud, a set of programs and offerings that makes it easier for
businesses to build their own private cloud infrastructures using the
Windows Server platform. Sprint Nextel has decided to block both Huawei
and ZTE from securing its multibillion-dollar network modernization
project because of increasing national security concerns about the
Chinese vendors, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. With
the Journal reporting that AOL has hired financial advisers to explore a
possible tie-up with bigger rival Yahoo, Carol Bartz's company is seeing
minimal gains in pre-market trading. Shares recently changed hands at
$16.41, up 14 cents or 0.89%.

America Corp., General Electric Company, Intel Corp., Sirius XM Radio Inc.

    Bank of America says it serves one out of every two households and
therein lies the danger; in a good economy, that's massive earnings
power, but in this economy, that's massive exposure to losses. General
Electric Co. named Vice Chairman John Rice to oversee a new international
business structure as Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt signals the
importance of faster-growing overseas markets for the company. Intel was
upgraded at UBS from Neutral to Buy with a $25 price target as the PC
cycle appears to have bottomed. According to seekingalpha.com, facing no
near term debt concerns, lowered borrowing and interest expenses, reduced
capex and a continued auto recovery, the long term outlook for Sirius XM
has never been better in the history of satellite radio.

			WhereScape Announces Native Support for Microsoft SQL Server 
      Integration Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WhereScape RED Will Leverage SSIS Data Movement Functionality as Part 
      of WhereScape&#8217;s Agile Data Warehouse Development, Management and 
      Processing Environment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WhereScape, the developer of WhereScape RED, an agile Integrated 
      Development Environment (IDE) for managing data warehouses, today 
      announced native support for Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services 
      (SSIS), Microsoft&#8217;s platform for building enterprise-level data 
      integration and data transformations solutions. WhereScape customers can 
      now use SSIS to load data into a data warehouse which is designed and 
      managed by WhereScape RED and leverage SSIS data movement functionality 
      as part of its data warehouse development, management and processing 
      activities. The announcement was made at PASS Summit 2010, the premier 
      conference for SQL Server professionals, where WhereScape is exhibiting 
      in booth #400.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Once data is loaded into a SQL Server data warehouse, WhereScape RED 
      works within SQL Server&#8217;s powerful database engine to transform data and 
      build data warehouse objects within the data warehouse or project mart 
      in a fraction of the time that it typically takes with traditional 
      methods. WhereScape RED will continue to support the native SQL Server 
      load utilities it has used to import data into the database, such as 
      BULK INSERT, linked servers and ODBC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft SQL Server continues to be the most popular database for 
      WhereScape RED, with well over 200 Microsoft customers, including 
      Coinstar, a leading provider of automated retail solutions and IPC, an 
      independent SUBWAY&#174; franchisee-owned and operated purchasing 
      cooperative. These customers enjoy productivity gains, ease of use, and 
      cost benefits of the SQL Server and WhereScape combination.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SQL Server Integration Services excels at loading data from different 
      sources. Once the data is loaded, WhereScape RED builds all the 
      downstream SQL Server objects such as facts, dimensions, and Microsoft 
      Analysis Services cubes in the database 10 times faster than with 
      traditional, hand-coding methods,&#8221; said WhereScape CEO Michael 
      Whitehead. &#8220;SSIS provides WhereScape customers another option to load 
      data that is extremely fast, efficient and flexible. WhereScape 
      developers enjoy full technical and user documentation for change 
      management and data lineage.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fully Integrated with Microsoft SQL Server
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WhereScape RED provides native support for SQL Server as well as IBM 
      DB2, Oracle and Teradata. The same WhereScape agile integrated 
      development environment is used to build SQL Server data warehouses as 
      well as Analysis Services cubes. The benefits are compelling &#8211;

      House (ACH) payments are made. Instead of initiating payments from 
      multiple in-country bank accounts and paying numerous wire fees, clients 
      now can use a single account to perform foreign exchange conversion and 
      execute ACH transactions in 19 currencies. The solution now covers 40 
      countries and will include additional currencies in the near future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan&#8217;s market-leading solution is ideal for businesses with large 
      volumes of non-urgent ACH payments that want to eliminate the 
      administrative and financial complexity of managing and reconciling 
      multiple foreign accounts. For example, one J.P. Morgan client is using 
      the capability to make its payroll payments from one central account, 
      even though its employees are dispersed globally. As a result, the 
      client was able to close numerous in-country bank accounts and cut costs 
      associated with multiple wire fees and managing and reconciling these 
      accounts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;J.P. Morgan continues to invest in its foreign exchange services to 
      help clients cut payment costs while improving operational efficiency on 
      a global scale,&#8221; said Traci Filler, managing director, Foreign Exchange, 
      J.P. Morgan Treasury Services. &#8220;By expanding our cross-border ACH 
      capabilities, J.P. Morgan&#8217;s clients now have more currency and low value 
      payment options. Clients also benefit from lower transaction, foreign 
      exchange and reconciliation costs associated with using a single account 
      rather than maintaining multiple local accounts globally.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan offers a full suite of foreign exchange solutions to meet 
      clients' cross-border payment needs. Whether making a single payment to 
      a vendor in another country or paying employees around the world in 
      multiple currencies, J.P. Morgan has the solutions companies need to 
      efficiently process international payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			DataCore Software Brings Unprecedented Storage Scalability, 
      Performance and High-Availability to Microsoft Clustered File Shares, 
      Hyper-V Failover Cluster CSVs and Metro Clusters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Spotlight on Customer Use Cases, High-Availability NAS and Cluster 
      Best Practices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Microsoft Tech-Ed Europe 2010, DataCore Software, a leading provider 
      of storage virtualization software, is demonstrating major breakthroughs 
      to enhance the availability, scalability and performance of Failover 
      Clustering in Microsoft&#174; Windows Server&#174; 2008 R2 with Hyper-V&#8482;. Several 
      case studies and white papers will illustrate how IT organizations 
      benefit operationally and financially from these joint solutions. 
      DataCore is located in Booth E86.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The two most common use cases for DataCore in Microsoft Failover Cluster 
      scenarios involve virtualizing and mirroring storage resources across 
      physically-separated storage devices for:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Clustered Shared Volumes (CSVs)
      
			
        Clustered File Shares
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The DataCore experts will discuss the technical aspects behind these 
      environments, as well as real-life implementations. Featured among them 
      is the Swiss-based hospital, Regionalspital Emmental (RSE) AG, where 
      DataCore software fully virtualizes the shared storage infrastructure 
      for RSE&#8217;s Exchange, SQL and medical applications. RSE operates 15 
      physical servers and over 50 virtual machines running on top of Hyper-V.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Server virtualization from Microsoft Hyper-V combined with storage 
      virtualization software from DataCore form an integral part of our IT 
      strategy, significantly lowering costs for hardware, energy and 
      administration,&#8221; states Falko Gieldanowski, Head of IT at RSE AG. "We 
      are currently saving around 30% by better optimizing the use of our time 
      and resources and from the resulting increase in productivity &#8211; and we 
      anticipate further savings over the lifetime of our infrastructure."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			What&#8217;s New: Eliminating Storage-related Downtime for Clustered File 
      Shares
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the topics that will be spotlighted during Tech-Ed Europe 2010 
      concerns ways to keep storage from becoming a single-point-of-failure 
      for clustered file shares. Attendees will be introduced to new best 
      practices necessary to meet their high-availability objectives using 
      DataCore software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Non-Stop Data Access: Virtualizing and Speeding-up SANs for CSVs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      US-based Stockbridge Capital Group deploys DataCore storage 
      virtualization software with Microsoft Hyper-V to meet their business 
      continuity needs. Two synchronously-mirrored DataCore nodes keep the 
      storage infrastructure, especially the CSVs, highly available to ensure 
      non-stop data access from a cluster of seven (7) Hyper-V servers hosting 
      over 25 virtual machines. Prior to virtualization, Stockbridge had well 
      over 30 physical servers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;DataCore&#8217;s storage virtualization solution offers all of the high-end 
      features, including enterprise-class high availability, but at an 
      affordable price,&#8221; comments Stephen Pilch, COO, Stockbridge. &#8220;DataCore 
      software lets us easily leverage our investment in existing and new 
      technologies and empower our virtual servers to meet non-stop business 
      needs while fitting our budget. It is a perfect match for us.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The virtualized storage configuration services the needs of 
      Stockbridge&#8217;s Microsoft Exchange server along with the file repositories 
      used by all their employees. &#8220;We were pleasantly surprised that the 
      iSCSI SAN, because of DataCore, actually performed better than the 
      existing fibre SAN, in terms of its speed and accessibility,&#8221; notes Cem 
      Kursunoglu, president at BayNODE. Read the full story here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Large Scale Metro Clusters Rely on Microsoft and DataCore
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Continuum Health Partners ("Continuum") relies on DataCore SANsymphony&#8482; 
      software to virtualize and manage well over 200 Terabytes of storage for 
      the various hospitals in the Continuum hospital network. The 
      DataCore-powered infrastructure supports a community of 14,000 users on 
      over five-hundred (500) servers with storage devices split between 
      different locations in metropolitan New York.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "DataCore storage virtualization software is the key to the 
      virtualization puzzle - offering the flexible storage virtualization 
      dimension needed for any virtualization project - and serving as the 
      perfect complement to server virtualization as well as the perfect 
      enhancement to storage hardware," explains Jill Wojcik, IT Director at 
      Continuum Health Partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ESPOO, FINLAND, Nov 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Nokia business smartphones, maps and apps enhance the enterprise
experience

    Nokia today gave an update on the deployment of Microsoft Exchange
ActiveSync for Nokia smartphones that shows it is gaining substantial
traction among the world's biggest operators and enterprises.

    The solution - which delivers direct, secure access to email and personal
information via organizations' Microsoft Exchange servers - is now
available for Nokia smartphones on more than 550 operator networks
worldwide. These operators include America Movil, Orange, Telecom Italia,
Telefonica, TeliaSonera, T-Mobile and Vodafone. And recently, the
solution has undergone large-scale deployment at leading enterprises such
as JCDecaux and OnMobile, which have been attracted to its dramatically
improved efficiency and significantly lower cost compared to rival
solutions.

    Through joint activities targeted at enterprises, Nokia and operators are
bringing operational efficiencies and substantial savings in total cost of
ownership (TCO) for IT decision makers, when compared to other solutions.

    At JCDecaux, Europe's largest outdoor advertising company, just 14 percent
of its mobile users in the UK had access to mobile email and calendar
functions. The company was looking to extend that functionality to more
of its workforce, in a way that was cheaper than the existing solution
and without issues such as managing additional servers. JCDecaux chose
Nokia's solution, which - in combination with attractive data tariffs
from Vodafone Global Enterprise - led to a reduction in TCO, increased
the company's responsiveness to customers and raised mobile email access
for company mobile users to 100 percent.

    OnMobile, India's largest white label data and value-added services
company for mobile, landline and media service providers, was able to
speed up processes, cut response time and save money by introducing
Nokia's solution. Also, given that part of its workforce was already
using Nokia smartphones, it was easy to set up Mail for Exchange without
extra cost. In addition, monthly mobile data charges were substantially
lower for the Nokia solution, and this encouraged users of a rival
solution to switch. In the six months following the deployment, OnMobile
reported substantial time savings for engineers, a 20 percent increase in
projects completed on time and a 30 percent decrease in travel expenses.

    "IT directors are being pressured to deploy business mobility solutions
such as email, IM and intranet access for more employees, but without the
high costs they have had to spend on additional middleware, licenses and
maintenance," said Ilari Nurmi, the head of marketing for Nokia's
portfolio of Eseries business smartphones.

    The solution enables employees to connect directly to the corporate mail
server with their Nokia smartphone without the need for additional
servers, and is fast becoming the solution of choice for businesses. In
addition to accessing email, employees also enjoy direct access to
corporate instant messaging through Microsoft(R) Communicator Mobile,
which was the first new application to be delivered by the two companies
as part of their strategic alliance announced last year.

    "Nokia is doing more than any other handset company to help businesses go
mobile. Microsoft will design and develop mobile productivity,
communication and collaboration solutions, and we will jointly bring them
to market - giving our smartphones the edge over the competition," Nurmi
continued.

    The Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync solution is supported by a wide range of
Nokia smartphones available with different designs and prices, covering
the entire business user market. In the first half of 2010, more than 12
million Nokia Eseries business smartphones were shipped, representing a
growth of more than 50 percent compared to the first half of 2009.
Nokia's line-up of business smartphones is to be strengthened by the
arrival of the Nokia E7, equipped with a full keyboard and 4-inch
touchscreen featuring Nokia ClearBlack technology for improved outdoor
visibility.

    In addition to access to corporate email and infrastructure, Nokia
smartphone users also enjoy access to maps, navigation, download apps and
access other services through Ovi. The popularity of Business category
apps in the Ovi Store, such as Worldmate, F-Secure Anti-Theft for Mobile,
Boingo and Bloomberg, has significantly increased with some of the top
downloading countries including France, Germany, India, Saudi Arabia, the
UAE and the UK.

    About Nokia

    At Nokia, we are committed to connecting people. We combine advanced
technology with personalized services that enable people to stay close to
what matters to them. Every day, more than 1.3 billion people connect to
one another with a Nokia device - from mobile phones to advanced

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nokia business smartphones, maps and apps enhance the enterprise experience&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Espoo, Finland - Nokia today gave an update on the deployment of Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync for Nokia smartphones that shows it is gaining substantial traction among the world's biggest operators and enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The solution - which delivers direct, secure access to email and personal information via organizations' Microsoft Exchange servers - is now available for Nokia smartphones on more than 550 operator networks worldwide. These operators include America Movil, Orange, Telecom Italia, Telefonica, TeliaSonera, T-Mobile and Vodafone. And recently, the solution has undergone large-scale deployment at leading enterprises such as JCDecaux and OnMobile, which have been attracted to its dramatically improved efficiency and significantly lower cost compared to rival solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Through joint activities targeted at enterprises, Nokia and operators are bringing operational efficiencies and substantial savings in total cost of ownership (TCO) for IT decision makers, when compared to other solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;At JCDecaux, Europe's largest outdoor advertising company, just 14 percent of its mobile users in the UK had access to mobile email and calendar functions. The company was looking to extend that functionality to more of its workforce, in a way that was cheaper than the existing solution and without issues such as managing additional servers. JCDecaux chose Nokia's solution, which - in combination with attractive data tariffs from Vodafone Global Enterprise - led to a reduction in TCO, increased the company's responsiveness to customers and raised mobile email access for company mobile users to 100 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;OnMobile, India's largest white label data and value-added services company for mobile, landline and media service providers, was able to speed up processes, cut response time and save money by introducing Nokia's solution. Also, given that part of its workforce was already using Nokia smartphones, it was easy to set up Mail for Exchange without extra cost. In addition, monthly mobile data charges were substantially lower for the Nokia solution, and this encouraged users of a rival solution to switch. In the six months following the deployment, OnMobile reported substantial time savings for engineers, a 20 percent increase in projects completed on time and a 30 percent decrease in travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"IT directors are being pressured to deploy business mobility solutions such as email, IM and intranet access for more employees, but without the high costs they have had to spend on additional middleware, licenses and maintenance," said Ilari Nurmi, the head of marketing for Nokia's portfolio of Eseries business smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The solution enables employees to connect directly to the corporate mail server with their Nokia smartphone without the need for additional servers, and is fast becoming the solution of choice for businesses. In addition to accessing email, employees also enjoy direct access to corporate instant messaging through Microsoft&#174; Communicator Mobile, which was the first new application to be delivered by the two companies as part of their strategic alliance announced last year.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"Nokia is doing more than any other handset company to help businesses go mobile. Microsoft will design and develop mobile productivity, communication and collaboration solutions, and we will jointly bring them to market - giving our smartphones the edge over the competition," Nurmi continued.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync solution is supported by a wide range of Nokia smartphones available with different designs and prices, covering the entire business user market. In the first half of 2010, more than 12 million Nokia Eseries business smartphones were shipped, representing a growth of more than 50 percent compared to the first half of 2009. Nokia's line-up of business smartphones is to be strengthened by the arrival of the Nokia E7, equipped with a full keyboard and 4-inch touchscreen featuring Nokia ClearBlack technology for improved outdoor visibility.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In addition to access to corporate email and infrastructure, Nokia smartphone users also enjoy access to maps, navigation, download apps and access other services through Ovi. The popularity of Business category apps in the Ovi Store, such as Worldmate, F-Secure Anti-Theft for Mobile, Boingo and Bloomberg, has significantly increased with some of the top downloading countries including France, Germany, India, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Transport expert had served on JPM Cazenove exec committee&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * 25-year banking veteran also worked at Deutsche, Merrill&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (adds background on Cazenove, paragraphs 4-5)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) hired
Mark Preston, a former senior banker at JPMorgan's (JPM.N)
Cazenove arm, to head its UK advisory business, as the Canadian
bank looks to boost its European investment-banking operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement on Monday, RBC said Preston joins as a
managing director and will "be responsible for RBC's senior
relationships with UK businesses across all its industry and
product sectors".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He will be based in London and report to Patrick Meier, head
of European investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Preston, who has a background in transport and business
services, joined JPMorgan Cazenove in late 2006 from Deutsche
Bank (DBKGn.DE), and served on the bank's executive committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He left earlier this year after JPMorgan took full control
of the business, which had previously been a joint venture with
Britain's Cazenove Group. JPMorgan Cazenove's former chief
executive, Naguib Kheraj, resurfaced last month as chief
executive of Lazard (LAZ.N) International. [ID:nLDE69C1QT]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Preston has also worked at Merrill Lynch, RBC said, and has
more than 25 years' corporate finance experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last decade he has led mergers and acquisitions
(MA), and equity and debt capital markets transactions for
companies such as Anglo American (AAL.L), Associated British
Ports, DP World DPW.DI and Segro Plc (SGRO.L).

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 8 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO) hired
Mark Preston, a former senior banker at JPMorgan's (JPM.N)
Cazenove arm, to head its UK advisory business, as the Canadian

relationships with UK businesses across all its industry and
product sectors".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He will be based in London and report to Patrick Meier, head
of European investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Preston has also worked at Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) and
Merrill Lynch, RBC said, and has more than 25 years' corporate
finance experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last decade he has led mergers and acquisitions
(MA), and equity and debt capital markets transactions for

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney opened a new 20,000 square foot store in New York's Times Square on Tuesday, pressing ahead with plans to upgrade its retail chain, despite choppy consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Robert Iger, said in an interview the makeover of its retail business centered on improving the location of stores and adding features to entertain shoppers, such as a two-story princess castle that anchors the Times Square shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overhaul comes at a tricky time, with consumer spending stuck in a slump and shoppers worried about debt, the housing market and employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel good about our consumer because of products like 'Toy Story' or 'Tangled' or 'Tron'," said Iger. "Even in tough times, consumers are interested in great stories and great characters, which represent value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives said Disney plans to upgrade 20 to 25 stores annually over the next 5 to 7 years, although few will be as elaborately done as the Time Square store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond the high-rise castle, the store features a 12-foot screen that shows movie clips requested by shoppers and a table where kids can put together custom cars from the popular Disney-Pixar "Cars" movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The store opening, timed to make the most of the holiday shopping season, arrives just two days before the entertainment powerhouse is due to release its quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer products revenue was up about 9 percent for the first three fiscal quarters of the year and is expected to increase again in the fourth quarter, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It remains one of the smallest divisions of the company, but Iger pointed out it plays a "critical" role for the brand. Sales of Rapunzel dolls build interest in the new "Tangled" film, for instance, while a Captain Hook sword keeps interest behind the "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about the broader economy, Iger said it had improved through the year, but described the recovery as "modest and slow paced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Disney's quarterly results, analysts expect the biggest sign of economic improvement to come from advertising sales, but caution that its parks and resorts division remains under some pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio Entertainment, helped by "Toy Story 3," should be one strong spot and consumer products should be another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its media networks, which includes ABC and ESPN, the focus is likely to be on advertising. Expectations are that sales of commercial time during the World Cup should provide a big boost to ESPN, while ABC will show modest improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paul Thomasch; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) lost money on only two trading days during the third quarter, despite an industry-wide slump in trading volumes, according to a regulatory filing published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street firm lost no more than $25 million on two separate days, it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

trading conditions and increasing regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Volcker rule" provision of the U.S. Dodd-Frank
financial reform law, which limits the extent to which banks
can bet with their own capital, prompted Goldman to start
closing its proprietary trading business. [ID:nN21290478]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said in the filing it has "liquidated substantially all
of the positions that had been held within Principal
Strategies" as of Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also has been reviewing the practices of its Litton
Loan Servicing unit after regulators and state attorneys
general asked for information about its practices as part of an
industry-wide probe into the foreclosure practices of banks,
the firm said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its mortgage servicing unit has "temporarily suspended
evictions and foreclosure and real estate owned sales in a
number of states, including those with judicial foreclosure
procedures," Goldman said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm said it has not found evidence of any foreclosures
that were unwarranted and that it does not expect its
foreclosure suspension "to lead to a material increase in its
mortgage servicing-related advances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's shares closed down 1.6 percent at $166.55 in
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Bank of America shares
were down 2.6 percent at $12.27 and JPMorgan shares were down
1.5 percent at $39.90.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) plans to buy U.S. natural gas producer Atlas Energy ATLS.O for $3.2 billion, becoming one of the last big oil companies to jump into the Marcellus shale field.&lt;/p&gt;

"The price looks reasonable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimated that the deal valued the Marcellus acreage at about $9,000 an acre, below the peak that some of the best properties fetched earlier this year above $14,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steep decline in natural gas prices in recent months, largely because of rising output from Marcellus and other shale fields, has prompted many energy companies to slow their natural gas drilling programs and focus on oil and other liquids production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the deal, which must be approved by Atlas shareholders, Chevron would gain access to as much as 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Marcellus and other shale fields owned by Atlas in the U.S. East and Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlas has about 850 billion cubic feet of proved, or economically viable, natural gas reserves. That is about 3 percent of Chevron's proved gas reserves at the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil and gas company, will pay $43.34 per share, or a 37 percent premium to Atlas' closing price on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That offer consists of $38.25 per share in cash for each Atlas share, plus a distribution of units in Atlas Pipeline Holdings LP AHD.N worth about $5.09 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron will also assume net debt from Atlas of about $1.1 billion, for a total deal value of $4.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHALE TOEHOLD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, recently bought into shale fields in Poland, Romania and Canada, and the latest move will allow it to exploit the dense rock formations that have changed the U.S. energy outlook in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy investment bankers said Chevron has been looking for a toehold in the Marcellus for some time and looked at some of the previous assets that were up for grabs in the region earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy companies have rushed to tap into shale rock formations in states including Texas, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, using a technique called hydrofracturing, or "fracking," in which water, sand and chemicals are injected at high pressure into the rock to form cracks that allow the gas to be pulled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the rush to produce that gas has created a supply glut, and recently pushed natural gas prices NGc1 to their lowest level in a year, although they have rebounded somewhat in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, environmental groups and homeowners in Pennsylvania have criticized fracking as an ecologically dangerous practice that has fouled drinking water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the deal, Chevron will take over Atlas's 60 percent stake and serve as the operator of a joint venture in the Marcellus shale with India's Reliance Industries (RELI.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliance will continue to fund 75 percent of the operator's drilling costs, up to $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That part of the deal ensures that Chevron will not have to pour billions of dollars into development of new wells, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Atlas) is being carried by Reliance, and they're cash-flow neutral and growing by 40 to 50 percent," Hanold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Atlas's assets in the Appalachian basin include 486,000 net acres of Marcellus Shale; 623,000 net acres of Utica Shale; and a 49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream LLC, a joint venture with intrastate and natural gas gathering lines in the Marcellus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs  Co. served as Chevron's financial adviser in the deal, and Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom LLP as legal adviser to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jefferies  Co Inc and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc are acting as financial advisers to Atlas Energy, and Wachtell Lipton Rosen Katz served as its legal adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron closed 1.5 percent lower at $83.56 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Atlas shares jumped 34 percent to $42.50 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily.

 (Adds closing share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Matt Daily&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) plans to
buy U.S. natural gas producer Atlas Energy ATLS.O for $3.2
billion, becoming one of the last big oil companies to jump
into the Marcellus shale field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The field in western Pennsylvania and neighboring states,
one of the largest U.S. natural gas finds in decades, has
attracted a crush of industry heavyweights betting that the
fuel will become a key global energy source in the coming
decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's move into the Marcellus follows acquisitions by
Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) earlier this
year, and joint venture deals there by Total (TOTF.PA), BP Plc
(BP.L) and Statoil (STL.OL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Chevron) doesn't have much of a U.S. presence in shale,

 Take a Look: Shale gas as an energy source [ID:nN18229665]
 Reuters Breakingviews                      [ID:nN09285513]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHALE TOEHOLD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, recently bought
into shale fields in Poland, Romania and Canada, and the latest
move will allow it to exploit the dense rock formations that
have changed the U.S. energy outlook in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy investment bankers said Chevron has been looking for
a toehold in the Marcellus for some time and looked at some of
the previous assets that were up for grabs in the region
earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy companies have rushed to tap into shale rock
formations in states including Texas, Louisiana and
Pennsylvania, using a technique called hydrofracturing, or
"fracking," in which water, sand and chemicals are injected at
high pressure into the rock to form cracks that allow the gas
to be pulled out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the rush to produce that gas has created a supply glut,
and recently pushed natural gas prices NGc1 to their lowest
level in a year, although they have rebounded somewhat in the
past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, environmental groups and homeowners in
Pennsylvania have criticized fracking as an ecologically
dangerous practice that has fouled drinking water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the deal, Chevron will take over Atlas's 60 percent
stake and serve as the operator of a joint venture in the
Marcellus shale with India's Reliance Industries (RELI.BO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reliance will continue to fund 75 percent of the operator's
drilling costs, up to $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That part of the deal ensures that Chevron will not have to
pour billions of dollars into development of new wells,
according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(Atlas) is being carried by Reliance, and they're
cash-flow neutral and growing by 40 to 50 percent," Hanold
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlas's assets in the Appalachian basin include 486,000 net
acres of Marcellus Shale; 623,000 net acres of Utica Shale; and
a 49 percent interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream LLC, a joint
venture with intrastate and natural gas gathering lines in the
Marcellus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs  Co. served as Chevron's financial adviser
in the deal, and Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom LLP as legal
adviser to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferies  Co Inc and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc are
acting as financial advisers to Atlas Energy, and Wachtell
Lipton Rosen Katz served as its legal adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Chevron closed 1.5 percent lower at $83.56 on the
New York Stock Exchange, while Atlas shares jumped 34 percent
to $42.50 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; * Decision is latest development in diplomatic standoff&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Diplomatic spat started over landing rights&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABU DHABI, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Canadian citizens will now need
visas to enter the United Arab Emirates, a UAE official said on
Tuesday, after recent tensions over landing rights and military
operations in the oil-exporting country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canada was one of more than 30 countries, mostly Western,
that benefited from a visa waiver the UAE offered to their
citizens, but Canadians entering any of the seven emirates from
Jan. 2, must now obtain a visa in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision is the latest development in a diplomatic
standoff between the two countries over landing rights for UAE
airlines flying to Canada, which triggered a UAE government
decision to end access to a military base used by the Canadian
military to support troops in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The official source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the waiver is offered to countries with which the UAE
"enjoys a special relationship built on growing economic
cooperation and other forms of coordination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dubai carrier Emirates EMIRA.UL had been lobbying the
Canadian government to boost its thrice-weekly direct flights to
Toronto and more Canadian destinations, with support from the
UAE government, but failed to gain greater access. Abu Dhabi's
Etihad Airways also wants to increase its flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canada's Department of Foreign Affairs confirmed on Tuesday
that as of Jan. 2, 2011 visas will be required to travel to UAE
for business or tourism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UAE citizens are already required to have visas to enter
Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All sovereign states have the right to decide the entry
requirements for visitors to their countries," the department
said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the UAE blocked Canada's access to an airbase
near Dubai that the country had been using for support and rest
for its troops in Afghanistan.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States has given no explanation for denying an entry visa to Russia's fifth richest man, aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska, despite repeatedly being pressed to do so, Russia's Foreign Minister said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deripaska, 42, ranked fifth-richest Russian by Forbes magazine, with assets of $10.7 billion, has strong Kremlin backing and is chief executive officer and biggest shareholder in the world's top aluminum producer, RUSAL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department revoked Deripaska's multiple-entry visa without explanation in 2006, when relations between Washington and Moscow were at a post-Cold War low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The U.S. side) is totally unable to explain to us why he ... is not given a visa," Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This issue has been repeatedly raised by the Russian leadership," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seen as one of the more loyal oligarchs, the Kremlin stepped in to save Deripaska's indebted businesses during the height of the economic crisis, refinanced his heavy debts, and has long called on Washington to grant him a U.S. visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal last year linked the visa denial to suspicions Deripaska could have ties to organized crime in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Deripaska declined to comment Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Lavrov appealed in an open letter to the U.S.-based law firm Endeavor Group, which has been trying to secure Deripaska a visa. The U.S. Justice Department has said Deripaska paid Endeavor over $200,000 for consulting services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A persistent state of limbo regarding Mr. Deripaska's ability to travel freely...has become an impediment to the promotion... of contacts between the business communities," Lavrov said in the letter, which has been posted on the U.S. Department Justice website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Alexei Anishchuk; Editing by Michael Roddy)&lt;/p&gt;

      Murray, Frank  Sailer LLP Files Antitrust Class Action on Behalf of 
      Anyone Who Transacted in COMEX Silver Futures or Options, Against JP 
      Morgan Chase  Co., HSBC Holdings plc and Others
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Murray, Frank  Sailer LLP announces that it has filed a class action 
      complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District 
      of New York (Case No. 10-CV-8343) seeking to recover damages on behalf 
      of all persons or entities who transacted in COMEX silver futures or 
      options contracts between March 1, 2008 through such time as the effects 
      of Defendants&#8217; illegal conduct ceased (the &#8220;Class Period&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Read 
      the Complaint
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Complaint Alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants conspired 
      to and did suppress and manipulate the prices of COMEX silver futures 
      and options contracts by accruing extremely large short positions in 
      COMEX silver futures contracts in order to suppress the price of COMEX 
      silver futures and options contracts. This behavior would also result in 
      the suppression of the value of call options and an increase in the 
      value of put options, frequently resulting in call options becoming 
      worthless (&#8220;options pinning&#8221;). Defendants have engaged in additional 
      conduct with the intent of manipulation of the futures markets, 
      including the placement of large, &#8220;spoof&#8221; orders, whose purpose was to 
      influence prices before being withdrawn prior to actual speculation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Defendants&#8217; alleged restraint of trade and anticompetitive conduct had 
      severe adverse consequences on competition and price discovery. 
      Plaintiff and other members of the Class who traded COMEX silver futures 
      and options contracts during the Class Period were deprived of normal, 
      competitive trading patterns and instead were subject to artificially 
      determined prices as a result of Defendants&#8217; unlawful conduct. As a 
      consequence thereof, Plaintiff and the Class suffered financial losses 
      and were, therefore, injured in their business or property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The complaint further alleges that in September 2008, the Enforcement 
      Division of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&#8220;CFTC&#8221;) commenced 
      an investigation into manipulation in the silver market. The CFTC stated 
      in a report that it had received &#8220;numerous letters, e-mails 
      and phone calls&#8221; alleging that silver futures prices were being 
      unlawfully manipulated downward. On October 26, 2010, CFTC Commissioner 
      Bart Chilton announced that there have been &#8220;violations of the Commodity 
      Exchange Act in the silver market.&#8221; Specifically, Commissioner Chilton 
      concluded, &#8220;[t]here have been fraudulent efforts to persuade and 
      deviously control&#8221; prices in the silver market, which &#8220;should be 
      prosecuted.&#8221; Commissioner Chilton further indicated that the CFTC 
      investigation was continuing and added that he was &#8220;hopeful that the 
      agency will speak publicly about the investigation in the very near 
      future.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator fined Goldman Sachs Group Inc $650,000 for being too slow to reveal that two employees were facing government probes, including a vice president at the center of a civil fraud case against the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In imposing the fine, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Goldman had waited more than seven months before revealing that the vice president, Fabrice Tourre, had been notified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it might sue him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed civil fraud charges against Tourre and Goldman on April 16 over a transaction known as Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It accused Goldman of creating and selling collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages, without telling investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co had helped choose and bet against the debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman agreed in July to pay $550 million to settle the SEC case, one of the biggest arising from the U.S. housing and credit crises. Tourre has asked a Manhattan federal judge to throw out the SEC case against him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA said it had imposed the fine because Goldman violated a rule requiring it to disclose employees' receipt of "Wells notices" within 30 days. Such notices indicate the SEC may file civil charges, and give recipients a chance to mount defenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such disclosure delays impede FINRA's ability to regulate brokerages, as well as investors' ability to check employee records, FINRA acting enforcement chief James Shorris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our guidelines provide for sanctions that are remedial, not punitive," Shorris said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We understand that the underlying matter was relatively significant," he added, referring to Abacus, "which is why the sanction was six times the maximum under our sanction guidelines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to FINRA, Goldman did not update Tourre's records until May 3, or 18 days after the SEC lawsuit was filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said the bank was pleased to resolve the matter. It did not admit wrongdoing, and agreed to review its reporting procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman generated $5.97 billion of net income in the first nine months of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shorris called the two late filings a "relatively isolated number," given Goldman's size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINRA said the SEC did not sue the second Goldman employee who got a Wells notice. The regulator oversees nearly 4,700 brokerages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, Goldman shares were down 0.3 percent at $168.67 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York, editing by Matthew Lewis, Gerald E.

      The Law Office of Robbins Umeda LLP Announces an Investigation of the 
      Acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc. by Chevron Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Robbins 
      Umeda LLP has commenced an investigation into possible breaches of 
      fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by members of the Board 
      of Directors ("Board") of Atlas Energy, Inc. ("Atlas" or the "Company") 
      (NASDAQ: ATLS) in connection with their efforts to sell Atlas to Chevron 
      Corporation ("Chevron") (NYSE: CVX). If the transaction is completed, 
      Atlas shareholders will receive $38.25 in cash for each outstanding 
      share, and will also receive a pro-rata share of a distribution of over 
      41 million units of Atlas Pipeline Holdings, L.P. (NYSE: AHD). The deal 
      is expected to close after the completion of certain pre-merger 
      conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Robbins Umeda LLP's investigation concerns whether Atlas's Board 
      undertook a fair process to obtain fair consideration for all 
      shareholders of Atlas. Specifically, our investigation concerns whether 
      members of the Company's Board breached their fiduciary duties to Atlas 
      shareholders by failing to adequately shop the Company before entering 
      into the transaction with Chevron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you are a shareholder of Atlas, plan to continue to hold your shares, 
      and would like more information about your rights as a shareholder, 
      please contact attorney Gregory E. Del Gaizo at 800-350-6003 or by 
      e-mail at info@robbinsumeda.com.

			Atlas Energy, Inc. Shareholder Investigation by Briscoe Law Firm 
      Concerning the Acquisition by Chevron Corporation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The 
      Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC, founded by a former state prosecutor and 
      enforcement attorney for the United States Securities and Exchange 
      Commission, and the law firm of Powers Taylor, LLP are investigating 
      potential legal claims against the Board of Directors of Atlas 
      Energy, Inc. (&#8220;Atlas Energy&#8221; or &#8220;ATLS&#8221;) (NASDAQ: ATLS) related to 
      the proposed acquisition of Atlas Energy by Chevron Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The definitive acquisition agreement, which was announced on November 9, 
      2010, involves a transaction valued at approximately $4.3 billion, 
      including assumption of debt. Under the proposed acquisition, Atlas 
      Energy shareholders will receive a cash payment of $38.25 and a pro-rata 
      share of a distribution of approximately 41 million units of Atlas 
      Pipeline Holdings, L.P. for each share of Atlas Energy/ATLS common stock 
      they hold. Based on the closing price of Atlas Pipeline Holdings&#8217; shares 
      the day before the merger announcement, the aggregate value to Atlas 
      Energy shareholders is approximately $43.34.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At least one analyst has projected that the true inherent value of Atlas 
      Energy/ATLS common stock may be as high as $64 per share. Based on the 
      lack of an appreciable premium to shareholders and other factors, the 
      proposed transaction may undervalue Atlas Energy/ATLS shares and not be 
      fair to Atlas Energy shareholders. The investigation relates to possible 
      breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of state law by the 
      Board of Directors of Atlas Energy for approving this transaction and 
      whether Atlas Energy&#8217;s Board of Directors acted in the shareholders&#8217; 
      best interests.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you currently own shares of Atlas Energy/ATLS and would like 
      additional information regarding this investigation, or if you have 
      information regarding the allegations involving this transaction, please

    GladiatorStocks.com Alerts Today's Possible Movers and Shakers: Citigroup
Inc., General Electric Company, Sirius XM Radio Inc. and Yahoo Inc.

    Citigroup is transferring staff from other parts of the business such as
its investment banking ops and it's corp. bank to its private bank.
Chairman of Citi Private Bank said "A few years ago it became apparent
that attracting talent was going to be a challenge for everybody in
asia". General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said he remained
concerned about a Chinese industrial policy that has been widely
criticized by foreign businesses as discriminatory, even as the company
pledged to invest $1.5 billion in four new joint ventures and pour $500
million into research and development. As 2011 valuations come into play
when pricing Sirius XM (SIRI) shares, one notable question regarding next
year's guidance stems from the possibility that Sirius XM may be able to
increase its base subscription rate for the first time in the company's
history. Yahoo! Inc., owner of the largest U.S. Web portal, jumped as
much as 7.1 percent in Nasdaq trading on a report that KKR &amp; Co. is
joining a list of buyout firms that want to take the company private.

		&lt;p&gt;
			4th annual event to be held January 11-13, 2011, in San Francisco
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			OneMedPlace announced today that Nathan Myhrvold, Ph.D., 
      co-founder and CEO of Intellectual Ventures (&#8220;IV&#8221;) and the former Chief 
      Technology Officer for Microsoft, will present the keynote address on 
      Tuesday, Jan. 11, 2011, at the &#8220;OneMedForum 
      2011&#8221; business development and finance conference for emerging 
      healthcare and life science companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re delighted that Dr. Myhrvold will share his views on the future of 
      invention in health and medicine,&#8221; said Brett Johnson, CEO of 
      OneMedPlace, the conference organizer. &#8220;Dr. Myhrvold is a true thought 
      leader and one of the most creative thinkers of our generation. His 
      ideas about the financing of invention could greatly impact innovation 
      in healthcare.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am pleased to have the opportunity to address the entrepreneurs, 
      scientists, healthcare providers, and investors building the companies 
      shaping the future of health and medicine,&#8221; said Dr. Myhrvold. &#8220;A major 
      focus of Intellectual Ventures has been working on inventing solutions 
      in the area of medical technology.&#8221; The Intellectual Ventures health 
      portfolio includes 100 patent families, 1000 inventions, and over 2000 
      invention disclosures, according to the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Myhrvold started college at 14, received his doctorate in physics 
      from Princeton University at 23, and then studied under Steven Hawkings 
      at Cambridge University. After Microsoft acquired his software firm in 
      1986, he served as Chief Technology Officer for 14 years, a period 
      during which the firm grew to be among the world&#8217;s largest and most 
      profitable. He then founded Intellectual Ventures (&#8220;IV&#8221;), with a vision 
      is to change the nature of invention.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With almost 30,000 patents in areas including alternative energy, meta 
      materials and medical technology, more than 700 employees, $5 billion 
      under management, and investors like Bill Gates and some of the largest 
      companies in the world, Intellectual Ventures has to be considered a 
      significant force in the future of medtech,&#8221; added Johnson. &#8220;IV has 
      built an invention juggernaut that some believe may fundamentally change 
      the nature of how inventions are developed. Their ideas represent a 
      paradigm shift&#8212;creating a &#8216;currency&#8217; with inventions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;What we&#8217;re really trying to do is create a capital market for 
      inventions akin to the venture capital market that supports start-ups 
      and the private equity market that revitalizes inefficient companies,&#8221; 
      explained Dr. Myhrvold. &#8220;Our goal is to make applied research a 
      profitable activity that attracts vastly more private investment than it 
      does today, so that the number of inventions generated soars.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Many have said the notion of creating a liquid market for inventions is 
      absurd. I couldn&#8217;t disagree more,&#8221; said Dr. Myhrvold. &#8220;In the 1970s, 
      people said the same thing about another type of intangible intellectual 
      property: software. Back then, everyone in the computer industry 
      believed that software was valuable only because it helped to sell 
      mainframes or minicomputers and that you could never sell software by 
      itself. As a result, software engineers worked for computer 
      manufacturers or for companies that used computers. Very few independent 
      software vendors existed, and those that did were barely profitable. As 
      a business, software was hopeless. Everyone said so. But everyone was 
      wrong, of course. Over the next three decades, software became one of 
      the most profitable businesses in history. I believe that invention 
      is set to become the next software: a high-value asset that will serve 
      as the foundation for new business models, liquid markets, and 
      investment strategies.&#8221;

      Fitch: Chevron's Ratings Unaffected by Announced Atlas Acquisition
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings anticipates that Chevron Corporation's (NYSE: CVX) 
      announced acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc (NASDAQ: ATLS) will not 
      impact Chevron's ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under terms of the deal, Chevron will acquire Atlas for $3.2 billion in 
      cash and assume pro forma net debt of $1.1 billion, for total 
      transaction value of $4.3 billion. The deal is subject to Atlas 
      shareholder approval, regulatory review, and certain restructuring 
      transactions by Atlas. Chevron will also assume Atlas' role as operator 
      in a jv with Reliance Industries Limited in the Marcellus Shale. Under 
      terms of that deal, Reliance will fund 75% of the operator's drilling 
      costs, up to $1.4 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Acquired assets upon closing will include approximately 850 billion 
      cubic feet (bcf) of proved natural gas reserves with approximately 80 
      million cf/d of production. Acreage includes 486,000 net acres of 
      Marcellus shale and 623,000 net acres of Utica shale in the Appalachian 
      basin; 100,000 net acres of Collingwood/Utica shale in Michigan; Antrim 
      shale production, and a 49% interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Similar to the ExxonMobil-XTO transaction announced in December 2009, 
      this transaction is expected to meaningfully enhance Chevron's 
      unconventional resource base in North America. Chevron has a growing 
      portfolio of global unconventional resources including net acreage 
      positions in Romania (675,000 acres), Canada (200,000 acres Western 
      Canada) as well as Southeast Poland (approximately 200,000 acres). 
      Chevron's ability to exploit the new acreage as well as leverage Atlas' 
      technical capabilities in shale gas extraction across the combined 
      entity's broader portfolio is likely to be a strategically important 
      part of the acquisition; therefore retention of key Atlas geological 
      staff is likely to be critical to the success of the acquisition going 
      forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prior to the deal, at Sept. 30, 2010, Chevron had gross debt of $10.62 
      billion, cash of approximately $11 billion, and short-term deposits of 
      $3.47 billion, for aggregate debt net of cash and equivalent instruments 
      of negative $3.85 billion. On a pro forma basis following the 
      transaction, the company is expected to have net debt of approximately 
      $1.1 billion on a combined asset base of approximately $182 billion. 
      Looking forward, Fitch anticipates that the company will continue to be 
      managed conservatively and will maintain high levels of financial 
      flexibility post-integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch currently rates Chevron as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'AA';

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Unocal unsecured notes 'AA';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper 'F1+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR 'F1+'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Funding Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper 'F1+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR 'F1+'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation is a large integrated oil company with 2009 upstream 
      production of 2.68 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) and 
      year-end proven hydrocarbon reserves of 11,315 million boe. Chevron's 
      downstream portfolio includes interests in 17 refineries with an 
      aggregate refining capacity of 2.16 million bpd and approximately 22,000 
      branded retail stations. Chevron's chemicals assets are held through 
      CPChem, a joint venture with ConocoPhillips Corporation which holds 
      interests in 34 worldwide manufacturing facilities and four research 
      centers. Chemicals interests also include the Oronite lubes and fuel 
      additives business. Other assets include midstream assets, power 
      generation, and mining, among others. Chevron also controls a 41 tanker 
      fleet to move crude and products around the world held on a short-term 
      (1 year) charter basis.

			The Law Firm of Levi  Korsinsky, LLP Launches an Investigation into 
      the Possible Breaches of Fiduciary Duty by the Board of Atlas Energy, 
      Inc. in Connection with the Sale of the Company to Chevron Corporation &#8211; 
      ATLS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Levi  Korsinsky is investigating the Board of Directors of Atlas 
      Energy, Inc. (&#8220;Atlas Energy&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NasdaqGS: ATLS) for 
      possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of state law in 
      connection with their attempt to sell the Company to Chevron Corporation 
      (&#8220;Chevron&#8221;) (NYSE: CVX). Under the terms of the transaction, Atlas 
      Energy shareholders will receive consideration valued at $43.34 per 
      share for a total transaction value of approximately $4.3 billion. Atlas 
      Energy shareholders will receive $38.25 in cash for each outstanding 
      share, and will also receive a pro-rata share of a distribution of over 
      41 million units of Atlas Pipeline Holdings, L.P. (NYSE: AHD).

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investigation concerns whether the Atlas Energy Board of Directors 
      breached their fiduciary duties to Atlas Energy stockholders by failing 
      to adequately shop the Company before entering into this transaction and 
      whether Chevron is underpaying for Atlas Energy shares, thus unlawfully 
      harming Atlas Energy stockholders. In particular, at least one analyst 
      set a price target for Atlas Energy common stock at $64.00 per share.

			Goldman Sachs to Pay $650,000 for Failing to Disclose Wells Notices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Firm is Ordered to Review its Procedures and Systems and Document 
      Corrective Measures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced today that 
      it has fined Goldman, Sachs  Co. $650,000 for failing to disclose that 
      two of its registered representatives, including Fabrice Tourre, had 
      received formal notices from the Securities and Exchange Commission 
      (SEC) that they were the subjects of investigations. Tourre&#8217;s &#8220;Wells 
      Notice&#8221; was issued in connection with the SEC&#8217;s investigation of an 
      offering of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation (CDO) called 
      ABACUS 2007-ACI (Abacus).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Firms are required to update a representative&#8217;s regulatory record by 
      filing a Form U4 reporting the receipt of a Wells Notice within 30 days 
      of learning of the Notice. In Tourre&#8217;s case, his Form U4 was not amended 
      until May 3, 2010, more than seven months after Goldman learned of his 
      Wells Notice, and only after the SEC filed a complaint against Goldman 
      and Tourre on April 16, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FINRA found that Goldman did not have adequate supervisory procedures 
      and systems in place to ensure that required disclosures were made when 
      registered employees received notice that they were the subject of a 
      regulatory investigation. FINRA also found that Goldman&#8217;s written 
      supervisory procedures, manuals and policies were inadequate. Nowhere 
      did the procedures and policies mention &#8220;Wells Notices&#8221; specifically and 
      the need to make disclosure when one was issued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Goldman&#8217;s failures impacted the ability of FINRA and other securities 
      regulators to discharge their registration, examination and oversight 
      duties, and limited the ability of investors and other market 
      participants to adequately assess the individuals through FINRA&#8217;s public 
      disclosure program, BrokerCheck,&#8221; said James S. Shorris, FINRA Executive 
      Vice President and Acting Chief of Enforcement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Individuals at Goldman were promptly informed of the receipt of the 
      Wells Notices by the outside counsel for both employees, but they 
      subsequently failed to notify the Goldman compliance unit charged with 
      updating Forms U4. The second registered individual subsequently was not 
      named in an SEC complaint.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the settlement, Goldman also agreed to review its supervisory 
      procedures and systems in the reporting area and to implement and 
      document any necessary remedial measures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In concluding this settlement, Goldman neither admitted nor denied the 
      charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.

      Bernstein Liebhard LLP Announces Investigation of Acquisition of Atlas 
      Energy, Inc. by Chevron Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bernstein Liebhard LLP is investigating whether the Board of Directors 
      of Atlas Energy, Inc. (&#8220;Atlas Energy&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;) (NASDAQ:ATLS) 
      breached its fiduciary duty to its shareholders in agreeing to sell 
      Atlas Energy to Chevron Corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the agreement, Atlas Energy will receive 
      consideration valued at $43.34 per share in total. Atlas Energy 
      shareholders will receive $38.25 in cash for each outstanding share, and 
      will also receive a pro-rata share of a distribution of over 41 million 
      units of Atlas Pipeline Holdings, L.P. (NYSE:AHD). The investigation is 
      focused on the potential unfairness of the price to Atlas Energy 
      shareholders and the process by which the Atlas Energy Board of 
      Directors considered and approved the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      shareholder and/or have information relating to the matter, please

      Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: EI DuPont de Nemours  Co., 
      Monsanto Company, Manpower, Apple and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Zacks Equity Research highlights: EI 
      DuPont de Nemours  Co. (NYSE: DD) 
      as the Bull of the Day and Monsanto Company (MON) 
      the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
      analysis on Manpower (NYSE: MAN), 
      Apple, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) 
      and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EI DuPont de Nemours  Co. (NYSE: DD) 
      is focused on capturing $1 billion in working capital productivity gains 
      during 2011-2013. The company is also on track to achieve a combined 
      $600 million in benefits from fixed cost productivity and restructuring 
      actions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DuPont is executing strategies for further development and growth of new 
      products, particularly for agriculture, photovoltaics, alternative 
      energy and materials. Furthermore, the company's focus on the emerging 
      markets, along with a strong performance in the Agriculture  Nutrition 
      segment, are expected to generate top-line growth in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Along with upward estimate revisions by analysts, these factors have led 
      us to upgrade our recommendation from Neutral to Outperform with a 
      target price of $56.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We reiterate our Underperform recommendation on Monsanto Company (MON) 
      based on low visibility on the yield performance of SmartStax seed in 
      the coming years. Based on concerns regarding the performance of 
      SmartStax seed, estimates have gone down by 6 cents and 14 cents for 
      fiscal 2011 and 2012, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Monsanto continued to post weak results for fiscal 2010 with an EPS of 
      $2.41, almost half its $4.41 in fiscal 2009 due to the decrease in the 
      prices of Roundup herbicides. The increase in cost and expense was the 
      icing on the cake.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, a slower market recovery and an intensely competitive 
      environment posts additional challenges for the company. Thus, our 
      Underperform recommendation on the stock indicates that it would perform 
      below the broader market. Our $53.00 target price, 18.9x 2011 EPS, 
      reflects this view.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Past the Turbulence, Where To Now?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Like the Chinese curse says: may you live in interesting times.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For now it seems as if the major macroeconomic and socio-political 
      obstacles have been navigated, for better or worse, but the hugest of 
      these issues -- from the Wall Street bailout to the failure of the Greek 
      economy -- have put massive pressures on trading markets both up and 
      down, both in the U.S. and around the world, for the past couple years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the two most recent pieces of big news -- the GOP recapturing 
      the House of Representatives and the Fed's announced $600 billion in 
      quantitative easing (QE2), both of which analysts seem to agree reflect 
      positively on Wall Street -- it feels as if we may be in for a breather. 
      But does this mean after two years of heavy turbulence we can expect to 
      float along at current levels?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If not, what can be seen as potential upward or downward pressure on the 
      markets going forward? Even more importantly, how can the individual 
      investor profit from a little forethought at this stage? After all, we 
      are currently trading around the highs reached back in April of this 
      year, before the world thought Europe was about to crumble into the 
      Mediterranean. So where to now?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Stock Plays for This Environment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One place to start would be to look at our stubbornly consistent slow 
      economic growth and high unemployment levels. While GDP chugs along 
      modestly in the low single-digits, unemployment continues to threaten 
      the 10% mark each month.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Thus, a company like Manpower (NYSE: MAN) 
      warrants serious consideration. Companies in need of additional work 
      resources who are not yet confident enough in the economy to take on 
      more full-time employees often turn to temp service agencies, and 
      Manpower is a market leader. The stock has had a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong 
      Buy rating) since October 23rd, and 12 of the 13 analysts covering 
      Manpower have upwardly revised earnings estimates for the December 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also, one might want to make sure he or she is invested in stocks whose 
      companies have made it through the Great Recession unscathed -- or have 
      roared ahead despite the overall economy. Apple, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) 
      comes to mind immediately. While consumers have been cutting back on 
      their overall spending, Apple has managed to sell enough handsome 
      gadgets over the past two years to become the second-largest company in 
      the world by market cap.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      What? You say you don't own any shares of AAPL? Rise and shine, Rip van 
      Winkle. Though Apple, Inc. shares carry a Zacks #3 Rank at present, the 
      mixed earnings estimate revisions of the past month tilt the scales to 
      the upside: 28 analysts have raised estimates for the December quarter 
      and 5 have lowered theirs. Also, keep in mind that Apple, Inc.'s 
      guidance is predictably overly conservative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Finally, although the finance industry was Ground Zero for the economic 
      meltdown, and over 100 banks have gone bankrupt in 2010 alone, being 
      underexposed to the financials is not a good idea at this juncture. 
      There are simply too many ways for companies like JPMorgan Chase  Co. 
      (NYSE: JPM) to turn a 
      profit quarter over quarter, year over year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan has posted positive earnings surprises that have averaged more 
      than 26% over the past four quarters. Earnings estimate revisions are 
      again mixed -- 15 upward revision, 2 downward in the past month -- but 
      JPM is as solid a Zacks #3 Rank financial institution as one can find. 
      And JPMorgan will most likely be at the forefront of the major banks to 
      restore a "normal" dividend in the coming quarters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      So -- everyone feeling a little bit better now? We seem to have tiptoed 
      around the abyss, and we can once again begin looking forward to 
      profitability and growth. And even if it seems for awhile like we've 
      escaped turbulence only to find ourselves adrift in a flat market, solid 
      bedrock stocks will help you feel more grounded.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Toyota&#8217;s Profit Quintuples
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE: TM) 
      revealed a fivefold increase in profit to &#165;115.5 billion ($1.34 billion) 
      or &#165;31.47 per share (37 cents) in the second quarter of its fiscal 2011 
      ended March 31, 2011 from &#165;22.19 billion ($258.26 million) or &#165;6.96 per 
      share (8 cents) in the same quarter of previous fiscal year. The profit 
      was boosted by marketing strategy as well as cost reduction measures 
      incorporated by the company during the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consolidated revenues in the quarter ascended 6% to &#165;4.81 trillion 
      ($55.98 billion) on the back of a 10% rise in global sales volume to 1.9 
      million units. Vehicle sales declined marginally by 2,509 units to 
      514,882 units in North America and 19% or 41,496 units to 180,878 units 
      in Europe. Meanwhile, sales rose 18% to 585,496 units in Japan, 27% to 
      289,826 units in Asia, and 22% to 324,189 units on Other regions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating profit almost doubled to &#165;111.46 billion ($1.30 billion) from 
      &#165;58 billion ($675.05 million) in the second quarter of fiscal 2010. The 
      rise in operating profit was attributable to positive impacts from 
      marketing efforts and cost reduction measures, offset partially by 
      unfavorable exchange rate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			King Pharma Disappoints
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), King 
      Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NYSE: KG) 
      reported third-quarter earnings of 16 cents per share, a penny below the 
      year-ago earnings. The Zacks Consensus Estimate was 19 cents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenues fell 19.2% to $374.5 million mainly due to the lackluster 
      performance of several key products and the entry of two generic 
      versions of Skelaxin. Revenues, however, exceeded the Zacks Consensus 
      Estimate by $7.5 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Quarter in Detail
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      King Pharma's branded Pharmaceuticals segment declined 43.3% with 
      revenues coming in at $160.8 million. Revenues of almost all key 
      products declined from the year-ago period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Thrombin-JMI sales declined 25.9% to $32.2 million. We expect 
      Thrombin-JMI sales to continue declining due to tough competition in the 
      form of Bristol-Myers Squibbs&#8217; (NYSE: BMY) 
      Recothrom and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s (NYSE: JNJ) 
      Evithrom.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, Skelaxin (metaxalone), which posted sales of $91 million in 
      the first quarter of 2010, saw a huge drop in sales due to the entry of 
      two generic versions early in the second quarter. Skelaxin sales plunged 
      to $6.8 million in the third quarter of 2010, down from $102.1 million 
      in the year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to IMS weekly prescription data, for the week ending October 
      22, 2010, generic competitors captured about 85% of the prescriptions in 
      the metaxalone market. King Pharma received $25.2 million in the form of 
      royalties from sales on the authorized generic version of Skelaxin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Avinza revenues declined 11.4% to $27.3 million, mainly due to declining 
      prescriptions (down 30.7%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embeda, obtained through King Pharma's acquisition of Alpharma, posted 
      sales of $10.2 million, down 32% sequentially. Embeda was launched in 
      the third quarter of 2009; revenues declined 9% from the year-ago 
      period. Sales were affected by voluntary product recalls announced by 
      King Pharma during the first half of 2010. These product recalls were 
      due to post-manufacturing testing issues. Two more lots of Embeda have 
      been recalled so far in the fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Flector Patch, another product obtained through the Alpharma 
      acquisition, was the only product to record growth during the third 
      quarter. An increase in wholesale inventory levels accompanied with a 
      price increase taken earlier this year helped boost FlectorPatch sales 
      to $42.4 million, up 5%. Prescriptions, however, declined 8.3% during 
      the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenues from the Animal Health business were $92.7 million in the 
      reported quarter, down 3.3%. The Animal Health business should provide 
      positive cash flow and diversification.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We were pleased to see King Pharma&#8217;s Meridian Auto-Injector business 
      continue to perform well. Third quarter revenues came in at $83.6 
      million, up 16.4%. Price increases, higher sales and royalties on EpiPen 
      helped offset the impact of lower government orders. The company also 
      signed a signed a new supply agreement with Dey Pharma, under which the 
      EpiPen collaboration will run through 2020. Under the new contract, King 
      Pharma will receive higher prices and royalties (effective January 1, 
      2010).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating expenses declined to $140 million. While selling, general and 
      administrative expenses declined 15.8% to $114.3 million, research  
      development expenses increased 13.4% to $25.7 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      King Pharma said that it remains on track to re-submit its marketing 
      applications for opioid candidates, Remoxy and Acurox. While the Remoxy 
      application should be re-submitted to the US Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) by year-end, the marketing application for Acurox 
      (without niacin) is scheduled to be re-submitted in the US in the first 
      quarter of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Neutral on King Pharma
		&lt;/p&gt;

      We currently have a Neutral recommendation on King Pharma, which is 
      supported by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating). In October 
      2010, King Pharma entered into an agreement with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) 
      whereby Pfizer will acquire King Pharma for $14.25 per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The offer price represents a 40% premium on King Pharma&#8217;s closing price 
      as of October 11, 2010. The Boards of both companies have approved the 
      deal, which is scheduled to close later this year/early next year.

			Lieberman Software Extends the Power of Microsoft&#174; 
      Systems Center Service Manager to Automatically Close Privileged Account 
      Security Holes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Integration is the First to Leverage SCSM Workflows to Safeguard 
      Privileged Access to Servers, Workstations, Network Appliances and 
      Applications Everywhere on the Network
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Lieberman 
      Software Corporation, the Pioneers of Privileged Identity 
      ManagementSM, today announced deep, out-of-the-box 
      integration between the company&#8217;s privileged identity management (PIM) 
      solutions and Microsoft System Center Service Manager (SCSM). This 
      integration is the first to extend the management workflows of Microsoft 
      SCSM to control and audit privileged accounts, the powerful &#8220;keys to the 
      kingdom of IT.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Left unmanaged, privileged accounts provide anonymous, unaudited access 
      to configuration settings and all sensitive data present on every 
      server, workstation, network appliance and business application on the 
      network. The new Lieberman Software integration extends Microsoft SCSM 
      by enabling IT staff to:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        More quickly resolve IT service issues by getting fast, privileged 
        access to systems and applications through the SCSM interface;
      
			
        Receive privileged access only to the extent needed to resolve each IT 
        service issue, and only if properly authorized through SCSM;
      
			
        View complete, authoritative documentation of each privileged password 
        check out request including each requester and IP address, time 
        stamps, and the reason for each request.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      This two-way integration is designed to save IT staff time by more 
      quickly granting access to IT assets whenever service is required, and 
      by eliminating the time-consuming manual tasks of obtaining approvals, 
      documenting each access and reporting the results. Together SCSM and 
      Lieberman Software&#8217;s privileged identity management products also 
      provide enhanced oversight to help organizations meet their Service 
      Level Agreement (SLA) and regulatory compliance requirements, 
      continuously auditing IT staff access to privileged accounts and 
      providing authoritative records to prove compliance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For our customers, reducing the time it takes to resolve IT service 
      problems is absolutely key,&#8221; said Paul Ross, Group Product Marketing 
      Manager, Microsoft.&#160;&#8220;By integrating Lieberman Software&#8217;s privileged 
      identity management solutions with Service Manager the resolution of 
      issues related to these critical accounts is accelerated. Delivering 
      this directly within the Service Manager environment also further lowers 
      the cost of IT meeting their compliance requirements.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Lieberman Software &#8211; Microsoft SCSM Integration
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lieberman Software&#8217;s Enterprise 
      Random Password Manager (ERPM) and Random 
      Password Manager (RPM) control access to privileged credentials, 
      ensuring that only authorized staff can access sensitive systems, with 
      an approved purpose, for a limited amount of time. Once the password 
      check-out time has been completed, or the administrator checks the 
      password back in, it&#8217;s automatically randomized and all dependent 
      services are updated with the new password.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The integrations ensure that only those systems and applications that 
      are relevant to each SCSM incident can be reached through privileged 
      credentials for service and repair, and only by appropriate personnel. 
      All password checkout/check-in transactions become part of the trouble 
      ticket record, are audited and are available for review by IT management 
      and auditors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ERPM and RPM are the first privileged identity management solutions 
      capable of verifying trouble ticket information so that only those users 
      who provide valid ticket data can access sensitive systems. The 
      Lieberman Software solutions do so by confirming that each open ticket 
      is valid, has been requested by an authorized user, and corresponds to 
      the correct system prior to releasing each password. In doing so ERPM 
      and RPM help organizations comply with regulatory mandates requiring 
      that they resolve open security management events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft SCSM is a visionary product for automating IT service 
      management and is being rapidly adopted in the enterprise as a logical 
      replacement for legacy trouble ticket systems,&#8221; said Philip Lieberman, 
      president and CEO of Lieberman Software.&#160;&#8220;We decided to integrate our 
      privileged identity management solutions with SCSM because it represents 
      an important new technology for trouble ticket and configuration control 
      management.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lieberman Software is a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner in the ISV 
      category and a Microsoft System Center Alliance Partner. ERPM and RPM 
      are already integrated with Microsoft System Center Operations Manager 
      (SCOM) and System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM),
			making 
      comprehensive privileged identity management a simple snap-in for an 
      organization&#8217;s existing enterprise management console.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SCSM integration is available immediately in ERPM and RPM at no 
      additional cost. More information is available at www.liebsoft.com/scsm_integration.

&lt;p&gt;  PHILADELPHIA, PA, Nov 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Neuxpower Solutions (www.neuxpower.com), a global leader in file
optimization software, today announced that the Antelope Valley Union
High School District has reclaimed 30 to 40 percent of its primary
storage previously consumed by Microsoft Office and JPEG files by using
Neuxpower NXPowerLite for File Servers. The Neuxpower file optimization
solution, used by more than one million users worldwide, automates the
reduction of the school district's file bloat while generating
comprehensive reports detailing how storage was being used and the
immediate savings obtained by optimizing files.

    The Antelope Valley Union High School District covers a geographic area
from the Los Angeles Forest in the south, to the Kern county line in the
north, and from the Ventura/Kern county lines in the west, to the San
Bernardino county line in the east. Over 23,600 high school students are
educated in eight comprehensive and four continuation high schools, with
additional educational opportunities offered by a Regional Occupation
Program (ROP) and Adult Education campuses.

    The School District manages twelve file servers across its fifteen
locations and it was finding that a large amount of server space was
consumed by extremely large Microsoft Office and JPEG files. Teachers and
students were creating more and more bloated documents, presentations and
images every day. As a result, the data growth was increasing storage
management requirements and impacting the school district's backup
window. 

    "Backups were taking up to six hours at some of our sites," said Dan
Stewart, director of information systems, Antelope Valley Union High
School District. "Even with hardware being upgraded every two years, we
were unable to keep up with demand. We knew that if we continued down the
same path, we might lose control of our data growth."

    That's when the District began searching for new ways to reclaim storage,
reduce backup windows and keep data growth in check. Antelope initially
deployed ten licenses of Neuxpower's NXPowerLite Desktop Edition to batch
and optimize files on their servers. Experiencing immediate benefits and
long-term value the School District wanted to address its entire file
server environment. Once NXPowerLite for File Servers became available
Antelope immediately implemented the solution which has enabled the
District to automate manual processes and generate comprehensive reports
detailing how storage was being used and the savings obtained by
optimizing files.

    Once installed, NXPowerLite for File Servers enabled the district to
reclaim 30 to 40 percent of storage consumed by Microsoft Office and JPEG
files after the initial optimization run was completed in just three to
four days. The software continues to run transparently on district
servers on a monthly basis, optimizing any new files and reporting on
current storage usage to keep data growth in check. 

    "NXPowerLite gives us smaller, optimized files that not only save on
storage space, but are more usable and easier to email than the
originals," said Stewart. "We have also been very happy with the visual
quality of the optimized files and our users have been unable to tell the
difference between the original and the optimized version."

    "With the increased use of information technology in the classroom,
today's teachers and students are actively generating mountains of new
content, however they don't necessarily have the time or skills to
manually optimize it," said Mike Power, CEO, Neuxpower. "As a result, the
education sector often consumes far more storage than they need to.
NXPowerLite is an ideal solution for technology-rich school districts
like Antelope Valley Union High School District that need to remove file
bloat without reducing file quality so that they may keep data growth and
management costs under control."

    About Neuxpower

    Established in 1997, Neuxpower is the leading provider of file
optimization software for primary data reduction. NXPowerLite technology
dramatically reduces the size of bloated Microsoft Office and JPEG files,
without affecting their appearance. Optimized files remain in their
original format, retaining all their attributes and visual content
integrity. Using NXPowerLite companies can quickly and easily reclaim
substantial amounts of their existing primary storage. Our desktop and
server solutions are used by more than one million people worldwide. To

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman, Natixis close to settlement -lawyer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Settlement expected "around lunchtime"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Legal spat one of rising wave of bank litigation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Nov 9 (Reuters) - Wall Street heavyweight Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) and French rival Natixis (CNAT.PA) were close to
settling a London court case on Tuesday over a bond deal that
highlights a rising tide of financial legal spats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One lawyer told a London court that the two parties were
securing an agreement and that he had been told there would be
"an executed settlement around lunchtime". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court was adjourned until 1400 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dispute centres on whether Natixis, majority owned by
BPCE, which has France's second-largest retail branch network,
can lawfully terminate three credit default swaps bought by
Goldman's London unit, Goldman Sachs International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natixis, which reports third-quarter results on Tuesday,
wanted to terminated the deals, alleging that Goldman had not
complied with the contract. Goldman, which denies the claim, is
also seeking damages for breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawyers expect a rising wave of banking and financial
disputes before English courts to continue next year as banks
try to extract themselves from agreements struck before the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The conditions that traditionally cause a turn in the cycle
away from litigation are not yet present," noted Allen  Overy,
a leading London law firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A faltering recovery in the rich economies and tight credit
conditions may still create problems for debt-laden deals from
the height of the last cycle, and the pressures on investors and
multinationals to pursue yields and profit in higher risk
emerging markets are likely to increase."

			Social Media Analysis Provides Valuable Insight on Customer 
      Opinion to Drive Informed, Effective Marketing Campaigns
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Crimson Hexagon (www.crimsonhexagon.com), 
      provider of social 
      media monitoring and analysis for marketing, brand insights and 
      market research professionals, today announced
			Microsoft Bing
			chose 
      its Crimson Hexagon ForSight&#8482; platform for in-depth social media 
      analysis. Bing reports the insights revealed by the Crimson Hexagon 
      ForSight technology sparked new ideas for marketing campaigns and helped 
      refine marketing strategies by identifying new ways to relate with its 
      broad and diverse customer base.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Bing, a search engine that finds and organizes answers for 
      internet users, needed to understand all the ways that people were 
      interacting with its online services. While the company actively 
      harnesses social-media channels in its marketing efforts, Bing was 
      unable to quickly sort through and make sense of the information it 
      collected. Bing turned to the Crimson Hexagon ForSight platform to 
      discover and analyze relevant online conversations and derive actionable 
      insights.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The analysis revealed by the Crimson Hexagon ForSight platform helped 
      us identify ways that we can connect with our target audiences on a more 
      individual level,&#8221; said Lise Brende, director of marketing analytics, 
      Bing and MSN at Microsoft Corp. &#8220;This information enabled our marketing 
      team to hone strategies tailored to exactly what our customers need and 
      deserve.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Crimson Hexagon ForSight platform enabled Microsoft&#8217;s Bing marketing 
      team to delve into valuable customer opinions in the following ways:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Identify where conversations happen &#8211; By quickly sorting 
        through billions of online forums, blogs and websites, Crimson Hexagon 
        identified where the bulk of conversations were occurring, enabling 
        Bing to have focused interaction with core audiences.
      
			
				Recognize key influencers
				&#8211; Crimson Hexagon identified 
        those personalities who influence conversations of interest, enabling 
        Bing to hone outreach efforts and marketing campaigns that tap into 
        these resources.
      
			
				Execute flexible, targeted marketing strategies &#8211; Crimson 
        Hexagon&#8217;s analysis uncovered vital customer insights, enabling Bing
				to 
        implement more successful and effective marketing campaigns.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;After analyzing one month of online conversations, Crimson Hexagon 
      provided Bing with the ability to harness the nuances of social media 
      conversations to create more effective marketing campaigns, ultimately 
      enhancing customer service delivery and our overall business,&#8221; said 
      Brende. &#8220;We are looking forward to continued success with Crimson 
      Hexagon.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are thrilled that Microsoft Bing selected our Crimson Hexagon 
      ForSight platform to truly understand the value and impact of customer&#8217;s 
      social media conversations, and how they can inform meaningful, 
      productive marketing campaigns,&#8221; said Scott Centurino, chief executive 
      officer of Crimson Hexagon. &#8220;We are dedicated to helping global brands 
      like Microsoft achieve similar benefits through the advanced social 
      media analysis capabilities delivered by our ForSight platform.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on groundbreaking work conducted at Harvard University&#8217;s Institute 
      for Quantitative Social Science, the ForSight platform from Crimson 
      Hexagon is the only commercially available opinion analysis platform 
      that lets customer&#8217;s distill meaning &#8211; with mathematical precision &#8211;

      Fifth Annual Clean Energy Conference in New York on November 10-11, 
      2010. Jonathan Read, CEO of ECOtality, will appear on a panel titled

			Security 
      First Corp., a data high availability and security company whose 
      disruptive software technology is revolutionizing information handling 
      today announced it has signed a joint development agreement with IBM 
      (NYSE: IBM) 
      to collaborate on cryptographic security solutions that will enable new 
      levels of highly-available, secured data for cloud computing clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the agreement, Security First and IBM will develop a Virtual 
      Machine cryptographic security capability containing Security First&#8217;s 
      SecureParser&#174; Cryptographic Splitting technology for use in 
      IBM's Linux-based public Cloud computing offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SecureParser Cryptographic Splitting technology is a new paradigm 
      for securing and making data highly available across networks and 
      distributed storage solutions including public, community, hybrid and 
      private Clouds. The SecureParser
			software with its many 
      Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS 140-2) certifications has 
      been designed to address key data assurance needs voiced by both 
      governmental and commercial IT leaders. Such reliable data assurance 
      will unleash the full potential of virtualization and the Cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Security First CEO Mark O'Hare stated, "By teaming with a market leader 
      like IBM, our SecureParser technology can help resolve the most 
      perplexing obstacles of secure and highly available Cloud computing. We 
      see a clear path ahead now for Cloud computing to move forward and reach 
      its full potential, and we are excited and pleased to be a key part of 
      this significant security solution with IBM.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Security First Corp.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Security First is an emerging industry leader in information assurance 
      including data security, privacy, integrity, and high availability. 
      Security First&#8217;s science discovery and patented lead technology 
      SecureParser&#174; Cryptographic Splitting is transformational 
      software and meets even the most stringent security requirements of 
      military organizations, government agencies, and commercial enterprises. 
      By replacing disparate bolt-on perimeter technologies with a single 
      data-centric solution that can be applied to any digitized information, 
      SecureParser ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and continuous 
      availability of data-at-rest and data&#8211;in-motion while providing a 
      platform for secure information sharing. Because it is woven directly 
      into the fabric of the data, SecureParser protection remains with data 
      for its entire lifetime. For more information, visit www.securityfirstcorp.com.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Atlas Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATLS) 
      announced today that Chevron would acquire Atlas Energy for cash of $3.2 
      billion and assumed pro forma net debt of approximately $1.1 billion. 
      The acquisition will provide Chevron with an attractive natural gas 
      resource position primarily located in southwestern Pennsylvania&#8217;s 
      Marcellus Shale. The acquisition is subject to certain Atlas Energy 
      restructuring transactions, approval by Atlas Energy shareholders and 
      regulatory clearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This acquisition is the right opportunity for Chevron,&#8221; said George L. 
      Kirkland, Chevron Vice Chairman. &#8220;We are acquiring a company that has 
      one of the premier acreage positions in the prolific Marcellus. The high 
      quality resource, competitive cost structure in the Marcellus, strong

      Gary Luquette, Chevron North America Exploration and Production 
      President said, &#8220;Atlas Energy brings to us a highly skilled team with 
      strong operating experience and established land management

      When the transaction closes, Chevron will gain Atlas Energy&#8217;s estimated 
      nine trillion cubic feet of natural gas resource, which includes 
      approximately 850 billion cubic feet of proved natural gas reserves with 
      approximately 80 million cubic feet of daily natural gas production. The 
      assets in the Appalachian basin consist of 486,000 net acres of 
      Marcellus Shale; 623,000 net acres of Utica Shale; and a 49 percent 
      interest in Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC, a joint venture which owns 
      over 1,000 miles of intrastate and natural gas gathering lines servicing 
      the Marcellus. Assets in Michigan include Antrim producing assets and

      In April 2010, Atlas Energy entered a joint venture to develop its

      Limited. Under the agreement, Chevron will assume Atlas Energy&#8217;s role as 
      operator with 60 percent participation in the Marcellus joint venture, 
      under the original agreement terms between Atlas Energy and Reliance. 
      Reliance will continue to fund 75 percent of the operator&#8217;s drilling 
      costs, up to $1.4 billion.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 9 (Reuters) - U.S. banking heavyweight Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) and French peer Natixis (CNAT.PA) were close to
settling a legal row over a bond deal that highlights a wave of
spats over agreements struck before the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a London court, one trial lawyer told the court his
instructions were that the two sides will "have an executed
settlement around lunchtime".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The court was adjourned until 1400 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dispute centres around whether Natixis, which is
majority owned by French retail bank BPCE, can cancel a
transaction on three credit default swaps with Goldman, which is
claiming damages for breach of contract.

			Confio Software's Ignite 8 for Microsoft SQL Server Experiences 
      Record Growth
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Confio&#8482; Software today announced that IgniteTM for Microsoft 
      SQL Server, the company's award-winning database performance analysis 
      tool designed specifically for SQL Server DBAs, has experienced record 
      growth of nearly 400 percent since early 2009. Confio attributes this 
      growth in part to the launch of Ignite 8 for SQL Server in early 2010 
      and its ongoing commitment to the SQL Server community.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Microsoft SQL Server DBA community has responded well to Ignite 8, 
      as evidenced by the enthusiasm and positive feedback we receive at 
      monthly SQL Server user groups and the dozens of SQL Saturday events we 
      sponsor throughout the year,&#8221; said Don Bergal, COO of Confio Software. 
      "We have been rewarded with rapidly escalating use of our product, and 
      we are proud to support the SQL Server community in return."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ignite 8 for Microsoft SQL Server helps DBAs, developers and DBA 
      managers identify, analyze, and resolve the most complex and costly 
      performance problems affecting applications and users depending on 
      Microsoft SQL Server. Ignite 8 goes beyond basic server health metrics 
      to build a complete SQL Server performance picture using response-time 
      analysis and historical trend analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since implementing Ignite 8 for Microsoft SQL Server, we now have both 
      real-time analysis of our database response time as well as server 
      health statistics,&#8221; said Rodney Dauphin, Regional IT Manager at Infor. 
      &#8220;By having this multi-layered approach we can instantly analyze the 
      wait-times so we can locate and fix virtually any bottleneck in the 
      system.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SQL Server DBAs, developers and database managers interested in learning 
      more about Ignite 8 for SQL Server are encouraged to visit Confio 
      Software's booth (#402) at PASS Summit 2010, Nov. 8-11 at the Washington 
      State Convention  Trade Center. Confio will be 'turning up the heat' on 
      SQL Server performance with a Char-Broil&#174; Red&#174; infrared grill grand 
      prize giveaway and other prizes for winners of Confio&#8217;s own Cornhole 
      game (everyone's favorite BBQ game).

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AFP Annual Conference&#8212;Despite all the value that hedging 
      provides, there is still a broad-based misperception on how hedges are 
      supposed to perform, says Reval (www.reval.com), 
      the leading corporate financial risk management solutions provider, 
      which will be presenting &#8220;Best Practices in Risk Management,&#8221; with 
      industry leaders Visa and Ford on Tuesday, November 9 from 8:30 am to 
      9:30 am CST at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center. Corporate 
      treasurers will learn best practice approaches to risk management from 
      exposure capture through performance measurement and hear what their 
      peers say they do&#8212;or don&#8217;t do&#8212;to benchmark hedge performance, when Reval 
      reveals the results of its 2010 Risk Benchmarking Survey.

      Millard Lumber Implements Virsto Software to Put Their Microsoft Hyper-V 
      Environment into Hyper Drive
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Virsto One improves storage capacity utilization and delivers 
      performance and management benefits
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tech&#8226;Ed Europe 2010 booth E4:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Virsto&#8482; 
      Software, an innovator in storage solutions for virtual servers, 
      today announced that Millard Lumber, an Omaha, Nebraska-based 
      construction products and services company, has implemented Virsto 
      One&#8482; to create a high performance, flexible, and cost-efficient 
      storage solution based on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V 
      virtualization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The results speak for themselves,&#8221; said Chris Routhe, information 
      technology director for Millard Lumber. &#8220;By deploying Virsto One with 
      Hyper-V, we were able to immediately cut our storage capacity 
      consumption by over 65 percent while improving performance and cutting 
      out hours of administrative time each week.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Virsto provides an easy-to-deploy software solution that can be used in 
      Microsoft Hyper-V environments, implementing a highly efficient virtual 
      storage architecture that offers potential performance gains of up to 3x 
      or more, a reduction of storage consumption by up to 90 percent, and the 
      ability to create high performance virtual hard disk (VHD) snapshots in 
      under a tenth of a second. Compatible with any block storage hardware, 
      Virsto One is managed through a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) 
      snap-in and provides a number of advanced management features, such as 
      virtual hard disk (VHD) files larger than 2 terabytes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Virsto installed quickly and easily, and its advantages were 
      immediately apparent,&#8221; continued Routhe. &#8220;The fact that it allowed us to 
      thin-provision our VHD files without any decrease in performance will 
      save us a bundle on storage hardware.&#8221; Virsto effectively delivers the 
      performance advantages of fixed disks with the storage capacity savings 
      of dynamic disks, a feature that was particularly important to Millard 
      Lumber.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Virsto Software has been working with Microsoft to help customers lower 
      storage costs while improving performance for their virtualization 
      infrastructure,&#8221; said Dai Vu, director of solutions marketing in the 
      Windows Server and Cloud division at Microsoft Corp. &#8220;With the addition 
      of Virsto Software, enterprise customers running Windows Server 2008 R2 
      Hyper-V can lower total cost of ownership while reaping the benefits of 
      a high performance, enterprise-class virtualization solution."

			About Virsto One
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most data storage technologies deployed with virtual servers were not 
      designed specifically for virtualization, and were built based on 
      assumptions that are true for physical servers but not for virtual data 
      centers. Virsto One is designed to increase the agility of storage in 
      virtual environments and help users take advantage of the opportunities 
      native to virtualization. Supporting Microsoft Hyper-V, Virsto One is 
      architected to be storage- agnostic and enable users to virtualize 
      storage-intensive workloads, maximize consolidation of server and 
      storage hardware, reduce storage management complexity and significantly 
      reduce overall storage costs.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday rejected Goldman Sachs Group Inc's bid to throw out a record $20.6 million (12.8 million pounds) arbitration award involving the now-defunct Bayou hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan granted a request by unsecured creditors of Bayou Group LLC to confirm the award, which was made in June by an arbitration panel of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creditors had accused a Goldman (GS.N) unit that cleared trades for Bayou of ignoring signs of fraud at the Connecticut hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayou was run by Samuel Israel, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence after pleading guilty in 2005 to defrauding investors out of roughly $450 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's significant," said Ross Intelisano, a partner at Rich  Intelisano LLP, representing the creditors. "It confirms the largest arbitration award ever rendered against Goldman, and provides a significant recovery for investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman Ed Canaday declined to comment. It was not immediately clear whether Goldman plans an appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said he will issue a opinion to explain his reasons for upholding the award.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the award stands, it could increase the requirements that Wall Street banks set before clearing trades for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In court papers, Goldman called the legal foundation for the arbitration award "demonstrably wrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the law is "crystal clear" that it cannot be liable for money that Bayou deposited into and shuffled among accounts at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP v. Official Unsecured Creditors' Committee of Bayou Group LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-05622.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel.

			Wyse Launches New Family of Cloud PCs &#8211; Ready for Microsoft Windows 7 
      with Software Assurance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Combination of Wyse Hardware, Wyse Streaming Manager and Bundled 
      Microsoft Licensing Brings Cloud Computing Benefits to PC-based Customers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse Technology, the global leader in cloud client computing, today 
      announced another alternative to the traditional PC with a new family of Cloud 
      PCs &#8211; specially designed diskless PCs that get their Windows OS, 
      applications and data from a private cloud, rather than a local HDD, 
      providing significant benefits in TCO, management and security over 
      traditional desktops. This new family comes packaged with a Windows 7 
      license, and Microsoft Software Assurance eligibility, streamlining 
      installation, licensing, and updates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse Cloud PCs provide an alternative to the traditional PC, utilizing 
      cloud computing concepts to eliminate the local HDD in favor of 
      server-based storage, providing the ability to run high-performance 
      software on the desktop, but with security, manageability, energy use, 
      and reduced TCO typically associated with a thin client.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse Cloud PCs are also an ideal client option for desktop 
      virtualization environments, where some applications must run on the 
      local desktop for compatibility or performance, and all others on the 
      VDI server. Wyse's inclusion of the Microsoft Windows 7 license makes 
      these devices eligible for Microsoft Software Assurance, eliminating the 
      need for an additional Microsoft VDA license. "We appreciate Wyse's use 
      of the benefits of Microsoft Software Assurance as an integral part of 
      the implementation of the Cloud PC solution," said Eddie O&#8217;Brien, 
      Microsoft VP US OEM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse Cloud PCs are designed to work with enterprise streaming software 
      in the private cloud, such as Wyse Streaming Manager. Wyse WSM requires 
      only minimal server hardware to deliver OS, applications and content, 
      eliminating the pains associated with managing and securing PCs with 
      local hard disks. Cloud PCs receive their Microsoft Windows 7 streamed 
      by WSM directly from the network on every boot, ensuring total security 
      and manageability of the devices and the work environment. User data is 
      stored in the datacenter, avoiding common data loss scenarios and virus 
      propagation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new Cloud PC models include the Wyse R00L and Wyse R00LE, which both 
      include bundled Microsoft licensing. These models provide a high 
      performance environment while maintaining low power consumption of less 
      than 15 watts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "As virtualization at the desktop continues to take hold, Wyse continues 
      to bring new thinking to the table," said Eddie O'Brien, Vice President 
      US OEM at Microsoft. "The new R00L and R00LE cloud PCs are an innovative 
      solution for Microsoft's enterprise customers looking for a full Windows 
      client experience while gaining many benefits of cloud computing 
      concepts."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Cloud PCs take the simplicity and energy efficiency of PC desktops to 
      new levels and demonstrate our continuing innovation in addressing the 
      needs of our customers," said Param Desai, Sr. Director, Product 
      Management at Wyse. "As a market leader in delivering smart, green, 
      cloud-oriented virtual clients, the addition of Cloud PCs with bundled 
      Microsoft licensing&#160;will further enhance&#160;the already rich portfolio&#160;of 
      Wyse solutions available globally."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Availability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse R00L, Wyse R00LE, and other Cloud PCs are available immediately.

			Wyse Extends Market Leadership in Cloud Client Computing with 
      Multiplatform Support for RDP 7.1 with Microsoft RemoteFX
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wyse to Deliver Day One Support for Microsoft-Based Remote Desktop 
      Protocol
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wyse 
      Technology, the global leader in cloud client computing, today 
      featured its support for RDP 7.1 with Microsoft RemoteFX at Microsoft 
      Tech Ed Europe 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RemoteFX from Microsoft enhances the remote desktop experience for users 
      that connect to virtual and session-based desktops and applications over 
      a network. With RemoteFX, users will be able to leverage server 
      resources for high fidelity graphics and audio on their virtual 
      workspace from a broad range of client devices including very simple, 
      low-cost thin client devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft RemoteFX will be supported on Wyse thin clients based on 
      Wyse-enhanced Windows Embedded Standard 7 and Windows Embedded Standard 
      2009, as well as the upcoming Windows Embedded Compact 7 platform, 
      enabling a rich experience for end users. The support of Wyse devices 
      for RemoteFX helps to increase worker efficiency by quickly and securely 
      connecting remote workers with the applications they need through a 
      simple Web connection. These workers will have an immersive remote 
      desktop experience, with improved manageability, security, and reduced 
      energy consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse thin clients based on Windows Embedded Standard 7 deliver the 
      power, familiarity and reliability of the popular Windows 7 operating 
      system with support for Microsoft SCCM-based management and the latest 
      RDP 7 technologies, in a virtual desktop and cloud computing ready 
      appliance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse is also adding support for Microsoft RDP 7 on its popular Wyse 
      ThinOS based thin clients, with the availability of Wyse ThinOS 7 
      software. ThinOS 7 includes new rich multimedia, bi-directional audio 
      and true multi-display features. Wyse ThinOS is the only purpose-built 
      advanced thin client operating system with a unique and unpublished API, 
      delivering optimized performance and manageability and built-in 
      protection from viruses, malicious software and malware.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "With the Wyse support for RDP 7.1 with Microsoft RemoteFX, customers 
      will benefit from a high fidelity, rich media experience while 
      maintaining the power, manageability and data security benefits of a VDI 
      environment across multiple client solutions devices," said Param Desai, 
      Director, Product Management at Wyse Technology. "Microsoft partners now 
      have access to end virtual desktop computing solutions by leveraging 
      Wyse's RDP-ready offerings."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "As organizations plan to deploy a centralized computing architecture 
      with virtualized or session-based desktops, IT professionals want to 
      deliver a premium user experience to connected workers," said Manlio 
      Vecchiet, director of product management at Microsoft Corp. "Microsoft 
      RemoteFX will allow remote workers to access any type of application or 
      screen content, including rich media and 3D applications, using 
      different types of devices. We are very pleased to partner with Wyse to 
      offer customer solutions today that increase the flexibility and user 
      experience of a centralized desktop environment."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Forrester Research, Inc.: "Beginning in 2010 but 
      flourishing over the long term, the 'corporate desktop' will no longer 
      be a physical machine but a virtual image that users will access from 
      whatever device is most convenient at that time in that particular 
      location. And users will be able to complete all of their activities 
      (work and personal) from the same device without security 
      compromises&#8230;Looking ahead, Forrester predicts broader, industrywide 
      adoption in 2010 as IT managers increasingly view client virtualization 
      as the future of the corporate PC."1

&lt;p&gt;  GHENT, BELGIUM, Nov 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 

Ablynx [Euronext Brussels: ABLX] today announced that it is now eligible
for a milestone payment of $3 million as a result of the initiation by
Pfizer of a new Phase I clinical study in healthy volunteers for a second
Nanobody (PF-05230905) targeting tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha).

    Pfizer's lead anti-TNF-alpha Nanobody, ATN-103, is currently in a Phase II
study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Pfizer has completed
recruitment for the Phase II study.

    Ablynx entered into an exclusive research collaboration and license
agreement in November 2006 with Wyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer. As
part of the agreement, Pfizer now owns the exclusive worldwide development
and commercialisation rights to the anti-TNF-alpha Nanobody programme.
This deal has a potential value to Ablynx of $212.5 million in up-fronts
and milestone payments. Ablynx will now have earned a total of $10
million in milestone payments from Pfizer. In addition, Ablynx is
eligible to receive royalties on product sales.

    Dr Edwin Moses, CEO and Chairman of Ablynx commented: "Pfizer's decision
to advance a second anti-TNF-alpha Nanobody into the clinic underscores
the importance and potential of this programme. We are very pleased with
the progress made in this TNF-alpha partnership, and we continue to work
with Pfizer to discover additional anti-TNF-alpha Nanobodies which could
have important therapeutic applications. Pfizer is well placed to
maximize the value of these Nanobody programmes based on their proven
success in the TNF-alpha field and their significant biologics expertise.
We would anticipate the study to be completed by the second quarter of
2011. There are now five Nanobodies in clinical development."

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Whether or not Rickie Fowler clinches his maiden PGA Tour title in this week's Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista, the 21-year-old American can reflect on a golden rookie season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six top-10 finishes in 27 starts have made him a leading contender for rookie of the year honors while enhancing his status as one of the game's most exciting young talents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've had a pretty good year without the win," Fowler told reporters on Wednesday on the eve of the season-ending event. "Obviously if I'm in contention and have a chance on Sunday, it would be a bonus if I could get myself in there and win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That would be a great way to cap off the year and would definitely fill that empty space that is in there. But other than that, it's been a great year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highly regarded by his peers well before he turned professional last year, Fowler has twice finished second on the 2010 PGA Tour, at the Phoenix Open and the Memorial tournament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However he has been trumped by his main rival in the chase for rookie of the year, Northern Irishman Rory McIlroy, who claimed his first tour victory at the Quail Hollow Championship in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know it's kind of come down to Rory and I," Fowler said. "I haven't really worried about it too much. I've been focusing on playing and I've been traveling a whole lot for me to think about it too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fowler has been one of the most traveled players on the PGA Tour in recent weeks, playing six of the last seven events in countries ranging from Malaysia to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm feeling all right and I've been catching up on a little bit of sleep the last couple of nights," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've played a lot more this year than I've planned on. Playing well early got me into a lot more events that I wasn't expecting to be in, so the biggest thing for me is making sure I've stayed rested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six previous winners of the Disney Classic will tee off in Thursday's opening round on the hosting Magnolia and Palm courses, among them American Davis Love III and Fijian Vijay Singh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's champion Stephen Ames of Canada is, however, a notable absentee this week due to a lingering back injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Arlington, Texas; Editing by Frank Pingue)&lt;/p&gt;

      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it 
      earned $15.5 million, or basic net income per share of $1.69, on net 
      sales of $395.4 million for the third quarter of 2010, compared to net 
      income of $15.4 million, or basic net income per share of $1.68, on net 
      sales of $374.6 million for the third quarter of 2009. The results for 
      the third quarter of 2010 included $1.9 million of after-tax gains ($3.1 
      million on a pre-tax basis) due to mark-to-market adjustments on fuel 
      and aluminum hedges, $.2 million of after-tax gains ($.3 million on a 
      pre-tax basis) from additional insurance recoveries on assets lost or 
      damaged due to the Nashville, Tennessee area flood, and $1.7 million of 
      after-tax gains related to changes in reserves for uncertain tax 
      positions. The results for the third quarter of 2009 included $.6 
      million of after-tax gains ($.9 million on a pre-tax basis) due to 
      mark-to-market adjustments on fuel and aluminum hedges, and $5.4 million 
      of after-tax gains related to changes in reserves for uncertain tax 
      positions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $12.0 million in the third 
      quarter of 2010, or comparable basic net income per share of $1.31,

			(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow 
      investors to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business 
      trends for the third quarters of 2010 and 2009. Management uses this 
      information to review results excluding items that are not necessarily 
      indicative of ongoing results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company earned $32.2 million, or basic net income per share of 
      $3.51, on net sales of $1.16 billion for the first nine months of 2010, 
      compared to net income of $36.1 million, or basic net income per share 
      of $3.94, on net sales of $1.09 billion for the first nine months of 
      2009. The results for the first nine months of 2010 included $2.7 
      million of after-tax losses ($4.5 million on a pre-tax basis) due to 
      mark-to-market adjustments on fuel and aluminum hedges, $.5 million of 
      after-tax gains ($.9 million on a pre-tax basis) from the impact of the 
      Nashville flood, a $.5 million increase in tax expense due to the change 
      in tax law eliminating the tax deduction once available for Medicare 
      Part D subsidies, and $1.7 million of after-tax gains related to changes 
      in reserves for uncertain tax positions. The results for the first nine 
      months of 2009 included $5.0 million of after-tax gains ($8.2 million on 
      a pre-tax basis) due to mark-to-market adjustments on fuel and aluminum 
      hedges and $7.1 million of after-tax gains related to changes in 
      reserves for uncertain tax positions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $33.3 million in the first 
      nine months of 2010, or comparable basic net income per share of $3.63, 
      versus $24.2 million in the first nine months of 2009, or comparable 
      basic net income per share of $2.64. The following table reconciles 
      reported GAAP net income and comparable net income and basic net income 
      per share for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009:

      trends for the first nine months of 2010 and 2009. Management uses this

      J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, &#8220;We are very pleased 
      with our performance thus far in 2010. Despite continued high 
      unemployment in most of our franchise markets, we have seen strong 
      growth on both a top-line and comparable bottom-line basis. Our 
      employees have done an excellent job of providing the world&#8217;s best 
      brands to our customers and consumers, and execution throughout the 
      business is strong and continues to improve.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      William B. Elmore, President and COO, added, &#8220;We are especially pleased 
      with the increased activity we are seeing in our On-Premise business, 
      which is perhaps the best barometer of the strength of our brands. Our 
      price/package/channel strategies and our continuous improvement efforts 
      have collectively driven very strong marketplace and financial results.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Cautionary Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Included in this news release and other information that we make 
      publicly available from time to time are forward-looking management 
      comments and other statements that reflect management&#8217;s current outlook 
      for future periods.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			These statements and expectations are based on currently available 
      competitive, financial and economic data along with our operating plans, 
      and are subject to future events and uncertainties that could cause 
      anticipated events not to occur or actual results to differ materially 
      from historical or anticipated results.
			Among the events or 
      uncertainties which could adversely affect future periods are: lower 
      than expected selling pricing resulting from increased marketplace 
      competition; changes in how significant customers market or promote our 
      products; changes in public and consumer preferences related to 
      nonalcoholic beverages; unfavorable changes in the general economy; 
      miscalculation of our need for infrastructure investment; our inability 
      to meet requirements under bottling contracts; material changes in the 
      performance requirements for marketing funding support or our inability 
      to meet such requirements; decreases from historic levels of marketing 
      funding support; changes in The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s and other beverage 
      companies&#8217; levels of advertising, marketing and spending on brand 
      innovation; the inability of our aluminum can or plastic bottle 
      suppliers to meet our purchase requirements; our inability to offset 
      higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased 
      bottle/can sales volume or reduced expenses; sustained increases in fuel 
      costs or our inability to secure adequate supplies of fuel; sustained 
      increases in workers&#8217; compensation, employment practices and vehicle 
      accident costs; sustained increases in the cost of employee benefits; 
      product liability claims or product recalls; technology failures; 
      changes in interest rates; adverse changes in our credit rating (whether 
      as a result of our operations or prospects or as a result of those of 
      The Coca-Cola Company or other bottlers in the Coca-Cola system); 
      changes in legal contingencies; legislative changes effecting our 
      distribution and packaging; additional taxes resulting from tax audits; 
      natural disasters and unfavorable weather; issues surrounding labor 
      relations; recent bottler litigation; our use of estimates and 
      assumptions; public policy challenges regarding the sale of soft drinks 
      in schools; the impact of recent volatility in the financial markets to 
      access the credit markets; legislative changes that could affect 
      distribution and packaging; the impact of recently announced and 
      completed acquisitions of bottlers by their franchisors; obesity and 
      other health concerns may reduce demand for the Company&#8217;s products; 
      global climate change or legal, regulatory or market response to such 
      change; ability to change distribution methods and business practices 
      could be negatively affected by bottler disputes; and the concentration 
      of our capital stock ownership.
			The forward-looking statements in 
      this news release should be read in conjunction with the more detailed 
      descriptions of the above factors located in our Annual Report on Form 
      10-K for the year ended January 3, 2010 under Part I, Item 1A &#8220;Risk 
      Factors&#8221; as well as those additional factors we may describe from time 
      to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
			Except as required by law, the Company undertakes no obligation to 
      update or revise any forward-looking statements contained in this 
      release as a result of new information or future events or developments.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on Harbinger assets, redemption date)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Nov 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
plans to remove money from hedge fund manager Philip Falcone's
flagship portfolio, a person familiar with the matter said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When asked about Goldman's plan to pull the money, Falcone
responded coolly, calling it "a non event" in an email to
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomberg first reported the New York-based investment bank
planned to pull out $120 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Falcone's once high-flying Harbinger Capital Partners has
lost 16 percent this year, investors in the New York-based fund
firm said. Falcone's Special Situations Fund is off about 11
percent, the investors said. The losses rank Harbinger as one
of the year's worst-performing hedge fund firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the end of September Harbinger managed roughly $9
billion and investors had until Oct. 1 to file redemption
notices to get money back by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the last months, several investors expressed growing
concern about the poor performance of several Harbinger funds.
Some also said they were uneasy with Harbinger's ownership of
an upstart Internet company called LightSquared, which plans to
use satellites and an array of land-based cell tower to bring
broadband service to every corner of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Harbinger has some ties to the bank as Falcone hired Omar
Asali -- who previously co-headed Goldman's Hedge Fund
Strategies -- in 2009.

			Teletouch Supports Kidd&#8217;s Kids 2010 Trip To Disney World
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Teletouch Communications, Inc. (OTCBB: TLLE), a premier U.S. wireless 
      services, cellular, consumer electronics and public safety equipment 
      provider, today announced that it is honored and humbled to once again 
      support the Kraddick Foundation dba Kidd&#8217;s Kids annual trip to Walt 
      Disney World&#174; for terminally and chronically ill children. Founded in 
      1991 by nationally syndicated morning show personality, Kidd Kraddick, 
      host of Kidd Kraddick In The Morning&#174;, Kidd&#8217;s Kids mission is making a 
      difference in the lives of children with special medical needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I founded Kidd's Kids with the hope of making a difference in the lives 
      of terminally and chronically ill children. Each year, Kidd's Kids 
      offers five amazing days of suspended reality to children whose lives 
      have been ravaged by disease. Kidd's Kids children and their families 
      are given the chance to experience the exuberance of being &#8216;normal.&#8217; 
      That is the gift that we all offer by supporting the Kidd's Kids 
      organization,&#8221; said Kraddick.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kraddick continued, &#8220;As a 501(3)(c) organization, we work hard 
      throughout the year to raise the funds necessary to send these special 
      kids on an all-expenses paid, fun-filled, vacation to Walt Disney World 
      in Florida. Most of our funding comes from donations made by listeners 
      to the Kidd Kraddick In The Morning radio show, corporate sponsors, and 
      various fundraising events. We very much appreciate the financial and 
      technical support being provided to us by Teletouch-Hawk Electronics 
      again this year.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Three years ago, we were asked by Kidd and his team to provide 
      Push-To-Talk cellular equipment and services for this very special trip, 
      so that the families, medical team and Kidd&#8217;s volunteer staff could stay 
      instantly connected anywhere, anytime at Disney World,&#8221; stated T. A. 
      "Kip" Hyde, Jr., President, Chief Operating Officer and Director of 
      Teletouch. &#8220;Our staff jumped at the chance to help, and we are so 
      pleased this year to not only provide full communications support, 
      including technical staff on location, but also new digital cameras for 
      each of the families to record and remember this special time. We are 
      humbled to be a part of this wonderful program and to support these 
      beautiful children and their families.&#8221;

			About Kraddick Foundation dba Kidd's Kids
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Founded in 1991, the Kraddick Foundation dba Kidd&#8217;s Kids is a 501(c)(3) 
      organization, founded by nationally syndicated morning show personality 
      Kidd Kraddick. Kidd&#8217;s Kids was founded on the premise of making a 
      difference in the lives of children with special medical needs. Kraddick 
      Foundation dba Kidd&#8217;s Kids is certified by the state of Texas and 
      registered with the appropriate state departments of each syndicated 
      affiliate market. Children selected for the Kidd&#8217;s Kids trip are between 
      the ages of 5 and 12, suffer from a chronic or terminal illness, and/or 
      are physically challenged or have a catastrophic impairment due to an 
      accident/birth defect. The child must also reside in one of the Kidd 
      Kraddick In The Morning radio show listening areas and demonstrate a 
      financial need. Each child selected attends the trip along with their 
      family members who reside in the same household, including parent(s) or 
      legal guardian(s) and any siblings that are between 5 and 16 years of 
      age. Due to the generosity of Kidd&#8217;s listeners and corporate donations, 
      between 40 and 50 families now participate in the trip to Walt Disney 
      World&#174; in Florida each year. The Kidd Kraddick In The Morning show 
      originates in Dallas, Texas and can be heard in over 80 markets across 
      the country. For more information on Kidd&#8217;s Kids mission, and additional 
      support opportunities, go to www.kiddskids.com.

      Research and Markets: US TV Program Production and Distribution Report: 
      500 Companies Such as 20th Century Fox and Disney-ABC with Combined 
      Annual Revenue of $55 Billion
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/c4cce1/tv_program_product) 
      has announced the addition of the "TV 
      Program Production and Distribution" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brief Excerpt from Industry Overview Chapter
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US TV program production and distribution industry includes about 
      500 companies with combined annual revenue of $55 billion. Major 
      companies are NBC Universal, CBS Television Studios, Disney-ABC, 
      Twentieth Century Fox Television, Warner Bros Television Group, and Sony 
      Pictures Television. The industry is highly concentrated: the 50 largest 
      companies account for about 80 percent of industry revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Broadcasting of TV programs is covered in the TV Cable, Pay  Broadcast 
      Networks profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer leisure activity and the general economy drive demand. The 
      profitability of individual companies depends on the marketability of 
      products, mainly their potential to attract advertising revenue for TV 
      networks. Large companies have advantages in financing, distribution, 
      on-staff creative and technical talent, and multiple-year contracts with 
      key performers and directors of popular programs. Small companies can 
      compete successfully by focusing on special topics, niche audiences, or 
      nonmainstream TV channels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major products and services are the production and distribution of TV 
      programs, commercials, and related products, like DVDs. Program 
      production types (genres) include TV movies; dramas; situational 
      comedies (sitcoms); reality, game, and talk shows; and documentaries, 
      children's, art, sports, and news programs. Most programs are scripted, 
      though some genres are largely unscripted, including talk and reality 
      shows. First-run programs typically earn less than subsequent releases 
      for reruns (repeats); long off-network runs (syndication); and other 
      media like DVD.

&lt;p&gt;  PALO ALTO, CA, Nov 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Stephen Jones, former Chief Marketing Officer of The Coca-Cola Company,
and former CEO of both the Minute Maid company and upstart soda
phenomenon, Jones Soda, will present a keynote address at the 2010 CMO
Council CMO Summit, being held in San Jose, California on December 9,
2010. Jones will share the high points and challenges of steering the
largest brand in the world, as well has his journey from being a CMO to
the role of CEO. 

    A true global marketing leader, Jones started his Coke marketing career
in Canada as brand manager of Sprite, moved to Atlanta to be Sr. brand
manager of Diet Coke for the US market, before moving to London to be
Marketing Manager of Coca-Cola Great Britain. He eventually moved his
family to Tokyo where he held various marketing and operations roles
before becoming President of Coca-Cola Japan Company, Coca-Cola's single
largest profit contributor. Jones returned the US to become President of
The Minute Maid Company, the largest juice company in the world. After
leaving Coke, and after forming a management group that specialized in
working with private equity groups, he became CEO of Jones Soda Co., a
boutique soft drink company, where he successfully led the turnaround of
the struggling company. Today, Jones helms Revolution, an Atlanta based
firm of innovation growth strategist, working with clients including
Colgate, Pfizer, S.C. Johnson, and GE MABE.

    "Stephen Jones represents a marketer who has undertaken huge,
transformational programs, with the goal of driving global business
growth and opportunity through local activation and engagement," said
Donovan Neale-May, executive director of the CMO Council. "And, having
taken the step from CMO to CEO, Jones brings a new perspective on how the
mindset shifts from the marketing to the more operationally focused. His
insights on taking that next step will be invaluable to marketers looking
to advance their roles within the C-Suite and eventually make that leap
to the top office." 

    The CMO Summit will gather keynote speakers and panelists from across the
C-Suite to share in their experiences, insights and best practices for
optimizing three key areas of collaboration: Customer Experience,
Marketing Effectiveness and Operational Efficiency. The full-day event
will include keynote addresses from C-Suite leaders who will shed light
on the needs and requirements of senior management and boards on today's
CMO. Brands including Accenture, Chrysler, Prudential, Juniper Networks,
Taleo, Denny's, Motorola, AIG, Lenovo, Wells Fargo, ADP, Papa Murphy's,
Gannett, Nokia, FMC, Farmers Insurance, SAP, 24-Hour Fitness, Orbitz, and
Wrigley's are already confirmed to engage at the event.

			Chevron Acquiring Atlas for $4.3 Billion
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. energy behemoth Chevron Corp. (NYSE: CVX) 
      has agreed to acquire natural gas producer Atlas Energy Inc. (Nasdaq: 
      ATLS) for about $4.3 
      billion in stock, cash and debt. The transaction, the most recent by an 
      energy company to expand in natural gas following ExxonMobil Corp. (NYSE: 
      XOM) and Royal 
      Dutch Shell Plc. (NYSE: RDS.A), 
      is subject to certain Atlas Energy restructuring initiatives, approval 
      by Atlas Energy shareholders and regulatory clearance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As per the deal, Atlas shareholders would get $38.25 in cash and more 
      than 41 million units of Atlas Pipeline Holdings L.P. (NYSE: AHD) 
      &#8211; 64% owned by Atlas Energy &#8211; for each share they hold, representing a 
      total value of $3.2 billion. At Atlas&#8217; Monday&#8217;s closing stock price of 
      $31.72, the deal values Atlas&#8217; shares at $43.34 each, a 37% premium. 
      Additionally, Chevron will assume $1.1 billion in debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pittsburgh-based Atlas Energy is one of the leading independent natural 
      gas producers in the Appalachian and Michigan Basins. The company has 
      amassed a large acreage position (486,000 net acres) in the prolific 
      Marcellus Shale play, a key natural gas drilling area located throughout 
      Western Pennsylvania and much of the Appalachian Basin. Overall, Atlas 
      Energy controls some 850 billion cubic feet of proven natural gas 
      reserves, with approximately 80 million cubic feet of daily natural gas 
      output.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We see the Atlas Energy transaction, which will also provide Chevron 
      with a 60% operated interest in a joint venture with India&#8217;s Reliance 
      Industries, as part of Chevron&#8217;s long-term strategic plan to focus on 
      growth in its gas business. In line with other supermajors, Chevron sees 
      natural gas playing an important part in its future. The company&#8217;s 
      targeted volume growth (1% through 2014 and by 4 &#8211; 5% in the three years 
      after that) will be achieved primarily by new natural gas projects. 
      Chevron expects natural gas to represent 41% of total volumes by 2017, 
      up from the current share of 31%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      San Ramon, California-based Chevron is one of the largest publicly 
      traded oil and gas firms in the world, based on proved reserves. It is 
      engaged in oil and gas exploration and production, refining and 
      marketing of petroleum products, manufacturing of chemicals and other 
      energy-related businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron shares currently retain a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a 
      short-term Hold rating. We are also maintaining our long-term Neutral 
      recommendation on the stock.

			Microsoft&#8217;s Revolutionary Arc Touch Mouse Uses Cypress CapSense&#174; 
      Solution To Implement Touch Scroll Strip
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Mouse is World&#8217;s First to Flatten for Portability and Pop Up for 
      Comfort
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cypress Semiconductor Corp. (Nasdaq:CY) today announced that Microsoft&#8217;s 
      revolutionary new Arc Touch Mouse uses the Cypress CapSense&#174; 
      solution for the touch scroll strip that lets users navigate documents 
      and Web pages without using the on-screen scroll bar. The CapSense-based 
      scroll wheel delivers a smooth, comfortable navigation experience as 
      opposed to the jerky scrolling that some mechanical wheels provide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cypress is the worldwide leader in capacitive touch-sensing with the 
      industry&#8217;s broadest portfolio. Its PSoC&#174;-based CapSense devices offer 
      unmatched flexibility and integration, addressing a broad range of 
      designs from complex, feature-rich applications to simple button 
      replacement. The easy-to-use solution offers leading noise immunity and 
      water-resistance for reliable operation. More information about the 
      CapSense solution is available at www.cypress.com/go/capsense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Arc Touch Mouse was designed to deliver ultimate portability to 
      easily slip into a bag, purse or pocket. It also goes from curved to 
      flat with one simple movement. The Arc Touch Mouse&#8217;s touch strip enables 
      consumers to scroll with a flick of a finger. Using the CapSense 
      solution, the strip corresponds to each position and velocity change to 
      give users accurate, controlled scrolling no matter how fast or slow the 
      movement. The strip also has three tap &#8220;buttons&#8221; for added 
      functionality: page up, page down and the middle click area, which is 
      reprogrammable for whatever mouse function the user needs most. The Arc 
      Touch Mouse is equipped with BlueTrack Technology, letting consumers 
      track on virtually any surface. Two AAA batteries give the Arc Touch 
      Mouse more than six months of battery life, and the two-color battery 
      life indicator lets people know when the power is running low.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is an exciting new application for CapSense,&#8221; said Dirk Franklin, 
      director of Cypress&#8217;s CapSense Business Unit. &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to play a 
      role in revolutionizing the mouse with CapSense.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About CapSense
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cypress's CapSense touch-sensing solution has replaced 3.5 billion 
      mechanical buttons in mobile handsets, laptops, consumer electronics, 
      white goods, automotive applications, and virtually any system that has 
      a mechanical button or switch, making Cypress the industry touch-sensing 
      leader. The CapSense portfolio, the industry's broadest and most 
      integrated, enhances industrial design and reliability with the most 
      noise-immune and water tolerant capacitive touch-sensing interfaces, 
      including proximity sensing where direct touch is not required. CapSense 
      proximity sensing, with its industry-leading detection range up to 25 
      cm, provides power savings by activating an interface only when needed 
      while further enhancing industrial designs by only exposing interfaces 
      when necessary. Based on the PSoC programmable system-on-chip 
      architecture and the PSoC Designer&#8482; Embedded-System Design Tool, users 
      complete CapSense designs quickly and easily using pre-configured and 
      verified "user modules" and real-time sensor tuning and monitoring.

      A new animal health research collaboration aimed at finding better ways 
      of preventing and managing disease and advancing sustainable animal 
      agriculture and welfare has been announced by Pfizer Animal Health and

			SharePoint Users to Expand Business to Global Markets Using New 
      Capabilities from Lingotek Collaborative Translation PlatformTM 
      &#8211; Inside solution, Combining Machine Translation, Community Translation 
      and Management Tools
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Lingotek, 
      the leader in collaborative translation solutions, today announced they 
      have created a Lingotek - Inside solution for Microsoft SharePoint 
      application using Lingotek&#8217;s award-winning
			Collaborative 
      Translation PlatformTM. Through this integration, all 
      Lingotek platform features can be embedded directly in SharePoint 
      through a robust set of APIs, enabling SharePoint users to translate 
      huge amounts of content in order to better connect with their staffs, 
      partners and communities across the globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SharePoint lets people work together in ways that are most effective for 
      them by providing great collaboration tools that anyone can use to share 
      ideas. However,&#160;prior to the Lingotek Inside solution, language 
      translation was hard with SharePoint, making it difficult for users to 
      collaborate and share translated content. Lingotek - Inside SharePoint 
      rounds out SharePoint&#8217;s offerings by allowing users to efficiently 
      translate content while helping them to expand globally and reach new 
      markets cost-effectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The mission of SharePoint is to facilitate collaboration and 
      communication for enterprises,&#8221; said Owen Allen, former Microsoft 
      SharePoint ISV partner marketing manager. &#8220;Implementing Lingotek&#8217;s 
      Inside solution strengthens that mission. Users are able to access 
      secure, accurate and up-to-date translated content, allowing them to 
      collaborate and communicate without barriers to colleagues, customers, 
      partners and prospects around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SharePoint is known worldwide by the enterprise community as a 
      collaboration powerhouse,&#8221; Lingotek CEO Robert Vandenberg said. &#8220;We are 
      excited to bring the Lingotek Inside solution to SharePoint users who 
      can directly translate content within SharePoint and, consequently, 
      connect with an increased number of global communities critical to the 
      growth of their businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With Lingotek&#8217;s platform, content managers can upload and edit documents 
      easily as well as invite and connect with community members who can not 
      only view and contribute translations but also rate the precision and 
      reliability of the translation. By combining best-in-class machine 
      translation solutions and real-time community translations, SharePoint 
      users will be able to produce &#8220;real time&#8221; volunteer translations in a 
      third amount of the time while reducing large costs organizations 
      typical handled by translation services.

			Wipro Wins Microsoft Platform Modernization Award for Sales for 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Award is in Recognition of Solutions Providing High Business 
      Value, Leveraging Microsoft Technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wipro Technologies, the Global Consulting, System Integration and 
      Outsourcing Business of Wipro Limited (NYSE:WIT) today announced that 
      Wipro has been awarded the Microsoft Platform Modernization Award for 
      Sales for 2010. The coveted award is the highest recognition for 
      technology transformation and is awarded to partners who create a 
      significant impact in the market place in transforming customer 
      applications from competing platforms to Microsoft. Wipro received the 
      award at Microsoft&#8217;s Worldwide Partner Conference earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Speaking about the award to Wipro, Larry Orecklin, VP - Enterprise Sales 
      at Microsoft said, &#8220;Wipro's significant achievement in creating a 
      winning proposition for transforming customer legacy applications to the 
      modern Microsoft application platform has been recognized through this 
      award. Our partnership with Wipro is helping our mutual customers 
      address their business challenges of reducing costs and increasing 
      agility.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This recognition brings into spotlight, our commitment to technology 
      driven business transformation for our customers. Our Microsoft 
      Technology Services has high maturity and depth of experience in the 
      area of collaboration, cloud and platform transformation. This has 
      enabled us to consistently deliver the very best value to our clients in 
      all industries.&#8221; said Srinivas Pallia, Senior Vice President and Global 
      Head, Business Technology Services, Wipro Technologies. &#8220;We believe this 
      is validated by the success we have had in delivering high business 
      impact from IT for our global clients, like Shell&#8221; said Srinivas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jerome Welch, Middleware Support Manager, Shell IT International said, 
      &#8220;Our long term partnership with Wipro has definitely helped Shell to 
      optimize operations and streamline business processes, effectively 
      leveraging middleware technology in IT. Wipro has worked with us for 
      various Microsoft Technologies (BizTalk, SSIS and Sharepoint) as part of 
      Middleware Services and Applications Support for Global Functions. Wipro 
      has consistently demonstrated high levels of business and technical 
      knowledge, creativity and delivery excellence. I congratulate them on 
      receiving this well deserved award.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wipro has developed a &#8216;Transformation Platform&#8217; in collaboration with

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) forecast rising ad sales, pricing and theme park attendance, sending its shares higher after it posted a rare quarterly earnings miss that contrasted sharply with strong performances by its peers in the media sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The entertainment conglomerate's stock climbed 2.1 percent after hours on the rosier outlook. The shares ended down 3 percent on Thursday after Disney inadvertently released its disappointing fourth quarter results before the market closed, spooking some investors. It is investigating the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, nevertheless, sounded a positive note with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current trends in our business are encouraging. We're also optimistic about our creative pipeline. Thus, we believe we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2011," said Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said ad sales in the current first quarter were pacing up double-digit percentages at both ESPN and TV stations, reflecting a stabilizing economy. It also said U.S. hotel reservations were up 5 percent in the current quarter from a year-ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wall Street had expected better fourth quarter numbers from a company that has exceeded earnings expectations in each of the past six quarters. Disney's shares have been up about 15 percent this year amid perceptions an advertising recovery was taking hold, outperforming the share performances of both Time Warner Inc (TWX.N) and News Corp, which recently posted strong profits on the advertising rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MESSY QUARTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Generally, the forward trends look good and they're entering into the sweet spot of the content and consumer product cycle. Advertising trends also look strong," said David Bank, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, noting the fourth quarter was "messy" due to a calendar shift, writedowns and other items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weak fiscal fourth-quarter revenue at Disney's media networks division -- its largest -- offset a boost from smash "Toy Story 3" in its studio unit and robust advertising sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The revenue bright spot that beat our estimate was the studios, mostly on the strength of 'Toy Story 3'" said David Joyce, analyst with Miller Tabak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower revenue at its media networks division was the result of there being one less week in the quarter than last year, and a writedown for programing. Also, sports cable channel ESPN had already recognized a significant amount of revenue from affiliates in the fiscal third quarter of this year after hitting a targeted number of key sporting events, as opposed to in the fourth quarter a year ago. That led to a lower revenue comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said ESPN recognized $354 million less deferred revenue than the period a year ago, noting the amount was equal to earnings of about 9 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another bright spot was in Disney's broadcasting division, which saw an increase in operating income driven by decreased programing and production costs at ABC and higher advertising revenues and ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Disney's fourth-quarter net income fell to $835 million, or 43 cents per share, compared with $895 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding items, Disney reported earnings of 45 cents a share.

 (Adds comment from conference call, recasts)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sue Zeidler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
forecast rising ad sales, pricing and theme park attendance,
sending its shares higher after it posted a rare quarterly
earnings miss that contrasted sharply with strong performances
by its peers in the media sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The entertainment conglomerate's stock climbed 2.1 percent
after hours on the rosier outlook. The shares ended down 3
percent on Thursday after Disney inadvertently released its
disappointing fourth quarter results before the market closed,
spooking some investors. It is investigating the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, nevertheless, sounded a positive note with
analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The current trends in our business are encouraging. We're
also optimistic about our creative pipeline. Thus, we believe
we are well positioned to deliver strong results in 2011," said
Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo on a conference call
with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said ad sales in the current first quarter were
pacing up double-digit percentages at both ESPN and TV
stations, reflecting a stabilizing economy. It also said U.S.
hotel reservations were up 5 percent in the current quarter
from a year-ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Wall Street had expected better fourth quarter numbers
from a company that has exceeded earnings expectations in each
of the past six quarters. Disney's shares have been up about 15
percent this year amid perceptions an advertising recovery was
taking hold, outperforming the share performances of both Time
Warner Inc (TWX.N) and News Corp, which recently posted strong
profits on the advertising rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MESSY QUARTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Generally, the forward trends look good and they're
entering into the sweet spot of the content and consumer
product cycle. Advertising trends also look strong," said David
Bank, analyst with RBC Capital Markets, noting the fourth
quarter was "messy" due to a calendar shift, writedowns and
other items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weak fiscal fourth-quarter revenue at Disney's media
networks division -- its largest -- offset a boost from smash
"Toy Story 3" in its studio unit and robust advertising sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The revenue bright spot that beat our estimate was the
studios, mostly on the strength of 'Toy Story 3'" said David
Joyce, analyst with Miller Tabak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lower revenue at its media networks division was the
result of there being one less week in the quarter than last
year, and a writedown for programming. Also, sports cable
channel ESPN had already recognized a significant amount of
revenue from affiliates in the fiscal third quarter of this
year after hitting a targeted number of key sporting events, as
opposed to in the fourth quarter a year ago. That led to a
lower revenue comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said ESPN recognized $354 million less deferred
revenue than the period a year ago, noting the amount was equal
to earnings of about 9 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another bright spot was in Disney's broadcasting division,
which saw an increase in operating income driven by decreased
programming and production costs at ABC and higher advertising
revenues and ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Overall, Disney's fourth-quarter net income fell to $835
million, or 43 cents per share, compared with $895 million, or
47 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding items, Disney reported earnings of 45 cents a
share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 46 cents a
share, according to ThomsonReuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total revenue fell 1 percent to $9.7 billion from $9.9
billion. Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $9.95
billion, according to ThomsonReuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at its flagship media networks arm, home to sports
cable network ESPN and broadcaster ABC, fell 7 percent to $4.4
billion. Operating income in media networks fell 18 percent to
$1.2 billion, missing analysts' forecasts for about $1.37
billion, due to programming writeoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parks and resorts revenue slipped 1 percent to $2.82
billion and operating income slid 8 percent to $316 million, as
domestic park attendance fell and it faced higher costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's shares rose to $36.60 in extended trade after
closing down 3.05 percent, or $1.13, at $35.86 on the New York

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - American journeyman Chris Stroud shrugged off shoulder pain to surge into a three-shot lead in the opening round of the weather-hit Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three weeks after having to withdraw from the final round of the Las Vegas Open, Stroud fired a sizzling 10-under-par 62 on the Palm course, one of two layouts hosting the final PGA Tour event of the season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old rattled up five birdies on each nine in a flawless display with only 22 putts to end a fog-delayed first day three strokes ahead of compatriot Roland Thatcher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're not making bogeys, man, you can just shoot some great scores," Stroud told reporters after firing his lowest score on the PGA Tour. "I'm just making a lot of putts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's all it really came down to. I didn't hit the ball that great today. I just got it in play."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Ryder Cup player Rickie Fowler was among a group of five who opened with 66s on the easier Palm layout before play was halted in fading light with 14 players on the course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroud, who has yet to win his first tour title, said he was still experiencing continual pain in his shoulder, despite having treatment on it before and after every round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's in constant pain, and usually when I wake up it's the worst," he added. "I got an MRI done in Vegas on Tuesday to double check and make sure I didn't really hurt something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said it's consistent with a minor strain slash tear, a microscopic tear, and that's it's nothing to really be concerned over. I was just happy to be able to play this week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how he felt with three rounds remaining, Stroud replied: "Physically it's the hardest. Mentally I'm great. I'm fresh and I've had two weeks off. I'm happy. My thoughts are good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is basically the first time I've ever had a physical ailment really holding me back. So every shot, you just try not to think about it and just keep rubbing it, keep it in check."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the six previous winners of the Disney Classic competing this week, Fijian Vijay Singh opened with a 69 and American Davis Love III carded a 71, each of them on the Palm course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Grapevine, Texas; Editing by Frank Pingue)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds target vs U.S. output comparison, closing share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 11 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
expects the natural gas production of its pending acquisition,
Atlas Energy ATLS.O, to grow to more than seven times current
output, or the equivalent of 100,000 barrels of oil per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive John Watson, giving no timeline for the
production growth from Atlas' Marcellus shale gas properties in
western Pennsylvania, said his company had passed up on several
shale investment opportunities over the past few years because
they did not make sense financially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've waited to get the kind of terms that would give us
the control that we wanted in the business," he told the Bank
of America Merrill Lynch Global Energy Conference on Thursday,
two days after Chevron announced the $3.2 billion Atlas deal.
[ID:nN09162177]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson's targeted level for Atlas output would represent
about 1 percent of current U.S. gas production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron expects its own overall daily oil and gas
production to grow 3 percent this year, to 2.78 million barrels
of oil equivalent, with annual growth of 1 percent projected
through 2014, and increases of 4 percent to 5 percent in the
three years after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, will make
more acquisitions in the years ahead, Watson said, while
adding, "We're not in a position where we have to do a
particular acquisition."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Questions had been raised about Chevron's shale gas
strategy ever since larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) made
shale the talk of the industry last December when it announced
its $27 billion acquisition of XTO Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The XTO deal more than doubled Exxon's U.S. gas output to
14 percent of its global oil and gas production at a time when
U.S. natural gas prices are depressed due to increased output
from Marcellus and other shale fields. Eight percent of
Chevron's global output is U.S. gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shares have suffered as a result, rising just 5
percent in 2010 versus Chevron's 12 percent gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONG-TERM DEEPWATER COMMITMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Affirming Chevron's long-term commitment to the deepwater
Gulf of Mexico, Watson said it has equity interests of 50
percent or more in the top 45 Lower Tertiary prospects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the U.S. government lifted a moratorium on
deepwater drilling imposed after the BP Plc (BP.L) blow-out in
April, and the industry is watching for activity to start
picking up again in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everything has been done to get the industry back to work,
and we expect more permits to be issued in due course," Watson
told the conference in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Ramon, California-based Chevron moved ahead last month
with a planned $7.5 billion investment in its Jack/St. Malo
facility in the Lower Tertiary trend, and Watson said a final
investment decision on the Big Foot project in the Gulf would
come by the end of this year. [ID:nN21259958]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares rose 1.1 percent to $86.09, their highest
closing level since September 2008. Exxon rose 0.9 percent.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - With Miley Cyrus' "Hannah Montana" of the air and star Demi Lovato on hiatus while she faces personal issues, a new actress is entering the Disney fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. cable network Disney Channel has greenlighted a new live-action comedy series, "Ant Farm," starring new talent China McClain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 12-year-old plays middle schooler Chyna Sparks, a musical prodigy who gets into a gifted program called Accelerated Natural Talent at the local high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with her fellow "ANTs," she must navigate the halls of a new school of older kids who are not particularly fond of grade-skipping newbies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series brings with it plenty of behind-the-scenes Disney pedigree.

			THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) today reported earnings for the 
      fiscal year and fourth quarter ended October 2, 2010. Diluted earnings 
      per share (EPS) for the year increased 15% to $2.03 from $1.76 in the 
      prior year. For the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.43 compared to $0.47 in 
      the prior-year quarter. The decrease for the quarter reflected a $0.09 
      adverse impact from a shift in the timing of recognition of previously 
      deferred revenues between the third and fourth quarters at ESPN. 
      Additionally, fiscal 2010 results for the full year and for the quarter 
      include one fewer week of operations compared to fiscal 2009 due to our 
      fiscal period end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The 2010 fiscal year was a financial and strategic success for The Walt 
      Disney Company with performance driven by great content like Toy 
      Story 3 and the way we benefited from that content across our many 
      businesses. Our fourth quarter earnings grew solidly after factoring out 
      a programming writeoff at one of our equity networks, the timing of ESPN 
      revenue recognition and the effect of one fewer week of operations this 
      year than last,&#8221; said Disney president and CEO Robert A. Iger. &#8220;With the 
      acquisition of Marvel, our brand and franchise portfolio is stronger 
      than ever and we&#8217;re confident our global growth strategy positions the 
      company well to thrive in the coming years.&#8221;

      EPS for the current year included restructuring and impairment charges 
      ($270 million), gains on the sales of investments in two television 
      services in Europe ($75 million), a gain on the sale of the Power 
      Rangers property ($43 million), and an accounting gain related to 
      the acquisition of The Disney Store Japan ($22 million), which 
      collectively had a net adverse impact of $0.04. EPS for the prior year 
      included restructuring and impairment charges ($492 million), a non-cash 
      gain in connection with the merger of Lifetime Entertainment Services

      on the sale of investments in two pay television services in Latin 
      America ($114 million), which collectively had a net adverse impact of 
      $0.06. The gains mentioned above are recorded in &#8220;Other Income&#8221; in the 
      Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding these items, EPS for the 
      year increased 14% to $2.07 from $1.82 in the prior year.

			Cable Networks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Cable Networks increased $213 million to $4.5 
      billion for the year due to growth at ESPN and the international Disney 
      Channels, partially offset by a decrease in cable equity income. The 
      increase at ESPN reflected higher affiliate and advertising revenue, 
      partially offset by higher programming and production and general and 
      administrative costs. Higher affiliate revenue was due to contractual 
      rate increases and subscriber growth, partially offset by the impact of 
      one fewer week of operations. Subscriber growth was driven by the launch 
      of a new network in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
      2009. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher 
      sold inventory. Higher programming and production costs were driven by 
      the new network in the United Kingdom, coverage of the World Cup and 
      increased contractual costs for college basketball, NFL and college 
      football programming. Higher operating income at the international 
      Disney Channels was due to increased affiliate revenue driven by 
      subscriber growth and higher advertising revenue. Decreased cable equity 
      income was driven by a $58 million charge for our share of programming 
      writeoffs at AE/Lifetime that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 
      the current year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, operating income at Cable Networks decreased by $413 
      million to $1.1 billion due to a decrease at ESPN and lower cable equity 
      income driven by the programming writeoffs at AE/Lifetime. The decrease 
      at ESPN was due to the timing of recognition of previously deferred 
      revenues, the impact of one fewer week of operations and higher 
      programming and production costs. During the quarter, ESPN recognized 
      $170 million of previously deferred revenue compared to $524 million in 
      the prior year quarter. These decreases were partially offset by higher 
      affiliate fees driven by contractual rate increases and subscriber 
      growth and increased advertising revenues due to higher sold inventory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Broadcasting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Broadcasting increased $154 million to $659 million 
      for the year driven by higher advertising revenue at the owned 
      television stations, the absence of a bad debt charge in connection with 
      the bankruptcy of a syndication customer, lower programming and 
      production costs at the ABC Television Network and an improvement in net 
      affiliate fees. Lower programming and production costs reflected cost 
      savings at news and daytime and a lower cost mix of programming in 
      primetime. These increases were partially offset by higher pension and 
      postretirement medical costs, lower domestic television syndication 
      results due to the prior-year sales of According to Jim and 
      Grey&#8217;s Anatomy and decreased advertising revenue at the ABC 
      Television Network. Decreased advertising revenue at the ABC Television 
      Network was due to lower ratings and the impact of one fewer week of 
      operations, partially offset by improved rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, operating income at Broadcasting increased $145 million 
      to $147 million driven by decreased programming and production costs at 
      the ABC Television Network, higher advertising and an improvement in net 
      affiliate fees, partially offset by higher pension and postretirement 
      medical costs. Lower programming and production costs at the ABC 
      Television Network reflected a lower cost mix of programming in 
      primetime, cost savings in daytime and news production, decreased sports 
      programming costs and the impact of one less week of operations. Higher 
      advertising revenues were driven by improved primetime ratings at the 
      ABC Television Network and growth at the owned television stations, 
      partially offset by the impact of one less week of operations. Decreased 
      revenues for the quarter reflected lower sales of ABC Studios 
      productions primarily due to the prior-year domestic syndication sales 
      of According to Jim and Grey&#8217;s Anatomy. This revenue 
      decline was largely offset by reduced production cost amortization 
      including the impact of a lower average production cost amortization 
      rate for productions sold in the current quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parks and Resorts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parks and Resorts revenues for the year increased 1% to $10.8 billion 
      and segment operating income decreased 7% to $1.3 billion. For the 
      quarter, revenues decreased 1% to $2.8 billion and segment operating 
      income decreased 8% to $316 million. Results for the year and quarter 
      reflected a decrease at our domestic operations, partially offset by 
      improved results at our international operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the year, decreased operating income at our domestic operations was 
      due to higher costs at our domestic resorts, lower hotel occupancy and 
      attendance at Walt Disney World Resort and a decrease at Disney Cruise 
      Line, partially offset by higher guest spending at our domestic resorts, 
      primarily due to higher average ticket prices and increased attendance 
      at Disneyland Resort. Increased costs at our domestic resorts reflected 
      labor cost inflation, higher pension and post-retirement medical 
      expenses and costs for new guest offerings including World of Color 
      at Disneyland Resort. The decrease at Disney Cruise Line reflected 
      increased operating costs to support the fleet expansion and lower 
      passenger cruise days including the impact of scheduled dry-dock 
      maintenance. Results for the current year at our domestic operations 
      were adversely impacted by having one less week of operations than in 
      the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increased results at our international operations reflected improvement 
      at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort driven by increased attendance, guest 
      spending, and hotel occupancy and an increase at Disneyland Paris due to 
      higher guest spending and a sale of a real estate property, partially 
      offset by lower attendance. Higher guest spending at both resorts was 
      driven by higher average ticket prices and average daily hotel room 
      rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, lower operating income at our domestic operations 
      reflected higher costs at our domestic resorts and lower results at 
      Disney Vacation Club, partially offset by higher guest spending at our 
      domestic resorts driven by an increase in average ticket prices and 
      higher food and beverage spending. Increased costs reflected labor cost 
      inflation and higher pension and post-retirement medical expenses. The 
      decrease at Disney Vacation Club reflected lower ownership sales of 
      vacation club units and decreased revenue recognition due to the timing 
      of completion of vacation club properties. Results for the current 
      quarter at our domestic operations were adversely impacted by having one 
      less week of operations than in the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income at our international resorts reflected increased 
      attendance and guest spending at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and 
      Disneyland Paris. Increased guest spending at both resorts was driven by 
      higher average daily hotel room rates and an increase in average ticket 
      prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Studio Entertainment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studio Entertainment revenues for the year increased 9% to $6.7 billion 
      and segment operating income increased from $175 million to $693 
      million. For the quarter, revenues increased 6% to $1.6 billion and 
      segment operating income increased $117 million to $104 million. Higher 
      operating income for the year was primarily due to improvements in our 
      worldwide theatrical and domestic home entertainment results, partially 
      offset by higher film cost write-downs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The improvement in worldwide theatrical results reflected the strong 
      performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 in 
      the current year. Significant titles in the prior year included Up, 
      The Proposal and Bolt.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in domestic home entertainment was primarily due to lower 
      distribution and marketing expenses resulting from cost reduction 
      initiatives. Key current-year releases included Up, Alice in 
      Wonderland and Princess and the Frog while the prior year 
      included WALL-E, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and Bolt.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, higher operating income was driven by an increase in 
      worldwide theatrical distribution due to the strong international 
      performance of Toy Story 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer Products revenues for the year increased 10% to $2.7 billion 
      and segment operating income increased 11% to $677 million. For the 
      quarter, revenues increased 13% to $730 million and segment operating 
      income increased 22% to $184 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in segment operating income for the year was primarily due 
      to higher licensing revenue driven by the strength of Toy Story and 
      Marvel merchandise, higher comparable store sales at the Disney Store in 
      North America and Europe, lower costs at the Disney Store North America 
      and an increase at Publishing driven by Marvel titles. These increases 
      were partially offset by a higher revenue share with the Studio 
      Entertainment segment and operating costs and intangible asset 
      amortization associated with Marvel. Lower costs at the Disney Store 
      North America reflected the benefit of an improved global purchasing 
      strategy. The increased revenue share with the Studio Entertainment 
      segment was primarily due to growth from Toy Story merchandise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, higher operating income reflected licensing revenue 
      growth driven by the strength of Toy Story and Marvel merchandise, an 
      improvement at the worldwide Disney Store including the benefit of the 
      global purchasing strategy and an increase at publishing driven by 
      Marvel titles. These increases were partially offset by a higher revenue 
      share with the Studio Entertainment segment and operating costs and 
      intangible asset amortization associated with Marvel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interactive Media
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive Media revenues for the year increased 7% to $761 million and 
      operating results improved 21% to a loss of $234 million. For the 
      quarter, revenues increased 20% to $188 million and operating results 
      improved 9% to a loss of $104 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Improved operating results for the year were primarily due to lower cost 
      of sales on self&#8211;published video games, increased subscribers at our 
      mobile phone service business in Japan, and higher Club Penguin 
      subscription revenue. Lower video game cost of sales reflected a sales 
      mix shift from higher cost new releases, which included bundled 
      accessories, in the prior year to lower cost catalog titles in the 
      current year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, improved operating results were primarily due to higher 
      net effective pricing on self-published video games driven by Toy 
      Story 3, and
			increased subscribers at our mobile phone 
      service business in Japan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The improvements for both the year and the quarter were partially offset 
      by the inclusion of results for Playdom in the current quarter which 
      reflected the impact of purchase accounting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Restructuring and Impairment Charges
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company recorded $270 million of restructuring and impairment 
      charges in the current year related to organizational and cost structure 
      initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks 
      segments. Restructuring charges of $138 million, of which $55 million 
      were recorded in the current quarter, were primarily for severance and 
      other related costs. Impairment charges of $132 million, of which $3 
      million were recorded in the current quarter, consisted of writeoffs of 
      capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the 
      closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN 
      Zone locations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the prior year, the Company recorded charges totaling $492 million 
      which included impairment charges of $279 million (of which $142 million 
      related to radio FCC licenses) and restructuring costs of $213 million. 
      During the prior-year quarter, the Company recorded charges totaling 
      $166 million which included impairment charges of $73 million (of which 
      $34 million related to radio FCC licenses) and restructuring costs of 
      $93 million.

      The decrease in interest expense for the year was primarily due to lower 
      effective interest rates and lower average debt balances, partially 
      offset by expense related to the early redemption of a film financing 
      borrowing. For the quarter, the decrease in interest expense reflected 
      lower average debt balances.

      The decrease in interest and investment income for the year was

      The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year was primarily 
      due to favorable adjustments related to prior-year income tax matters, 
      partially offset by a charge related to the health care reform 
      legislation enacted in March 2010. For the quarter, the reduction in the

      Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year 
      increased $48 million to $350 million and for the quarter decreased $48 
      million to $131 million. The increase for the year was driven by 
      improved operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland and ESPN. The 
      decrease for the quarter was primarily due to lower operating results at 
      ESPN, partially offset by improved operating results at Hong Kong 
      Disneyland. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is

      The increase in cash provided by operations for the year was driven by 
      higher operating cash receipts at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts 
      and Studio Entertainment businesses and lower cash payments at our 
      Studio Entertainment segment, driven by a decrease in distribution and 
      marketing expense, partially offset by higher income tax payments. The 
      increase in cash receipts for our Media Networks and Studio 
      Entertainment segments was driven by higher revenues, while the increase 
      in cash receipts at Parks and Resorts was driven by the timing of 
      advance travel deposits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in capital expenditures for the year reflected higher

			Non-GAAP Financial Measures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding the impact 
      of certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment 
      operating income, all of which are important financial measures for the 
      Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP 
      financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of 
      earnings per share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in 
      accordance with GAAP. Net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate 
      segment operating income as we have calculated them may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings per share excluding certain items 
      &#8211; The Company uses earnings per share excluding certain items to 
      evaluate the performance of the Company&#8217;s operations exclusive of 
      certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to 
      period. The Company believes that information about earnings per share 
      exclusive of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where 
      the impact of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported 
      earnings, because the measure allows for comparability between periods 
      of the operating performance of the Company&#8217;s business and allows 
      investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the 
      impact of the operations of the business. The following table reconciles 
      reported earnings per share to earnings per share excluding certain 
      items:

      (1) Other income for the current year consists of gains on the sales of 
      our investments in television services in Europe in the first and second 
      quarters, an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the Disney 
      Stores in Japan in the second quarter, and a gain on the sale of the Power 
      Rangers property in the third quarter. Other income for the prior 
      year consists of a non-cash gain in connection with the merger of 
      Lifetime and AE in the fourth quarter and a gain on the sale of an 
      investment in two pay television services in Latin America in the first 
      quarter.

			Net borrowings &#8211; The Company believes that 
      information about net borrowings provides investors with a useful 
      perspective on our financial condition. Net borrowings reflect the 
      subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we 
      earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a portion of the 
      interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as 
      a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our 
      cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness 
      when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. 
      However, we may not immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the 
      reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of our 
      available cash and cash equivalents to repay debt in the ordinary course 
      of business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Free cash flow &#8211; The Company uses free cash 
      flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and 
      other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its 
      operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than 
      capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free 
      cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash 
      available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments 
      and pay dividends or repurchase shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Aggregate segment operating income &#8211; The 
      Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on 
      segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment 
      operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses 
      separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that 
      information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors 
      by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the 
      Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors 
      that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both 
      operations and the other factors that affect reported results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows

			The Walt Disney Company Reports Fourth Quarter Earnings
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company today reported earnings for the fiscal year and 
      fourth quarter ended October 2, 2010. Diluted earnings per share (EPS) 
      for the year increased 15% to $2.03 from $1.76 in the prior year. For 
      the quarter, diluted EPS was $0.43 compared to $0.47 in the prior-year 
      quarter. The decrease for the quarter reflected a $0.09 adverse impact 
      from a shift in the timing of recognition of previously deferred 
      revenues between the third and fourth quarters at ESPN. Additionally, 
      fiscal 2010 results for the full year and for the quarter include one 
      fewer week of operations compared to fiscal 2009 due to our fiscal 
      period end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The 2010 fiscal year was a financial and strategic success for The Walt 
      Disney Company with performance driven by great content like Toy 
      Story 3 and the way we benefited from that content across our many 
      businesses. Our fourth quarter earnings grew solidly after factoring out 
      a programming writeoff at one of our equity networks, the timing of ESPN 
      revenue recognition and the effect of one fewer week of operations this 
      year than last,&#8221; said Disney president and CEO Robert A. Iger. &#8220;With the 
      acquisition of Marvel, our brand and franchise portfolio is stronger 
      than ever and we&#8217;re confident our global growth strategy positions the 
      company well to thrive in the coming years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The following table summarizes the fourth quarter and full year results 
      for fiscal 2010 and 2009 (in millions, except per share amounts):

			Cable Networks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Cable Networks increased $213 million to $4.5 
      billion for the year due to growth at ESPN and the international Disney 
      Channels, partially offset by a decrease in cable equity income. The 
      increase at ESPN reflected higher affiliate and advertising revenue, 
      partially offset by higher programming and production and general and 
      administrative costs. Higher affiliate revenue was due to contractual 
      rate increases and subscriber growth, partially offset by the impact of 
      one fewer week of operations. Subscriber growth was driven by the launch 
      of a new network in the United Kingdom in the fourth quarter of fiscal 
      2009. The increase in advertising revenue was primarily due to higher 
      sold inventory. Higher programming and production costs were driven by 
      the new network in the United Kingdom, coverage of the World Cup and 
      increased contractual costs for college basketball, NFL and college 
      football programming. Higher operating income at the international 
      Disney Channels was due to increased affiliate revenue driven by 
      subscriber growth and higher advertising revenue. Decreased cable equity 
      income was driven by a $58 million charge for our share of programming 
      writeoffs at AE/Lifetime that were recorded in the fourth quarter of 
      the current year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, operating income at Cable Networks decreased by $413 
      million to $1.1 billion due to a decrease at ESPN and lower cable equity 
      income driven by the programming writeoffs at AE/Lifetime. The decrease 
      at ESPN was due to the timing of recognition of previously deferred 
      revenues, the impact of one fewer week of operations and higher 
      programming and production costs. During the quarter, ESPN recognized 
      $170 million of previously deferred revenue compared to $524 million in 
      the prior year quarter. These decreases were partially offset by higher 
      affiliate fees driven by contractual rate increases and subscriber 
      growth and increased advertising revenues due to higher sold inventory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Broadcasting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Broadcasting increased $154 million to $659 million 
      for the year driven by higher advertising revenue at the owned 
      television stations, the absence of a bad debt charge in connection with 
      the bankruptcy of a syndication customer, lower programming and 
      production costs at the ABC Television Network and an improvement in net 
      affiliate fees. Lower programming and production costs reflected cost 
      savings at news and daytime and a lower cost mix of programming in 
      primetime. These increases were partially offset by higher pension and 
      postretirement medical costs, lower domestic television syndication 
      results due to the prior-year sales of According to Jim and 
      Grey&#8217;s Anatomy and decreased advertising revenue at the ABC 
      Television Network. Decreased advertising revenue at the ABC Television 
      Network was due to lower ratings and the impact of one fewer week of 
      operations, partially offset by improved rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, operating income at Broadcasting increased $145 million 
      to $147 million driven by decreased programming and production costs at 
      the ABC Television Network, higher advertising and an improvement in net 
      affiliate fees, partially offset by higher pension and postretirement 
      medical costs. Lower programming and production costs at the ABC 
      Television Network reflected a lower cost mix of programming in 
      primetime, cost savings in daytime and news production, decreased sports 
      programming costs and the impact of one less week of operations. Higher 
      advertising revenues were driven by improved primetime ratings at the 
      ABC Television Network and growth at the owned television stations, 
      partially offset by the impact of one less week of operations. Decreased 
      revenues for the quarter reflected lower sales of ABC Studios 
      productions primarily due to the prior-year domestic syndication sales 
      of According to Jim and Grey&#8217;s Anatomy. This revenue 
      decline was largely offset by reduced production cost amortization 
      including the impact of a lower average production cost amortization 
      rate for productions sold in the current quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parks and Resorts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parks and Resorts revenues for the year increased 1% to $10.8 billion 
      and segment operating income decreased 7% to $1.3 billion. For the 
      quarter, revenues decreased 1% to $2.8 billion and segment operating 
      income decreased 8% to $316 million. Results for the year and quarter 
      reflected a decrease at our domestic operations, partially offset by 
      improved results at our international operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the year, decreased operating income at our domestic operations was 
      due to higher costs at our domestic resorts, lower hotel occupancy and 
      attendance at Walt Disney World Resort and a decrease at Disney Cruise 
      Line, partially offset by higher guest spending at our domestic resorts, 
      primarily due to higher average ticket prices and increased attendance 
      at Disneyland Resort. Increased costs at our domestic resorts reflected 
      labor cost inflation, higher pension and post-retirement medical 
      expenses and costs for new guest offerings including World of Color 
      at Disneyland Resort. The decrease at Disney Cruise Line reflected 
      increased operating costs to support the fleet expansion and lower 
      passenger cruise days including the impact of scheduled dry-dock 
      maintenance. Results for the current year at our domestic operations 
      were adversely impacted by having one less week of operations than in 
      the prior year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increased results at our international operations reflected improvement 
      at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort driven by increased attendance, guest 
      spending, and hotel occupancy and an increase at Disneyland Paris due to 
      higher guest spending and a sale of a real estate property, partially 
      offset by lower attendance. Higher guest spending at both resorts was 
      driven by higher average ticket prices and average daily hotel room 
      rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, lower operating income at our domestic operations 
      reflected higher costs at our domestic resorts and lower results at 
      Disney Vacation Club, partially offset by higher guest spending at our 
      domestic resorts driven by an increase in average ticket prices and 
      higher food and beverage spending. Increased costs reflected labor cost 
      inflation and higher pension and post-retirement medical expenses. The 
      decrease at Disney Vacation Club reflected lower ownership sales of 
      vacation club units and decreased revenue recognition due to the timing 
      of completion of vacation club properties. Results for the current 
      quarter at our domestic operations were adversely impacted by having one 
      less week of operations than in the prior-year quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Higher operating income at our international resorts reflected increased 
      attendance and guest spending at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and 
      Disneyland Paris. Increased guest spending at both resorts was driven by 
      higher average daily hotel room rates and an increase in average ticket 
      prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Studio Entertainment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studio Entertainment revenues for the year increased 9% to $6.7 billion 
      and segment operating income increased from $175 million to $693 
      million. For the quarter, revenues increased 6% to $1.6 billion and 
      segment operating income increased $117 million to $104 million. Higher 
      operating income for the year was primarily due to improvements in our 
      worldwide theatrical and domestic home entertainment results, partially 
      offset by higher film cost write-downs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The improvement in worldwide theatrical results reflected the strong 
      performance of Toy Story 3, Alice in Wonderland and Iron Man 2 in 
      the current year. Significant titles in the prior year included Up, 
      The Proposal and Bolt.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in domestic home entertainment was primarily due to lower 
      distribution and marketing expenses resulting from cost reduction 
      initiatives. Key current-year releases included Up, Alice in 
      Wonderland and Princess and the Frog while the prior year 
      included WALL-E, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian and Bolt.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, higher operating income was driven by an increase in 
      worldwide theatrical distribution due to the strong international 
      performance of Toy Story 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer Products revenues for the year increased 10% to $2.7 billion 
      and segment operating income increased 11% to $677 million. For the 
      quarter, revenues increased 13% to $730 million and segment operating 
      income increased 22% to $184 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in segment operating income for the year was primarily due 
      to higher licensing revenue driven by the strength of Toy Story and 
      Marvel merchandise, higher comparable store sales at the Disney Store in 
      North America and Europe, lower costs at the Disney Store North America 
      and an increase at Publishing driven by Marvel titles. These increases 
      were partially offset by a higher revenue share with the Studio 
      Entertainment segment and operating costs and intangible asset 
      amortization associated with Marvel. Lower costs at the Disney Store 
      North America reflected the benefit of an improved global purchasing 
      strategy. The increased revenue share with the Studio Entertainment 
      segment was primarily due to growth from Toy Story merchandise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, higher operating income reflected licensing revenue 
      growth driven by the strength of Toy Story and Marvel merchandise, an 
      improvement at the worldwide Disney Store including the benefit of the 
      global purchasing strategy and an increase at publishing driven by 
      Marvel titles. These increases were partially offset by a higher revenue 
      share with the Studio Entertainment segment and operating costs and 
      intangible asset amortization associated with Marvel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interactive Media
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive Media revenues for the year increased 7% to $761 million and 
      operating results improved 21% to a loss of $234 million. For the 
      quarter, revenues increased 20% to $188 million and operating results 
      improved 9% to a loss of $104 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Improved operating results for the year were primarily due to lower cost 
      of sales on self&#8211;published video games, increased subscribers at our 
      mobile phone service business in Japan, and higher Club Penguin 
      subscription revenue. Lower video game cost of sales reflected a sales 
      mix shift from higher cost new releases, which included bundled 
      accessories, in the prior year to lower cost catalog titles in the 
      current year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the quarter, improved operating results were primarily due to higher 
      net effective pricing on self-published video games driven by Toy 
      Story 3, and
			increased subscribers at our mobile phone 
      service business in Japan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The improvements for both the year and the quarter were partially offset 
      by the inclusion of results for Playdom in the current quarter which 
      reflected the impact of purchase accounting.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Restructuring and Impairment Charges
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company recorded $270 million of restructuring and impairment 
      charges in the current year related to organizational and cost structure 
      initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks 
      segments. Restructuring charges of $138 million, of which $55 million 
      were recorded in the current quarter, were primarily for severance and 
      other related costs. Impairment charges of $132 million, of which $3 
      million were recorded in the current quarter, consisted of writeoffs of 
      capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film projects, the 
      closure of a studio production facility and the closure of five ESPN 
      Zone locations.

      The decrease in interest expense for the year was primarily due to lower 
      effective interest rates and lower average debt balances, partially 
      offset by expense related to the early redemption of a film financing 
      borrowing. For the quarter, the decrease in interest expense reflected 
      lower average debt balances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The decrease in interest and investment income for the year was 
      primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment in the prior-year

      The decrease in the effective income tax rate for the year was primarily 
      due to favorable adjustments related to prior-year income tax matters, 
      partially offset by a charge related to the health care reform 
      legislation enacted in March 2010. For the quarter, the reduction in the 
      effective income tax rate was driven by favorable adjustments related to 
      prior-year income tax matters.

      Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests for the year 
      increased $48 million to $350 million and for the quarter decreased $48 
      million to $131 million. The increase for the year was driven by 
      improved operating results at Hong Kong Disneyland and ESPN. The 
      decrease for the quarter was primarily due to lower operating results at 
      ESPN, partially offset by improved operating results at Hong Kong 
      Disneyland. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is 
      determined based on income after royalties, financing costs and income

      The increase in cash provided by operations for the year was driven by 
      higher operating cash receipts at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts 
      and Studio Entertainment businesses and lower cash payments at our 
      Studio Entertainment segment, driven by a decrease in distribution and 
      marketing expense, partially offset by higher income tax payments. The 
      increase in cash receipts for our Media Networks and Studio 
      Entertainment segments was driven by higher revenues, while the increase 
      in cash receipts at Parks and Resorts was driven by the timing of 
      advance travel deposits.

      The increase in capital expenditures for the year reflected higher 
      construction progress payments on two new cruise ships, the expansion at

      (1) Net borrowings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the discussion 
      of non-GAAP financial measures that follows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The total borrowings shown above include $2,586 million and $2,868 
      million attributable to Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland Resort 
      as of October 2, 2010 and October 3, 2009, respectively. Cash and cash 
      equivalents attributable to Disneyland Paris and Hong Kong Disneyland 
      Resort totaled $657 million and $606 million as of October 2, 2010 and 
      October 3, 2009, respectively.

			Non-GAAP Financial Measures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding the impact 
      of certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment 
      operating income, all of which are important financial measures for the 
      Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP 
      financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of 
      earnings per share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in 
      accordance with GAAP. Net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate 
      segment operating income as we have calculated them may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings per share excluding certain items 
      &#8211; The Company uses earnings per share excluding certain items to 
      evaluate the performance of the Company&#8217;s operations exclusive of 
      certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to 
      period. The Company believes that information about earnings per share 
      exclusive of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where 
      the impact of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported 
      earnings, because the measure allows for comparability between periods 
      of the operating performance of the Company&#8217;s business and allows 
      investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the 
      impact of the operations of the business. The following table reconciles 
      reported earnings per share to earnings per share excluding certain 
      items:

      (1) Other income for the current year consists of gains on the sales of 
      our investments in television services in Europe in the first and second 
      quarters, an accounting gain related to the acquisition of the Disney 
      Stores in Japan in the second quarter, and a gain on the sale of the Power 
      Rangers property in the third quarter. Other income for the prior 
      year consists of a non-cash gain in connection with the merger of 
      Lifetime and AE in the fourth quarter and a gain on the sale of an 
      investment in two pay television services in Latin America in the first 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Net borrowings &#8211; The Company believes that 
      information about net borrowings provides investors with a useful 
      perspective on our financial condition. Net borrowings reflect the 
      subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we 
      earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a portion of the 
      interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as 
      a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our 
      cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness 
      when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. 
      However, we may not immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the 
      reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of our 
      available cash and cash equivalents to repay debt in the ordinary course 
      of business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Free cash flow &#8211; The Company uses free cash 
      flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and 
      other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its 
      operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than 
      capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free 
      cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash 
      available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments 
      and pay dividends or repurchase shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Aggregate segment operating income &#8211; The 
      Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on 
      segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment 
      operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses 
      separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that 
      information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors 
      by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the 
      Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors 
      that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both 
      operations and the other factors that affect reported results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as follows

      Antitrust Laws in Silver Futures Trading

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Girard Gibbs LLP (www.GirardGibbs.com) 
      is currently investigating allegations that J.P. Morgan Chase  Co. and 
      HSBC violated federal laws by conspiring to lower the price of silver 
      futures and options contracts. The banks are accused of accumulating 
      heavily concentrated positions in silver futures and options on the 
      Commodity Exchange Inc. (COMEX), beginning in early 2008.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lawsuits have been filed against HSBC and J.P. Morgan Chase  Co, 
      alleging that the banks manipulated the prices of COMEX silver futures 
      by building up large short positions in silver futures contracts they 
      had no intent to fill, in order to force silver prices down at a time 
      when silver should have been trading at higher levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The banks&#8217; actions are being investigated by the U.S. Department of 
      Justice as well as the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). 
      On October 26, 2010, CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton issued a statement, 
      saying:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220; [I ] believe violations to the Commodity Exchange Act have taken 
      place in silver markets and that any such violation of the law in this 
      regard should be prosecuted.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you bought or sold COMEX silver futures since March 1, 2008, Girard 
      Gibbs is interested in speaking to you. If you wish to discuss our 
      investigation or have any questions concerning your rights in this case,

			Mobile Backhaul to Help Drive Upper Millimeter Market, New Visant 
      Strategies Report Finds
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Continuing deployments of 3.5G and 4G mobile networks is driving upper 
      millimeter radio sales, according to a new study from Visant Strategies. 
      3.5G and 4G build-outs in the near future, the study finds, will require 
      1 Gigabit and more of backhaul capacity between network aggregation 
      points, leading to upper millimeter radio deployments for backhaul.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The E Band is an attractive alternative for backhaul in urban and near 
      urban environments when hundreds of megabits per second or more of 
      capacity is needed,&#8221; said Andy Fuertes of Visant Strategies. &#8220;There is 
      insufficient availability of lower PTP frequencies to carry backhaul 
      capacity that is equal to E band, especially when the bar is placed at 1 
      Gigabit per second. 3G base stations and aggregation points, in many 
      cases, fall within the range of E band in urban and near urban areas and 
      this trend will continue with dense HSPA plus, mobile WiMAX and LTE 
      deployments.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to &#8220;Upper Millimeter 2011: Success in Mobile, Private and 
      Public Safety Wireless,&#8221; E band radio shipments will grow five-fold 
      between 2010 and 2016 with E band and 60 GHz radio revenues reaching 
      over $500 million in 2016. 60 GHz radio shipments will also grow roughly 
      five-fold due to an increased use in private enterprise and government 
      networks, among other market segments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;60 GHz radios will do well in private and public safety wireless 
      networks,&#8221; said Larry Swasey of Visant Strategies. &#8220;Upper millimeter 
      radios on all fronts have improved greatly on price and performance the 
      last decade as well, helping drive the market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report examines 3.5G and 4G deployments, 3.5G and 4G users and 
      regional mobile trends which will lead to the use of upper millimeter 
      radios. Included are shipments and revenues by region through 2016 of 
      E-band and 60 GHz band radios as well as ASPs. Both radio segments are 
      also broken down through 2016 by shipments/revenues per application, 
      such as mobile backhaul, private enterprise, public safety and 
      government and last mile access, among others.

			ExxonMobil 
      (NYSE:XOM) introduced today the "Exxon Mobil Fuel Finder" iPhone&#174; and 
      iPod touch&#174; application, which provides drivers with real-time maps, 
      driving directions and station information for more than 10,000 Exxon 
      and Mobil retail locations across the continental United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are very excited to bring our customers the first mobile app from 
      ExxonMobil, using technology to allow customers to more easily and more 
      efficiently find a station -- no matter where they are," says Ben 
      Soraci, U.S. retail sales director for ExxonMobil Fuels Marketing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Exxon Mobil Fuel Finder is a mobile version of its popular online 
      station locator, available since January 2001, at exxonmobilstations.com. 
      The application relies on GPS technology to identify a user's location 
      and then highlights nearby Exxon and Mobil stations on an interactive 
      Google map. An advanced filtering feature distinguishes stations by 
      hours, fuel sold, pay at the pump, convenience store, Speedpass, 
      car wash and service bay. This feature will allow customers to seek 
      out specific services prior to their arrival.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The application also includes an "Our Gasoline" section where users can 
      learn how Exxon and Mobil fuel helps clean up intake valves and keeps 
      vital engine parts, like fuel injectors, clean.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This app is another way, of many, that ExxonMobil strives to provide 
      useful information to customers,&#8221; says Soraci. &#8220;Through our next 
      campaign, for example, we&#8217;re featuring consumer energy efficiency 
      messages at stations. While people are filling up, they can read energy 
      efficiency suggestions, tips I use for my own car.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Exxon Mobil Fuel Finder is a free application available 
      for download on the App StoreSM.

      A group of Microsoft&#174; channel partners has announced the launch of MPOWR 
      (Microsoft Partners for One World of Results), a new community for 
      business development leaders within companies belonging to the Microsoft 
      Partner Network. The worldwide organization will provide tools to help 
      Microsoft partners build their businesses through stronger peer-to-peer 
      networking and knowledge sharing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Partner-to-partner collaboration is a proven strategy for business 
      growth, and we&#8217;re excited to offer a robust set of tools to help 
      partners build a strong, independent worldwide community focused on this 
      critical business function,&#8221; said Bill Luisi, a member of the MPOWR 
      Founders&#8217; Committee. &#8220;Microsoft partners already receive lots of 
      essential support from Microsoft and elsewhere, but we see MPOWR as the 
      place where partners will be best able to tap into each other&#8217;s 
      real-world knowledge to help them grow their businesses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MPOWR launches on November 11, 2010 with two key offerings. The web 
      portal (www.mpowercommunity.org) 
      will provide tools for partners to network, share business leads, and 
      collaborate through member-driven Special Interest Groups addressing 
      topics of interest. The organization will also launch MPOWRment, 
      the digital magazine of MPOWR, with content focused specifically on 
      Microsoft partner success strategies in the highly changeable IT 
      channel. MPOWR membership is free to active members, and any employee of 
      a Microsoft partner company can sign up for their first year of free 
      membership via the web portal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe that the power of a cohesive, engaged, and independent 
      community of Microsoft partners can be a tremendously valuable resource 
      to all stakeholders in the IT channel,&#8221; said Ted Pfeiffer, Executive 
      Director of MPOWR. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking forward to putting MPOWR&#8217;s highly 
      accessible toolkit into the hands of partners and helping them use the 
      tools to build a community focused on partner needs.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;   * Expects to sign deal for $1 bln Disney park in Java next
yr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bakrieland owns lands at proposed site
 (Updates with details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Nov 11 (Reuters) - Indonesian developer Bakrieland
(ELTY.JK) is in talks with Walt Disney Company (DIS.N) to build
a $1 billion theme park in the country's main Java island, a
source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strong consumer demand and a youthful population are
driving growth in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, which is
now attracting increased foreign portfolio and direct
investment, though Western firms are often put off by rampant
corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bakrieland expects to sign a deal next year for the park in
Sukabumi, West Java, said the source, who declined to be
identified because the talks were not public and ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Bakrieland is currently in intense talks with Disney to
build Disneyland in Indonesia," the source told Reuters. "The
exact total project value is still under discussion but it's
more than $1 billion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Bakrieland spokesman declined to comment. Disney was not
immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney is building a theme park near Shanghai and already
has a Disneyland in Hong Kong, which made a net loss last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Land acquisition is often a major challenge for foreign and
local firms involved in infrastructure projects in Indonesia,
but Bakrieland owns land in Sukabumi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bakrieland is part of the politically connected Bakrie
Group that has interests in coal mining, telecoms and
plantations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said after a
meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama in Jakarta this week
that he expected U.S. investment in Indonesia will rise
significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Graft, red tape and inadequate infrastructure are still
hurdles, though the country expects overall foreign direct
investment in 2010 to pick up a third from last year and is
keen to attract more to provide stable longer-term capital
inflows.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Little-known American Roland Thatcher kept his PGA Tour card hopes alive by charging four shots clear in the second round of the Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three strokes behind the pacesetting Chris Stroud overnight, Thatcher took command with a scintillating nine-under-par 63 on the Magnolia Course, one of two layouts hosting the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 33-year-old, who has played most of his tournament golf on the satellite Nationwide Tour, rattled up nine birdies in a flawless display to post a 16-under total of 128.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stroud followed his opening 62 with a 70 on the Magnolia layout to share second place at 12 under with fellow American Brian Gay (65).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another American, Robert Garrigus, was a further stroke back at the midway point in the final PGA Tour event of the season after firing a 65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher, who lies 179th in the money list and needs to climb into the top 125 to secure full playing privileges for next year, was delighted with his scoring on the tougher of the two host layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There really weren't many opportunities for me to make much more than what I did as far as the round went," the three-times Nationwide Tour winner told reporters. "It was as low as it could go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't hit it inside of five feet all day. I made a good number of 15- to 20-footers, and that's how you turn a ball-striking round of 67 into 63. If I can do that two more days, it's going to be a really special week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher, whose best PGA Tour finish was a tie for second behind Tiger Woods at the 2009 Buick Open, needs to end the week no worse than joint second to secure his 2011 card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously after 65 and 63, my goals have changed quite a bit," he said. "I'm hoping to have a nice long off season and then start the year early (with full privileges) next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former world number one Vijay Singh of Fiji was 12 strokes off the pace after carding a 71, one shot better than multiple PGA Tour winner Davis Love III, who returned a 70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cut fell at three-under 141 with former major champions Todd Hamilton, Justin Leonard, Shaun Micheel and Rich Beem among those failing to advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Arlington, Texas; Editing by Steve Ginsburg)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has stopped providing clearing services for some of the Wall Street bank's smallest U.S. clients, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients that manage less than $5 million were the target, though not all were declined the clearing service, the article said. It added Goldman was shedding clients that are riskier, have lower growth prospects, and are more focused on retail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's prime brokerage business has been pressured this year, due partly to increased competition to provide the services and also because funds are borrowing fewer individual stocks for short selling, according to executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest prime brokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley (MS.N), and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), have had the smallest growth rates this year, according to data from AR Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dean Backer, Goldman's prime-brokerage leader, said in an interview several weeks ago that the bank had about 800 prime brokerage clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure is down from its pre-financial crisis peak as many hedge funds closed during the downturn, or smaller funds turned to mini prime brokers, which pool assets of smaller funds. Goldman provides clearing services for mini primes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's clearing unit -- which stands between traders, guaranteeing their obligations -- is separate from its prime brokerage unit, though the two are closely connected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Spicer and Ross Kerber; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

Street bank's smallest U.S. clients, Bloomberg reported on
Friday, citing unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clients that manage less than $5 million were the target,
though not all were declined the clearing service, the article
said. It added Goldman was shedding clients that are riskier,
have lower growth prospects, and are more focused on retail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street's prime brokerage business has been pressured
this year, due partly to increased competition to provide the
services and also because funds are borrowing fewer individual
stocks for short selling, according to executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest prime brokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley (MS.N),
and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), have had the smallest growth
rates this year, according to data from AR Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dean Backer, Goldman's prime-brokerage leader, said in an
interview several weeks ago that the bank had about 800 prime
brokerage clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That figure is down from its pre-financial crisis peak as
many hedge funds closed during the downturn, or smaller funds
turned to mini prime brokers, which pool assets of smaller
funds. Goldman provides clearing services for mini primes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's clearing unit -- which stands between traders,
guaranteeing their obligations -- is separate from its prime
brokerage unit, though the two are closely connected.

      The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ) said today it is calling 
      on the U.S. Department of Justice to launch an investigation concerning 
      reports that Islamic terrorists have appeared before a Congressionally 
      sponsored Muslim group that meets at the U.S. Capitol. The investigative report 
      by Fox News reveals that a number of well-known terrorists - including 
      U.S. born Anwar al-Awlaki, the Al Qaeda cleric believed to be hiding in 
      Yemen and the lone American on the U.S. government&#8217;s capture or kill 
      list - have appeared at what's been described as weekly 'prayer' 
      sessions on Capitol Hill.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "It is unbelievable that the very terrorists who want to destroy America 
      are permitted to meet in a Congressionally-sanctioned setting on Capitol 
      Hill," said Jay Sekulow, Chief Counsel of the ACLJ. "This raises a host 
      of significant questions - including concerns about national security. 
      We're demanding that the Department of Justice conduct an investigation 
      and take immediate action to halt to what appears to be a pattern of 
      inviting Islamic extremists with ties to terrorism to participate in 
      these events. The absurdity is clear: the U.S. government disinvites 
      Franklin Graham to a prayer service at the Pentagon, while Islamic 
      terrorists take part in Capitol Hill events. A thorough investigation is 
      warranted."

			The Law Office of Abe Shainberg Launches an Investigation into the 
      Possible Breaches of Fiduciary Duty by the Board of Atlas Energy, Inc. 
      in Connection with the Sale of the Company to Chevron Corporation &#8211; ATLS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Law Office of Abe Shainberg is investigating the Board of Directors 
      of Atlas Energy, Inc. (NasdaqGS: ATLS) for possible breaches of 
      fiduciary duty and other violations of state law in connection with 
      their attempt to sell the Company to Chevron Corporation (&#8220;Chevron&#8221;) 
      (NYSE: CVX). Under the terms of the transaction, Atlas Energy 
      shareholders will receive consideration valued at $43.34 per share for a 
      total transaction value of approximately $4.3 billion. The consideration 
      is to consist of $38.25 in cash and a pro-rata share of a distribution 
      of over 41 million units of Atlas Pipeline Holdings, L.P. (NYSE: AHD) 
      valued at $5.09 per Atlas Energy shares, based on the prior closing 
      price of AHD stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investigation concerns whether the Atlas Energy Board of Directors 
      breached their fiduciary duties to Atlas Energy stockholders by failing 
      to adequately shop the Company before entering into this transaction and 
      whether Chevron is underpaying for Atlas Energy shares, thus unlawfully 
      harming Atlas Energy stockholders. Analysts set a mean target price for 
      Atlas Energy stock at $45.33 per share and at least one analyst set a 
      price target at $64.00 per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) shares rose 5 percent on Friday after its upbeat forecast cheered investors and prompted at least one broker to raise the price target on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the entertainment and media powerhouse climbed to $37.71, up $1.85, in early trade and flirted with the 52-week high of $37.98. UBS raised its price target on the company to $37 from $35 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock market's reaction comes a day after Disney reported quarterly results that appeared to show weaker-than-expected earnings and raised concerns about disappointing revenue at its media networks division, the company's largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But during a conference call with analysts, Disney executives suggested the company expected rising ad sales, pricing and theme park attendance IDn:N11107912.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the large number of media earnings upside surprises this quarter, Disney's miss was all the more surprising," Nomura analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a research note. "Even upon scanning the press release, the results seemed weak. However, it turns out that you can't judge a quarter by a press release."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nathanson pointed out there were unexpected, one-time items in the quarter that affected the earnings, and that on an "apples-to-apples" basis its results were actually better than analysts on average had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney was the only major media company trading higher early Friday, with News Corp (NWSA.O), Time Warner Inc (TWX.N), CBS (CBS.N), and Viacom VIAb.N each down about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paul Thomasch; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    * Shares rise 5 percent, near 52-week high&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Analysts say earnings solid on apples-to-apples basis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Other media company shares slip in early trade&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) sharesrose 5 percent on Friday after its upbeat forecast cheeredinvestors and prompted at least one broker to raise the pricetarget on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of the entertainment and media powerhouse climbed to$37.71, up $1.85, in early trade and flirted with the 52-weekhigh of $37.98. UBS raised its price target on the company to$37 from $35 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The stock market's reaction comes a day after Disneyreported quarterly results that appeared to showweaker-than-expected earnings and raised concerns aboutdisappointing revenue at its media networks division, thecompany's largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But during a conference call with analysts, Disneyexecutives suggested the company expected rising ad sales,pricing and theme park attendance [IDn:N11107912].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Given the large number of media earnings upside surprisesthis quarter, Disney's miss was all the more surprising,"Nomura analyst Michael Nathanson wrote in a research note."Even upon scanning the press release, the results seemed weak.However, it turns out that you can't judge a quarter by a pressrelease."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nathanson pointed out there were unexpected, one-time itemsin the quarter that affected the earnings, and that on an"apples-to-apples" basis its results were actually better thananalysts on average had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Disney was the only major media company trading higherearly Friday, with News Corp (NWSA.O), Time Warner Inc (TWX.N),CBS (CBS.N), and Viacom VIAb.N each down about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Paul Thomasch; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((paul.thomasch@thomsonreuters.com; 1 646 223-6092; ReutersMessaging: paul.thomasch.reuters.com@reuters.com))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Visit blogs.reuters.com/mediafile/ for more coverageat the Reuters MediaFile blog))Keywords: DISNEY/SHARES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

      Research and Markets: Personal Care Products Manufacturing: Industry 
      Includes about 800 Companies, Such as Procter  Gamble, with Combined 
      Annual Revenue of $50 Billion
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/454a33/personal_care_prod) 
      has announced the addition of the "Personal 
      Care Products Manufacturing" report to their offering.

      Executive Summary
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brief Excerpt from Industry Overview Chapter:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US personal care products industry includes about 800 companies with 
      combined annual revenue of $50 billion. Major companies include Estee 
      Lauder, Johnson  Johnson, and Procter  Gamble. The industry is 
      concentrated: the 50 largest firms account for about 70 percent of 
      industry revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This industry includes companies engaged primarily in preparing, 
      blending, compounding, and packaging toilet preparations. Products 
      include makeup, shampoo, and various creams and lotions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand is driven by population growth and consumer preferences. The 
      profitability of individual companies depends on product innovation, 
      effective sales and marketing, and efficient operations. Large companies 
      have scale advantages in purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, and 
      marketing. Small companies can compete effectively by offering 
      specialized products. The industry is capital-intensive: average annual 
      revenue per worker exceeds $800,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major products include cosmetics, hair products, and creams and lotions. 
      Cosmetics (makeup and nail products) are 20 percent of global industry 
      revenue; face care products about 18 percent; perfumes about 13 percent; 
      and hair products, 9 percent. Other products include deodorant (8 
      percent); toothpaste and mouthwashes (8 percent); and soap and shaving 
      preparations (5 percent).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cosmetics, such as lipstick, follow current fashion trends and come in a 
      wide variety of colors. Lipstick is made of dyes and pigments in a 
      fragranced oil-wax base. Ingredients are melted separately, and then 
      oils and solvents are ground together with desired color pigments.

      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JAKKS Pacific's (Nasdaq: JAKK) 
      third quarter 2010 results came in well ahead of the Zacks Consensus 
      Estimate. Although key brands like WWE, Hannah Montana and Pokemon 
      continued to be a drag on the company's sales growth, improving consumer 
      spending and cost-cutting initiatives benefited the profitability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We remain confident on the company's long-term growth potential with new 
      product launches, possible acquisitions, improved earnings helped by 
      cost-saving measures, resolution of litigation and a strong financial 
      condition to materialize such growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, the company enters the 2010 holiday season with a strong 
      booking momentum. Impressive product portfolio for 2011 and the recently 
      announced share buyback program will also augur well for the company. 
      Hence, we upgrade the stock from Neutral to Outperform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Range Resources (NYSE: RRC) 
      announced record-setting third-quarter 2010 production volume of 503 
      million cubic feet equivalent per day (MMcfe/d), up 15% from last year 
      and 7% from the second quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the company's third quarter production increased mainly on the 
      back of solid contribution from its core Marcellus Shale properties, 
      this area is primarily over-pressured and, in some areas, contains rich 
      gas that must be processed further. As such, Range Resources needs more 
      capital as well as new high-pressured lines to gather Marcellus gas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although we appreciate Range Resources increasing focus on liquids, 
      natural gas-weighted production and reserves will weigh on the stock. 
      Our Underperform recommendation for Range Resources remains unchanged at 
      this stage. As such, we see little reason for investors to hold this 
      stock. Our $33 price objective reflects a multiple of 9.3x the trailing 
      12-month cash flow.

			Disney Lowers Curtain on Fiscal 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), 
      the entertainment conglomerate consisting of Disney and Pixar Studios, 
      ABC Television Network, ESPN, Disneyworld and Disney Resorts, reported 
      fiscal 4th quarter and full-year 2010 earnings results just before the 
      closing bell Thursday. But the results disappointed: 4th quarter EPS 
      reached 43 cents, below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 46 cents. For 
      the full year, Disney's $2.03 per share missed the consensus of $2.09.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zacks Consensus Revenue Estimate had been $9,924 million for the 4th 
      quarter, and the most recent estimate was an even-more optimistic $9,936 
      million. But DIS reported revenues of $9,742 million -- missing 
      expectations by 1.9% and down 1% year over year. The stock fell 3% 
      before regular market trading ended.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney President and CEO Robert Iger also cited a series of one-time 
      items that led to the earnings and revenue misses, including "a 
      programming writeoff at one of our equity networks, the timing of ESPN 
      revenue recognition and the effect of one fewer week of operations this 
      year than last," which reportedly impacted results by 9 cents per share. 
      Iger then expressed enthusiasm about its Marvel franchise portfolio 
      going forward. Marvel had been acquired back in the 4th quarter of 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the past month, analysts had been turning more positive about 
      Disney earnings, as 6 of 24 analysts upwardly revised estimates for both 
      the 4th quarter and full year. Eight analysts upped their expectations 
      for fiscal 2011 in the past month, as well. That said, Disney shares had 
      also been downgraded from Outperform to Neutral on November 2nd, as 3 
      analysts had downwardly revised earnings estimates for the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among the positive developments articulated in the full-year earnings 
      report, Consumer Products revenues rose 10%, and Studio Entertainment 
      was up 9%. Both can be attributed by the success of 2010 releases such 
      as Toy Story 3.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AFC Beats, Outlook Raised
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AFC Enterprises Inc. (Nasdaq: AFCE) 
      posted its third quarter 2010 adjusted earnings of approximately 23 
      cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 18 
      cents and soared 27.8% year over year from 18 cents in the prior-year 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AFC Enterprises reported a net income of $5.9 million or 23 cents, well 
      above $3.4 million or 13 cents recorded in the year-earlier quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The better-than-expected results were driven by positive same-store 
      sales and the company's 4 strategic plans, which focus on developing the 
      brand, offering more value service to guests and introduce new product 
      innovation along with cost saving initiatives to improve margins and 
      ramp-up new unit growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The operator and franchisor of Popeye's restaurants reported total 
      revenue of $34.1 million, which spiked up 6.9% from the year-ago 
      quarter, attributable to positive same store sales. The company also 
      outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $33.0 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Medicis Pharma Tops by a Cent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Medicis Pharmaceutical Corp. (NYSE: MRX) 
      posted third quarter 2010 earnings of 58 cents per share, beating the 
      Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent and exceeding the year-ago earnings 
      of 50 cents per share by 16.5%. Higher revenues accounted for increased 
      earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For fiscal 2010, Medicis Pharma expects earnings in the range of $2.25 
      to $2.30 per share on revenues of $698 million to $703 million. The 
      current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal year 2010 is $2.28 per 
      share, at the mid-point of the guided range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Medicis Pharma also provided guidance for earnings and revenues for the 
      fourth quarter of 2010. The company expects earnings in the range of 
      $0.57 &#8211; $0.62 per share on revenues of $180 million &#8211; $185 million. The 
      fourth quarter Zacks Consensus earnings Estimate is 60 cents per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Medicis Pharma, which is 
      supported by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating). Medicis Pharma 
      recently received approval for additional dosage strengths (55 mg, 80 
      mg, 105 mg) of acne treatment drug, Solodyn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company currently has the US Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s approval 
      for eight dosing strengths of Solodyn &#8211; 45 mg, 55 mg, 65 mg, 80 mg, 90 
      mg, 105 mg, 115 mg and 135 mg &#8211; offering greater prescribing flexibility 
      to physicians.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe that the company will look to shift patients to the new 
      dosage strengths so as to reduce the impact of the entry of generic 
      versions of older dosages post November 2011. On the third quarter call, 
      Medicis Pharma stated that the 65 mg and 115 mg strengths, which were 
      approved in July 2009, and the new 55 mg, 80 mg and 150 mg strengths, 
      accounted for 70.0% of new prescriptions and 66.8% of total 
      prescriptions.

</body></entry><entry author="Christine Kearney" date="2010-11-12T14:03:24+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/12/us-books-taibbi-idUSTRE6AB2OL20101112"><headline>Rolling Stone writer's book rips Goldman, Greenspan</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rolling Stone writer Matt Taibbi famously compared investment bank Goldman Sachs to a giant money-sucking vampire squid a year and a half ago. Now his new book "Griftopia" apportions more blame for the financial crisis and fallout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new "grifter class" of America who have successfully defrauded the average Joe are the major players on Wall Street propped up by willing politicians, Taibbi says in his recently published, "Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids and the Long Con That is Breaking America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 250-page book employs the colloquial style of Rolling Stone magazine to detail the roles of major players such as former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the destabilization of the economy in the lead up to the 2008 crisis, and why Goldman Sachs got a $10 billion federal bailout while other banks were allowed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taibbi says "a concentrated group of connected financial companies that are growing bigger and bigger all the time," now wield "enormous political influence." He compared them to powerful interests in developing countries who "write the rules of the game so that they can't lose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are the dominant political powers in the country now," he told Reuters in an interview. "When you get so much political influence that you can't not make money, it's just like a license to steal and that is what the book is about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, he added, became a favored target of his partly because former Goldman officials crossed over to government positions. Hank Paulson, a former Goldman CEO, was U.S. Treasury Secretary when he decided to bailout Goldman Sachs while rival Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think there is a parallel in American history that is worse than that," he said. "There is a particular culture at that bank that is different from other banks, they cultivate this air of superiority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taibbi said he is not surprised Goldman soon posted record profits after the bailout since they were allowed to borrow from the government at near zero percent interest and lend that money back to the government in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds at a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like hooking an ATM machine up to the United States Treasury -- that is one of a dozen different ways Goldman got money from the government," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined requests to comment on the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHOTGUN WEDDINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taibbi said the period between August and November 2008, and details of government help for the "explosion of shotgun weddings" between institutions such as Bank Of America and Merrill Lynch, should be on the public record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These things were all orchestrated behind the scenes. I seriously doubt that they were legal. That's not capitalism, that's oligarchy when that happens," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Goldman Sachs, Taibbi's book devotes a chapter to Greenspan. Taibbi argues that Greenspan gave big banks greater power, deregulated the markets and dangerously sheltered Wall Street by lowering interest rates after each stock bubble leading up to the 2008 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguing for the collapse of financial regulatory laws was another fault, he said. A spokeswoman for Greenspan did not return a query seeking comment on the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people "don't understand the Fed" including the fact that "every time Wall Street blows itself up with a speculative bubble, the Fed slashes interest rates to zero, that that is essentially a bail-out mechanism," he said. "When banks can borrow money for nothing, that is a bailout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans should be angry, said Taibbi, but instead of understanding the complexities of what happened, political groups such as the Tea Party offer "bad, simplistic explanations" while the Democrats offered none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial media were also to blame, as they "mostly write for the people who work in Wall Street," he said, meaning they have lost their objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He offers a tiny glimmer of hope with appointments such as Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of Wall Street who is helping set up a new government watchdog to protect consumers, in a world where most politicians are either "willing or ignorant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we get to the point when we have to save them every time they screw up, then we are no longer regulating them, we are no longer governing them, we are servicing them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Christine Kearney, editing by Mark Egan and Jill Serjeant)&lt;/p&gt;

			The Coca-Cola Foundation Awards $300,000 in 
      Grants to Keep Youth Active in California, New York and Texas
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			16 Organizations Awarded Active Healthy Living Grants
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hundreds of organizations responded when The Coca-Cola Foundation 
      announced a request for proposals for its Active Healthy Living grant. 
      The 16 organizations in California, Texas and New York that are being 
      awarded $10,000 to $25,000 grants will help support physical activity 
      and nutrition education programs focused on the entire family.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At The Coca-Cola Company, improving access to community programs that 
      foster physical activity, exercise and nutritional education is an 
      absolute priority for us,&#8221; said Ingrid Saunders Jones, senior vice 
      president, Global Community Connections, The Coca-Cola Company and chair 
      of The Coca-Cola Foundation. &#8220;Our goal is to make a positive difference 
      in communities by strengthening and creating active healthy lifestyle 
      habits for families.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the Bronx, NY, FAN4Kids will be celebrating its $20,000 Coca-Cola 
      Foundation Active Healthy Living grant at a ceremony today at PS 75. The 
      grant will help support the expansion of the FAN4Kids program into two 
      additional elementary schools.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Coca-Cola Foundation Active Healthy Living grant will help us bring 
      FAN4Kids to even more schools so that more young people will begin a 
      lifelong habit of making healthy choices about nutrition and physical 
      activity,&#8221; said Robert Oliver, CEO of FAN4Kids. &#8220;It is truly an honor to 
      be selected to receive a grant out of the hundreds of applications.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FAN4Kids is a non-profit education service company that provides a 
      comprehensive nutrition and physical activity education program for 
      low-income children in New York and New Jersey. This expansion will 
      include 250 students in South Bronx and Queens public elementary 
      schools. The FAN4Kids program is designed to prevent the problems of 
      poor eating and inactivity before they become an issue by providing, 
      &#8220;lessons that last a lifetime&#8221;.

&lt;p&gt; * Matt Taibbi expands on his vampire squid theory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Middle class lose out, Goldman Sachs wins, he says&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Christine Kearney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - Rolling Stone writer Matt
Taibbi famously compared investment bank Goldman Sachs to a
giant money-sucking vampire squid a year and a half ago. Now
his new book "Griftopia" apportions more blame for the
financial crisis and fallout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new "grifter class" of America who have successfully
defrauded the average Joe are the major players on Wall Street
propped up by willing politicians, Taibbi says in his recently
published, "Griftopia: Bubble Machines, Vampire Squids and the
Long Con That is Breaking America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 250-page book employs the colloquial style of Rolling
Stone magazine to detail the roles of major players such as
former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the
destabilization of the economy in the lead up to the 2008
crisis, and why Goldman Sachs got a $10 billion federal bailout
while other banks were allowed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taibbi says "a concentrated group of connected financial
companies that are growing bigger and bigger all the time," now
wield "enormous political influence." He compared them to
powerful interests in developing countries who "write the rules
of the game so that they can't lose."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are the dominant political powers in the country
now," he told Reuters in an interview. "When you get so much
political influence that you can't not make money, it's just
like a license to steal and that is what the book is about."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs, he added, became a favored target of his
partly because former Goldman officials crossed over to
government positions. Hank Paulson, a former Goldman CEO, was
U.S. Treasury Secretary when he decided to bailout Goldman
Sachs while rival Lehman Brothers was allowed to fail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think there is a parallel in American history that
is worse than that," he said. "There is a particular culture at
that bank that is different from other banks, they cultivate
this air of superiority."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taibbi said he is not surprised Goldman soon posted record
profits after the bailout since they were allowed to borrow
from the government at near zero percent interest and lend that
money back to the government in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds
at a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's like hooking an ATM machine up to the United States
Treasury -- that is one of a dozen different ways Goldman got
money from the government," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined requests to comment on the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHOTGUN WEDDINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taibbi said the period between August and November 2008,
and details of government help for the "explosion of shotgun
weddings" between institutions such as Bank Of America and
Merrill Lynch, should be on the public record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These things were all orchestrated behind the scenes. I
seriously doubt that they were legal. That's not capitalism,
that's oligarchy when that happens," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides Goldman Sachs, Taibbi's book devotes a chapter to
Greenspan. Taibbi argues that Greenspan gave big banks greater
power, deregulated the markets and dangerously sheltered Wall
Street by lowering interest rates after each stock bubble
leading up to the 2008 crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arguing for the collapse of financial regulatory laws was
another fault, he said. A spokeswoman for Greenspan did not
return a query seeking comment on the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most people "don't understand the Fed" including the fact
that "every time Wall Street blows itself up with a speculative
bubble, the Fed slashes interest rates to zero, that that is
essentially a bail-out mechanism," he said. "When banks can
borrow money for nothing, that is a bailout."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Americans should be angry, said Taibbi, but instead of
understanding the complexities of what happened, political
groups such as the Tea Party offer "bad, simplistic
explanations" while the Democrats offered none.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial media were also to blame, as they "mostly
write for the people who work in Wall Street," he said, meaning
they have lost their objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He offers a tiny glimmer of hope with appointments such as
Elizabeth Warren, a fierce critic of Wall Street who is helping
set up a new government watchdog to protect consumers, in a
world where most politicians are either "willing or ignorant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When we get to the point when we have to save them every
time they screw up, then we are no longer regulating them, we
are no longer governing them, we are servicing them," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Christine Kearney, editing by Mark Egan and

			Chevron Affirms Full-Year Net Production Guidance for 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)
			today affirmed its previously 
      stated full-year net production guidance for 2010 of 2,750 MBOED based 
      on the first nine months&#8217; 2010 average WTI price of $78. This represents 
      a two percent increase from 2009 actual net production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The corporation is issuing this statement following a recent news report 
      that implied the company had revised its production guidance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the world&#8217;s leading integrated energy companies, with 
      subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company&#8217;s success is 
      driven by the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their 
      application of the most innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is 
      involved in virtually every facet of the energy industry. The company 
      explores for, produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; 
      refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and other energy 
      products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products; generates power 
      and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency solutions; 
      and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels. 
      Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is 
      available at www.chevron.com.

		&lt;p&gt;
			This press release contains forward-looking statements relating to 
      Chevron's operations that are based on management's current 
      expectations, estimates and projections about the petroleum, chemicals 
      and other energy-related industries. Words such as "anticipates," 
      "expects," "intends," "plans," "targets," "projects," "believes," 
      "seeks," "schedules," "estimates," "budgets" and similar expressions are 
      intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements 
      are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain 
      risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond the

      otherwise.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ 
      materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing 
      crude oil and natural gas prices; changing refining, marketing and 
      chemical margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of 
      exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness 
      of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; technological 
      developments; the results of operations and financial condition of 
      equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company's 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company's net 
      production or manufacturing facilities or delivery/transportation 
      networks due to war, accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe 
      weather or crude oil production quotas that might be imposed by the 
      Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries; the potential liability 
      for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future 
      environmental regulations and litigation; significant investment or 
      product changes under existing or future environmental statutes, 
      regulations and litigation; the potential liability resulting from other 
      pending or future litigation; the company's future acquisition or 
      disposition of assets and gains and losses from asset dispositions or 
      impairments; government-mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, 
      industry-specific taxes, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on 
      scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with 
      the U.S. dollar; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally 
      accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; and 
      the factors set forth under the heading "Risk Factors" on pages 30 
      through 32 of the company's 2009 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 
      addition, such statements could be affected by general domestic and 
      international economic and political conditions. Unpredictable or 
      unknown factors not discussed in this press release could also have 
      material adverse effects on forward-looking statements.

      Cloudium Systems (&#8220;Cloudium&#8221; or the &#8220;Company&#8221;), the Irish company 
      focused on developing products and solutions for virtual desktops and 
      cloud computing, today announces a partnership with Microsoft. The 
      partnership was announced at TechEd, Microsoft&#8217;s premier technical 
      education event, in Berlin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Cloudium Systems
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Formed in 2009, Cloudium Systems is a pioneer in the creation of 
      innovative, high-performance solutions for rich media applications - 
      spanning desktop virtualisation to IPTV &#8211; which will advance the 
      continuing development of cloud computing and the use of the &#8216;virtual 
      desktop&#8217;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Company was founded by veterans of networking and virtualisation who 
      have a track record of creating new businesses and bringing new products 
      to market based on technological innovation. Cloudium currently employs 
      a team of 14 in Limerick and Dublin and expects to create a further 25 
      jobs over the next 3 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloudium has completed a capital raising from Powerscourt Capital, 
      Enterprise Ireland and a range of private investors. The Company is now 
      well capitalised to deliver on its near-term growth objectives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Partnership with Microsoft
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloudium is today announcing a partnership with Microsoft and the 
      licensing of Microsoft&#8217;s RemoteFX technology for its products. 
      Cloudium is also launching its VCA2000 product family; its first product 
      range to incorporate Microsoft&#8217;s RemoteFX technology. This 
      product family is a next generation, high performance, low cost, energy 
      efficient &#8216;zero client&#8217; solution based on Cloudium developed CA2000 
      semiconductor. The product will provide users the same experience as a 
      desktop PC from a virtual desktop.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloudium Systems CEO, John Hickey, commented:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;The world of computing is on a cusp of a paradigm shift with a move 
      from the personal computer to a &#8216;pervasive&#8217; or &#8216;virtual&#8217; desktop that 
      can be accessed anywhere and anytime &#8211; a concept described in the 
      increasingly used term &#8220;cloud computing.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Our vision is to provide customers with &#8216;pervasive desktops&#8217; that 
      can be accessed anywhere and anytime. Hardware based, high performance, 
      full fidelity, zero clients solutions &#8211; which are enabled by our VCA2000 
      product family - are a first step in this direction.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Conor Moran, Director of Powerscourt Capital Partners, added:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Industry drivers and application trends clearly indicate a shift 
      towards new cloud based desktops and Cloudium Systems is ideally placed 
      with its flexible architecture, to take full advantage of this fantastic 
      opportunity.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			John Hickey, concluded:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;The confidence shown by our investors, in supporting Cloudium 
      Systems, highlights the value of our unique technology and is strong 
      validation of our business model, market strategy and product 
      development plan.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Nov 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's (XOM.N) group refiner
in Japan, TonenGeneral Sekiyu KK (5012.T), said on Friday it is
unlikely to make any announcement in the near future on how it
plans to comply with the country's new rules on heavy oil
cracking efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; TonenGeneral late last month submitted to the government a
number of options, including rationalisation of its current
operations and possible new investment, that it said would help
it meet trade ministry regulations calling for either building
new residue cracking units or scrapping refinery capacity by
March 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry watchers have said only the latter looks feasible at
a time of peaking population and an expected decline in oil
demand in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As you are likely aware, the compliance date is in 2014,"
the company's director David Csapo told two reporters on the
sidelines of a third-quarter earnings announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So that's a long time from now. Naturally as a company, we
tend to try and preserve flexibility. We are not going to discuss
the number of options and which options are more likely than
others. That's just not something we're going to debate in any
public forum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Csapo added that the company would take some time to reach
any decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For related analysis and Q+A on the METI regulations, and a

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group has hit a snag in its efforts to win government approval to pay back a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Robert Garrigus won his first PGA Tour event on Sunday with a sizzling eight-under-par 64 to win the Disney Classic at Lake Buena Vista while overnight leader Roland Thatcher imploded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garrigus, who started the day five shots back of Thatcher, carded eight birdies to secure the win with a 21-under total of 267 that was three ahead of fellow American Thatcher (72).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The win in the final PGA Tour event of the season should help ease the pain of his final-hole meltdown at the St. Jude Classic at Memphis earlier in the season where Garrigus blew the lead with a triple bogey on the 18th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Its great to be able to close this one off and figuratively shut everybody up about Memphis," Garrigus told reporters. "Every time I got an interview it was about Memphis, but it really helped me just to realize that it's not that big a deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thatcher, who started the day four shots clear of the pack, bogeyed 12, 16 and 17 but made par on the final hole to secure second place and his PGA Tour card for next season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't imagine having a more stressful moment in my life, up to this point," said Thatcher. "So to be able to come out on the other side of that, on the good side of it is just amazing for me."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Americans Rickie Fowler, Johnson Wagner and Spencer Levin all tied for third, four shots behind Garrigus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Simon Evans in Miami; Editing by Frank Pingue)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - People with mild heart failure lived longer and fared better by adding Pfizer's drug Inspra to standard medications, a finding that could widely expand use of such drugs in healthier patients, researchers said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ironic twist, another study presented at the American Heart Association meeting showed Johnson  Johnson's Natrecor heart failure drug -- which is not widely used because of long-standing safety concerns -- is in fact safe, but provides little benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 5 million Americans have heart failure, a chronic condition that costs the United States an estimated $30 billion a year to manage. Unlike a heart attack, in which a heart artery becomes blocked, heart failure is gradual. It occurs when the heart loses its ability to efficiently pump blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients taking Inspra along with standard treatment were 37 percent less likely to die or be hospitalized for heart failure compared with those who were taking standard treatment alone, Dr. Faiez Zannad, a researcher from France's Henri Poincare University of Nancy, told the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the results were in line with strong results seen in previous trials of Inspra in sicker heart failure patients and now should expand the drug's use to those with milder disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest trial was stopped in May when it became clear that it would succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspra, which is sold under the generic name eplerenone, is a member of the family of medicines called aldosterone antagonists that also includes an older generic drug called spironolactone.

&lt;p&gt; * Cuts death, hospitalizations by 37 pct in study&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Seen opening treatment to those with mild heart failure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson and Julie Steenhuysen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - People with mild heart failure
lived longer and fared better by adding Pfizer's (PFE.N) drug
Inspra to standard medications, a finding that could widely
expand use of such drugs in healthier patients, researchers
said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an ironic twist, another study presented at the American
Heart Association meeting showed Johnson  Johnson's (JNJ.N)
Natrecor heart failure drug -- which is not widely used because
of long-standing safety concerns -- is in fact safe, but
provides little benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nearly 5 million Americans have heart failure, a chronic
condition that costs the United States an estimated $30 billion
a year to manage. Unlike a heart attack, in which a heart
artery becomes blocked, heart failure is gradual. It occurs
when the heart loses its ability to efficiently pump blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients taking Inspra along with standard treatment were
37 percent less likely to die or be hospitalized for heart
failure compared with those who were taking standard treatment
alone, Dr. Faiez Zannad, a researcher from France's Henri
Poincare University of Nancy, told the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the results were in line with strong results seen
in previous trials of Inspra in sicker heart failure patients
and now should expand the drug's use to those with milder
disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest trial was stopped in May when it became clear
that it would succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inspra, which is sold under the generic name eplerenone, is
a member of the family of medicines called aldosterone
antagonists that also includes an older generic drug called
spironolactone. They block a hormone that the body uses to hold
onto salt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new study should greatly expand the use of this family
of drugs, Zannad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Now we are filling the gap and we have all the continuum
of heart failure -- after a heart attack, among the most severe
patients, and now mild patients are eligible," Zannad said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inspra is currently approved for patients that have had a
heart attack and have heart failure. Spironolactone is approved
for patients with severe heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For mild heart failure, patients typically now take drugs
known as beta blockers and ACE inhibitors, two standard
medicines. Zannad predicted aldosterone antagonists will now be
added to their drug regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A second study presented at the meeting answered some
lingering questions about JJ's heart drug Natrecor, whose use
plunged in 2005 after several studies suggested it could damage
the kidneys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JJ, which in 2003 acquired Natrecor through its $2.4
billion purchase of biotech company Scios Inc, fought hard to
counter the negative findings, but most doctors stopped
prescribing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JJ continues to sell the product, but doctors say the
company does not actively market the niche drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers on Sunday said a trial sponsored by JJ
surprisingly showed the medicine does not harm the kidneys, as
earlier studies suggested, but is minimally effective at
helping people with heart failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A big former use of the medicine was frequent infusions
among patients treated outside of the hospital, even though the
drug was not approved for that population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no patient who should receive intermittent  
infusion," Dr. Clyde Yancy of Baylor University Medical Center
in Dallas, told the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The trial provided very little evidence that its addition
would improve the outcome of patients with acute decompensated
heart failure who are receiving excellent standard of care,"
said Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the study "... joins a large number of other trials
conducted with a variety of agents since the 1970s in acute
heart failure that have not shown a clinical benefit. How to

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's main militant group said on Tuesday it was behind an attack on an Exxon Mobil oil platform and it had kidnapped seven Nigerian workers, the second such raid for which it has claimed responsibility in a week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. energy firm said armed men boarded the offshore facility, operated by its Mobil Producing Nigeria unit in a joint venture with the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), late on Sunday but gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said it had detonated explosives rigged to the facility and kidnapped seven local workers.

 (Adds statement from militant group)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nick Tattersall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAGOS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Nigeria's main militant group said
on Tuesday it was behind an attack on an Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) oil
platform and it had kidnapped seven Nigerian workers, the second
such raid for which it has claimed responsibility in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. energy firm said armed men boarded the offshore
facility, operated by its Mobil Producing Nigeria unit in a
joint venture with the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation (NNPC), late on Sunday but gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND)
said it had detonated explosives rigged to the facility and
kidnapped seven local workers. There was no independent
confirmation of any damage to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group warned of further attacks in the heartland of
Africa's biggest oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the coming weeks, the Movement for the Emancipation of
the Niger Delta will launch a major operation that will
simultaneously affect oil facilities across the Niger Delta," it
said in a statement emailed to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previous campaigns by MEND fighters have knocked out a
significant proportion of the OPEC member's oil production,
currently averaging about 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), and
cost it as much as $1 billion a month in lost revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renewed unrest in the region would be an embarrassment for
President Goodluck Jonathan in the run-up to April elections.
Jonathan is the first head of state from the Niger Delta and
brokered an amnesty with militants more than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon attack took place a week after a similar raid on a
rig operated by the exploration firm Afren (AFRE.L) in the same
waters off the state of Akwa Ibom, in which two Americans, two
Frenchmen, two Indonesians and a Canadian were kidnapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The military threatened on Saturday to raid the camps of
armed gangs in the creeks of the Niger Delta, warning civilians
to leave before what could be its first major offensive in the
region since a government amnesty programme began last August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MILITARY ACTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEND said one military operation had already been carried
out against one of its camps in Rivers state on Monday, adding
clashes would endanger the lives of the hostages it was holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Expatriate hostages held at this location had to be removed
and relocated for their safety as rocket attacks by the Nigerian
military came very close," the group said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There was no immediate confirmation from the military of any
operation in Rivers state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A security source said Sunday's attack was took placed at a
platform in the Oso field, one of Nigeria's biggest condensate
fields with about eight platforms whose total output averages
about 75,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Relevant government and security agencies have been
informed and appropriate response measures are under way," Exxon
said in a statement, without commenting on the potential effect
on output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil firms in the Niger Delta suffered years of attacks until
the amnesty programme bought more than a year of relative peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The militants were always divided, and although many of the
field commanders agreed to lay down their weapons, new leaders
have started to emerge, security experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the attack on Afren, MEND claimed responsibility for
two car bombings in Abuja which killed at least 10 people near
an independence day parade on Oct. 1. It was the group's first
attack in the capital.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday it has sold more than 1 million of its new hands-free Kinect gaming systems in the first 10 days since launch, putting it on track to beat its target of 5 million sales by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is hoping the Kinect will help revitalize sales of its Xbox game console this holiday shopping season and counter competing motion-based gaming systems from Nintendo Co, which makes the Wii, and Sony Corp, which introduced its Move product two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a strong start," said Don Mattrick, head of Microsoft's game unit, in a telephone interview on Monday.

Monday it has sold more than 1 million of its new hands-free

(XOM.N) oil platform off the Nigerian coast late on Sunday,
kidnapping eight Nigerian crew members in the second such raid
in the region in a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. energy firm said armed men boarded the offshore
facility, operated by its Mobil Producing Nigeria arm in a joint
venture with the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum

speedboats in the Oso field off the southern state of Akwa Ibom,
one of Nigeria's biggest condensate fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Relevant government and security agencies have been
informed and appropriate response measures are under way at this
time," Exxon said in a statement on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Akwa Ibom is one of the states in the Niger Delta, a vast
wetlands area containing onshore and offshore facilities that

August, buying more than a year of relative peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the militants were always divided, and although many of
the field commanders agreed to lay down their weapons, new
leaders have started to emerge, security experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Militants attacked a rig operated by exploration firm Afren
(AFRE.L) in the same waters off Akwa Ibom a week ago, kidnapping
two Americans, two Frenchmen, two Indonesians and a Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That attack was claimed by the Movement for the Emancipation
of the Niger Delta (MEND), the main militant group in the
region, which has threatened further strikes against energy
facilities. [ID:nLDE6AB0L5] [ID:nLDE6A708L]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A resurgence in violence would embarrass President Goodluck
Jonathan, the first head of state from the Niger Delta, who
faces a tough battle in elections due in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jonathan brokered last year's amnesty, seen as one of the
main achievements of his administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The military threatened on Saturday to raid camps of
criminal gangs in the creeks of the Niger Delta, and told
civilians in the vicinity to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A major offensive by the armed forces would be the first in
the Niger Delta since the amnesty began last August.

      Company's Board of Directors, effective Dec. 31, 2010. As a result of

      privilege to serve on the Board and be part of The Coca-Cola Company. 
      Under Muhtar Kent&#8217;s leadership, the Company has a very clear long-term 
      growth strategy and an exciting future ahead of it. I wish Muhtar, his

      employees worldwide all the best as they build even greater success.&#8221;

      Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said, &#8220;On behalf of 
      everyone at Coca-Cola, I want to thank Cathie for her many invaluable 
      years of service as a Director. She has always been a thoughtful and 
      wise voice on our Board and we will miss her counsel and perspectives. 
      This is a very exciting opportunity for Cathie to make a difference in 
      the lives of the children of New York City, and we wish her every 
      success in her new role.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Ms. Black served as Director of The Coca-Cola Company from April 1990 to 
      May 1991, and was again elected as Director in 1993.

			Pepco 
      Gets $3.9 Million Contract
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pepco Energy Services Inc., a subsidiary of Pepco Holdings Inc. 
      (NYSE: POM), has been 
      awarded a $3.9 million contract to design and build a plant at the Alpha 
      Ridge Landfill, near Baltimore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The contract award by Howard County, Maryland, entails the construction 
      of a new 1 MW landfill gas-to-energy generating plant at the Alpha Ridge 
      Landfill.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new plant will use methane gas as a fuel for a reciprocating engine 
      and generator to produce 1 MW of electric power. The electric power 
      produced at the plant will serve the local utility grid and provide 
      power for electric vehicles used at the landfill.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This landfill gas-to-energy project demonstrates Howard County&#8217;s vow to 
      optimize its existing assets and to have a positive impact on the 
      environment. It is one of the most important environmental-friendly 
      projects for Howard County. The Howard County continues to look for all 
      possible options to save energy, money and the environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The electricity sold at the plant will generate revenues for Howard 
      County that will help offset their landfill costs. Additionally, at full 
      capacity, the plant is expected to reduce roughly 5,400 metric tons of 
      carbon dioxide emissions per year, which would otherwise be produced 
      from traditional fossil fuel power plants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Howard County indicated that the design and permitting for the project 
      are currently underway. The plant is expected to become operational by 
      early 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron 
      Retains Neutral Rec
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are maintaining our Neutral rating on Chevron Corporation (NYSE: 
      CVX), reflecting 
      lower-than-expected third quarter 2010 results. Higher costs incurred in 
      association with the Gulf of Mexico (&#8220;GoM&#8221;) drilling moratorium and 
      lower U.S. volumes have impaired the company&#8217;s performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			3Q10 Quarter Recap
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s earnings per share (excluding foreign-currency effects) came 
      in at $2.06, running behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.15. On a 
      year-over-year basis, earnings moved up 14.4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Quarterly revenues hiked 6.6% year over year to $49.7 billion and 
      exceeded our estimates by 3.3% amid stronger oil and gas realizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. net oil-equivalent production dipped 7.1% from the prior year, 
      while the international operations observed a 4.6% year over year rise 
      in volumes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the end of the quarter, the company had $11.0 billion in cash and 
      total debt of $10.6 billion, with a debt-to-total capitalization ratio 
      of about 9.4%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Defying the jaded volume growth in the domestic sector in the quarter, 
      Chevron comes up with a robust production outlook supported by the 
      number of major deepwater projects scheduled to come online over the 
      next few years. Major start-ups during the last few months include the 
      Tahiti and Perdido in the GoM, Frade offshore Brazil and Tombua-Landana 
      in Angola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lately, Chevron announced its plans to invest approximately $7.5 billion 
      to develop two large fields &#8211; Jack and St. Malo &#8211; in deepwater GoM. The 
      company has also acquired a 70% operated interest in three deepwater 
      concessions in Liberia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Driven by a bundle of development projects all over the globe and the 
      exploration prospects in China, Liberia and Turkey, we believe that 
      Chevron will be able to achieve its long-term production growth target 
      of 4&#8211;5% per annum for 2014&#8211; 2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management&#8217;s decision to restart the quarterly buyback of shares not 
      only highlights the company&#8217;s commitment to create value for 
      shareholders but also underlines its confidence on commodity prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We also appreciate Chevron&#8217;s refurbishment of its asset base through 
      disposition of high-cost low-profit assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite all these positive aspects, Chevron fails to escape the hazards 
      associated with an exploration and production company. The exposure to 
      volatile oil and gas prices and complex market forces continue to remain 
      an overhang over the company&#8217;s results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s business in international markets faces risks such as 
      embargoes and/or expropriation of assets, exchange rate risks, terrorism 
      and political/civil threat. Moreover, the company also depends on 
      property acquisitions to expand its resource base. Failure to seal 
      lucrative deals in the future could negatively impact the growth rate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CSC 
      to License Billing Software
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Virginia-based Computer Sciences Corp. (NYSE: CSC) 
      announced that it has signed a multi-year licensing agreement with 
      leading insurance group, Shelter Mutual Insurance Company of Columbia. 
      Financial terms were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As per the agreement, Computer Sciences will license its Exceed Billing 
      Software to Missouri-based Shelter Mutual Insurance. The software adds 
      new capabilities in the insurance business that make the billing process 
      faster, more cost effective and the settlement of claims easier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shelter Mutual Insurance will deploy Exceed software suites for all its 
      insurance businesses (life and personal and commercial property and 
      casualty (PC) insurance) as well as other businesses. By leveraging the 
      enhanced capabilities of the software for an extended period of 11 
      years, the insurance company will be able to cut down costs related to 
      billing services, particularly in the Midwestern and Southern states.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Computer Sciences&#8217; software will replace the insurance company&#8217;s 
      existing PC legacy system. Along with the Exceed software, Shelter 
      Mutual Insurance will also deploy Computer Sciences&#8217; multiple policy 
      administration systems, including the CyberLife software specifically 
      targeted at managing life insurance businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In September, Computer Sciences inked a licensing and maintenance deal 
      with a developing insurance company, to license its New Business 
      Accelerator (nbAccelerator) and Insurance Optics Business Analytics 
      solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the help of these solutions, the insurance carrier will be able to 
      acquire new businesses, simplify its activities relating to submission 
      of forms, processing of various insurance policies and assessment of 
      customer data for analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We remain encouraged by Computer Sciences&#8217; insurance deals since they 
      are an indication of the effectiveness of its products. We look forward 
      to a spate of similar deals, going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, Computer Sciences&#8217; unimpressive second quarter 2011 keeps us on 
      sidelines. The quarter&#8217;s top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, 
      although the bottom line was a penny ahead. Both revenues and earnings 
      per share were down from the year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite the quarter&#8217;s disappointment, we remain optimistic about the 
      company&#8217;s outlook for fiscal 2011, based on its strong new business 
      bookings, enhanced product portfolio, growing customer base and the 
      economic recovery. However, contract delays are expected to keep a lid 
      on earnings for the next quarter&#8217;s earnings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currently, Computer Sciences has a short-term Hold recommendation, as is 
      indicated by the Zacks #3 Rank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ETP's 
      Projects Nearing Completion
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Energy Transfer Partners L.P. (NYSE: ETP), 
      a master limited partnership (&#8220;MLP&#8221;), announced that two pipeline 
      projects (Fayetteville Express Pipeline and the Tiger Pipeline) that 
      will transport shale gas further downstream, will come online several 
      months ahead of schedule and significantly below budget.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fayetteville Express Pipeline (a 185 mile 42-inch interstate 
      pipeline originating in the Fayetteville Shale and extending through 
      Arkansas and into Mississippi) and the Tiger Pipeline (a 175 mile 
      42-inch interstate pipeline originating near Carthage, Texas and ending 
      near Delhi, Louisiana) are both expected to be in service on December 1, 
      2010. Additionally, the combined project costs for these two pipelines 
      are expected to total $2.02 billion, $200 million under most recent 
      estimates and $480 million under original estimates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fayetteville Express Pipeline &#8211; a 50/50 joint venture with Kinder 
      Morgan Energy Partners L.P. (NYSE: KMP) 
      serving the Fayetteville Shale producing region in Arkansas with the 
      capacity to move up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day &#8211; was 
      earlier anticipated to be fully operational by the first quarter of 2011 
      (interim service started in early October).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energy Transfer further noted that costs for the project are likely to 
      total approximately $1.01 billion, $115 million less than the most 
      recent estimate and down $290 million from the original projection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On the other hand, the 100% Energy Transfer owned and operated Tiger 
      Pipeline (aimed at serving the Haynesville Shale and Bossier Sands 
      producing regions in Louisiana and East Texas) was originally scheduled 
      to have its initial capacity of 2 billion cubic feet per day in service 
      during mid-2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of now, Energy Transfer expects project costs to be approximately 
      $1.01 billion, down $85 million from the most recent estimate and down 
      $190 million from the original projection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The earlier-than-expected completion of these large-scale, interstate 
      projects, together with the cost savings the partnership is able to 
      achieve is likely to translate into significant distributable cash flows 
      for Energy Transfer&#8217;s unitholders in 2011 and the subsequent years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energy Transfer units currently retain a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates 
      into a short-term Hold rating. We are also maintaining our long-term 
      Neutral recommendation on the stock.

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Nov 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 


--  Today, POP, a leading digital agency, announced it worked with
    Microsoft to launch Games on Demand to the web with a new PC Game
    Store. POP and Microsoft worked together to design and build the new
    Games for Windows Marketplace from the ground up to create a highly
    engaging experience for gamers.

    

--  POP worked with Microsoft to create and implement an improved and
    streamlined experience to its gamers, including:
    --  Online access, anywhere. Optimized for speed, the store allows for
        ultra-fast downloads; this means fewer clicks to purchase and
        download, delivering faster turnaround for game play.
    --  Game search functionality. Gamers can search by title or genre to
        quickly find the games they want; they can even find new games
        from their favorite publishers with dedicated publisher pages.
    --  Fresh design. The clean, intuitive look and feel makes browsing
        for games a simple, enjoyable experience. Gamers can easily
        navigate between pages as they search for the perfect game.
    --  Direct integration with Xbox LIVE services and a custom built
        Microsoft e-commerce engine, which allows users to see their
        gamerscore, avatar, and complete purchases with Microsoft points
        associated with their account, as well as see what games networked
        friends are also playing and have purchased.
    --  Easier administration. POP designed and developed an experience
        that showcases an initial catalogue of 100 game titles with a
        custom importer reducing the need for manual entry. The content
        management system (CMS) allows Games for Windows to easily add
        supporting rich media.
    --  A new game recommendation engine that allows the Games for Windows
        team to create "collections" of games based on tagging and in
        response to customer feedback

    

Commentary

"The new Games for Windows Marketplace delivers a much
improved experience and instant gratification for players," said POP's
Founder and President, Bill Predmore. "There's no doubt this new
experience solidifies Microsoft as a serious PC gaming platform for
digital gaming downloads." 

    "Through our collaboration with POP, we've created a digital store that
makes it easier to find and purchase online games from start to finish,"
said Avi Ben-Menahem, Executive Producer for Games for Windows LIVE at
Microsoft. "The site delivers a streamlined experience and removes the
barriers between gamers and the games they love making it easier than
ever for millions of gamers to quickly access PC games."

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BC, Nov 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 

Insiderslab.com released new critical reports that disclosed the
favourable insider trade found in Starbucks (SBUX), Microsoft (MSFT), MGM
Resorts (MGM), Coca-Cola (KO), &amp; Chimera Investment (CIM) today.

    It is a smart investment strategy when researching or picking stocks to
start from the larger size transaction. Obviously, the more money that is
logged on to a single insider trade, the more significant that trade will
be. On another aspect, the percentage change of an executive's total
holding due to one trade should also be considered. The greater magnitude
of an insider's purchase usually shows more confidence in his company's
future performance.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Nov 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SOA Software, a leading SOA and cloud services Governance provider, today
announced the availability of a comprehensive suite of governance
products to help customers successfully plan, build and run applications
for the IBM WebSphere Business Services Fabric.

    SOA Software's products provide Unified SOA Governance Automation for the
IBM WebSphere Business Services Fabric. This allows customers to
confidently use IBM WebSphere products as part of a heterogeneous
enterprise SOA environment sharing services with other commercial SOA
platforms including Microsoft, RedHat, Oracle, and SAP.

    Unified SOA Governance breaks down into distinct areas; Planning
Governance is about making sure that you are building the right things,
Development Governance is about making sure you're building them the
right way, and Operational Governance is about ensuring that what you've
built is behaving correctly.

    "We are very pleased to be able to announce this comprehensive set of
product integrations that help customers deliver uniform, consistent
governance of WebSphere centric SOA programs," said Alistair Farquharson,
chief technology officer of SOA Software. "The strong collaboration we
have with the IBM engineering teams allowed us to bring fully functional
products with comprehensive integration, to help our joint customers
ensure the success of their SOA initiatives."

    IBM Customers add SOA Software's Unified SOA Governance Automation
solution to the IBM WebSphere Business Services Fabric to: 


--  Ensure that services they identify, design and build using the
    WebSphere Business Services Fabric products are relevant to and
    consumable by applications they plan, design, build and deploy using
    other technologies like Microsoft or Oracle, or buy from other vendors
    like SAP.
--  Make services they expose from applications running on WebSphere
    Business Services Fabric products visible to and compliant with
    enterprise policies defined, enforced and audited across other
    platforms; and make services they design and build using other
    platforms like Microsoft and open source environments visible to and
    compliant with enterprise policies defined, enforced and audited
    across their WebSphere Business Services Fabric applications.
--  Promote and ensure consistent alignment between demand from service
    consumers and the supply of services through Consumer Contract
    Provisioning.

    

SOA Software's platform-independent Unified SOA Governance
Automation solution promotes the use of best-practices throughout an
enterprise SOA program regardless of where services and consumers are
designed, built, deployed and operated. Portfolio Manager, Repository
Manager, Service Manager and Policy Manager integrate seamlessly with
development and runtime products from most commercial platforms including
IBM, SAP, Microsoft, and Oracle, as well as RedHat and other open source
providers. 

    Policy Manager provides a powerful policy framework for operational,
compliance and Quality of Service policy definition, attachment and
auditing. Service Manager provides a set of intermediaries that abstract
service and application containers from the implementation, enforcement
and auditing of operational, security, management and QoS policies.
Policy Manager is available with specific versions targeted and specific
platforms, and Service Manager is available for a wide range of service
and application containers.

    SOA Software's governance solution for IBM WebSphere Business Services
Fabric includes:


--  Service Manager Agent for IBM WebSphere Teamworks
--  Service Manager Agent for IBM WebSphere Process Server
--  Service Manager Agent for IBM WebSphere Enterprise Service Bus
--  Policy Manager for WebSphere Service Registry and Repository (WSRR)
--  Service Manager Agent for IBM WebSphere Application Server

    

SOA Software also offers comprehensive governance solutions for
other IBM products with:


--  Policy Manager for WebSphere DataPower
--  Service Manager Agent for IBM WebSphere Message Broker
--  Repository Manager Asset Adapter for IBM Rational ClearCase
--  Repository Manager Asset Adapter for IBM Rational ClearQuest

--  Portfolio Manager for IBM WebSphere Business Services Fabric

			OptumHealth Debuts OptumizeMe Fitness App to Help Microsoft&#174; Windows 
      Phone 7 Users Connect and Compete for Better Health
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			OptumizeMe Turns Healthy Pursuits into Fun Fitness Challenges with 
      Online Friends 
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Selected by Microsoft as a Premier Windows Phone 7 Launch App
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OptumHealth, one of the nation&#8217;s largest health and wellness companies, 
      today announced the release of the OptumizeMe mobile application. 
      Designed exclusively for the many new Windows&#174; Phone 7 devices, 
      OptumizeMe helps people pursue their health goals through their own 
      online social networks, where they can track their progress and issue 
      fun fitness challenges to their friends, family and coworkers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OptumizeMe, selected by Microsoft as a Premier Launch App, is designed 
      to maximize the features of the Windows Phone 7 platform. It is 
      available now, free of charge, at the Windows&#174; Phone Marketplace. The 
      app is part of the Microsoft Windows Phone 7 showcase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With OptumizeMe, people can create and challenge each other to fitness 
      competitions, and trade both encouragement and &#8220;digs&#8221; along the way. 
      Users can network with friends using the app, or link to their existing 
      social networks to create new fitness challenges. The application tracks 
      their progress on challenges, and rewards them with virtual badges as 
      they achieve their goals. OptumizeMe also uses the Windows Phone 7&#8217;s 
      location capabilities to help fitness enthusiasts locate and join open 
      challenges happening near them.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;If you&#8217;re the kind of person who lives life on the go, wants to 
      increase your fitness and can&#8217;t resist a good challenge, OptumizeMe is 
      the app for you,&#8221; said Rob Webb, CEO of OptumHealth Care Solutions. &#8220;It 
      makes living a healthy lifestyle easier and more fun for people with 
      Windows Phone 7 mobile devices by creating connections with friends who 
      share similar fitness goals. Most of us already use our social networks 
      to stay in touch with each other, so why not use them to share the 
      experience of getting healthier together?&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a recent New England Journal of Medicine report, 
      healthy behavior actually spreads through social connections. OptumizeMe 
      links with online social networks like Facebook to make healthy activity 
      a social activity. For example, OptumizeMe can post updates to a user&#8217;s 
      Facebook wall to allow friends to monitor the person&#8217;s progress and post 
      messages of support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Windows Phone 7 is backed by a rich developer ecosystem that is 
      creating a variety of quality apps and games designed to help people get 
      the most out of their phone,&#8221; said Todd Brix, senior director, Windows 
      Phone Marketplace, Microsoft Corp. &#8220;OptumizeMe is a great example of the 
      innovative apps available on Windows Phone Marketplace that take 
      advantage of Windows Phone 7&#8217;s unique features and design.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sixty mobile operators in 30 countries will offer Windows Phone 7 mobile 
      devices, available in the United States Nov. 8.

			JPS Health Network Licenses TriZetto&#8217;s QicLink Extended Enterprise 
      Solution to Automate and Improve Administrative Efficiency
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The 
      TriZetto Group, Inc. today announced that JPS 
      Health Network in Ft. Worth, Texas, has licensed TriZetto's 
      QicLink Extended Enterprise&#8482; software and services to improve the 
      administrative efficiency of its information systems and automate more 
      of its administrative processes in replacement of its existing system. 
      Providing health coverage to 50,000 uninsured in Tarrant County, Texas, 
      JPS expects to go live on TriZetto's QicLink&#8482; system in Q1 of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our 10-year-old administration system was being phased-out, and we 
      wanted something new that would better address our needs for 
      user-friendliness, extensive EDI functionality and data import 
      capabilities,&#8221; said Patty Angell, Director of Benefit Services for JPS. 
      &#8220;We reviewed four different vendors and felt that the QicLink system 
      spoke for itself, although our own opinion was supplemented with a 
      glowing recommendation from one of our key providers. The QicLink system 
      package licensed by JPS also includes the ClinicaLogic&#8482;, 
      QicLink 
      Workflow and QicLink 
      Benefits Exchange integrated ancillary modules that support claims 
      screening, claims automation and web-based access, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;JPS is the 109th payer to depend on the QicLink system to 
      run its core business,&#8221; said Rob Scavo, President of TriZetto&#8217;s Emerging 
      Markets Group. &#8220;I think JPS&#8217;s selection reflects the value customers see 
      in the investments TriZetto has made to continually advance QicLink&#8217;s 
      capabilities and the best-in-breed partner solutions we have brought to 
      bear under the TriZetto 
      Premier Partnership Program&#174;. We have focused very sharply on 
      expanding our solutions in concert with the increasingly sophisticated 
      requirements of the benefits administration industry, the evolution of Integrated 
      Healthcare Management and the demands of healthcare 
      reform.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Chase Doubles SBA Loans to Become #1 in U.S., Helps 3,300 Small 
      Businesses in 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Loans increase 170% from year earlier; dollar volume up 217%
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase announced today that it more than doubled its Small Business 
      Administration loan volume in fiscal 2010 to become the nation&#8217;s largest 
      SBA lender, helping 250 more businesses than the next largest lender.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase&#8217;s 3,386 loans represent a 170% increase in SBA loans from a year 
      earlier. Chase lent $434 million in SBA loans in fiscal 2010, up 217% 
      and making it second-largest SBA lender in dollars.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The SBA loan program allows us to reach thousands of small businesses 
      that need the financing to run their businesses and meet their payroll, 
      especially during these challenging times,&#8221; said Michael Cleary, head of 
      Business Banking at Chase. &#8220;Helping small businesses grow is important 
      because they are core to the U.S. economy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase&#8217;s SBA 7(a) and Express loans were a crucial part of its 37% 
      increase in lending to small businesses through working capital, term 
      loans for expansion, commercial mortgages, lines of credit, and business 
      credit cards. Through the first three quarters of 2010, Chase lent $7.4 
      billion to businesses with sales of less than $20 million, up from $5.4 
      billion a year earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since last November, Chase also has hired more than 500 additional 
      business bankers and approved more than $250 million in small business 
      credit after giving rejected loans a second look.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In SBA lending, Chase ranked first in both dollars and loans in New York 
      and was the top lender in loans in Arizona, Illinois and Indiana and in 
      Dallas-Ft. Worth, Houston and San Antonio, Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In total, Chase ranked within the top three in both number of loans and 
      dollars in 12 local district offices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Includes increase in loans and dollar amount from 2009.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Mimecast Launches Support for Microsoft BPOS, Extending the Business 
      Benefits and Reducing the Risks of Migration
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Integrated Service Offers Support for BPOS Migration, Granular 
      eDiscovery and Long-Term Email Archiving and a 100% Service Availability 
      SLA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mimecast&#174;, a leading supplier of cloud-based email security, 
      continuity, 
      policy control and archiving, 
      has today announced support for Microsoft Business Productivity Online 
      Standard Suite (BPOS), easing migration headaches and extending the 
      business benefits of Microsoft&#8217;s latest messaging and collaboration 
      tools.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mimecast&#8217;s services fully integrate with Microsoft&#8217;s hosted email 
      platform, offering 100% service availability SLA and building on the 
      benefits of BPOS by offering powerful email archiving, as well as 
      granular eDiscovery and legal hold capabilities. BPOS is Microsoft&#8217;s 
      first email solution delivered entirely through a Software-as-a-Service 
      (SaaS) model, designed to give businesses a viable alternative to 
      managing their email system in-house. This SaaS model aligns perfectly 
      with Mimecast&#8217;s cloud-based services, already available for Microsoft&#8217;s 
      on-premise solution, Exchange 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Momentum is building behind BPOS as businesses look to move 
      applications to the cloud and run leaner IT departments,&#8221; commented 
      Peter Bauer, co-founder and CEO of Mimecast. &#8220;But the shift to a fully 
      hosted email environment is a big jump, both culturally and technically, 
      and IT teams are going to need to be sure they can migrate their data 
      safely.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s also important for organizations considering moving to BPOS to 
      realize that there are choices available to them in terms of how they 
      migrate, and in terms of specific areas of functionality where the 
      standard BPOS offering can be enhanced. As a true SaaS vendor, Mimecast 
      has seven years of experience in delivering services through the cloud, 
      so we are particularly excited by the prospect of BPOS gaining traction 
      in the market.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Laura DuBois, Program Vice President, IDC Storage Software and Solutions 
      at IDC, said; &#8220;As we move into 2011, we see demand for third party cloud 
      suppliers to offer services to complement the standard Microsoft BPOS 
      functionality. With archiving, in particular, businesses for whom 
      eDiscovery is critical will want more powerful search tools for their 
      users and more flexibility and control over how long they archive data. 
      We would expect these companies to look to augment BPOS with third party 
      solutions such as Mimecast, which already has a strong track record of 
      providing this level of functionality for on-premise and hosted 
      Exchange.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Benefits of the new Mimecast service for Microsoft BPOS include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Eliminating risk during migration: For a business where email 
        access is mission-critical even the shortest outage can be hugely 
        damaging. Mimecast acts as a failsafe for users, providing a 100% 
        availability SLA to keep businesses running at all times, through the 
        migration and beyond
      
		
		
			
				Long-term independent email archive: Deployed in tandem with 
        BPOS, Mimecast can provide an independent, long-term email archive 
        offering bottomless and easily-searchable storage. Mimecast&#8217;s system 
        stores all emails, including those deleted by users, for up to 10 years
      
		
		
			
				Advanced eDiscovery capabilities: The solution also offers 
        granular eDiscovery and legal hold capability to help organizations 
        meet their growing legal and compliance requirements. Mimecast&#8217;s 
        archiving capability, combined with the system&#8217;s Outlook-integrated 
        search tools, allows designated personnel to rapidly identify and 
        retrieve evidential quality data in compliance with the legal 
        restrictions

      delivers SaaS-based enterprise email management including archiving, 
      discovery, continuity, security and policy. By unifying disparate and 
      fragmented email environments into one holistic solution that is always 
      available from the cloud, Mimecast minimizes risk and reduces cost and 
      complexity, while providing total end-to-end control of email. Founded

			Pollo Campero and Fresh A-Peel Open in Downtown Disney&#174;
			Marketplace
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Latin chicken sensation launches first Orlando location, while 
      innovative new restaurant concept unveils menu of nutritious, delicious 
      foods
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Starting today, visitors to Downtown Disney&#174; Marketplace will 
      experience the amazing flavors of Pollo Campero, an international Latin 
      chicken quick service restaurant, and the first-of-its-kind Fresh 
      A-Peel, featuring made-to-order fresh selections.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Pollo Campero, Walt Disney World&#174; guests can savor 
      combinations of freshly prepared Latin chicken, unique flavorful side 
      dishes such as yuca fries and sweet plantains, and Latin drinks 
      including horchata and tamarindo. Pollo Campero&#8217;s fried 
      and grilled chicken is marinated, sending the distinctive Pollo Campero 
      flavor all the way to the bone. Fried chicken is hand-breaded in 
      seasoned flour and slowly pressure-cooked without trans-fats, resulting 
      in a flavorful and juicy meal. Grilled chicken features the taste of 
      lime and orange juices, red bell peppers, and a special blend of Latin 
      herbs and spices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today is a landmark day for Pollo Campero,&#8221; said Roberto Denegri, 
      president and chief operating officer of Campero USA. &#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled to 
      open our newest restaurant at Disney, the No. 1 family vacation 
      destination in the world. Most importantly, we&#8217;re excited to introduce 
      guests to the fantastic flavors of our legendary Latin chicken.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Inspired by Disney&#8217;s commitment to offer its guests great-tasting more 
      healthful options, award-winning restaurateur Larry Levy and Pollo 
      Campero teamed up to create Fresh A-Peel. Operating in the same location 
      as Pollo Campero, Fresh A-Peel features a nutritious and delicious array 
      of hot-off-the-grill items and chef-prepared salads and wraps, as well 
      as gluten-free cupcakes and bakery treats.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our menu relies on the freshest, most flavorful ingredients,&#8221; said Mr. 
      Levy. &#8220;I wanted to create nutritious foods even my grandchildren would 
      love. All of them have favorites on the Fresh A-Peel menu, whether they 
      are picky eaters or adventurous tasters.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The restaurant has a back-to-basics approach to serving family favorites 
      that are prepared in a better-for-you way. Chef-prepared entrees 
      including salads are made with locally grown produce and available in a 
      bowl or as a wrap, and all-natural burgers are prepared to order and 
      packed with flavor. Balanced kids meals are served with fresh fruit and 
      healthy sides, while other delicious menu offerings are gluten-free, 
      low-sodium and vegetarian.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This single restaurant offers guests an incredible range of dining 
      choices, all in one location,&#8221; said Adam Cummis, president of the joint 
      venture. &#8220;Not only can guests order Pollo Campero&#8217;s legendary fried or 
      grilled chicken and signature side dishes, but they can also indulge in 
      Fresh A-Peel&#8217;s nutritious and delicious meals. By pairing these two 
      concepts together, we&#8217;ve created a destination that offers something for 
      every diner, and we&#8217;re changing the way people think about quick dining.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Nov 15 (Reuters) - Gunmen attacked an oil facility
off the southern coast of Nigeria operated by U.S. energy firm
Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) overnight but it was unclear whether there
were any injuries or damage, a security source said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The site was a deep offshore facility off the coast of Akwa
Ibom, one of the states that make up the Niger Delta, home to
Africa's biggest oil and gas industry, said the source, who
declined to be named because investigations were continuing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attack would be the second of its kind in as many weeks
off Akwa Ibom. Militants attacked a rig operated by exploration
firm Afren (AFRE.L) in the region a week ago, kidnapping two
Americans, two Frenchmen, two Indonesians and a Canadian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That attack was claimed by the Movement for the Emancipation
of the Niger Delta (MEND), the main militant group in the
region, which has warned of further strikes against energy
facilities. [ID:nLDE6AB0L5] [ID:nLDE6A708L]

			MACH&#8217;s ISR Solution Opens Up Roaming For Visafone&#8217;s Pre-Paid CDMA 
      Customers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New CDMA Network Signing Extends MACH&#8217;s Leadership Position in the 
      Pre-Paid Roaming Market
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MACH, the leading provider of hub-based mobile communication solutions, 
      today announced the successful launch of Visafone&#8217;s pre-paid roaming 
      service for CDMA subscribers using MACH&#8217;s market leading Inter-Standard 
      Roaming (ISR) Solution. Visafone, 
      Nigeria&#8217;s fastest growing mobile network operator, will be able to 
      provide more than three million mostly pre-paid customers with seamless 
      access to international roaming on GSM networks and other wireless 
      technologies. By signing up yet another network operator to its 
      industry-leading solution, MACH has firmed up its leadership position in 
      the pre-paid roaming market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Network operators are striving to deliver seamless connectivity 
      worldwide for both their pre-paid and post-paid subscribers. By doing 
      so, they improve customer experience, reduce churn and increase roaming 
      revenues. Traditional inter-standard roaming solutions provide seamless 
      connectivity for post-paid subscribers only. MACH&#8217;s ISR managed service 
      solution is unique in the industry as it is able to provide for both 
      pre-paid and post-paid subscribers. It offers an efficient and value 
      added approach for CDMA operators, unlocking new revenue opportunities, 
      and providing service continuity for their customers whilst travelling.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;One of Visafone&#8217;s stated goals is to be the pre-eminent and most 
      customer focused telecom operator in Nigeria. Part of the plan to 
      achieve this is the emphasis on seamless and efficient services that 
      will ensure the best clarity and the widest coverage,&#8221; said Mr. R. 
      Balachandran, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, Visafone. 
      &#8220;By signing up to MACH&#8217;s ISR solution, we are one step closer to 
      achieving this aim. We opted for MACH&#8217;s fully managed, outsourced 
      solution as it provides for both pre-paid and post-paid subscribers, it 
      is quick and easy to implement, and it has been adopted by major mobile 
      operators around the world.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;We are delighted to be able to support Visafone in its business 
      aims, while at the same time building on our established momentum in the 
      pre-paid outsourced inter-standard roaming
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			market,&#8221; said Tom Heeremans, Regional Vice President EMEA, MACH. &#8220;As 
      Nigeria&#8217;s fastest growing operator, Visafone needs to be able to offer 
      seamless roaming - with one device, one number and one bill &#8211; to its 
      mostly pre-paid CDMA customers in a very short space of time. Our ISR 
      solution is typically deployed in fewer than 12 weeks, and Visafone&#8217;s 
      customers will have full access to all their usual services while 
      roaming, regardless of whether they are on pre-paid or contract 
      packages.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MACH ISR is a fully hosted inter-standard roaming solution in which a 
      single agreement provides full featured voice and data roaming in more 
      than 200 countries with minimal capital investment and operational 
      expenditure. Based on Accuris Networks&#8217; inter-working platform for voice 
      and SMS, and MACH&#8217;s own patented Mobile IP Proxy for seamless data 
      roaming, it is delivered through a proven managed services 
      infrastructure. It offers turnkey interoperability between wireless 
      technologies, including CDMA, 1X/EVDO, GSM, GPRS/UMTS, Wi-Fi, WiMAX and, 
      soon, LTE. The solution, which can be implemented using existing 
      connections, offers end users all of the services that are available on 
      their home network, even when they are travelling. With end-to-end, one 
      number interoperability, mobile operators can provide complete voice and 
      messaging services without the time and investment required to build 
      their own platform.

&lt;p&gt; * Shareholder seeks to block sale to Chevron&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sale comes a low point in gas prices
 (Adds Chevron statement in paragraph seven)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tom Hals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WILMINGTON, Del, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A shareholder filed a
lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition of Atlas Energy Inc
ATLS.O by Chevron Corp (CVX.N), alleging the $3.2 billion
deal was "intrinsically unfair" to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of Atlas gives Chevron access to the
Marcellus shale field in Pennsylvania and neighboring states,
which is one of the largest U.S. natural gas finds in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron bid $43.34 per share, a 37 percent premium to
Atlas's closing price prior to the deal's announcement on Nov.
9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, which seeks class action status, was brought
on Monday by shareholder Abraham Katsman. The suit accuses
Atlas's board of directors of breaching their fiduciary duties,
aided by Atlas and Chevron, for agreeing to sell the company
cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The timing of the proposed sale of Atlas to Chevron
appears opportunistically timed to take advantage of the
current economic downturn, and is grossly unfair, inadequate,
and substantially below the fair or inherent value of the
company," said the complaint, which was filed in Delaware's
Chancery Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moon Township, Pennsylvania-based Atlas is incorporated in
Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron believes it has made a fair offer for Atlas. We
believe this suit is without merit," said a statement from
Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlas did not immediately return a call for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale of the company comes as U.S. natural gas prices
have tumbled, largely because of rising output from the
Marcellus and other shale fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlas shares slipped 4.5 cents to $43.96 in Nasdaq trading
on Tuesday, while Chevron shares fell $1.66 to $82.48 on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Abraham Katsman v Atlas Energy Inc et al,
Delaware Chancery Court, No. 5990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The prior case is In re Atlas Energy Resources LLC
unitholder litigation, Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 4589.

&lt;p&gt; * Shareholder seeks to block sale to Chevron&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sale comes a low point in gas prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tom Hals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WILMINGTON, Del, Nov 16 (Reuters) - A shareholder filed a
class action lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition of Atlas
Energy Inc ATLS.O by Chevron Corp (CVX.N), alleging the $3.2
billion deal was "intrinsically unfair" to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of Atlas gives Chevron access to the
Marcellus shale field in Pennsylvania and neighboring states,
which is one of the largest U.S. natural gas finds in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron bid $43.34 per share, a 37 percent premium to
Atlas's closing price prior to the deal's announcement on Nov.
9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit, brought on Monday by shareholder Abraham
Katsman, accuses Atlas's board of directors of breaching their
fiduciary duties, aided by Atlas and Chevron, for agreeing to
sell the company cheaply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The timing of the proposed sale of Atlas to Chevron
appears opportunistically timed to take advantage of the
current economic downturn, and is grossly unfair, inadequate,
and substantially below the fair or inherent value of the
company," said the complaint, which was filed in Delaware's
Chancery Court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moon Township, Pennsylvania-based Atlas is incorporated in
Delaware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlas and Chevron did not immediately return calls for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale of the company comes as U.S. natural gas prices
have tumbled, largely because of rising output from the
Marcellus and other shale fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlas is already facing a similar lawsuit as a result of a
deal by the company to acquire a limited liability company
subsidiary for what unitholders of the subsidiary argue is an
undervalued price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlas shares slipped 4.5 cents to $43.96 in Nasdaq trading
on Tuesday, while Chevron shares fell about 2 percent to
$82.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Delaware judge cleared that case to proceed last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest case is Abraham Katsman v Atlas Energy Inc et
al, Delaware Chancery Court, No. 5990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The prior case is In re Atlas Energy Resources LLC
unitholder litigation, Delaware Court of Chancery, No. 4589.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chairman Bill Gates and Chief Executive Steve Ballmer defended recent stock sales on Tuesday as they faced tough questions from shareholders frustrated by the lack of growth in the company's shares over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gates, who co-founded the company in 1975, sells 20 million shares every quarter to help fund his philanthropic activities, while Ballmer is planning to sell 75 million shares by year end for tax planning reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Both Bill and I retain very substantial interests in the company," said Ballmer, CEO since 2000, at the company's annual shareholders meeting, which was broadcast on the Web. "If you look at the amount of shares sold by insiders it's really a very small percentage of all of the shares that sell, it's not a material factor in the stock price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 50 million Microsoft shares change hands most days on Nasdaq, sometimes more than 100 million. The company has about 8.6 billion shares outstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates is still the largest individual shareholder with about 7.2 percent of the company, followed by Ballmer with about 4 percent. Gates regularly sells shares in batches of 1 million to 4 million to fund his $33 billion Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation, which became his focus when he retired from day-to-day work at Microsoft in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by a shareholder if he could somehow annul his Microsoft shares, rather than selling them, Gates defended his priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I made that decision that wealth was going to go to the Foundation and the causes of the Foundation as opposed to being some reduction in shares outstanding for Microsoft," said Gates, in his only public utterance at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell about 1 percent to $25.81 on Nasdaq. The shares are down about  15 percent this year, compared to a 9 percent gain in the Nasdaq. They are trading around the same level as 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three of the top four U.S. mobile service providers -- Verizon Wireless, ATT Inc (T.N) and T-Mobile USA -- are working together to build a network that would let consumers pay for goods with their phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their Isis joint venture, which was formally announced on Tuesday, plans to take market share from dominant payment networks Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N), which currently process most U.S. credit and debit card payments.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday it has sold more than 1 million of its new hands-free Kinect gaming systems in the first 10 days since launch, putting it on track to beat its target of 5 million sales by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is hoping the Kinect will help revitalize sales of its Xbox game console this holiday shopping season and counter competing motion-based gaming systems from Nintendo Co, which makes the Wii, and Sony Corp, which introduced its Move product two months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a strong start," said Don Mattrick, head of Microsoft's game unit, in a telephone interview on Monday. "Consumers are loving it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kinect -- a sensing device you plug into the Xbox which allows you to play games just by moving your body and speaking commands -- is priced at $150 for a standalone unit and $300 bundled with a 4 gigabyte Xbox console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It went on sale in U.S. stores November 4, although many customers had pre-ordered units, likely causing a spike in early sales. Microsoft is hoping sales will stay hot as the day after Thanksgiving -- one of the biggest shopping days of the year, known as 'Black Friday' -- approaches on November 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 30,000 U.S. stores are selling Kinect in the United States, including branches of Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Target Corp, Best Buy Co, GameStop Corp and online at Amazon.com. It went on sale on November 10 in Europe and is due to go on sale in Asia on November 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Microsoft is hoping the new technology will help extend the role of its Xbox 360, which has sold 45 million units, and introduce a concept that is expected to feature in forms of electronics and computers in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were trading unchanged after hours, after closing down 7 cents at $26.20 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I made that decision that wealth was going to go to the
Foundation and the causes of the Foundation as opposed to being
some reduction in shares outstanding for Microsoft," said
Gates, in one of very few public utterances at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares fell about 0.5 percent to $25.90 on
Nasdaq. The shares are down about about 15 percent this year,
compared to a 9 percent gain in the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock has been trading around the same level as 2002.
One shareholder complained that Microsoft's shares have been
"wallowing" for years, to applause from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do understand the frustrations, we are all
shareholders," replied Ballmer. "Ultimately the stock market
gets it right, as long as we get it right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CEO praised his company's latest line-up of products,
emphasizing the hot-selling Windows 7 operating system, but
complained himself that investors tended to favor companies in
the consumer electronics sphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think there's been as much appreciation for the
incredible success we've had with enterprises," said Ballmer.
"People relate better to the consumer market," he added. Apple
Inc (AAPL.O), which has had a string of hits with its music
players, phones and tablet devices, has seen its stock rise
25-fold in the last eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer and Gates rejected one shareholder's appeal to
consider breaking up Microsoft into smaller parts, in order to
focus on individual businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think it would be useful," said Ballmer,
explaining that such a move would throw away the advantage of
having different parts of its business working together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Derek Caney, Bernard

Gates Foundation, which became his focus when he retired from
day-to-day work at Microsoft in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked by a shareholder if he could somehow annul his
Microsoft shares, rather than selling them, Gates defended his
priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I made that decision that wealth was going to go to the
Foundation and the causes of the Foundation as opposed to being
some reduction in shares outstanding for Microsoft," said
Gates, in his only public utterance at the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares fell about 1 percent to $25.81 on Nasdaq.
The shares are down about about 15 percent this year, compared
to a 9 percent gain in the Nasdaq. They are trading around the
same level as 2002.

			BP On Track to Meet Rumaila Target
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BP Plc (NYSE: BP) 
      and its partner China National Petroleum Corp. (&#8220;CNPC&#8221;) are on track to 
      meet their preliminary target of a 10% rise in output from the Rumaila 
      oilfield by the end of this month. The growth in production was driven 
      by continued focus on increasing oil production from existing wells, new 
      wells coming on stream and an unperturbed flowline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2009, BP and its Chinese partner CNPC clinched a 20-year development 
      contract for Rumaila and set a target to increase output to 2.85 million 
      barrels per day (bpd) in six years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rumaila oil field, with an estimated crude reserve of 17 billion 
      barrels, is a giant oil field located in southern Iraq, approximately 
      32&#160;kilometers from the Kuwaiti border. It is the world&#8217;s fourth largest 
      oil field with a current capacity of 1 million bpd, almost half of 
      Iraq&#8217;s total output of 2.5 million bpd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another consortium led by Italian energy giant Eni SpA (NYSE: E) 
      also signed a 20-year contract with Iraq earlier this year for the 
      development of the giant Zubair oil field. Eni, along with its 
      U.S.-based partner Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) 
      and Korea Gas Corporation had set an output target of 1.2 million bpd on 
      a baseline production level of 183,000 bpd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Iraqi government signed several developmental contracts with the oil 
      companies that included Rumaila as well as Zubair oil field agreements. 
      If successful, Iraq is expected to meet Saudi levels of 12 million bpd.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The alliances will be paid $2 for each extra barrel of oil the companies 
      extract on top of the current production at both fields. Additionally, 
      Iraq intends to revamp its infrastructure and export pipelines to cope 
      with the growing production volumes. BP, CNPC, ExxonMobil Corporation 
      (NYSE: XOM) and 
      Russia group Lukoil were among the companies interested in partly 
      funding the export projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Gulf of Mexico spill ruptured the basic fundamentals of BP. The 
      distressed UK major is currently searching several alternatives to raise 
      funds to meet the spill cost. We believe that keeping pace with the 
      previous target in Iraq, in such a critical environment, is a positive 
      direction toward the turnaround.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recently, BP posted impressive third quarter results mainly on the back 
      of higher realized oil prices, lower depreciation and lower-than-usual 
      tax rates. The Gulf of Mexico oil spill tragedy has definitely ruptured 
      the basic fundamentals of BP but its constant endeavor to fight the 
      aftermath is appreciable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We continue to see near-term headwinds with respect to weak U.S. 
      refining margins and competitive disadvantages versus its European 
      peers. Consequently, we retain our long-term Neutral recommendation on 
      the company. BP holds a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AM Best Confirms AXIS Rating
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating agency A.M. Best Co. affirmed the issuer credit rating (ICR) of 
      &#8220;bbb+&#8221; and existing debt ratings of AXIS Capital Holdings Limited (NYSE: 
      AXS). The rating 
      agency also affirmed the financial strength rating (FSR) of A 
      (Excellent) and ICR of &#8220;a+&#8221; of AXIS Specialty and its operating 
      affiliates. The outlook for all ratings remains stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A.M. Best Co. noted that AXIS&#8217; portfolio is well diversified, both 
      geographically and by line of business. The company operates in Bermuda, 
      the U.S., Singapore and Europe, with a focus on specialty insurance 
      lines including property, marine and political risk, along with property 
      catastrophe and other specialty reinsurance coverages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating affirmation is based on AXIS&#8217; consistent performance, solid 
      risk-based capitalization, robust enterprise risk management controls 
      and experienced management team. Also, AXIS has been delivering a 
      five-year average return on equity in the mid double-digit range as well 
      as a five-year average combined ratio of approximately 85%. A.M. Best 
      expects AXIS to maintain a total debt-to-capital ratio in the mid-teens 
      to low twenties over the near term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On the flip side, the company&#8217;s exposure to large catastrophe losses 
      coupled with a tough macro environment weigh on its positives. Though 
      the company suffered huge realized and unrealized investment losses in 
      2008 and losses on specific investments and certain underwriting 
      decisions in 2009, it has been able to manage the crisis effectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AXIS Capital reported third-quarter operating income of $1.22 per share, 
      beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate as well as the year-ago figure.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, quotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAGOS, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Tuesday eight people were missing following a raid on a Nigerian
offshore oil platform on Nov. 14 that knocked out 45,000 barrels
per day of condensate production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mobil Producing Nigeria...confirms that unknown armed

eight platforms whose total output averages about 75,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta,
Nigeria's main militant group, said on Tuesday it was
responsible for the attack on Exxon's oil facility.
[ID:nLDE6AE188] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group warned of further attacks in the heartland of
Africa's biggest oil and gas industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the coming weeks, the Movement for the Emancipation of
the Niger Delta will launch a major operation that will
simultaneously affect oil facilities across the Niger Delta," it
said in a statement emailed to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previous campaigns by MEND fighters have knocked out a
significant proportion of Nigeria's oil production, currently
averaging about 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), and cost it
as much as $1 billion a month in lost revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said on Tuesday it had contacted the families of the
personnel on the platform, while government and security
agencies had been informed and appropriate measures were
underway.

      The Company also announced today that it is extending the expiration 
      date of the tender offers. The Any and All Offer will now expire at 5:00 
      p.m., EST, on November 22, 2010. The Any and All Offer Withdrawal Date 
      (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) has passed and notes validly 
      tendered through 5:00 p.m., EST, yesterday, the original expiration date 
      for the Any and All Offer, may not be withdrawn except under the 
      circumstances described in the Offer to Purchase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Maximum Tender Offer will now expire at 11:59 p.m., EST, on December 
      14, 2010. Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer must 
      tender and not withdraw their notes before the early tender date, which 
      is now 5:00 p.m., EST, on November 30, 2010 to be eligible to receive 
      the total consideration. Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender 
      Offer who tender their notes after the early tender date will be 
      eligible to receive the tender offer consideration, which is the total 
      consideration minus $30 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered by 
      such holder that are accepted for purchase. Holders of notes subject to 
      the Maximum Tender Offer who tender their notes after the early tender 
      date may not withdraw their notes except in the limited circumstances 
      described fully in the Offer to Purchase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of notes 
      tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the tender offers will be 
      determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by reference 
      to a fixed spread specified for each series of the notes over the yield 
      based on the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security specified on 
      the cover page of the Offer to Purchase, as calculated by the dealer 
      managers at 2:00 p.m., EST, on November 22, 2010 for the Any and All 
      Offer and at 2:00 p.m., EST, on November 30, 2010 for the Maximum Tender 
      Offer. In addition to the total consideration or the tender offer 
      consideration, as applicable, accrued interest up to, but not including, 
      the settlement date will be paid in cash on all validly tendered notes 
      accepted in the tender offers. The settlement dates for the Any and All 
      Offer and the Maximum Tender Offer will follow promptly after the 
      applicable extended expiration dates and currently are expected to be 
      Tuesday, November 23, 2010 and Wednesday, December 15, 2010, 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Any and All Offer and the Maximum Tender Offer are subject to the 
      satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions set forth in the Offer to 
      Purchase, including, among other things, the consummation of the 
      Company's issuance of one or more new series of senior notes with net 
      proceeds of at least $4.0 billion. That condition has now been satisfied.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of 5:00 p.m., EST, on November 15, 2010, approximately $1.49 billion 
      in aggregate principal amount of notes, or 34.0% of the outstanding 
      principal amount, had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn 
      pursuant to the Any and All Offer and approximately $0.24 billion 
      aggregate principal amount of notes, or 7.6% of the outstanding 
      principal amount, had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn 
      pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The Company has retained Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and HSBC 
      Securities (USA) Inc. to serve as coordinating dealer managers and 
      Goldman, Sachs  Co. and BofA Merrill Lynch to serve as dealer managers

&lt;p&gt; * Deka buys Singapore tower at 30 pct discount from Goldman&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Deal at 4 pct yield, sees potential for rental growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
  (Adds quotes, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Germany's Deka Immobilien has
bought a Singapore office tower for about $420 million, broker
Savills said on Tuesday, in a deal that crystallizes a hefty
loss on the price paid by owner Goldman Sachs (GS.N) in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The transaction reflects a 30 percent discount from the
peak pricing of 2007 and prime rental levels remain
approximately 50 percent below their peak in 2007," said Craig
Ward, a director at global consultant Savills (SVS.L), which
advised fund manager Deka.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman-linked property fund had bought Chevron House from
Singaporean developer CapitaLand (CATL.SI) in September 2007, at
a then-record price of S$2,780 per square foot, or S$730 million
($559.4 million) in total, local newspapers reported.
Savills said Deka, which bought the 262,650 square feet
property at an initial yield of 4 percent, sees strong potential
for rental growth and asset enhancements for the 29-storey tower
located in Singapore's Central Business District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consultancy said a number of other investors, in
addition to Deka, are seeking assets in Singapore ranging from
S$50 million to S$500 million, drawn by the city-state's strong
economic growth and recovery in its office market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Reuters in
an interview earlier this month the city-state's red-hot
property market was a matter of concern and needed careful
monitoring to avoid the creation of a bubble. [ID:nSGE6A10B9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman real estate funds have been offloading assets in
Asia so far this year, and in August sold two other Singapore
office blocks for S$870.5 million to Overseas Union Enterprise
(OVES.SI), a firm controlled by Indonesia's Lippo Group.

      Ten-year product management veteran Angela Doolittle has been named to 
      the position of product manager in the ACOM Channels Division, adding a 
      powerful product development, management and training dimension to the 
      division&#8217;s overall capabilities, it was announced today by Channel 
      Division Vice President Joe Torano.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      In the new post, she is responsible for cultivation and enrichment of 
      VAR/business partner relationships; creation and maintenance of product

      primary contact for development partnerships with IBM, Microsoft, and 
      Sage Software.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Much of her focus will be placed on the continuing evolution of ACOM&#8217;s 
      EZContentManager document 
      management solution to enhance opportunities 
      for channel partners selling into IT environments structured around 
      the offerings of these major vendors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Angela is remarkably well prepared to serve in this capacity,&#8221; Torano 
      said. &#8220;She brings an extensive understanding of the broad information 
      processing field, as well as a refined perspective on the needs of both 
      users and resellers, gleaned from years of interaction with both 
      communities. We view the channel as an extremely promising market 
      opportunity for ACOM and Angela&#8217;s credentials and experience will surely 
      be of great value as we continue to increase our presence in that 
      market.&#8221;

			Updated MarkLogic Toolkits Enable Collaboration and Sharing in 
      Microsoft Office
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MarkLogic Senior Engineer Pete Aven to Discuss Advantages of Building 
      Applications Directly in Microsoft Office at MarkLogic Government Summit
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Organizations around the world are constantly creating new content with 
      Microsoft Office. Unfortunately, much of this content falls to the 
      wayside after being used for its original purpose and loses value. MarkLogic&#174; 
      Corporation, the company revolutionizing the way organizations 
      leverage unstructured information, today announced the availability of 
      updated toolkits that allow content authors to quickly access, reuse, 
      and repurpose content created within Microsoft Office. Pete Aven, senior 
      engineer, MarkLogic, will discuss the advantages of the updated 
      toolkits and connectors for the government sector in a session 
      titled &#8220;MarkLogic Toolkits and Connectors&#8221; at the MarkLogic Government 
      Summit on Wednesday, November 17, 2010 at the Ritz Carlton in Tysons 
      Corner, V.A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Many content authors only want to use the tools they are comfortable 
      with,&#8221; said Ken Chestnut, vice president of product marketing, 
      MarkLogic. &#8220;With the updated MarkLogic toolkits, content authors can 
      find and reuse content from other documents while allowing them to stay 
      within Microsoft Office. This allows them to spend more time authoring 
      and less time trying to navigate across multiple user interfaces.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The toolkits and connectors contain customizable applications for 
      Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint that enable authors to tag, 
      search, and reuse previously created content. Developers can then build 
      rich applications for Microsoft Office to extend the functionality of 
      the software suite. Once a document has been created, it is stored 
      within MarkLogic Server and can be searched and updated to increase 
      collaboration and content sharing between different teams within an 
      organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The MarkLogic toolkits give developers the ability to build advanced 
      applications directly into Microsoft Office,&#8221; said Aven. &#8220;Microsoft 
      Office&#8217;s native XML format &#8211; Office Open XML &#8211; makes MarkLogic the 
      perfect platform to increase efficiency in the authoring process.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MarkLogic toolkits are available for:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Word &#8211; allows for intelligent information authoring and 
      dynamic assembly for reuse when creating new content.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Excel &#8211; search across spreadsheets and workbooks for 
      text, formulas, and metadata to improve information reuse and discovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft PowerPoint &#8211; easily create new custom presentations by 
      searching and retrieving information that already exists in your library 
      of presentations, documents, and spreadsheets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Office Toolkits are 
      available today. To register for the upcoming MarkLogic Government 
      Summit, please visit http://www.marklogic.com/gs10/.

			U.S. Bank Expands Mobile Capabilities with 
      Innovative New Visa Payment Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. Bank (NYSE: USB) and Visa (NYSE: V) continue to be at the forefront 
      of mobile payments innovation, partnering with DeviceFidelity, FIS and 
      Monitise to introduce an innovative new way for customers to make 
      purchases using their mobile phone. Customers can simply wave their 
      phone in front of a Visa payWave contactless payment terminal in order 
      to pay. U.S. Bank is one of the first major card issuers in the United 
      States to pilot this landmark technology as employees in multiple states 
      will begin testing this month. Plans are underway to introduce it to 
      select customers next year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our customers have told us that they want to mobilize their accounts 
      with us &#8211; they want to make payments with their mobile device and this 
      is a natural extension of our existing banking relationship,&#8221; said 
      Dominic Venturo, chief innovation officer for U.S. Bank Retail Payment 
      Solutions. &#8220;As their trusted financial services provider, we&#8217;re already 
      offering convenient mobile account access. Now we&#8217;re adding contactless 
      payment capabilities to their existing mobile device.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Issued by U.S. Bank, a DeviceFidelity In2Pay&#8482; microSD is inserted in the 
      customer&#8217;s mobile phone or within a specially-designed iPhone case 
      (In2Pay iCaisse&#8482;). Visa and DeviceFidelity recently introduced the 
      patent-pending In2Pay microSD based mobile contactless technology and 
      the associated In2Pay iCaisse solution. FIS and Monitise developed the 
      application that enables customers to make mobile purchases and access 
      account information as part of the U.S. Bank pilot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The solution conforms to the industry standard for memory cards, 
      microSD, and fits into the memory card slot found in many existing 
      mobile devices. U.S. Bank will be testing with several market leading 
      mobile brands. This mobile payment solution is password protected and 
      uses advanced security technology to uniquely identify each contactless 
      transaction. As is true with a lost or stolen card, the chip can be 
      immediately disabled by the bank as needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Consumers worldwide are embracing mobile as a convenient way to engage 
      with and manage their daily financial lives. The ability to link an 
      existing payment account to a mobile phone is transforming how consumers 
      pay and how merchants get paid,&#8221; said Bill Gajda, head of mobile 
      innovation at Visa. &#8220;The solution developed in collaboration with 
      DeviceFidelity will do just that and has the potential to accelerate the 
      adoption of mobile payments in the U.S.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;U.S. Bank is leading the way through the early adoption of contactless 
      microSD solutions, and we are excited to be part of their efforts to 
      bring mobile payments to the U.S.,&#8221; said Amitaabh Malhotra, chief 
      operating officer at DeviceFidelity. &#8220;With the In2Pay solution, we aim 
      to bring the speed, interactivity and security of mobile contactless 
      payments to a user&#8217;s preferred device, and collaborating with such 
      enthusiastic, innovative partners such as U.S. Bank, Visa and Monitise 
      is a huge step towards realizing that goal.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. Bank is a consistent leader in innovative mobile payment solutions. 
      Last month, the company launched a full-suite mobile banking solution 
      with bill pay capabilities for prepaid cardholders &#8211; the first of its 
      kind in the prepaid marketplace. It was also the first large American 
      bank to test the Visa Money Transfer person-to-person mobile payment 
      service, and has partnered with Visa to give cardholders on-the go 
      access to account alerts, offers and a locator service with the Visa 
      Mobile application. In addition, U.S. Bank was one of the first banks to 
      test the Visa Micro Tag, an early contactless mobile payment device.

&lt;p&gt; * Number of partners selected up 17 percent from 2008&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Partners receive acccess to special compensation pool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C. Nov 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) named 110 employees as partners, a 17 percent increase
from the last group of employees it promoted to that level in
2008, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based investment bank selects employees as
partners once every two years, and appointed 94 employees to
that level in 2008, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The process is one of the last vestiges of Goldman's days
as the last remaining partnership on Wall Street. Partners
receive a $600,000 annual salary, participate in a special
compensation pool and receive much of their year-end bonus in
restricted shares, Bloomberg reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New partners include Donald Casturo, an executive in
Goldman's commodities unit, and Dina Powell, Goldman's head of
corporate engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has so far paid $13.1 billion in compensation
through the first nine months of 2010, compared with $16.1
billion through the first nine months of 2009, according to the
company's third quarter report.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp will pay $25 million as part of a settlement to clean up a decades-old oil spill in New York City, the state's attorney general said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Asset Management L.P. (&#8220;Walton&#8221;) and Walton Big Lake Development 
      L.P. (&#8220;Big Lake Partnership&#8221;) announced today that Walton Big Lake 
      Development L.P. completed its initial public offering, issuing 
      1,785,594 units at a price of $10.00 per unit for gross proceeds of $ 
      17,855,940.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Proceeds of the offering will be used to purchase, manage and develop 
      the 136.5 acre Big Lake property located in Edmonton, Alberta.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Big Lake Partnership has been established to provide unitholders 
      with the opportunity to participate in the development of the Big Lake 
      property. Walton believes that the property is strategically located and 
      that investors can benefit from this development opportunity. The Big 
      Lake Partnership&#8217;s investment objectives are to preserve capital and 
      provide annual cash distributions beginning in 2011 until the completion 
      of the project, which is anticipated to be in December of 2015, 
      representing a net internal rate of return of 13.5% based on the $10.00 
      unit purchase price.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Big Lake Partnership intends to meet its investment objectives 
      through a four-step strategy: (i) acquire the Big Lake Property without 
      the use of leverage, (ii) obtain contractual commitments from 
      homebuilders to purchase lots to be serviced in each of the three 
      planned phases of the development of the Property before construction 
      commences on that phase, (iii) construct municipal services 
      infrastructure on the Property in phases to provide a controlled supply 
      of serviced lots to the marketplace, and (iv) use the revenue from the 
      sale of the serviced lots to repay construction loans and other 
      obligations of the Partnership and then make distributions to the 
      Limited Partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership will be managed by Walton Asset Management L.P., which 
      is part of the Walton Group of Companies. Development of the Big Lake 
      project will be managed by Walton Development and Management Inc., whose 
      team is comprised of 33 real estate development professionals bringing 
      over 350 years of combined experience in engineering, land development, 
      land planning, project management, finance, marketing and municipal 
      affairs.

			Microsoft Lync Replaces Office Communications Server
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Inetium (www.inetium.com) 
      a leading IT consulting company and Microsoft Gold Certified partner 
      today announced support for Microsoft Lync Server 2010. Lync is the new 
      family brand for the products formerly known as Office Communications 
      Server, Office Communications Online and Communicator.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Lync can make every engagement a virtual face-to-face meeting, 
      because any interaction can include video and audio conferencing, 
      application and desktop sharing, instant messaging, and telephony. 
      People can also stay connected to others on a wide range of devices 
      while away from the office and manage their communications and calls in 
      new ways, such as easily moving a call from a PC to a mobile device 
      while leaving the office without disrupting the conversation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lync has been designed from the ground up to work with Microsoft Office, 
      SharePoint and Exchange, which helps reduce end-user adoption hurdles 
      and increase return on investment. By combining the power of these 
      environments, customers within any industry have the ability to 
      collaborate and communicate like never before.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of an early adopters for the Microsoft Technology Readiness 
      Program (TRP) for Lync Server 2010 Inetium has worked closely with 
      Microsoft&#8217;s product team to extend its products to become Lync Server 
      2010-compatible and to take full advantage of the extended capacities 
      that Lync Server 2010 provides.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are delighted to stand alongside Microsoft in their launch of Lync 
      Server 2010. The new opportunities awarded to all organizations through 
      the use of Lync can dramatically increase collaboration, productivity 
      and innovation. Inetium stands on the foreground of helping 
      organizations realize this and looks forward to partnering with its 
      customers to help move them into this great new experience.&#8221; said 
      Michael Schwantes, Vice President of Infrastructure Solutions  Managed 
      Services at Inetium.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft Lync is on schedule to become generally available around end 
      of Q4 CY 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In July of 2010, Inetium announced its plans to merge with Avtex into a 
      single company, Avtex Solutions, LLC, effective Jan. 1, 2011. The merger 
      unites two Pohlad-owned technology firms with complementary product and 
      service offerings, creating a combined company focused on delivering 
      technology solutions that enhance an organization's productivity and its 
      interactions with employees and customers. In November, Avtex Solutions, 
      LLC announced the acquisition of Convergent, a technology solutions 
      provider recognized nationally for its expertise in Microsoft Unified 
      Communications (UC) and storage solutions. Under the umbrella of the 
      Pohlad Family Companies, the union of Convergent, Inetium and Avtex is 
      part of a broader strategy to integrate complimentary technology 
      organizations, building upon each set of strengths to bring solutions 
      and services to market.

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) chief financial officer on Wednesday joined a growing chorus of industry executives calling for a speedy resolution of the probes into the industry's foreclosure practices as a settlement may be on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We work very hard with our regulators to come to the right answer and we hope to do that quickly as well," said JPMorgan CFO Doug Braunstein, speaking at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch financial services conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein's comments come as the largest U.S. mortgage lenders and the 50-state attorneys general are negotiating a settlement of investigations into the industry's foreclosure practices, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state attorneys general, led by Iowa's Tom Miller, are negotiating with each of the largest mortgage lenders -- Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) -- independently, but are pushing for a nationwide fund to compensate home owners whose houses had been improperly repossessed, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the fund and how homeowners could be compensated is still being debated, the newspaper reported, and any settlement would require more work on loan modifications from the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One day earlier, Bank of America Chief Executive Brian Moynihan told the same conference a quick settlement would be the best possible outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is in everyone's best interest to get this settled and behind us," Moynihan said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan halted home foreclosures in 23 U.S. states in October, pending a review of its internal practices, and has been one of several large mortgage lenders at the center of a public firestorm over home repossessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics allege the major U.S. mortgage lenders cut corners in foreclosures, namely using so-called "robo-signers" -- employees who signed thousands of foreclosure documents daily without properly reviewing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Braunstein said the foreclosure halt will increase JPMorgan's foreclosure costs by "a few hundred million" per month, and those costs will begin appearing in the bank's financial results in the coming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Rauch, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, CA, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Melissa Data, a developer of high performance data quality and address
management solutions, today announced their new Data Quality Components
for Microsoft's SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS). This suite of
custom data transformations delivers the industry-recognized criteria for
complete Data Quality(i), including Data Profiling, Cleansing, Parsing,
Standardization, Matching, and Monitoring. The tools aim to help IT
professionals integrate increasingly complex enterprise data -- in
different formats, structures and sources -- and deliver a single view of
critical information assets. 

    Previously, implementing Master Data Management (MDM) or Data Quality
initiatives involved extensive manual coding efforts or the need to
purchase expensive data integration tools. Now, with Data Quality
Components for SSIS, users can build their own toolkit at a very
reasonable price to get exactly the functionality needed for the project. 

    "We've found that roughly 60 percent of databases contain outdated or
flawed data, or contain at least one or more errors," explains Ira
Whiteside, Melissa Data's business intelligence analyst. "Melissa Data
solves this problem by offering software with an easy-to-use GUI that
delivers 'any source, any target' capabilities without the need for
complex programming -- all at a fraction of the cost of other enterprise
data quality platforms."

    Data Quality Components for SSIS comprises three sets of transforms:

    1. Data Profiling and Monitoring: Identifies data quality issues that
require immediate attention and corrects issues before quality of data
declines. 

    2. Data Enrichment and Verification: Verifies contact data including:
addresses, phone numbers, and email addresses, geocoding (spatial
processing); and parses/genderizes names and detects vulgarities.

    3. Data Matching and Cleansing: Corrects data values to meet specific
business rules and standards, then consolidates customer records into
identifiable groups and merges related records. 

    Demonstration videos and free trials of all SSIS components are available
at: http://www.melissadata.com/dqt/data-quality-components-for-ssis.htm 

    ABOUT MELISSA DATA
 Celebrating its 25th anniversary, Melissa Data is a
data quality and enrichment solutions provider and Oracle Partner. The

      Lync ushers in a connected experience transforming every 
      communication into an interaction that is more collaborative, engaging 
      and accessible from anywhere. A single interface unites voice, instant 
      messaging, audio-, video-, and Web-conferencing into a richer, more

      efficient for users to find contacts, check their availability and 
      connect with them. Lync works with Microsoft Office, enriching the 
      experience of familiar applications like Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft 
      Word, Microsoft SharePoint, and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The two systems enable CIC 
      users and Lync 
      Server 2010 users to communicate by phone, or by Lync instant 
      message or video call from within a single interface.&#160;In addition, both 
      sets of users receive synchronized presence, along with a common 
      company-wide directory that can be viewed from within the CIC desktop 
      client.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) --

part of Microsoft(R) Lync(TM) Server 2010, the latest release in
Microsoft's unified communications (UC) offerings. The software provides
communications and connectivity for branch office users even if the WAN

2010. The ability to make and receive voice calls, use voicemail,
intra-office screen sharing and instant messaging, and attend audio
conferences, continues to be available on the DMG4000 Gateways using the
SBA software. 

    "Adding Survivable Branch Appliance software to our DMG4000 Gateways
enables customers in branch offices to use key communication features,
even when disconnected from the central Lync Server 2010 datacenter,"
said Franz-Josef Eberle, Vice President and General Manager of Dialogic's
Enterprise Group. "This functionality is important for delivering UC
solutions built on Lync Server 2010."

software upgrade on all DMG4000 Gateways for immediate availability
through authorized distributors and their resellers. Existing DMG4000
Gateways can also be field upgraded via a software package, also
available through Dialogic authorized channel partners.

    "Enabling existing Microsoft Office Communications Server customers
currently using DMG4000 Gateways with a software upgrade path to Lync
Server 2010 is extremely important, and will help our mutual customers
rapidly adopt the Survivable Branch Appliance," said Yancey Smith,
director of product management, Microsoft Lync.

			ProtonMedia&#8217;s ProtoSphere Works with Microsoft Lync Server 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ProtoSphere now provides an immersive collaboration layer for 
      Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s latest enterprise class unified communications platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Have you heard? Word on the street is that ProtonMedia&#8217;s
			ProtoSphere 
      Lync Edition 2010 now has the best-sounding 
      and most scalable Voice over IP (VoIP) of any virtual collaboration 
      environment on the market. And if you haven&#8217;t heard, it&#8217;s probably 
      because you&#8217;re not using the virtual immersive environment that works 
      with Microsoft 
      Lync Server 2010, Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s latest enterprise class unified 
      communications (UC) platform, which is now at the heart of ProtoSphere&#8217;s 
      communication features. This gives ProtoSphere a quality, 
      security-enhanced, and scalable VoIP technology in a 3-D virtual 
      immersive environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;ProtoSphere is an enterprise collaboration application that uses the 
      power of the Microsoft Lync extensible platform,&#8221; says Shaun Pierce, 
      general manager, Microsoft Lync. &#8220;ProtonMedia&#8217;s ProtoSphere provides a 
      unique virtual collaboration solution for the high-performance workplace 
      on top of Microsoft Lync.&#8221;

      Burns, CEO of ProtonMedia, says: &#8220;The next generation of UC is here. 
      Today marks the start of our efforts to bring all the benefits of Lync 
      Server 2010 to ProtoSphere users. This will allow us to create a 
      completely unified 3-D virtual workplace that brings together the 
      highest quality voice, data, and social networking into a single 
      environment where people can collaborate and communicate in real time.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ProtoSphere Lync Edition 2010 features four updates to its voice 
      communications functionality. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s new:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Dial 
        out function lets you conference any user into any public or 
        private zone in ProtoSphere by calling their landline, mobile phone, 
        or conference bridge, directly from the platform&#8217;s dial pad.
      
			
				Always-on 
        VoIP using crystal-clear Microsoft technology for hands-free 
        talking. You can now speak and hear other users the moment you enter a 
        zone.
      
			
				Echo 
        cancellation
				eliminates possible echo when speaking 
        without a headset, so users no longer need to wear one to ensure an 
        echo-free experience.
      
			
				Communication 
        Panel is a function that lets you adjust and mute/unmute your 
        microphone; adjust and mute/unmute your speaker; and select your audio 
        device, whether it be headset or built-in microphone/speakers.

			Azaleos Managed Service for New Microsoft Lync Server Taps Power of 
      Private Cloud
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Support for On-Premise and Third Party Datacenter Deployments 
      Optimizes Flexibility, Performance, and Service Reliability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Azaleos&#174; 
      Corporation, the managed messaging, collaboration and unified 
      communications services company, today announced the availability of its 
      managed service for Microsoft 
      Lync 2010, the renamed and highly anticipated third release of 
      Microsoft&#8217;s unified 
      communications (UC) platform. Azaleos managed Microsoft Lync Server 
      Services, which support both private cloud/third party datacenter and 
      on-premise deployment models, removes the leading barrier to adoption of 
      UC &#8211; lack of in-house expertise to manage real-time communication 
      technologies. The proven Azaleos private cloud approach delivers the 
      advantages of public cloud services without the latency problems 
      associated with hosted PBX services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Azaleos provides a flexible and reliable alternative for enterprises 
      that want to take advantage of the benefits provided by Microsoft Lync 
      Server 2010,&#8221; said Ashima Singhal, group product manager, Microsoft 
      Lync. &#8220;Azaleos plays an important role in addressing the business 
      requirements of customers that want to deploy Lync Server 2010 in a 
      private cloud, third-party datacenter, or on-premise, but prefer to 
      outsource monitoring and management.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a recent report entitled Microsoft 
      Lync Server 2010 and the Unified Communications Market, Osterman 
      Research found that while cost savings from Voice over IP was ranked as 
      a top-three business driver for deploying unified communications, only 
      one-half of deployments actually implement voice services. According to 
      the report&#8217;s findings, many enterprises that would like to deploy VoIP 
      simply do not do so because it&#8217;s too hard to manage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Over the past six months Azaleos has experienced a marked increase in 
      demand for unified communications services. In fact, it is now rare that 
      a request for proposal does not include a requirement for a UC 
      platform,&#8221; said Scott Gode, vice president of product management and 
      marketing for Azaleos. &#8220;Enterprise customers have come to trust the 
      stability of the Microsoft UC platform and are recognizing the cost 
      savings and productivity benefits of migrating to a UC platform. The 
      sticking point remains the ability for companies to self-manage these 
      systems and maintain acceptable dial-tone service.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Turnkey Lync Server 2010 Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To help companies fully deploy all the services within Lync Server 2010 
      including instant messaging, video conferencing and enterprise voice 
      technologies &#8211; the Azaleos managed Lync Server 2010 services provide 
      monitoring and management of the entire Lync Server stack. Azaleos 
      experts in its East and West Coast network operations centers 
      continuously monitor Microsoft Lync 2010 end-to-end focusing on 
      conditions that can affect services availability and quality. Azaleos 
      can detect, diagnose, and repair problems before customers even know 
      they exist.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      developed and uses proprietary innovations designed to deliver a

        as high performance for Exchange 
        2010 systems

			Pricing and Availability

      Azaleos and its business partners IBM Global Services and Verizon 
      Business. Pricing starts at $5/user/month for Standard Edition

management and administration capabilities," said Rich Costello, senior
research analyst, IDC. "The close alliance between Polycom and Microsoft
helps deliver that to the desktop collaborative experience."

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aspect, a global provider of unified communications and collaboration
services and software, today announced it is integrating its market
leading Aspect(R) Unified IP(R) contact center platform with Microsoft
Lync Server 2010 capabilities. Aspect Unified IP, with Microsoft Lync
will offer key unified communications (UC) capabilities, including
enhanced expert search functionality and increased collaboration for
agents within the contact center and knowledge workers across the
enterprise. 

    "For companies that have implemented Microsoft unified communications
technologies, deploying Aspect solutions within the contact center will
offer almost the equivalent of out-of-the-box UC capabilities for
customer contact," said Gary Barnett, chief technology officer and
executive vice president at Aspect. "The integration will also help
support IT strategies to allow organizations to standardize on Microsoft
core technologies, streamlining IT management and allowing for
straightforward, uncomplicated support of the customer contact solutions
within those enterprises."

    Working with the Microsoft Lync Release Candidate -- an early version of
the software, Aspect drew on its extensive insight and experience with
Microsoft UC not only to integrate Lync with its upcoming release of
Aspect Unified IP, but to put the integration through its paces in
Aspect's own contact center. As part of its own beta test, Aspect's
contact center will be using Lync with Aspect Unified IP for its Ask an
Expert functionality, which leverages knowledge workers throughout the
enterprise to increase first call resolution for customers. Aspect
expects the implementation to continue to drive meaningful results across
its enterprise and customer interactions.

    The enhanced enterprise and contact center features that will be
available through the Lync and Aspect Unified IP integration will create
new opportunities for organizations to advance customer contact through
better communication and information sharing.

    "Microsoft is pleased to be working with Aspect on delivering
next-generation solutions for the contact center that leverage unified
communications capabilities to better engage customers and companies and
deliver greater communication and collaboration," said Kirk Gregersen,
Senior Director, Lync Product Management, Microsoft Corp.

    "The enterprise-grade voice capabilities within Lync validate the tenet
that software is poised to replace legacy PBX-based telephony systems.
Enterprises that migrate to Lync will get a unified and intuitive set of
voice, video, instant message, presence, and conferencing tools and
increased savings on costs normally incurred from hardware purchases and
maintenance, telephony circuit costs and conferencing services," added
Barnett. "In the two years that the entire Aspect organization has been
PBX-free, we have reduced costs by two million dollars annually. We feel
it is only a matter of time before more organizations make this
transition to take advantage of the compelling productivity,
collaboration, mobility and cost benefits."

    Features Supporting Lync Server 2010 Release
 The upcoming release of
Aspect Unified IP will use specific functionality within Lync that will
provide increased capabilities to contact center users including: 


--  Unified Communications Powered Agent Desktop: Will eliminate the need
    for two separate desktop applications for contact center agents that
    want to take advantage of Lync's IM, presence and federation
    capabilities.
--  UC collaboration for contact center agents: Collaboration capabilities
    from Lync can be used to initiate desktop sharing between agents in
    the contact center, supervisors and experts.
--  Security: Aspect Unified IP will work with Lync to provide advanced
    security of customer information, including encryption, access
    controls and authentication through Active Directory.
--  Distributed Architecture: Aspect Unified IP, in conjunction with Lync,
    will support distributed architecture models to enable data center
    consolidation, virtualization, as well as distributed and work at home
    agents and information workers.

&lt;p&gt; * Bank's foreclosure halt leading to added costs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * CFO hopes for quick solution to foreclosure probes
 (Adds details of potential settlement, comments from Bank of
America on Tuesday about foreclosure settlement, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joe Rauch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's
(JPM.N) chief financial officer on Wednesday joined a growing
chorus of industry executives calling for a speedy resolution
of the probes into the industry's foreclosure practices as a
settlement may be on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We work very hard with our regulators to come to the right
answer and we hope to do that quickly as well," said JPMorgan
CFO Doug Braunstein, speaking at the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch financial services conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Braunstein's comments come as the largest U.S. mortgage
lenders and the 50-state attorneys general are negotiating a
settlement of investigations into the industry's foreclosure
practices, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state attorneys general, led by Iowa's Tom Miller, are
negotiating with each of the largest mortgage lenders -- Bank
of America Corp (BAC.N), JPMorgan and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N)
-- independently, but are pushing for a nationwide fund to
compensate home owners whose houses had been improperly
repossessed, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The size of the fund and how homeowners could be
compensated is still being debated, the newspaper reported, and
any settlement would require more work on loan modifications
from the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One day earlier, Bank of America Chief Executive Brian
Moynihan told the same conference a quick settlement would be
the best possible outcome. [ID:nN16104232]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "It is in everyone's best interest to get this settled and
behind us," Moynihan said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based JPMorgan halted home foreclosures in 23 U.S.
states in October, pending a review of its internal practices,
and has been one of several large mortgage lenders at the
center of a public firestorm over home repossessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics allege the major U.S. mortgage lenders cut corners
in foreclosures, namely using so-called "robo-signers" --
employees who signed thousands of foreclosure documents daily
without properly reviewing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Braunstein said the foreclosure halt will increase
JPMorgan's foreclosure costs by "a few hundred million" per
month, and those costs will begin appearing in the bank's
financial results in the coming quarters.

      annualized growth of 17%. Although the colon cancer test launched 
      earlier this year has yet to make a significant contribution to the top 
      line, the situation could improve gradually as the company tries to 
      receive reimbursements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are also encouraged by the NCCN guidelines, which could lead to 
      growing awareness among patients and further increase the acceptance of 
      the test. Given these factors we have raised our estimates and upgrade 
      the stock to Outperform.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      We are changing our long-term recommendation for Plum Creek Timber 
      (NYSE: PCL) from 
      Neutral to Underperform as we anticipate it to perform well below the 
      broader market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the last 30 days, fiscal earnings estimates have been lowered by 
      nearly all analysts covering the stock, driven by the cyclical nature of 
      the business, cut-throat competition, and strict environment policies. 
      However, Plum Creek is the largest publicly-held timber REIT, with a 
      diversified timber and land base that enables it to benefit from large 
      economies of scale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The stock, however, is trading at a premium to the peer group based on 
      forward earnings estimates. Our target price of $34.00, 25.6X 2010 EPS, 
      reflects our belief that PCL will perform well below the broader market.

			Foreclosure Renewal: A New Housing Mess?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Are the major banks looking at housing troubles and billions of dollars 
      of losses yet again? That is what a new report from the Congressional 
      Oversight Panel seems to warn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the chaos resulting from foreclosure paperwork 
      flaws could result in massive losses for banks and a new quandary for 
      the housing market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rampant paperwork lapses in evaluating the authenticity of information 
      provided in the mortgage documents have embroiled major lenders 
      including Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), 
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) 
      and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC) 
      in a number of lawsuits by homeowners in the second half of September. 
      As a result, these lenders temporarily suspended foreclosures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the new report, financial firms that service a total of 
      $6.4 trillion in mortgages are involved in the foreclosure mess. 
      However, after the Obama administration cited that foreclosure 
      suspension is not required in all 50 states, the affected lenders 
      started resuming foreclosed properties sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Perhaps the continuation of the foreclosure suspension was required as 
      the mess was not wiped out from the root. We think the recurrence of the 
      paperwork flaws and the torrent of resulting lawsuits could make it 
      difficult to find home buyers in the years to come. This could stretch 
      out the U.S. housing crisis for several years.

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Metalogix Software(R), the leading platform provider of simple-to-use,
cost-effective Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange, and Cloud-based
management solutions, today announced a free tool developed in
conjunction with Microsoft to offer organizations a powerful and
convenient way to adopt SharePoint 2010 search capabilities within an
existing SharePoint 2007 environment. This will allow users to take
advantage of:


--  More accurate and relevant search results
--  Improved scalability and performance
--  Increased search flexibility and customization to address specific
    business requirements

    

"Understanding Search is the primary means in the enterprise for
surfacing and locating information and as a result, has become a mission
critical component of SharePoint deployments. The rise in adoption of
SharePoint 2010 has led to more customers seeking to leverage the
benefits of the new search architectures, whether Enterprise Search in
SharePoint 2010, or through implementing FAST Search Server as part of
their topologies. In either scenario, customers are looking to minimize
the impact of upgrade and promote more rapid adoption -- scenarios often
include migrating or upgrading their existing SharePoint deployments to
include search, or migrating components of their existing deployments,"
said Bill Baer, Microsoft's Technical Product Manager for SharePoint.

    "Working with our partner Metalogix, Search First enables customers to
upgrade their search infrastructure to SharePoint 2010 while maintaining
a user experience their end users are familiar with -- providing
organizations a more granular approach to upgrade and allowing an upgrade
or migration of existing deployments to occur over time," stated Baer.

    "Metalogix prides itself on providing easy to use tools and solutions for
customers to leverage the robust features SharePoint has to offer. We
were thrilled at the opportunity to work with Microsoft and help existing
SharePoint 2007 customers to leverage new SharePoint 2010 search
capabilities. This will help them better manage their SharePoint data and
prepare for a move to SharePoint 2010 in the future," says Julien
Sellgren, CTO for Metalogix.

    About Metalogix Software

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTSDALE, AZ, Nov 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC), a leader in viewing,
collaboration and redaction technology announces release of its Brava!(R)
Enterprise 7 software for Microsoft(R) SharePoint(R) 2010.

    Brava for SharePoint allows users to easily interact with documents
anywhere, anytime using only their web browser. Brava adds key
document-centric workflow actions including the ability to add stamps,
create threaded discussions and other markups, publish documents to PDF
or TIFF, and redact sensitive content and privacy information. 

    With Brava, SharePoint 2010 customers can:


--  View virtually any file format, even CAD drawings, within SharePoint.
--  Enhance SharePoint document searches with thumbnails, full document
    previews, in-document context-based and term-hit navigation.
--  Enhance transactional, document-centric workflows to provide greater
    usability, efficiency, content security and the accuracy of change
    communication.
--  Provide users more insight into the document by embedding a thumbnail,
    full document view or document metadata display on any SharePoint page
    through standard web parts.
--  Support compliance requirements by adding metadata-driven stamps or
    watermarks, recording discussions and their resolutions and by
    performing intelligent, pattern-based redaction.

    

Gary Heath, IGC's President and CEO, said, "Informative Graphics has
been a provider of document software for the leading ECM solutions for
twenty years. Now we are bringing that same, proven ECM document
technology and expertise to SharePoint 2010, offering unique,
ready-to-use benefits to SharePoint ISV's, SI's and corporate end users.
Our technology delivers clear value to document-centric processes and
really improves how Information Workers find and interact with the data
they need to perform their jobs."

      important milestone in CIBT&#8217;s strategy to provide visa and other travel

&lt;p&gt; * Safety monitors stop Phase III apixaban trial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says bleeding risk outweighs clinical benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Trial involved patients with acute coronary syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Companies say to continue development of apixaban&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds company comment and background, paragraphs 4, 8-)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - In a clinical setback, Pfizer
Inc (PFE.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) said a
late-stage study of their closely watched blood thinner
apixaban was halted due to safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plug was pulled on a study of 10,800 patients with
acute coronary syndrome after an independent data monitoring
committee found a "clinically important increase in bleeding"
that was not offset by the benefits of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies have informed the trial's researchers, ethics
review boards and regulatory health authorities of the decision
to stop the study of patients with acute coronary syndrome at
risk of stroke or other ischemic events, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Studies of apixaban for other uses are ongoing, Pfizer and
Bristol-Myers said. These include prevention of strokes in
patients with atrial fibrillation -- a type of irregular
heartbeat -- which is considered the largest and most important
potential indication for such drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban belongs to a new class of oral anti-coagulant
drugs called factor Xa inhibitors that aim to replace the
problematic warfarin -- a widely used 65-year-old medicine that
must be closely monitored because of the small difference
between a therapeutic and toxic dose. Warfarin, while highly
effective, also interacts badly with some foods and other
medicines and carries a high risk of dangerous bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several other companies are developing drugs similar to
apixaban that are expected to compete in an estimated $10
billion a year market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The class of blood clot preventers has demonstrated
impressive efficacy, but the risk of dangerous bleeding is
always a concern with these types of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the halted trial, patients were given apixaban or a
placebo on top of standard of care -- aspirin and the
widely-used clot preventer Plavix, sold by Bristol-Myers and
Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) -- meaning some patients were taking
three blood thinners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Going in we wanted to see if we could achieve enough
incremental efficacy to offset incremental bleeding," Jack
Lawrence, head of apixaban development for Bristol-Myers said
in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The halted trial is one of nine Phase III clinical studies
currently evaluating apixaban. The data-monitoring committee
also recommended discontinuation of a separate Phase II study
of acute coronary syndrome patients in Japan, the companies
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acute coronary syndrome typically involves chest pain and
risk of heart attack due to blocked arteries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies are awaiting an approval decision in Europe
for apixaban to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing

&lt;p&gt; * Safety monitors stop Phase III apixaban trial&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says bleeding risk outweighs clinical benefits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Trial involved patients with acute coronary syndrome&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Companies say to continue development of apixaban&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - In a clinical setback, Pfizer
Inc (PFE.N) and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) said a late
stage study of their closely-watched blood thinner apixaban was
halted due to safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plug was pulled on a 10,800-patient study after an
independent data monitoring committee found a "clinically
important increase in bleeding" that was not offset by the
benefits of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies have informed the trial's researchers, ethics
review boards and regulatory health authorities of the decision
to stop the study of patients with acute coronary syndrome at
risk of stroke or other ischemic events, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban belongs to a new class of oral anti-coagulant
drugs called factor Xa inhibitors that aim to replace the
problematic warfarin -- a widely used 65-year-old medicine that
must be closely monitored because of the small difference
between a therapeutic and toxic dose. Warfarin, while highly
effective, also interacts badly with some foods and other
medicines and carries a high risk of dangerous bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Several other companies are developing drugs similar to
apixaban that are expected to compete in an estimated $10
billion a year market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The class of blood clot preventers have demonstrated
impressive efficacy, but the risk of dangerous bleeding is
always a concern with these types of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The halted trial is one of nine Phase III clinical studies
currently evaluating apixaban. The data monitoring committee
also recommended that a separate Phase II study of acute
coronary syndrome patients in Japan also be discontinued, the
companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We remain committed to the development of apixaban in
other patient populations," Brian Daniels, senior vice
president for Global Development and Medical Affairs at
Bristol-Myers Squibb, said in a statement.

its fuels marketing and aviation businesses in parts of the
Caribbean and Central America to a subsidiary of France's RUBIS
(RUBF.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vitogaz SA will buy 174 Texaco-branded service stations in

company-owned filling stations to 1,900 from 3,200 in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By restructuring our worldwide portfolio, we intend to

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - U.S.-based Walter Energy Inc (WLT.N) WTN.L is in talks to buy Canadian peer Western Coal Corp WTN.TO for $3.24 billion, as miners scramble to tap surging demand in Asia for steelmaking coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global steel demand is forecast to hit a record 1.34 billion tonnes in 2011, after 10 percent growth in top market China drove demand up more than expected this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massey Energy MEE.N, India's state-run Coal India Ltd (COAL.BO), Peabody Energy Corp (BTU.N), Alpha Natural Resources (ANR.N) and steelmaker ArcelorMittal (ISPA.AS) have been cited as potential buyers or targets in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tampa, Florida-based Walter Energy offered C$11.50 a share in cash and stock for Western Coal -- about 56 percent more than its Wednesday close -- and agreed to buy about 20 percent of the Canadian firm's shares from Audley Capital affiliates at that price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS analysts estimate Walter Energy's offer implied a coal price of about $208 a ton. In the third quarter, metallurgical coal prices averaged about $180 a ton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brian Gamble of Simmons  Co said the deal, which he said was expensive, was driven by a growing appetite for metallurgical, or coking, coal, which makes up more than three-quarters of Western Coal's portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That implies the valuation should be high," Gamble said. "We've seen international assets go at a significant premium to U.S.-based assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the deal is realized, Walter Energy and Western Coal would have combined reserves of about 385 million tons as well as access to major steel producing markets across the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Coal has mines in British Columbia and West Virginia, while Walter energy has mines in the Appalachia in eastern United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brean Murray Carret analysts, who are bullish on metallurgical coal, said a combined company would attract potential investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Coal makes itself all the more attractive for buyers as it ships using the relatively free Ridley terminals on the Pacific Coast, while Canadian peers Grande Cache Coal GCE.TO and Teck Resources (TCKb.TO) face congestion at Westshore, the country's largest coal export facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DEMAND FUELS MA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of dual-listed, Vancouver-based Western Coal jumped more than 45 percent in both London and Toronto. Walter Energy shares edged lower in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones U.S. Coal Index .DJUSCL -- which includes Arch Coal (ACI.N), Alpha Natural, Peabody, Massey, Patriot Coal as well as Walter Energy -- was up 3.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher steel demand has helped the index outpace the broader Dow Jones Industrial Average's .DJI 5 percent rise so far this year, and has driven speculation of growth in the sector through MA, which analysts say will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe (Thursday's offer) is not going to be the last deal in the met coal space, given how quickly the market appears to be tightening," Brean Murray said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposed deal comes amid a pick-up in MA activity in the coal sector, but Simmons' Gamble said Walter Energy had probably priced other U.S. players out of making any rival bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's entirely possible that someone comes in and outbids Walter for the assets, (but) it has to be someone from the international market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Coal is advised by RBC Capital, and Walter Energy by Morgan Stanley  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.020 Canadian Dollar)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Adveith Nair, Krishna N Das and Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter and Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

			The Coca-Cola Company Invites Phoenix to Experience the Fountain of 
      the Future
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pei Wei Asian Diner First Restaurant in Phoenix to Introduce Coca-Cola 
      Freestyle&#174;, New Touch Screen Fountain Dispenser
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174;, The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s exciting 
      new interactive fountain dispenser, called Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174;, 
      is available for the first time in Phoenix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Arizona-based Pei Wei Asian Diner, a long time Coca-Cola customer, will 
      be the first in the area to offer Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174;. Pei 
      Wei plans to feature Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174; in six of its 
      Phoenix area restaurants by the end of the year, the first of which is 
      located at 701 W McDowell Rd. in Phoenix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The sleek, stylish new fountains are touch screen operated, enabling 
      consumers to select from 106 regular and low-calorie branded beverages. 
      Many varieties of waters, fruit-flavored, still and sparkling beverages 
      are now available to U.S. consumers exclusively on Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174;. 
      The self-serve fountains &#8211; which represent a complete departure from 
      anything The Coca-Cola Company has offered previously &#8211; have been in 
      development for more than four years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have created a concept that is quickly becoming recognized as the 
      soda fountain of the future &#8211; the way people will experience Coca-Cola 
      beverages years from now,&#8221; said Gene Farrell, vice president, Coca-Cola 
      Freestyle&#174;, Coca-Cola North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results from beta testing that concluded at the end of 2009 indicate an 
      increase in total restaurant sales &#8211; including fountain servings &#8211; as 
      well as a measurable lift in traffic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The launch has expanded to include more than 150 restaurants in Atlanta, 
      Austin, Chicago, Dallas, Salt Lake City and Southern California, and the 
      company plans future introductions in other cities this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are thrilled that The Coca-Cola Company chose Pei Wei as the first 
      Phoenix area partner to unveil Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174;,&#8221; said KC 
      Moylan, Chief Operating Officer, Pei Wei Asian Diner. &#8220;Coca-Cola 
      Freestyle&#174; reflects Pei Wei&#8217;s &#8220;East of Usual&#8221; brand 
      philosophy, which encourages guests to take a step off the beaten path 
      and try something different from their ordinary routine.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to Phoenix, Coca-Cola Freestyle&#174; is also featured 
      in select Chicago, Dallas and Southern California Pei Wei restaurants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Offering a fresh-to-order menu, Pei Wei uses a Mandarin-style 
      wok-cooking process and features cuisine from five Asian countries: 
      China, Japan, Vietnam, Korea and Thailand. Designed with a vibrant, 
      contemporary, and urban-inspired style, Pei Wei provides a quick getaway 
      to five intriguing Asian cultures through their innovative, 
      pan-Asian-inspired menu.

&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s smartcamp global entrepreneur competition culminated in Dublin today with 9 startups from all around the world competing for the title of the &#8220;world&#8217;s smartest startup&#8221;. From 660 original applicants the final winner was Streetline, which helps cities track parking violations and drivers to find parking spots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ultra-low power sensors are installed in parking spots, which can detect if the space is occupied. Sensors can also be installed in the parking meter to verify whether the meter had been fed and therefore detect violations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Streetline, 30 percent of traffic in major cities consists of people driving around looking for parking, making it a major congestion and environmental problem. Parking fines are also a significant source of revenue for cities and currently many violations do not result in fines. Streetline systems are already deployed in cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. New York and Washington are about to be added. Streetline charges the city per space, per month in a service model. The company also just did its first deal with a private parking garage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to detecting parking violations, Streetline will release a smartphone application in early December to direct users to the closest parking pots. Once that is in place, a city could even start doing dynamic pricing of parking spots &#160;in order to direct drivers to particular parking areas.&#160;CEO Zia Yusuf told me that there are three major ways to get their product to consumers rather than just cities: the smartphone application, digital signs which direct people to parking (&#8220;3 spots if you turn left&#8221;) and finally partnerships with car navigation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, Yusuf would like to see cities introduce integrated parking systems which include monitoring like that supplied by Streetline, mobile payment for parking, alerts when parking time is running out and mobile ticketing. He suggests that a city could even send a ticket to your mobile phone with an offer that if you pay instantly, you get a discount on the fine. Streetline also has ambitions to extend its services into traffic monitoring and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of other startups received special mentions from the judges. Treemetrics is a local Irish company which uses&#160;3D laser scanning to measure the height, straightness, taper and volume of trees in a forest. This allows foresters to reduce measurement costs and schedule logging to maximise yield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sproxil tackles the huge problem of drug counterfeiting in developing countries using a simple scratch-off code attached to the packaging which works in a similar way to pre-paid mobile billing. The user exposes the code and sends it by text message to a verification number which checks its validity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For IBM, the smartcamp competition isn&#8217;t just a marketing exercise. 35 percent of IBM&#8217;s $100+ billion in&#160;revenue is driven by partners including startups. Irish social security software company C&#250;ram Software, for example, has alone driven 1 billion EU in sales for IBM over the course of their partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The common theme among startups in the finals was IBM&#8217;s smarter world mantra of instrumentation, interconnection and intelligence; basically lots of sensors and analysis of the data they produce. Most of the competing startups had deep domain knowledge in areas like healthcare, forestry, water treatment and seismic measurement as well as technical expertise. This fits well into IBM&#8217;s focus on vertical markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smartcamp competition was the brainchild of Martin Kelly, the European partner of IBM&#8217;s Venture Capital group and the first, smaller-scale&#160;competition was staged in Ireland last year. IBM&#8217;s Venture Capital group operates an unusual model in that it does not manage its own venture fund (like Intel and Google) but works with VCs to identify startups of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The startups get access to IBM&#8217;s market intelligence, customers and local know-how as well as the credibility a young company sometimes needs to deal with large enterprise customers. IBM gets an early look at interesting companies which could become partners or eventually acquisitions without actually investing its own cash. IBM has done 18 acquisitions in the last year alone. The company has set aside $20 billion for acquisitions up to 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Front photo by John Vachon, via Touching Harms the Art &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: data, parking, sensors, smartcamp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies: IBM, Sproxil, streetline, treemetrics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  GLEN ROCK, NJ, Nov 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Technical analyst Walter Murphy, a 33-year Wall Street veteran and author
of a well-regarded market letter that emphasizes strategic analysis for
the serious investor, has warned subscribers that "now is hardly the time
commit new assets to the market." 

    Murphy, who is managing partner of Walter Murphy Global Advisors LLC, is
a recognized expert in the Elliott Wave Principle. He also utilizes
momentum, cycles and investor sentiment. The firm monitors all major
asset classes and arrives at its opinions and strategies almost
exclusively through the use of technical analysis. In addition, the firm
monitors a select number of fundamental indicators, but this, too, is
done through the use of technical analysis.

    In a recent interview, Murphy said that he was looking for "trend changes
right across the board." Momentum and sentiment favored both a dollar
rally and a correction for gold. At the same time, Murphy -- who, in
July, advised his subscribers of a worthwhile summer rally for stocks --
believes that the four-month uptrend in the S 500 is now at risk of an
important reversal. His most recent Short Term Review warned subscribers
that both the rally from March 2009 to April 2010 and the subsequent
uptrend since last July's low are best counted as bear market rallies.
Since such rallies usually "end badly," Murphy has consistently suggested
that investors use market strength as an opportunity to cull
underperformers and adopt a more defensive posture.

    These pressures are global in scope. Murphy has told subscribers that the
technical underpinnings for most of the 37 non-US markets that the firm
monitors are similar to those in the US. Thus, a reversal of the
July-November intermediate uptrend should be global in scope.

    The goal of Walter Murphy Global Advisors, LLC is to help clients better
understand the capital markets under the belief that, if the markets'
signals are understood and anticipated, clients will have the opportunity
to make informed judgments that will lead, in turn, to more profitable
decisions.

    In addition to a monthly Insights newsletter, subscribers are kept up to
date during the month through Short Term Reviews, as well as a frequent
blog.

			BeyondTrust and Microsoft MVPs to Promote Education in Windows 
      Security
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MVPs Provide an Authoritative Voice from the Community on Best 
      Practices in Least Privilege
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BeyondTrust, the global leader in privilege delegation and authorization 
      management, today announced the company has teamed up with Darren 
      Mar-Elia and Derek Melber, two Microsoft Group Policy Most Valuable 
      Professionals (MVPs) to educate the market on implementing least 
      privilege in Windows environments. Darren and Derek are exceptional 
      technical experts committed to fostering conversation, educating the 
      market on best practices and overcoming industry challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft provides the MVP designation to recognize the best and 
      brightest from technology communities around the world. The award 
      recognizes community leaders from a wide range of backgrounds, including 
      not only technology professionals, but also teachers, artists, doctors, 
      and engineers, who actively share their real-world technical expertise 
      with the Microsoft community. The MVP designation awards these 
      inspirational individuals for representing the voice of the community 
      through powerful and independent feedback.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Darren Mar-Elia (MVP) founded SDM Software, contributes to Windows IT 
      Pro and blogs as the GPOGUY (Group Policy guy). Darren has held 
      technical roles at companies like Wells Fargo and Quest Software for 15 
      years with a focus on Microsoft infrastructure and application 
      technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The best practice of &#8216;least privilege&#8217; is well known, but it often 
      comes across as more difficult to implement than it really is,&#8221; said 
      Microsoft MVP Darren Mar-Elia. &#8220;It&#8217;s always surprising on a number of 
      levels when I come across an enterprise that doesn&#8217;t see the value in 
      least privilege. One of my chief priorities will be to convert 
      nay-sayers into advocates, by demonstrating how easy and necessary it 
      is.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Derek Melber (MCSE, MVP) is an independent speaker, author, and 
      consultant. Derek evangelizes and educates administrators and companies 
      around the world on Microsoft technology. Derek focuses on Active 
      Directory, Group Policy, security, and desktop management. As the author 
      of the MSPress &#8220;The Group Policy Resource kit&#8221; and sought after speaker, 
      Derek delivers technology to thousands of technologists every year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Least Privilege is the hottest topic at this time for nearly every 
      vertical and company that I come across. The concepts of reducing end 
      users and admins to least privilege are ever growing. BeyondTrust has 
      been solving least privilege issues for years and is by far the leader 
      in the space,&#8221; Derek Melber stated. &#8220;PowerBroker Desktops Windows 
      Edition is efficient, simple, and non-obtrusive to your network. Just 
      this past month I have shown government, military, finance, medical, and 
      even technical companies how to solve least privilege in less than just 
      one week for all desktops.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Nov 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aspect, a global provider of unified communications and collaboration
services and software, today announced it has completed the deployment of
Microsoft Lync Server 2010 to more than 1,600 of its approximately 1,900
global employees within one week of the software being made publicly
available for trial. All Aspect office-based and work-from-home employees
in the Americas and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) are now using
Microsoft Lync 2010 for all voice and voicemail services, audio and Web
conferencing, instant messaging (IM) and presence. Roll-out to the
Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is planned for December, to complete a 100
percent company-wide deployment by the close of 2010. 

    The enriched collaboration capabilities of Lync enable Aspect employees
to better connect, share and engage with colleagues, partners and
customers both inside and outside of the enterprise to deliver more
effective real-time interactions in their daily communications. 

    The company's decision to rapidly migrate to Lync Server 2010 from its
predecessor, Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007, clearly
demonstrates Aspect's commitment to advancing the deployment and use of
unified communications and collaboration (UCC). It is a natural
progression for Aspect, which made a strategic move to implement a
company-wide unified communications infrastructure nearly two years ago,
replacing its traditional telephony and PBX infrastructure across all 20
countries in its global enterprise. As part of the strategy, Aspect
equipped its own global technical support organization -- or contact
center -- with a full complement of UC capabilities to enhance customer
contact. Aspect's enterprise-wide adoption has resulted in staggering
cost-savings in traditional telephony and conferencing expenses totaling
$2 million in the first 12months, while driving greater efficiency and
collaboration.

    "By taking the initiative in deploying Lync Server 2010 within its own
enterprise, Aspect not only demonstrates its expertise in executing
successful business-critical next-generation enterprise communications
strategies," said Kirk Gregersen, senior director of product management,
Microsoft Lync, "but also serves as a model to other organizations
looking to capitalize on the business and productivity gains like those
Aspect can realize with help from Lync."

    Aspect's depth of experience in using and deploying UCC technologies,
combined with strength drawn from its roots in the mission-critical
contact center solutions arena, make it a highly-experienced partner for
companies wanting to adopt a Microsoft unified communications strategy to
address their own business requirements.

    "Aspect is walking the walk when it comes to unified communications,"
said Jamie Ryan, senior vice president, Information Technology and chief
information officer, Aspect. "In the span of just a few days, more than
1,600 Aspect employees are already using Lync 2010's extended
collaboration capabilities for a truly enhanced connected experience.
With our initial deployment of Office Communications Server 2007, we
witnessed brisk user adoption and explosive increases in efficiency and
productivity. Now, with an established culture of collaboration and the
new Lync enhancements, Aspect expects employees will quickly and eagerly
embrace new opportunities for working together."

    Several of the Lync 2010 enhanced sharing and collaboration features have
already been widely adopted by Aspect employees allowing them to
collaborate and communicate like never before, including:


--  Extended sharing capabilities, including sharing at the application
    level
--  Full integration of sharing and multi-participant collaboration into
    the Lync 2010 application environment, providing greater ease of use
    and a more streamlined experience
--  Enhanced security and access controls for meetings
--  Enhanced presence and contact information, including status,
    organization and reporting structures and pictures

    

Architectural improvements including a smaller footprint and support
for virtualization help Aspect better leverage IT resources and reduce
its carbon footprint.

      November 18, 2010 - RELATED TICKERS: SPDR SP 500 ETF (NYSE: SPY), 
      Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM), 
      Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN), 
      Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) 
      and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After major selling in the markets the past week, the markets are 
      hovering fractionally higher in quiet volume. It is as if Wall Street 
      has taken the day off after the massive sell yesterday. The SPDR SP 
      500 ETF (NYSE: SPY) 
      are trading at $118.44. +0.28 (+0.24%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Dollar is slightly weaker which is helping keep the markets flat to 
      higher. This is a strange day to say the least as volume is 
      non-existent. This is the hump day for options expiration and one has to 
      wonder what the institutions have planned for Thursday and Friday.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first two days of this week, the institutions wiped out the call 
      holders the drop. Could they lift the markets into the end of the way, 
      taking out the put holders?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stocks across the board are mostly flat to higher. With the Dollar 
      slightly weaker, Wall Street is eyeing commodity plays like Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) 
      which is slightly higher on the day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Technology is stronger overall as well, with stocks like Amazon.com, 
      Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) 
      bouncing. The main weak sector is clearly seen to be the bank stocks. 
      Both Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) 
      and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) 
      are lower. After a wild few days of massive swing trade and day trade 
      profits, the markets are pausing. Be ready for the next major move in 
      the markets.

      Zacks Bull  Bear of the Day Highlights Whole Foods Market, Amdocs, Bank 
      of America, JPMorgan Chase and PNC
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zacks Equity Research highlights: Whole Foods Market (NASDAQ: WFMI) 
      as the Bull of the Day and Amdocs Ltd. (NYSE: DOX) 
      as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
      analysis on Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), 
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) 
      and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=5506.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Whole Foods Market (WFMI) 
      with a strong brand image offers investors one of the strongest growth 
      profiles in the industry, and the stock is poised to surge, as the 
      demand for natural and organic products improves. The company is also 
      revamping its pricing strategy and concentrating more on value 
      offerings, while maintaining healthy margins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The stringent cost-control measures, effective inventory management and 
      improved store-level performance are driving earnings growth. The 
      company now expects bottom-line growth of 16% to 20% in fiscal 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, a prudent capital investment is also translating into improved 
      cash flows with lower debt levels and a healthy balance sheet. 
      Consequently, we have an Outperform recommendation on the stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We downgrade our recommendation for Amdocs Ltd. (DOX) 
      on the basis of its disappointing financial outlook for the first 
      quarter of fiscal 2011. Profitability will suffer as a result of higher 
      expenses for productivity improvement, emerging market sales opportunity 
      and suspension of program implementation at Clearwire.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe bottom-line shrinkage may continue thereafter since the 
      developed economies are still not out of the wounds and emerging market 
      opportunities are subject to regulatory and geo-political uncertainties. 
      The company is still facing demand softness in the European and North 
      American markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We therefore downgrade our rating to Underperform. Our target price of 
      $24 is based on a P/E of 11.4x our fiscal 2011 earnings estimate.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Foreclosure Mess Nearing End?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. bank regulators and a task force of Attorneys General (AGs) of all 
      50 states of the nation are gearing up to settle the foreclosure issue 
      at large financial institutions early next year, CNBC reported on 
      Tuesday. This would undoubtedly lessen the looming threat on housing 
      recovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      But the aftermath of faulty paperwork might still make it difficult for 
      lenders to find home buyers in the years to come. The foreclosure mess 
      would probably cast a long shadow on U.S. housing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Proposed Settlement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upcoming settlement by the AGs has a three-pronged approach. 
      Firstly, major lenders including Bank of America Corp. (BAC), 
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) 
      and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC) 
      would contribute money into a fund that will be used to compensate 
      borrowers who have lost homes due to the foreclosure, if they can prove 
      that they were the victims of flawed paperwork. The AGs would administer 
      the payment process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Secondly, banks will decimate dual-track modifications and foreclosures. 
      Accordingly, banks can start foreclosing only after all options of 
      modification are exhausted. This will give time to borrowers who are in 
      an indeterminate state of the modification process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Finally, a third party intervention would be required for the reviewing 
      of cases in which borrowers will claim compensation from the AG fund.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, the leader of the task force, said 
      that the mortgage servicing system is not competent to handle 
      foreclosures and is encumbering loan modifications. Also, according to 
      Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the loan 
      modifications have to be more robust to result in real principal 
      forgiveness. If this comes out of theory and is realized, the housing 
      crisis will definitely come to an end.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Foreclosure Flaws
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the time of foreclosing homes, many lenders use &#8216;robo-signers&#8217; - 
      employees who sign hundreds of documents a day without verifying 
      decisive information like the previously outstanding amounts of 
      borrowers. This is the primary reason behind the mess.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The problem intensified because of the negligence of homeowners and 
      lawyers despite their awareness. In many cases, signatures were not 
      reviewed by any notary. Even when notarizations took place, it is 
      unlikely that the officials witnessed the signings as per the legal 
      requirement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Flawed paperwork also raised questions about the validity of the 
      ownership documents. In many cases, an individual who moved into a house 
      after a payment may not be the legal owner. As a result, mortgage 
      lenders improperly expelled original homeowners from their homes as part 
      of their foreclosure process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Congressional Watchdog Warning
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Congressional Oversight Panel, which oversees the government's $700 
      bailout program, said in a report on Tuesday that the chaos resulting 
      from foreclosure paperwork could result in massive losses for banks and 
      a new quandary for the housing market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rampant paperwork lapses have embroiled major lenders in a number of 
      lawsuits by homeowners in the second half of September. As a result, 
      these lenders temporarily suspended foreclosures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the Oversight Panel report, financial firms that service a 
      total of $6.4 trillion in mortgages are involved in the foreclosure 
      mess. The problem is in danger of being compounded after the foreclosure 
      freeze was removed by the Obama administration, which cited that a 
      suspension is not required in all 50 states.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Road Ahead
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Though the proposed settlement is expected to lessen the paperwork 
      flaws, which will gradually put an end to the foreclosure mess, we 
      expect the problem to persist for a longer period as in some cases the 
      lenders have no information about the owners of the loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result, a significant stress will persist in housing recovery. 
      Also, lenders could be unable to prove their ownership on mortgage loans 
      due to wrong documentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the housing crisis, the pressure on the lenders to hasten the 
      foreclosure process is primarily responsible for the mess. Though the 
      harm had already been done before the burst of the housing bubble, an 
      immediate action was required when the problem was detected. However, 
      better late than never; the latest initiatives would at least control 
      before the damage spreads further.

			Micro Focus Launches Enhanced Terminal Emulation Suite with Microsoft 
      Office Integration
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RUMBA 8.1 expands developer and productivity tools to create new 
      applications and extend existing business-critical applications
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Micro 
      Focus&#174;, the leading provider of enterprise application 
      modernization, testing and management solutions, today announced the 
      availability of RUMBA 8.1, an enhanced version of the company&#8217;s terminal 
      emulation suite. The upgraded suite now includes Microsoft Office 
      integration, an innovative tile and zoom user interface, automatic 
      historical data capture, FIPS-compliant 
      security and customizable developer tools. With this new version, users 
      can gain flexibility, productivity and reliability in a complete and 
      secure end-to-end solution. RUMBA 8.1 gives developers the ability to 
      use custom tools to create new applications, as well as tap into the 
      full functionality of existing business-critical applications running on 
      the mainframe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the integration with Microsoft Office, end users can immediately 
      transfer data and transaction details within RUMBA to Microsoft Office 
      applications This functionality enables the quick and easy transfer of 
      transaction information to other users, ensuring minimal business 
      disruption while improving customer end-user satisfaction. With this 
      streamlined approach, RUMBA customers gain efficiency and realize cost 
      savings with increased transaction productivity in a low-risk 
      environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As organizations look to reduce IT spending and increase operational 
      efficiency, it&#8217;s critical that they identify the low-cost and low-risk 
      strategies that will extend the lifecycle of business-critical 
      applications,&#8221; said Archie Roboostoff, product marketing director at 
      Micro Focus. &#8220;By reducing the complexity and increasing user 
      productivity, RUMBA 8.1 enables businesses to leverage terminal 
      emulation as a strategic resource in any modernization plan.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the Microsoft Office integration, RUMBA 8.1 captures 
      historical data and screens during the normal use of the product. The 
      immediate availability of past information and screens allows end users 
      to be more efficient and share specific insights with multiple users 
      within the organization, reducing training time and increasing 
      productivity. Users can also build issue-specific profiles or best 
      practices, which allow customer service teams to instantly access 
      background information on recurring queries and help end users 
      accurately resolve problems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RUMBA 8.1 also features the RUMBA Developer Edition which is compatible 
      with .NET and Visual Studio 2008 / 2010. With this expanded 
      compatibility, users have access to the latest APIs and can develop 
      custom applications to effectively support their business needs in real 
      time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Customers using RUMBA 8.1 can also seamlessly migrate data and users 
      from multiple emulators into RUMBA, keeping the user experience 
      consistent and reducing costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to RUMBA 8.1, Micro Focus is also announcing the 
      availability of Web-to-Host 6.1, the new version of the browser-based 
      terminal emulator which incorporates features from RUMBA 8.1 and 
      provides support for double-byte character set (DBCS) systems to support 
      additional languages, such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean. A new 
      version of the user interface modernization solution, OnWeb 7.5, is also 
      available in this recent Micro Focus terminal emulation update. OnWeb 
      7.5 brings development and runtime support for Windows Server 2008, 
      Visual Studio 2008 / 2010 and Windows 7; integration support for VT220 
      UNIX terminals; and security and performance upgrades.

      and will serve as the launch for a &#8220;Decade of Citizen Diplomacy,&#8221; to

			Global Knowledge Wins Five Stars for Microsoft Training
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global 
      Knowledge has received top honors and two Five-Star 
      Awards for its Microsoft 
      training in Redmond magazine&#8217;s 2010 Readers&#8217; Choice 
      Awards. This is the eighth year in a row Redmond readers have recognized 
      Global Knowledge with top awards for training.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This year, Global Knowledge scored better than any other Microsoft 
      Independent Software Vendor (ISV) for Best Windows Certification-Based 
      Boot Camp and for Best Online, Disk-Based, or Instructor-Led Training, 
      picking up a Five-Star Award in both categories. The Five-Star Award, 
      new to the 2010 Readers' Choice Awards program, was created to recognize 
      products that have won in the same category for five consecutive years.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			"Student endorsement of our Microsoft training is the highest 
      validation and reflects the top quality and positive learning experience 
      we strive to provide for our students,&#8221; said Michael Fox, Global 
      Knowledge Senior Vice President. "We are delighted to be recognized by 
      Redmond magazine readers for the eighth consecutive year," he added.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In the competitive Best Windows Certification-Based Boot Camp 
      category, Global Knowledge was given the top ISV spot by 33% of 
      Redmond&#8217;s readership, just behind Microsoft&#8217;s own training. &#8220;None of the 
      other vendors in this category came close to the top two,&#8221; wrote Lee 
      Pender, executive editor of features for Redmond magazine.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global Knowledge delivers a full schedule of Microsoft 
      training courses worldwide and has received awards from 
      Redmond magazine readers every year since 2003.

&lt;p&gt;AudioCodes Achieves Microsoft Qualification for SIP Trunking Interoperability
With Verizon Business

LOD, Israel, Nov. 18, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- AudioCodes (Nasdaq:AUDC), a
leading provider of Voice over IP (VoIP) technologies and Voice Network
products, today announced it has achieved interoperability qualification for its
Mediant 3000 and Mediant 1000 Enterprise Session Border Controllers with
Microsoft Lync Server 2010 and Microsoft Office Communications Server R2, when
used in conjunction with Verizon Business' SIP Trunking service. The
qualification testing was conducted by tekVizion Labs, Microsoft's Unified
Communication Open Interoperability Program (UC OIP) testing partner.

By using the AudioCodes' Enterprise Session Border Controllers (E-SBC),
enterprise customers can securely connect their Microsoft Unified Communications
environment to Verizon Business' SIP trunking services, as well as to other SIP
trunking service providers worldwide. The tekVizion certification confirms
interoperability and feature transparency between the Microsoft system and the
SIP trunking service. With AudioCodes Mediant platforms, customers can support
PSTN and SIP Trunk interfaces in the same box, preventing forklift upgrades, and
enabling gradual migration from costly PSTN circuits to SIP Trunking services,
providing security and interoperability.

AudioCodes' Mediant 1000 platform is a flexible networking device, supporting a
number of services for the Microsoft UC environment. The Mediant 1000 can
simultaneously connect the Microsoft Lync 2010 server, Microsoft Office
Communications Server 2007 or Microsoft Exchange Server 2007/2010 into existing
TDM PBXs, IP-PBXs or PSTN services, as well as into SIP Trunking services. In
addition, it can be configured as a standalone "Basic" or "Enhanced" gateway, as
well as a "Basic Hybrid Gateway" or "Survivable Branch Appliance", integrating
Microsoft software inside. It can be ordered as a TDM-to-IP gateway, a
Multi-Service Business Gateway, an Enterprise Session Border Controller, or a
combination of the three, supporting up to 120 TDM-to-IP channels and 150 SBC
sessions.

AudioCodes' Mediant 3000 platform is an enterprise-class, high density, fault
tolerant Media Gateway and Session Border Controller. It supports redundant
configurations of up to 2016 TDM-to-IP and 1000 SBC sessions, enabling TDM and
IP connectivity for large enterprise' Microsoft UC environments.

"We are happy to announce another milestone in our roadmap to enable ubiquitous
connectivity for Microsoft UC networks," stated Nimrod Borovsky, Vice President
of Marketing at AudioCodes. "Our Mediant family of VoIP platforms has been key
to our success in delivering secure and interoperable connectivity solutions for
the Microsoft environment. Enterprises can safely use our products to create a
fully connected Microsoft world, supporting the evolution from TDM PBXs and PSTN
networks, to IP systems and SIP Trunking services."

      president and general manager, Virtualization and Monitoring at Quest. 
      "This is a rare opportunity for users to learn how they can build a 
      comprehensive solution stack to reap the benefits of desktop 
      virtualization from the three industry leaders in desktop virtualization 
      management, services and foundational infrastructure.&#8221;

      Solution Experts from HP will share best practices for planning, 
      architecting, implementing, and supporting desktop virtualization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Businesses are increasingly considering desktop virtualization 
      solutions, so we&#8217;re excited to work together with Quest and HP on these 
      informative virtualization symposiums,&#8221; said Shanen Boettcher, general 
      manager, U.S. server and tools marketing at Microsoft. &#8220;Our joint North 
      American tour will focus on educating customers on the benefits of 
      desktop virtualization adoption and Windows 7 migration.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Clients need a comprehensive, integrated desktop virtualization 
      approach that increases the functionality of existing infrastructure and 
      meets diverse needs,&#8221; said Tom Norton, global practice director, 
      Microsoft and Client Infrastructure Consulting Services at HP. &#8220;As part 
      of the multi-city symposia on desktop virtualization with Quest and 
      Microsoft, HP will help participants understand the value in creating a 
      strategy for architecting, executing and maintaining desktop

      EM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Lonza will offer a live Webinar on the benefits and value of 
      implementing LabVantage Micro/EM&#8482;, powered by MODA&#8482;&#8212;a paperless QC Micro 
      solution by Lonza&#8212;on Tuesday, December 14, 2010 at 8:00 AM EST 
      (International) or 11:00 AM EST (US).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The presentation will feature Karen Grohalski, Manager of 
      Laboratory Operations, Quality Systems at Pfizer Global Manufacturing, 
      the world&#8217;s leading biopharmaceutical company with a diversified global 
      health care portfolio. Also presenting will be Robert Voelkner, from 
      LabVantage Solutions, a co-sponsor of the event.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Webinar topics will include:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				LabVantage&#174; and Lonza Vision to Integrate MODA&#8482; Solution with 
        LIMS
			
			
				Pfizer's Rationale to Augment LIMS with Purpose-built QC Micro 
        Solution
			
			
				Pfizer's Previous Processes; Need for Automation and Integration 
        with LIMS

				Why Pfizer Selected LabVantage Micro/EM&#8482;, powered by MODA&#8482;
			
			
				Pfizer&#8217;s Plans for the Future
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			This webinar will discuss QC automation best practices that Pfizer 
      is implementing across some of its global manufacturing facilities, and 
      the functionality gap between standalone LIMS and today&#8217;s requirements 
      in QC Micro for EM, utility, and product testing. Topics will be 
      relevant to IT and business audiences.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Paper-based processes still burden most QC Micro programs: paper 
      scheduling, sharpie pen labeling of sample media, manual reconciliation, 
      paper log book entry, and manual notification on deviations. These steps 
      are labor-intensive, time consuming, and yield duplication of tasks and 
      high error rates. Pfizer has successfully implemented LabVantage 
      Micro/EM&#8482;, powered by MODA&#8482; by Lonza. As a result, Pfizer is achieving 
      their goal to automate their QC processes and regulatory compliance 
      across some of their global manufacturing facilities.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In May 2010, MODA became a Lonza company. What started as a 
      company-wide initiative to eliminate waste, reduce lead and labor time, 
      and improve overall compliance, inspired a robust informatics platform 
      for the life sciences industry.
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			More science. Less paper.&#8482; The MODA&#8482; product strengthens Lonza&#8217;s 
      Rapid Testing Solutions platform by adding a complementary product 
      offering for quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) 
      organizations in the life science industry. The MODA&#8482; solution offers 
      automated data collection, on demand analytics and workflow 
      visualization of regulated manufacturing processes, including 
      environmental monitoring, utility testing, and product testing. The 
      MODA&#8482; mobile data acquisition platform eliminates inefficiencies and 
      reduces error rates inherent with paper-based systems in regulated 
      manufacturing operations.

      &#8220;We are pleased to welcome to our senior management team Walt Piskorski, 
      a longtime colleague who will give us the support and guidance on 
      development and manufacturing we need as we move toward initiation of 
      the TRIADE study,&#8221; said Anthony A. McKinney, President, CEO of 
      Euthymics. &#8220;It is important that all elements of the TRIADE study, 
      including good manufacturing practice, are executed correctly. Walt has 
      a rich background and a record of success overseeing technical 
      operations that we believe will lead to important contributions to 
      Euthymics as our programs move forward.&#8221;

      Mr. Piskorski&#8217;s experience with late-stage products includes Lunesta&#174;, 
      Xopenex&#174; and Contrave&#174;. Most recently he served as 
      Senior Vice President of Technical Operations at Orexigen Therapeutics, 
      Inc., where he was in charge of manufacturing, quality, development and 
      distribution, with a focus on Contrave which has been submitted to the 
      FDA for obesity. Previously, Mr. Piskorski was Vice President of 
      Manufacturing at Sepracor, Inc., where he directed all product 
      manufacturing and distribution operations, and was involved in the 
      commercialization of several successful products. Earlier in his career,

      In addition to Mr. Piskorski&#8217;s appointment, Euthymics announced that the 
      company has moved into permanent headquarters in Cambridge,

      Euthymics&#8217; work toward achieving critical milestones planned in the 
      remaining months of 2010 and the first half of 2011.

      Euthymics Bioscience, Inc. is a neuroscience-focused clinical-stage 
      company developing next-generation treatments for central nervous system 
      disorders. The company&#8217;s lead product candidate, EB-1010 for depression, 
      is a triple reuptake inhibitor that acts on serotonin, norepinephrine 
      and dopamine in a specific unbalanced ratio and is given as monotherapy 
      (a single capsule). EB-1010 has demonstrated proof-of-concept efficacy 
      as treatment for major depression without causing weight gain or loss of 
      sexual function, which often lead to poor adherence to standard 
      antidepressants.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Euthymics also plans to develop a second triple reuptake inhibitor, 
      EB-1020, which is in the late research stage, for adult ADHD and

  (Recasts; adds details from Walter Energy press release; adds
shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGALORE, Nov 18 (Reuters) - U.S. coal maker Walter Energy
(WLT.N) said it is in talks to buy Canada's Western Coal
WTN.TO WTN.L for $3.24 billion, to create a steelmaking
coal giant aimed at exploiting Asian demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The combined company would be the leading, publicly traded
'pure-play' metallurgical coal producer in the world, with
access to steel-producing markets in both the Atlantic and
Pacific Basins," Walter Energy said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter Energy said it would pay Western Coal C$3.3 billion,
or C$11.50 a share, in cash and stock, a premium of nearly 56
percent to the stock's Wednesday close on the Toronto Stock
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter Energy added it would buy 20 percent of Western
Coal's outstanding shares from affiliates of Audley Capital for
C$11.50 each, or C$630 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Vancouver-based Western Coal were up 41 percent
at 635 pence at 1135 GMT on the London Stock Exchange. The
shares closed at C$7.38 Wednesday in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter Energy shares fell 5 percent to $90 in premarket
trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed deal comes amid a pick-up in MA activity in
the sector. (For a related TAKE A LOOK [ID:nLDE6AF0YH])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Massey Energy MEE.N said it is looking to
make acquisitions of its own, a few days after India's
state-run Coal India Ltd (COAL.BO) said it was in talks to buy
mines from Massey and another U.S. coal producer, Peabody
Energy Corp (BTU.N). [ID:nN17226033]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Alpha Natural Resources (ANR.N) said it
is bullish on the longer-term outlook for coal, and that it is
actively looking for acquisitions. [ID:nN03219400]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Western expects to produce 6.1 million tonnes of coal for
the fiscal year ending March 31, 2011, growing to 10 million
tonnes for fiscal 2013. Tampa, Florida-based Walter Energy
expects to produce 6.6 million tonnes of coal in the calendar
year 2010, growing to 8.6 million in the calendar year 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter Energy's proposal is subject to due diligence,
during which time Western has agreed to work exclusively with
the company for up to 14 days expiring December 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If an agreement is not reached by the companies then no
penalties will be incurred by either party, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Western Coal established a committee of its independent
directors to review the proposal, with Deloitte  Touche LLP
acting as independent financial advisers to the committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley  Co will advise Walter Energy, while RBC
Capital Markets will advise Western Coal.

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, Nov 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT) (or "the Company"), a leading U.S. producer and
exporter of premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry,
announced today that it has submitted a proposal (the "Proposal") to
Western Coal Corp. (TSX: WTN) (AIM: WTN) to acquire the outstanding
common shares of Western Coal for CAD$11.50 per share in cash and Company
stock. In connection with the Proposal, Walter Energy has entered into an
exclusivity agreement with Western Coal under which they have agreed to
work exclusively with each other for a period of up to 14 days toward the
negotiation of definitive agreements to give effect to the Proposal. The
transaction would be effected by way of a statutory plan of arrangement
pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia). 

    Separately, Walter Energy has agreed to purchase from affiliates of
Audley Capital ("Audley") common shares representing 19.8 percent of the
outstanding common shares of Western Coal for CAD$11.50 per share, or a
total consideration of approximately CAD$630 million (USD$615 million),
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances. The total enterprise
value of the proposal for Western Coal, including the purchase from
Audley Capital, is CAD$3.3 billion (USD$3.2 billion), net of cash on the
balance sheet.

    "From a strategic perspective, a transaction with Western Coal would be
transformational for our company," said Joe Leonard, Interim Chief
Executive Officer of Walter Energy. "The combined company would be the
leading, publicly-traded 'pure-play' metallurgical coal producer in the
world, with unique and strategic access to steel producing markets in
both the Atlantic and Pacific Basins. The transaction would meaningfully
diversify both companies' operating and development portfolios and
provide new business opportunities which might not be available to either
company on a standalone basis. The combined company would also be well
positioned to participate in further strategic growth opportunities." 

    On a pro forma basis, the combined company would have total coal reserves
of approximately 385 million tons, based on the most recent disclosures
by Walter Energy and Western Coal. Walter Energy currently produces
approximately 7.0 million tons of premium metallurgical coal, with
organic expansion plans expected to increase that number to up to 9.5
million tons in 2012. Western Coal expects to produce a total of 6.7
million tons of coal in the fiscal year ended March 2011 and has growth
plans to achieve 11.0 million tons of total coal production during fiscal
year ended March 2013. The increase in production and reserves would
position the new entity to capitalize on the current and anticipated
strength in the global metallurgical coal markets. 

    Under the purchase agreement with Audley, the Company will purchase
approximately 54.5 million common shares of Western Coal owned by Audley,
representing 19.8 percent of the total outstanding common shares of
Western Coal, in two installments. Upon the satisfaction of closing
conditions, Walter Energy will acquire approximately 25.3 million common
shares for cash and will acquire the remainder of the stake in cash or
Company stock immediately upon the acquisition of Western Coal by Walter
Energy or, in any event, no later than April 30, 2011. The acquisition of
Audley's shares is subject to the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and
compliance with any other applicable competition laws. 

    With respect to Audley, Michael T. Tokarz, Chairman of Walter Energy,
added, "Audley's support, evidenced by its desire to have a continuing
interest in the combined company, is a vote of confidence in our ability
to create value through the proposed transaction. We also want to commend
Audley for the key role they played in the development of Western Coal
over the last three years." 

    Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Incorporated is acting as financial advisor and
Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP and Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt LLP are
acting as legal counsel to Walter Energy.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has pulled out of
selling a portion of Hilton Worldwide bonds after differences
arose over the terms of sale, the Wall Street Journal said,
citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman's pullout would leave Bank of America (BAC.N) alone
to sell the hotel chain's $1.56 billion bonds, down from the
$2.66 billion that were previously on offer in the joint sale,
the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment to the Journal. The bank could
not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside
regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The exact nature of the disagreement is not known, the paper
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors had demanded an extra premium for the Hilton bonds
because the deal was not rated, prompting the banks to offer
sweeter terms, according to the Journal.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 18 (Reuters) - Total underwriting fees for the initial 
public offering of General Motors Co could reach about 
$248 million, largely benefitting the lead bankers including 
JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley , the Wall 
Street Journal said.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan could each take home about $40 
million in fees from GM's IPO, the Journal said, citing a 
person familiar with the matter.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group of underwriters will split about $165 million, 
or 0.75 percent of the proceeds, with a higher fee of about 2 
percent being paid by General Motors for the $5 billion in 
convertible shares being raised, the Journal said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan, Bank of America and Citi 
 are listed as lead underwriters on the offering.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs 
 , Credit Suisse and Royal Bank of Canada 
 are the other major underwriters of the deal.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan could not immediately be

			Walton Big Lake Development L.P. Announces Private Placement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Asset Management L.P. (&#8220;Walton&#8221;) and Walton Big Lake Development 
      L.P. (&#8220;Big Lake Partnership&#8221;) are pleased to announce that the Big Lake 
      Partnership will commence a private placement offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The offering will consist of a non-brokered private placement of up to 
      464,406 units at a subscription price of $10.00 per unit for gross 
      proceeds of up to $4,644,060. The private placement will be conducted on 
      similar terms as the offering that the Big Lake Partnership completed on 
      November 17, 2010 under its prospectus dated October 27, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The net proceeds from both the private placement and the prospectus 
      offering will be used to purchase, manage and develop the 136.5 acre Big 
      Lake property located in Edmonton, Alberta.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Big Lake Partnership has been established to provide unitholders 
      with the opportunity to participate in the development of the Big Lake 
      property. Walton believes that the property is strategically located and 
      that investors can benefit from this development opportunity. The Big 
      Lake Partnership&#8217;s investment objectives are to preserve capital and 
      provide annual cash distributions beginning in 2011 until the completion 
      of the project, which is anticipated to be in December of 2015, which 
      would represent a net internal rate of return of 13.5% based on the 
      $10.00 unit purchase price.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Big Lake Partnership intends to meet its investment objectives 
      through a four-step strategy: (i) acquire the Big Lake property without 
      the use of leverage, (ii) obtain contractual commitments from 
      homebuilders to purchase lots to be serviced in each of the three 
      planned phases of the development of the property before construction 
      commences on that phase, (iii) construct municipal services 
      infrastructure on the property in phases to provide a controlled supply 
      of serviced lots to the marketplace, and (iv) use the revenue from the 
      sale of the serviced lots to repay construction loans and other 
      obligations of the Big Lake Partnership and then make distributions to 
      the Limited Partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Big Lake Partnership is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P., 
      which is part of the Walton Group of Companies. Development of the Big 
      Lake property will be managed by Walton Development and Management Inc., 
      whose team is comprised of 33 real estate development professionals 
      bringing over 350 years of combined experience in engineering, land 
      development, land planning, project management, finance, marketing and 
      municipal affairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      About Walton: In business for 30 years, the Walton Group of Companies is 
      one of North America&#8217;s leading land-based real estate and development 
      groups. The Walton Group currently manages approximately $2.7 billion of 
      pre-development and development assets, including over 55,000 acres of 
      land, on behalf of investors and clients around the world.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on Friday a
crude distillation unit at its Sarpom refinery in Italy, which
had been shut after a fire in September, was back in operation
and gradually resuming normal production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "After the unit was released from seizure on Oct. 23,
repairs were completed and required technical checks and
controls were undertaken to allow the safe restart of the
unit," a refinery spokeswoman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sarpom refinery, which refines about 7 million tonnes of
crude oil a year, located in Trecate, near Milan, is 74.1
percent owned by Exxon Mobil and 25.9 percent by Italy's

		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades JPMCC 2008-C2; Affirms Super Senior 'AAAs'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded 17 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Mortgage 
      Securities Trust, series 2008-C2, due to increased loss estimates on the 
      specially serviced loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the October 2010 remittance period, there are five loans (21.7%) 
      in special servicing. Of these loans, the largest two, The Promenade 
      Shops at Dos Lagos (11.1%) and The Westin Portfolio (9.2%) represent 
      approximately 12% of Fitch's expected losses. Total deal expected losses 
      could reach as high as 17.5% in the event these loans are liquidated at 
      current value estimates. Cumulative assumed losses are 19.4%, which 
      include the 1.9% in actual realized losses to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The pool's aggregate principal balance has decreased 2.9% to $1.13 
      billion from $1.17 billion at issuance. Cumulative interest shortfalls 
      in the amount of $12.5 million are currently affecting classes A-J 
      through T.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has designated 24 loans (46.9%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which 
      includes the five specially serviced loans (21.7%). The largest 
      specially serviced loan, The Promenade Shops at Dos Lagos, is comprised 
      of a 345,847 sf lifestyle/entertainment retail center built in 
      2006/2007. The loan transferred to special servicing in October 2008 for 
      monetary default after the borrower indicated the property was 
      significantly impacted by the downturn in the economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An updated appraisal was received in early 2010, which indicated a value 
      sharply lower than the value from the 2009 appraisal. Based on the 
      latest appraisal, the decline in value led the master servicer to 
      recognize an appraisal reduction of $108.1 million in May 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Recently, the current property manager presented a business plan that 
      will attempt to stabilize property operations. The plan focuses on 
      retaining the core tenants and building the tenant base around them. The 
      plan also includes the introduction of a new movie theatre operator, and 
      state-of-the-art upgrades to the 15-screen theater that is collateral to 
      the loan. The new operator brings strong experience to the center and 
      the manager anticipates that coupled with the equipment upgrades, 
      theater performance will be much stronger than it was under the previous 
      operator.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of November 2010, the special servicer indicated that tenant 
      retention has been better than anticipated and the asset is 88% leased. 
      The special servicer added that year-to-date tenant annual gross sales 
      appear to be stabilizing and performance through year-end will be an 
      important proxy for future workout strategies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The next largest contributor to expected losses consists of the Westin 
      Portfolio, which is comprised of the 487-room Westin La Polama in 
      Tucson, AZ, with a 27-hole Jack Nicklaus golf course and spa, and the 
      412-room oceanfront Westin Hilton Head, in Hilton Head, SC. The loan 
      transferred to special servicing in October 2008 for monetary default. 
      The properties were significantly affected by the recession and its 
      impact on business and leisure travel. Recently, special servicing 
      responsibilities were transferred from Midland Loan Services to LNR 
      Partners, Inc. LNR continues to negotiate with the borrower, and updated 
      appraisals are in progress. Fitch's current loss estimate is based on 
      recent broker opinions of value and the 2009 appraisal; however, Fitch 
      will review its analysis when the ordered appraisals are completed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One loan, which was previously specially serviced and represented 2.2% 
      of the pool, was disposed from the trust in July 2010. The class NR 
      balance was reduced from $21.9 million to $10.8 million after realized 
      losses.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares and options of Walter Energy Inc (WLT.N) surged on Friday, a day after news that the company has offered to acquire Canadian peer Western Coal Corp WTN.TO for $3.24 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors and bankers said the trading activity might be due to speculation that Walter itself could be a takeover target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Walter, in making this (Western Coal) move, put itself in the spotlight, and arguably both companies are in play right now," said one investment banker, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter shares rose 7.3 percent to $103.94 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after hitting a new 52-week high of $104.67 earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the options market, investors appeared to be picking up upside call options, looking for additional gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 34,000 calls and 14,000 puts traded in Walter shares by 2:22 p.m. EST, 7.7 times the combined average daily volume, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders focused on the December strike call, giving the right to buy Walter shares at $115. The December $105, $110, $120 and $125 calls have attracted interest as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the put side, the December $85 strike was also active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heavy option activity was accompanied by a rise in the stock's option implied volatility, a key component of an options price. It rose 3 percent to 54 percent during the session, said WhatsTrading.com options strategist Frederic Ruffy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Doris Frankel and Michael Erman; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Drug extends progression free survival of patients&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Drug showed "manageable" safety profile&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Nov 19 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said its
experimental drug for the treatment of patients with a certain
type of kidney cancer met the main goal of significantly
extending survival without disease progression in a late-stage
study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug, called axitinib, was compared with sorafenib -- a
kidney cancer drug made by Bayer (BAYGn.DE) also known as
Nexavar -- in the study population of previously treated
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axitinib showed a "generally manageable" safety profile in
the study, Pfizer said. It is currently testing the drug in
another late-stage trial for treating kidney cancer among both
patients who have not been treated previously and those who
have been treated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which plans to present the study results at an
upcoming medical meeting, did not disclose any further details
about the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to Thomson Reuters data, axitinib is expected to
bring in sales of about $439 million by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 210,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with kidney
cancer every year and nearly 102,000 people are expected to die
from the disease, Pfizer said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's "bad bank" National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) may have overestimated the scale of the banking problem and the government could overcapitalize the banks, investment bank Goldman Sachs said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN Nov 19 (Reuters) - Ireland's National Asset
Management Agency (NAMA) may have overestimated the scale of the
country's banking problem and the government may end up
overcapitalising the sector, investment bank Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman's baseline case for estimated gross credit losses
over the entire loan portfolio of domestic banks stands at 34.7
billion euros over the five-year cycle, or 21.7 percent of
Ireland's gross domestic product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ireland's price tag for cleaning up its banks, based on NAMA

lenders, at a discount of around 58 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If our estimates suggest anything, it is that ultimate

(land/property development and construction) loan losses of 24
billion euros, well below the 42 billion euros that will be
written off as a result of an asset transfer to NAMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added that the only way to match NAMA's estimate is to
assume that 75 percent of the land and development loan
portfolio of domestic Irish banks is lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think this is an extremely aggressive assumption by any
standards, especially given that only two-thirds of the land
development loans are secured on Irish property," Kojucharov
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In this sense, when it comes to potential further financial
burdens to the government from the banking system, our numbers
imply that there is more upside than downside... As far as the
collateral damage to the government from bank credit losses

		&lt;p&gt;
			Bamboo Solutions Expands the Collaborative Capabilities of 
      Best-Selling Project Management Application for Microsoft SharePoint
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Project Management Central allows organizations to leverage 
      their investment in SharePoint
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bamboo&#174; Solutions, the leading provider of technologies that 
      enhance Microsoft&#174; SharePoint&#174;, has released the latest version of 
      SharePoint Project Management Central (PM Central&#8482;).
			PM 
      Central provides dynamic, interactive workspaces for project teams, 
      enhancing the rich native collaborative capabilities of the Microsoft 
      SharePoint platform.
			Customer feedback has fueled product 
      features since its inception, and release 2.0 continues that tradition. 
      The most-requested collaboration and project management features have 
      been delivered in the new release and, combined with unlimited user 
      licensing, these new features substantially raise the bar for managing 
      projects across the enterprise in SharePoint.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Since the initial release in 2009, hundreds of organizations have 
      chosen PM Central over other applications, because of its cost savings, 
      user-friendly interface, resource management and improved collaborative 
      ability to view work and schedule from all projects.
			PM 
      Central builds on the native capabilities of the SharePoint platform, 
      providing data aggregation, enhanced tracking and scheduling, robust 
      document management and collaboration, and sophisticated communication 
      tools. As a standardized Project Management Information System (PMIS), 
      PM Central excels at project portfolio management, task and schedule 
      management, team communication, document management and collaboration, 
      and issue, cost, risk and resource management.
			The latest 
      version provides managers with greater flexibility when planning, 
      budgeting and executing against defined goals. The new features expand 
      on project-management best practices to dramatically improve users&#8217; 
      ability to perform and manage their daily work and projects beyond 
      simple data and task management in SharePoint.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New features include:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Usability &#8211; A number of improvements simplify a manager&#8217;s 
        workload and facilitate the management of multiple tasks and projects. 
        Create schedules based on Start Date and variables such as Due Date, 
        Duration or Work; edit multiple task items at one time; and filter 
        project information by department via a 3-tiered architecture for 
        enhanced multi-level tracking and reporting.
			
			
				Improved Dashboard and Reporting &#8211; Project budgets, costs, risks 
        and progress are much easier to assess through additional charts and 
        reports.
				Display key performance indicators (KPI) to 
        compare values between the project&#8217;s planned work and cost and the 
        actual work and cost. Baselining capabilities, Gantt views and KPIs, 
        custom reports, and more make identifying risks and monitoring project 
        health easier.
			
			
				Enhanced Project and Resource Management &#8211; Resource Management 
        improvements allow project managers to add a resource to a project 
        using the Enterprise Resource Pool or a SharePoint account. Resources 
        can also be added to a project during task creation. Task and project 
        allocation enable managers to assign a percentage of a resource&#8217;s time 
        to work on a task or project.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Customer feedback has driven PM Central&#8217;s development since its 
      inception,&#8221; said Lam Le, Chief Operating Officer of Bamboo Solutions. 
      &#8220;The extensive enhancements in PM Central
			2.0 come directly 
      from professional project managers. As a result, that this version is 
      far more than a SharePoint tool to manage projects; it&#8217;s a true 
      professional project management tool that happens to be integrated with 
      the SharePoint platform.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PM Central 2.0 for SharePoint 2007 is available for immediate 
      download via Bamboo&#8217;s online store. A SharePoint 2010 version will be 
      available before the end of the calendar year. PM Central includes 
      pre-built site definitions and Bamboo&#8217;s most popular Web Parts, which 
      can be immediately utilized and further customized across the SharePoint 
      deployment. Licensing is per server, supporting an unlimited number of 
      users. Existing customers who have procured PM Central as part of 
      Bamboo&#8217;s Project Management Suite and with the premium support are 
      entitled to a free upgrade to the new release. For more information,

			Fed Devises Dividend Increase Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the doubling of dividend and share buyback announcement by Comerica 
      Inc. (NYSE: CMA), 
      the Federal Reserve has devised guidelines that it would follow to grant 
      banks, that undergone stress test in 2009, the permission to increase 
      dividends and buy back shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fed plans to start reviewing the payout requests from the U.S. banks 
      in the first quarter of 2011. It has laid down guidelines on which it 
      will base its decision of approval. A Tier 1 common equity ratio of 5% 
      needs to be maintained after any such payouts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, the companies must repay or replace any sort of government 
      bailouts, either through preferred or common stock, before opting for 
      such payouts. Moreover, they need to prove that their capital levels are 
      sufficient to absorb losses from any adverse economic scenarios 
      including a recession. They are also required to lay out how they would 
      satisfy the Basel III capital norms before going for any dividend 
      increase or buybacks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In fact, all the 19 banks that were subject to the stress test last year 
      must submit their capitals plans by January 7, 2011. Even if they don&#8217;t 
      opt for either dividend increase or share buyback, they need to submit 
      their capital plans to the Fed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We expect a number of large banks to request and get approval for 
      dividend increases in the first half of 2011. These banks include JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM), 
      Wells Fargo  Co. (NYSE: WFC) 
      and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. ( NYSE: PNC). 
      However, we believe it would be quite difficult for Citigroup Inc. 
      (NYSE: C) as the 
      company has yet to rid itself of the bailout loans and possess 
      sufficient capital levels for such payouts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With concerns over capital in the face of rising problematic loans, the 
      Fed officials had asked for a reduction or elimination of dividends by 
      banks following the decline in earnings and a deteriorating economic 
      outlook. The new guidelines set down by the Fed are a positive 
      indication about the economy&#8217;s health and the banks&#8217; condition, and 
      inspire our confidence in the banking system.

			House Party Receives Acclaimed Industry Award for Using Brand 
      Enthusiasts to Host Microsoft Windows 7 Global Launch 
      Parties
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      House Party, a leading consumer activation and experiential marketing 
      company, was named the winner of the Energizing category within the B2C 
      International Division of the 2010 Forrester Groundswell Awards, for its 
      Microsoft Windows 7 Global Launch Party event. The awards were announced 
      at the Forrester EMEA Marketing  Strategy Forum in placeCityLondon 
      today. In late 2009, House Party helped Microsoft debut its 
      highly-anticipated Windows 7 operating system globally through the 
      company&#8217;s signature in-home activation programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Energizing category recognizes social technologies that get a 
      company&#8217;s best customers to evangelize its products. Through the 
      Microsoft Windows 7 Launch Party event, more than 40,000 Launch Parties 
      took place with Microsoft brand advocates and employees as the party 
      hosts in 12 countries and seven languages. Parties were attended by the 
      hosts&#8217; friends and family, and their experiences were shared by millions 
      more via the event&#8217;s custom branded website, as well as on Facebook, 
      Twitter and other social networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The event generated over 78 million brand impressions and over two 
      million hours of consumer engagement. In addition, independent research 
      found the consumers who were reached by the parties, even six months 
      after the parties, were over twice as knowledgeable about Windows 7, 
      over twice as likely to purchase it, and over six times as likely to 
      recommend it, than those not reached.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;House Party is honored to be recognized by Forrester Research for the 
      Microsoft Windows 7 Launch Party event &#8211; it is our largest event to date 
      and our first international event,&#8221; said Kitty Kolding, CEO of House 
      Party. &#8220;We remain thrilled that Microsoft incorporated our capabilities 
      to help unveil such a pivotal product. The results we have seen, 
      spanning six months after the program was concluded, are extremely 
      powerful and demonstrate the strength of deploying the House Party 
      platform for consumer brands.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Forrester Groundswell Awards recognize excellence in achieving 
      business and organizational goals with social technology applications. 
      The awards program was developed to support and recognize the principles 
      outlined in the Forrester Research books Groundswell: 
      Winning In A World Transformed By Social Technologies (Harvard 
      Business Press, 2008) and Empowered:
			Unleash Your Employees, 
      Energize Your Customers, and Transform Your Business (Harvard 
      Business Press, 2010). [The fourth annual Forrester Groundswell Awards 
      were announced at the Forrester Consumer Forum in Chicago.] This year, 
      there were more than 130 entries to the Forrester Groundswell Awards in 
      four divisions including Business-to-Business (B2B), 
      Business-to-Consumer (B2C), Management and International.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Independent research also found that the Microsoft Windows 7 Launch 
      Party event caused the other media within the Windows 7 launch campaign 
      to perform better, producing a &#8220;media multiplier&#8221; effect that was 
      measurable, powerful and long lasting: six months after the parties, 
      participants were still 40% more likely to notice Windows 7 television 
      ads, 40% more likely to recognize the ads&#8217; messages, and 83% more 
      favorable toward the ads, when compared to a control group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the second Forrester Groundswell Award for House Party. The 
      company received a 2008 Forrester Groundswell Award in the Energizing 
      category for their work with The Hershey Company. House Party conducted 
      a 10,000 party event across the United States for the launch of 
      Hershey&#8217;s Bliss Chocolate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      House Party specializes in engaging a select group of consumer advocates 
      to host in-home parties where a brand or product is at the center. The 
      Windows 7 launch parties took place in the United States, Canada, United 
      Kingdom, Australia, India, Germany, France, Spain, Mexico, Italy, Hong 
      Kong and Japan. Hosts received an exclusive copy of Windows 7 Ultimate 
      before it was available at retail, and all partygoers experienced and 
      learned about Windows 7&#8217;s new offerings in a fun, party atmosphere. 
      Hosts used House Party&#8217;s proprietary online tools and resources to plan 
      their parties, document their activities and amplify their experience 
      online and via social media, exponentially increasing the reach of their 
      in-home parties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled by the diversity and quality of the entries in this 
      year&#8217;s International Forrester Groundswell Awards,&#8221; said Nate 
      Elliott, principal analyst at Forrester. &#8220;With consumers worldwide 
      embracing social technologies, the Groundswell is now global. The 
      finalists and winners we&#8217;ve recognized &#8212; including local efforts on four 
      continents and a number of truly global programs &#8212; are among the leaders 
      in using social tools to reach and serve their customers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A development setback for U.S. drug majors Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb has left them down, but by no means out of the race with Germany's Bayer to bring lucrative new anti-clotting pills to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A late-stage study of Pfizer and BMS's blood thinner apixaban in patients suffering from acute coronary syndrome (ACS) was stopped on Thursday after independent supervisors found a worrying increase in bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With cheap copies of Bayer's best-selling drugs clouding prospects for its sales and margins, Germany's largest drugmaker has high hopes riding on its Xarelto anti-clotting pill, co-developed with Johnson  Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayer shares were up 2.1 percent on Friday afternoon in response to Pfizer and BMS's woes and to its plans to slash 800 million euros in costs a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ACS, the focus of the halted apixaban trail, is only the second-largest use for the new class of blood thinners. Much more is at stake when it comes to preventing strokes due to a form of irregular heartbeat that is common among the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Measured by treatment days, stroke prevention will account for almost 60 percent of the overall market, which could be worth $12-$15 billion, Bayer has said. ACS would likely account for about 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the main indication of stroke prevention, apixaban has already shown good results in a Phase II study. The bleeding concerns that have now emerged have increased the project's overall risks, but from Bayer's point of view, I would not write apixaban off as a competitor," said Bankhaus Metzler analyst Sebastian Frericks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That view was echoed by Tim Anderson at Bernstein Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some investors may begin to fear that this new news reveals some sort of weakness in apixaban's overall profile. We do not share this view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While excessive bleeding puts the prospects of any anticoagulant in serious doubt, analysts raised a number of points in favor of apixaban's future in the mass market of stroke prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most patients that haemorrhaged in the apixaban study were also on Sanofi-Aventis's Plavix blood thinner, suggesting that the combination of the two, and not apixaban alone, was to blame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stroke prevention, apixaban would be used as a single therapy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, ACS is linked to clotting of arteries, while atrial fibrillation, the stroke-triggering heart arrhythmia that calls for anti-clogging drugs, causes venous clogging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This makes it difficult to draw conclusions about bleeding risks in the larger indication, according to Bernstein's Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apixaban, to be marketed under the Eliquis brand, is six to 12 months behind Xarelto's market launch in the stroke prevention setting, which is expected in the final quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bayer, in turn, is trailing unlisted German rival Boehringer Ingelheim, which won U.S. regulatory approval for its Pradaxa pill for stroke prevention in atrial-fibrillation patients last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed study results published this week suggested Xarelto would hold its own against market pioneer Pradaxa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, at least eight drug majors are vying to bring new blood thinners to market to replace the warfarin pill, a 65-year-old heart drug originally developed as rat poison, which is difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BC, Nov 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Insiderslab.com today issued reports that highlighted the respectable
insider trade for National Oilwell Varco (NOV), Abbott Laboratories
(ABT), Procter &amp; Gamble (PG), Amazon (AMZN), &amp; Atmel (ATML).

    Besides reporting direct ownerships and transactions, corporate insiders
have to file their indirect holdings made by their relatives as well. SEC
even further indicates that insiders also own indirect ownership of the
partnership he participated in. However, insiderslab.com suggests
investors pay more attention to those direct holding trades, since
insiders are more likely to practice more discretion when they registered
the shares under their own names.

&lt;p&gt;  NEWARK, CA, Nov 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SMART Modular Technologies (WWH), Inc. ("SMART" or the "Company")
(NASDAQ: SMOD), a leading independent manufacturer of solid state storage
products and memory modules, today announced that its XceedIOPS SAS 2.5"
solid state drive (SSD) will be used in the planned IBM POWER7
high-performance supercomputer. 

    The IBM supercomputer will use these drives to provide substantially
higher levels of performance (compared to HDDs), sufficient to meet the
critical data management requirements of this system. 

    Supercomputing requires storage solutions that can deliver long lifetimes
with high reliability and data integrity under the most demanding
operating environments. Due to its use of the latest 34nm
Enterprise-grade Multi-Level-Cell (E-MLC) NAND flash technology, SMART's
XceedIOPS SAS SSD provides superior endurance and a five-year minimum
operational life even in workload-intensive environments. 

    SMART's XceedIOPS SAS SSD also offers extensive error-correction and
detection features, multi-level data-path and code protection, data-loss
recovery, and active thermal management designed to improve reliability
and data integrity. 

    "Products like the IBM POWER7 supercomputer are defining leading-edge
computing and serve as an excellent example of how the combination of
performance, price, reliability, and endurance in the XceedIOPS SAS SSD
enables the development of an entirely new class of application
platforms," stated John Scaramuzzo, SMART's Senior Vice President and
General Manager, Storage Business Unit. "The selection criteria for SSDs
has moved beyond HDD replacement, as innovative designers such as those
at IBM use the qualities of enterprise-grade SSDs to significantly
enhance their products' performance, data integrity, and reliability."

    The IBM POWER7 supercomputer, showcasing SMART's XceedIOPS SAS SSDs,
debuted at the SC10 show in New Orleans, LA, earlier this week. For
additional information regarding SMART's SSD products, visit

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - In a clinical setback, Pfizer Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said a late stage study of their closely-watched blood thinner apixaban was halted due to safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plug was pulled on a 10,800-patient study after an independent data monitoring committee found a "clinically important increase in bleeding" that was not offset by the benefits of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies have informed the trial's researchers, ethics review boards and regulatory health authorities of the decision to stop the study of patients with acute coronary syndrome at risk of stroke or other ischemic events, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apixaban belongs to a new class of oral anti-coagulant drugs called factor Xa inhibitors that aim to replace the problematic warfarin -- a widely used 65-year-old medicine that must be closely monitored because of the small difference between a therapeutic and toxic dose. Warfarin, while highly effective, also interacts badly with some foods and other medicines and carries a high risk of dangerous bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several other companies are developing drugs similar to apixaban that are expected to compete in an estimated $10 billion a year market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The class of blood clot preventers have demonstrated impressive efficacy, but the risk of dangerous bleeding is always a concern with these types of drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The halted trial is one of nine Phase III clinical studies currently evaluating apixaban. The data monitoring committee also recommended that a separate Phase II study of acute coronary syndrome patients in Japan also be discontinued, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain committed to the development of apixaban in other patient populations," Brian Daniels, senior vice president for Global Development and Medical Affairs at Bristol-Myers Squibb, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MANILA Nov 19 (Reuters) - The Philippines' APC Group Inc
(APC.PS) said on Friday its Aragorn Power and Energy Corp unit
has signed two agreements with a unit of Chevron (CVX.N) for a
$300 million geothermal power project in the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Kalinga Ltd, a wholly owned unit of the world's
largest producer of geothermal energy, and Aragorn will develop
and operate steam fields that can generate around 100 megawatts
in new capacity for the power grid on Luzon, the country's main
island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aragorn holds a government permit for geothermal
exploration covering 26,000 hectares in Kalinga province in the
northern Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aragorn also signed a farm-out agreement that gives it the
option to take an equity position of up to 40 percent in the
geothermal project with Chevron, APC told the stock exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; APC said it would be the first major foreign investment
into the country's renewable energy industry since 2008, when
the Renewable Energy Act took effect.

&lt;p&gt;Nov 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has 
appointed 321 employees as managing directors in the latest 
round of annual promotions, up from 272 last year, Bloomberg 
reported, citing an internal memo.    	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The latest announcement comes a day after the bank named 
110 employees as partners, the agency said. Partners are 
ranked above managing directors.     	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Managing directors usually receive a higher pay than more 
junior employees but they are not entitled for a share in the 
special bonus pool reserved for partners, according to the 
agency.    	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spokesman Lucas van Praag told Bloomberg that 
women make up 19 percent of all managing directors, including 
the newly promoted.    	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Van Praag also told the agency that over 10 percent of 
this year's new partners are women, while declining to give a 
specific number.    	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman could not immediately be reached for comment by 
Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours.

      oil

HOUSTON, Nov. 21, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy XXI (Nasdaq:EXXI) (LSE:EXXI)
today announced it has executed a purchase and sale agreement to acquire certain
shallow-water Gulf of Mexico shelf oil and natural gas interests from affiliates
of ExxonMobil for $1.01 billion.

The assets are currently producing approximately 20,000 net BOE per day (BOE/d),
about 53 percent of which is oil. Offshore leases included in the purchase total
130,853 net acres.

Reserve estimates for the acquired properties were prepared on Nov. 16, 2010, by
Netherland, Sewell &amp; Associates, Inc., independent oil and gas consultants
employed by Energy XXI. The properties are estimated to contain net proved and
probable reserves of 66 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), 61 percent of
which is oil. Proved reserves are estimated at 30.1 million barrels of oil and
116.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas, or a total of 49.5 million BOE, 68
percent of which are proved developed.

The properties include nine fields on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, generally
located between Energy XXI's existing core South Timbalier and Main Pass
operations in water depths of 470 feet or less. The six largest fields account
for 89 percent of the net production.

"The ExxonMobil properties are an extraordinary fit with our existing,
oil-focused core assets, which generate some of the highest margins in the
industry," Energy XXI Chairman and CEO John Schiller said. "With this
acquisition, we are gaining access to production, infrastructure and extensive
acreage complemented by seismic data and field studies. As operator of 94
percent of the assets being acquired, we would have a portfolio of drilling and
recompletion opportunities that we can pursue while analyzing the potential for
higher-impact exploration prospects."

Pro forma for the acquisition, Energy XXI would become the third-largest oil
producer on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, with interests in seven of the top 11 oil
fields on the shelf. Estimated proved plus probable reserves would increase 72
percent to 158.1 million BOE from 92.1 million BOE at the company's June 20,
2010 fiscal year end. Production would increase to approximately 46,000 BOE per
day, up more than 77 percent from the 25,900 BOE per day average in the most
recent fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, 2010, with oil representing 63 percent.

"In addition to growing our reserves, production volumes and drilling portfolio,
we expect this consolidation of properties within our existing core area to
achieve meaningful cost savings," Executive Vice President of Exploration and
Production Ben Marchive said. "Cash flow from these properties, combined with
the excess cash already being generated by our existing asset base, should put
us in a position to rapidly retire debt while funding accelerated development of
the overall portfolio."

In conjunction with the signing of the agreement, Energy XXI has added to its
crude oil hedge position to provide downside price protection. Based on 46,000
BOE per day of pro forma production, 63 percent of which is oil, the company
currently has hedged 70 percent, 61 percent and 12 percent of the crude oil
production for calendar years 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively.

In addition to utilizing cash on hand to finance the purchase, Energy XXI has
obtained committed financing to increase its corporate revolver from $350
million currently to $700 million in conjunction with the acquisition, as well
as a $450 million unsecured bridge loan that the company would anticipate
retiring through the future issuance of high-yield notes. Energy XXI has placed
a 10 percent cash deposit into an interest-bearing account under the terms of
the agreement.

The purchase is subject to preferential rights-to-purchase held by other working
interest owners in the properties, as well as customary closing conditions and
adjustments. The effective date is Dec. 1, 2010, with closing expected by Dec.
20, 2010.

Conference Call Scheduled for Tomorrow

Energy XXI has scheduled a conference call for tomorrow, Monday, Nov. 22, 2010,
at 8 a.m. CST (2 p.m. London time) to discuss the acquisition. To actively

Glossary

Reserves:

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves -- Those quantities of crude oil and gas, which, by
analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable
certainty to be economically producible -- from a given date forward, from known
reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and
government regulations -- prior to the time at which contracts providing the
right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably
certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used
for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced
or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project
within a reasonable time. This definition has been abbreviated from the
definition of "Proved oil and gas reserves" contained in Rule 4-10(a)(22) of SEC
Regulation S-X.

Proved Developed Reserves -- Reserves are categorized as proved developed if
they are expected to be recovered from existing wells.

Probable Reserves -- Those additional reserves that are less certain to be
recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as
likely as not to be recovered. This definition has been abbreviated from the
applicable definition contained in Rule 4-10(a)(18) of SEC Regulation S-X.

Possible Reserves -- Those additional reserves that are less certain to be
recovered than probable reserves. This definition has been abbreviated from the
applicable definition contained in Rule 4-10(a)(17) of Regulation S-X.

Contingent Resources -- Those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given
date, to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations, but the applied
projects are not yet considered mature enough for commercial development due to
one or more contingencies. Contingent resources may include, for example,
projects where commercial recovery is dependent on technology under development,
or where evaluation of the accumulation is insufficient to clearly assess
commerciality.

Prospective Resources -- Those quantities of petroleum estimated, as of a given
date, to be potentially recoverable from undiscovered accumulations by
application of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an
associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.

Other terms:

Barrel -- unit of measure for oil and petroleum products, equivalent to 42 U.S.
gallons.

BOE -- barrels of oil equivalent, used to equate natural gas volumes to liquid
barrels at a general conversion rate of 6,000 cubic feet of gas per barrel.

BOE/d -- barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Field -- an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all
grouped on, or related to, the same individual geological structural feature or
stratigraphic condition. The field name refers to the surface area, although it
may refer to both the surface and the underground productive formations.

MMBOE -- million barrels of oil equivalent.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Nov 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
confirmed it was considering the sale of its 100 petrol stations
in Scotland but declined comment on a report it plans to sell
its North Sea oil fields, worth some $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Its comments came after the Sunday Times said the North Sea

said the group was "testing a new business model" which would
involve the group selling Esso-owned retail sites to wholesalers
but keeping the Esso brand and continuing to supply fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Conversion to the branded wholesaler model would include
the sale of Esso-owned retail sites to the wholesaler, along
with an agreement for the wholesaler to supply the sites with

 (Adds analyst comment, details, byline. Updates share price.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joe Rauch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHARLOTTE, N.C., Nov 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc's (GS.N) shares dropped 3.4 percent on Monday amid investor
fears the bank may be embroiled in a far-reaching insider
trading probe by the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Justice Department is examining whether employees of

hedge funds in connection with the insider trading
investigation, the Journal reported. [ID:nN22281945]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drop in Goldman's share price tempered a 22 percent
surge since Aug. 31, to $166.67 at last Friday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said news of the insider trading probe provided an

people can say that maybe it is time to get on the sidelines
until this sorts out," said Michael Nix, principal at Greenwood
Capital Associates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares plunged 12.5 percent on April 16 after the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of
creating and selling collateralized debt obligations -- backed
by subprime mortgages -- without telling investors that hedge
fund Paulson  Co had helped choose and bet against the debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That case was settled in July for $550 million.

			The Coca-Cola Company Announces Total 
      Consideration for its Any and All Offer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company ("TCCC" or the "Company") today announced the 
      reference yield and the total consideration for each series of notes 
      subject to its previously announced Any and All Offer. In the Any and 
      All Offer, the Company is offering to purchase any and all of specified 
      series of outstanding debt securities issued by the Company and its 
      wholly-owned subsidiary, Coca-Cola Refreshments USA, Inc. ("CCR").
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On November 16, 2010, the expiration date of the Any and All Offer was 
      extended until 5:00 p.m., EST, today by the Company. As a result, the 
      pricing terms announced in this press release replace, in full, those 
      previously announced by the Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The total consideration for each series of notes is based on the 
      applicable reference yield plus a fixed spread as set forth in the table 
      below. All payments for notes purchased in the Any and All Offer will 
      also include accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount 
      tendered up to, but not including, the Any and All Offer settlement 
      date, which is currently expected to be Tuesday, November 23, 2010.

&lt;p&gt;Google announced today it is giving Microsoft Office users a way to bring their documents into Google Docs without having to leave the Office application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the service appears within the desktop Office application, this could be the final nail in the coffin for desktop document editing. Microsoft has already taken a strong position in the cloud with the impending launch of Office 365. The company brought all of its&#160;Office applications online in response to Google&#8217;s increasingly popular web document applications.&#160;Windows Live users can currently use the cloud-operated versions of its Office utilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could easily serve as a way to ween users off the desktop-based Office software. Office is one of Microsoft&#8217;s biggest cash crops. So the company&#8217;s strong bet on Office in the cloud is a pretty clear indicator of where things are going. Microsoft is already planning to offer a subscription-based Office service in the form of Office 365. It also might even offer a&#160;subscription-based operating system service in the form of Windows 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google did beat Microsoft to the cloud with the launch of Google Docs. And Google Docs already allows Google users to upload their Microsoft Word and Excel documents into the cloud and turn them into Google-powered office documents. Now Microsoft Office users don&#8217;t even have to manually upload their documents onto Google Docs &#8212; they can do it straight through the Office applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps, the bundle of business tools that includes Docs, has signed up 3 million companies with more than 30 million users total. Google Docs gives small- to mid-sized businesses with employees strewn across the country a powerful free option for collaboration. The alternative Microsoft offered before release of its Office 365 suite was paying for its SharePoint program, a file-sharing and collaboration tool that integrates with its Office suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another win for companies with employees strewn across the country. The business collaboration space is in dire need of consolidation. Forcing users to rely on SharePoint and other extra file-sharing applications to collaborate is only hurting productivity and preventing the virtual office from being as efficient as it can be. Google doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to be the flagship for collaboration, but it certainly isn&#8217;t afraid of trying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a little surprising to see Google jump in bed with Microsoft now, seeing as the Office creator has been flirting with Facebook at Google&#8217;s expense for some time. Facebook, the largest social network provider in the world, recently jumped on board with Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine instead of Google. Facebook also recently announced connectivity with Microsoft&#8217;s cloud-based office applications through its Facebook messages service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Google did&#160;pick up DocVerse for $25 million earlier this year. DocVerse specialized in helping people collaborate on Microsoft Office documents. So this connectivity was certainly a long time coming. The service is currently available to early testers across the world. Google hasn&#8217;t announced when the service will go live to everyone.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: cloud, cloud office, Google Docs, Microsoft Office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies: Facebook, Google, Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Energy minister sees compensation ruling in 2011 or 2012&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ramirez forecasts successful conclusion for Venezuela&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARACAS Nov 22 (Reuters) - Venezuela foresees a successful
end in 2011 or 2012 to battles over "rude" compensation claims
by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N), Energy
Minister Rafael Ramirez said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll probably have news on that in 2011-2012," he told
reporters of the U.S. majors' demands for payment for assets
nationalized by the South American nation three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our teams are defending the whole Republic from the rude
aspirations of the transnationals. We are ready to finish this
battle, I think we are going to be successful."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Exxon and ConocoPhillips rejected terms and went to
the World Bank's arbitration panel when Venezuela pushed
foreign firms into minority partnerships with the state at
multibillion dollar projects in the Orinoco Belt crude region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramirez has said in the past ConocoPhillips wanted $20
billion from President Hugo Chavez's socialist government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; State oil company PDVSA says Exxon is claiming $7 billion.
[ID:nN20245797]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think Exxon's aspirations are way too high, we think it
is a negotiating tactic from the lawyers who represent them,"
added Ramirez, who is also the president of PDVSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A large compensation bill would be painful for
cash-strapped PDVSA, which has suffered lower profits in the
last two years and owes billions of dollars to providers.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Gap Meets Estimate, Affirms Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Gap Inc.&#8217;s (NYSE: GPS) 
      third-quarter 2010 earnings of 48 cents per share rose 9.0% from last 
      year's 44 cents and met the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the quarter, net sales grew 1.8% to $3.65 billion from $3.59 
      billion in the year-ago quarter. Same-store sales remained flat for the 
      quarter, reflecting growth in Banana Republic North America (+1%), Gap 
      North America (+1%) and the International division (+3%), offset by a 2% 
      decline in comparable store sales in Old Navy North America. The 
      company&#8217;s franchise sales for both Gap and Banana Republic jumped 45% 
      for the quarter. Total revenue also beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
      $3.62 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Quarterly gross profit fell 1.2% year over year to $1.51 billion, and 
      gross margin contracted 130 basis points (bps) to 41.2%. Operating 
      expenses as a percentage of sales declined 110 bps year over year to 
      27.4% on the back of strict cost containment measures. Accordingly, 
      Gap's operating income rose marginally by 1.0% year over year to $504 
      million, while operating margin fell 10 bps to 13.8%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gap ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1.40 billion, 
      compared with $2.17 billion in the year-ago period. Year to date, the 
      company deployed $1.35 billion of cash toward share buybacks and $413 
      million for capital expenditure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Another Pipeline Setback for Pfizer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) 
      and partner Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) 
      recently suffered a setback with the development of their anti-clotting 
      candidate, apixaban. The companies said that they have discontinued the 
      development of the candidate in patients with acute coronary syndrome 
      due to an increased risk of bleeding associated with the use of the drug.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Decision Based on Recommendation of an Independent Data Monitoring 
      Committee
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study, APPRAISE-2 (Apixaban for Prevention of Acute 
      Ischemic Events &#8211; 2), was being conducted across 40 
      countries with approximately 10,800 patients. Patients in the study were 
      randomized to receive either apixaban 5mg or placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer and Bristol-Myers decided to halt enrollment and discontinue 
      treatment with apixaban based on the recommendation of an independent 
      data monitoring committee. The committee reported that the side-effect 
      risk associated with the use of apixaban outweighed the benefits. A 
      significant increase in bleeding in the apixaban arm was observed in the 
      study, without there being a significant reduction in ischemic events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A phase II study, APPRAISE Japan, with apixaban for the acute coronary 
      syndrome patient population is also being conducted in Japan. The data 
      monitoring committee for this study has recommended that the study 
      should be discontinued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although apixaban will no longer be studied for the acute coronary 
      syndrome indication, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers will continue with the 
      remaining studies that are being conducted with the candidate. Apixaban 
      is currently in eight other studies that are being conducted in other 
      patient populations. Moreover, the companies have started submitting a 
      rolling new drug application (NDA) for apixaban with the US Food and 
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the prevention of stroke in patients with 
      atrial fibrillation who are not suitable for treatment with warfarin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The companies are also seeking approval for the use of apixaban for the 
      prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the EU.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Competitive Scenario
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Apixaban, which is an oral factor Xa inhibitor, belongs to a new class 
      of agents being developed for the prevention and treatment of blood 
      clots. The atrial fibrillation market is huge and represents significant 
      commercial opportunity. It is estimated that more than 2 million 
      Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation. The prevalence is expected to 
      increase significantly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In October 2010, Boehringer Ingelheim&#8217;s Pradaxa was the first new oral 
      anticoagulant to gain FDA approval in more than 50 years. Currently, 
      Pfizer/Bristol-Myers and Johnson and Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) 
      / Bayer (OTC: BAYRY) 
      are jostling for second position in the US anticoagulant market. Johnson 
      and Johnson/Bayer recently reported positive results on their blood 
      thinner, Xarelto (rivaroxaban), which is currently available in Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The discontinuation of the apixaban study is the latest pipeline setback 
      for Pfizer. Over the course of the year, Pfizer announced setbacks with 
      the development of candidates like tanezumab, Sutent and Dimebon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Pfizer, which is supported 
      by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating). While Wyeth brings with 
      it an attractive biologics platform and some complementary products and 
      businesses, we do not believe they are enough to sustain long-term 
      top-line growth. We see the merger as mostly an opportunity for Pfizer 
      to cut additional costs. Longer-term growth at Pfizer will be dependent 
      on the success of drug development. The Lipitor patent expiration in 
      2011 remains a big concern.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Infoblox, a market leading developer of advanced network

      the Microsoft 
      System Center Alliance and delivered two new management packs for

      network infrastructures. Softchoice&#8217;s Microsoft customers are looking 
      for solutions like these to help streamline and automate the workloads 
      and processes across their infrastructures.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Nov 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has upgradedBharti Airtel (BRTI.BO) to buy from neutral and raised its targetprice on the stock of India's top mobile phone operator to 430rupees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe that Bharti is the best positioned operator tobenefit from the improving regulatory environment and likelybetter competitive environment in India," analysts at the U.S.investment bank wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe the regulatory environment in thenext 12-18 months will be more favorable to incumbents than newentrants," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bharti shares had closed at 329.15 rupees on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman also raised its target price for India'ssixth-biggest mobile phone operator, Idea Cellular (IDEA.BO), to84 rupees, keeping its buy rating on the stock. The share closedat 71 rupees on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Devidutta Tripathy; Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((devidutta.tripathy@thomsonreuters.com; +91 98187 86430;Reuters Messaging:devidutta.tripathy.thomsonreuters.com@reuters.net))&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((If you have a query or comment on this story, send an email tonews.feedback.asia@thomsonreuters.com))Keywords: BHARTI/UPRADE &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2010.

      los titulares de tarjeta Visa de cualquier pa&#237;s de Latinoam&#233;rica o del 
      Caribe tambi&#233;n se pueden registrar gratuitamente y comprar en los

    &lt;/p&gt;

      Gerry Sweeney, jefe internacional de comercio electr&#243;nico y 
      autenticaci&#243;n de Visa Inc., expres&#243;: &#8220;Uno de los inhibidores del 
      crecimiento del comercio electr&#243;nico transfronterizo es la entrega de 
      los productos. En muchos pa&#237;ses, la compra de art&#237;culos en l&#237;nea a 
      comerciantes establecidos en los EE. UU. ha demostrado ser costosa y 
      complicada desde el punto de vista log&#237;stico. Nos asociamos con 
      proveedores de servicios log&#237;sticos como Borderlinx y SkyBOX para 
      eliminar los obst&#225;culos de las transacciones transfronterizas de 
      comercio electr&#243;nico al permitir que los titulares de tarjeta Visa 
      puedan comprar por Internet en miles de tiendas establecidas en los 
      EE.UU., que normalmente no enviar&#237;an sus productos al extranjero&#8221;.

      Sweeney agreg&#243;: &#8220;Visa reconoce que las compras por Internet est&#225;n en 
      constante evoluci&#243;n por la conducta cambiante de los consumidores y la 
      aparici&#243;n, disponibilidad y adopci&#243;n de nuevas tecnolog&#237;as. Seguiremos 
      trabajando para encontrar maneras innovadoras de crear nuevos productos 
      y servicios que aumenten el valor de la moneda digital&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La alianza de Visa con Borderlinx y SkyBOX y la facilitaci&#243;n del env&#237;o

      electr&#243;nico internacional de Visa para entregar una experiencia de

      Fitch Ratings assigns ratings of 'AAA/F1+' to the J.P. Morgan Securities

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term ratings assigned to the PUTTERs and the ratings assigned 
      to the DRIVERs are based on the rating Fitch has assigned to the Chicago 
      Park District, Illinois, general obligation unlimited tax bonds (harbor 
      facilities revenues alternate revenue source), series 2010C (rated 'AAA' 
      with a Stable Outlook), deposited in the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1+' rating assigned to the PUTTERs is based on the 
      liquidity facility for each series provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. 
      The 'F1+' rating will expire on Nov. 22, 2011, the expiration date of 
      each series liquidity facility, unless such date is extended or earlier

      Gerry Sweeney, globaler Leiter f&#252;r E-Commerce und Authentifizierung bei 
      Visa Inc., sagte: &#8222;Ein Hindernis f&#252;r das Wachstum des 
      grenz&#252;bergreifenden E-Commerce ist die Warenanlieferung. In vielen 
      L&#228;ndern hat sich der Einkauf bei Online-H&#228;ndlern aus den USA als teuer 
      und logistisch kompliziert erwiesen. Wir verb&#252;nden uns mit Anbietern von 
      Logistikdienstleistungen wie Borderlinx und SkyBOX, um diese Hindernisse 
      bei grenz&#252;bergreifenden E-Commerce-Transaktionen aus dem Weg zu r&#228;umen 
      und internationalen Visa-Karteninhabern den Online-Einkauf bei Tausenden 
      von US-amerikanischen H&#228;ndlern und Gesch&#228;ften zu erm&#246;glichen, die 
      normalerweise keine Waren ins Ausland liefern.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sweeney weiter: &#8222;Visa hat erkannt, dass sich Online-Eink&#228;ufe aufgrund 
      wechselnder Verhaltensweisen seitens der Verbraucher und der Einf&#252;hrung, 
      Verf&#252;gbarkeit und &#220;bernahme neuer Technologien stetig weiterentwickeln. 
      Wir werden weiterhin daran arbeiten, innovative M&#246;glichkeiten zum Aufbau 
      neuer Produkte und Dienstleistungen zu finden, die den Wert der 
      digitalen W&#228;hrung steigern.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Die Partnerschaft zwischen Visa und Borderlinx sowie SkyBOX und die

			Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 Reports Third Quarter 2010 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton International Group Inc. and Walton Ontario Land L. P. 1 (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) 
      announced today the Partnership&#8217;s results for the third quarter ended 
      September 30, 20101.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BUSINESS OVERVIEW
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership was established on October 2, 2009 for the purpose of 
      maximizing returns to its limited partners through the acquisition, 
      management, concept planning and eventual sale of two properties 
      consisting of an aggregate of 455 acres of undeveloped land in southern 
      Ontario (the &#8220;Properties&#8221;). The land located near the Toronto 
      area in Alliston, Ontario consists of two parcels of land comprised of 
      155 acres. The land located in the southwest quadrant of the City of 
      Ottawa (the &#8220;Ottawa Property&#8221;) consists of a single parcel of 300 
      acres. The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc. (&#8220;WIGI&#8221;).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is the current intention of the Partnership to hold its interest in 
      the Properties as an investment and to eventually dispose of its 
      interest prior to physical development of the Properties. If the 
      partners determine that the Partnership should participate in the 
      development of the Properties (other than pre-development concept 
      planning), the activities of the Partnership may also include the 
      partial or full development of the Properties prior to the sale of the 
      Properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Having completed the initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) in the first 
      quarter of 2010, and both the private placement offering (&#8220;Private 
      Placement&#8221;) and the land acquisition in the second quarter of 2010, 
      the Partnership has begun to execute the concept planning phase of the 
      overall investment strategy during the third quarter. As outlined in the 
      offering documents, during the concept planning phase now underway, 
      engineering, planning and legal professionals prepare the land for 
      development by obtaining municipal approvals. In order to obtain such 
      approvals, the Partnership will work with regional and municipal 
      planning authorities to conceptually plan the Properties for build-out 
      in order to achieve the highest and best development potential. These 
      approvals generally will attract an expanded audience of potential 
      buyers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As described in the Partnership&#8217;s original offering documents, net 
      income, if any, earned from the Properties prior to their eventual sale 
      was not and is not anticipated to be significant. To address this, the 
      Partnership initially provided for reserves to self-fund the costs 
      relating to the Properties. Purchasers of Partnership units will not 
      receive a significant amount of income or cash, if any, distributed on 
      their investment in the units until such time as any of the Properties 
      are sold.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Expenses for the period are in line with those anticipated in the 
      Partnership&#8217;s original plans. Total costs incurred and capitalized by 
      the Partnership relating to concept planning for the three months ended 
      September 30, 2010 were $30,627, of which $27,843 consists of 
      third-party consulting costs and $2,784 consists of fees to Walton 
      Development and Management Inc. This $30,267 represents the first 
      concept planning costs incurred out of the total reserves of $787,253 
      set aside for concept planning over the life of the project. Concept 
      planning costs are capitalized as land improvement, and form part of the 
      total land costs to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is proceeding as anticipated and as described in the 
      offering documents and in line with the Partnership&#8217;s plan to acquire 
      and hold interests in the Properties for appreciation in value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., part of 
      the Walton Group of Companies. Walton seeks to acquire and syndicate 
      undeveloped land that is strategically located in the path of major 
      North American urban growth corridors. These lands are syndicated to 
      investors, without the use of leverage, made development-ready through 
      concept planning, and then sold for a profit when it is commercially 
      opportune to do so. In business for over 30 years, the Walton Group 
      currently manages over $2.7 billion of real estate assets, including 
      over 55,000 acres of land, on behalf of itself and investors and clients 
      in North America, Europe and Asia. To date, Walton has syndicated over 
      300 projects across North America. Of these, 40 projects have been fully 
      or partially completed, providing returns to investors from the profit 
      made on the sale of the lands.

			Seattle non-profit also announces preliminary results from its 
      Talking Book program, to be presented at the ICTD 2010 conference in 
      London
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today Literacy Bridge announced that its founder, Cliff Schmidt, was 
      presented with the Microsoft Alumni Foundation Integral Fellows award by 
      Bill and Melinda Gates. The panel of judges selecting Mr. Schmidt 
      included Tom Brokaw, journalist and author; Bill Drayton, chair and CEO, 
      Ashoka; William H. Gates Sr., co-chair, Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation; 
      Pierre Omidyar, founding partner, Omidyar Network and founder and 
      chairman, eBay Inc.; Judith Rodin, president, Rockefeller Foundation; 
      and Thomas J. Tierney, chairman and co-founder, Bridgespan Group. 
      Criteria in selecting the winners included the ability to create 
      something extraordinary out of limited resources; selflessness; passion; 
      smarts; need; and scalability. The award includes an unrestricted 
      $25,000 grant and access to the talents and skills of Microsoft alumni 
      to help support Literacy Bridge&#8217;s ongoing efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is an honor to be recognized by my peers, the Microsoft Alumni,&#8221; 
      said Cliff Schmidt, founder of Literacy Bridge. &#8220;The results from our 
      Talking Book project are very encouraging, and receiving recognition 
      from Bill and Melinda Gates is incredibly rewarding. The Microsoft 
      Alumni Foundation award will help us expand Literacy Bridge&#8217;s Talking 
      Book project into new communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Literacy Bridge improves the health, education, and income of 
      impoverished rural families through an innovative audio computer that 
      provides easy access to on-demand, locally relevant, practical 
      information. Just as the rest of the world has the convenience of a 
      local library or the Web, the &#8220;Talking Book&#8221; delivers an audio library 
      of critical knowledge to those who need it most&#8212;people who cannot read 
      and live in extreme poverty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Literacy Bridge&#8217;s partnerships with local experts in health, agriculture 
      and education ensure that Talking Book messages are relevant and 
      actionable. For example, mothers learn how to recognize the symptoms of 
      TB or malaria; subsistence farmers learn about optimal seed spacing and 
      use of manure for crop production; children and illiterate adults 
      practice their reading by playing books at the speed they choose, and 
      test their vocabulary and reading comprehension with audio hyperlinks 
      and multiple-choice quizzes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Literacy Bridge has also been invited to present the results of its 
      Talking Book program evaluation study at the International Conference on 
      Information and Communication Technologies and Development (ICTD 2010) 
      in London, December 13-16, 2010. Highlights include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        91% of residents using Talking Books applied a new health or 
        agriculture practice based on Talking Book lessons.
      
			
        In a year when their peers saw a 5% drop in crop production, farmers 
        using Talking Books saw an average increase of 48%. After controlling 
        for a variety of other factors, use of a Talking Book correlated with 
        an increased production of 2.75 bags of crops per farm, valued at $89.
      
			
        These additional crops were worth $3000 all together, while the 
        program investment is only $1000&#8212; a 3x return on investment in one 
        year.

      Executive Summary
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brief Excerpt from Industry Overview Chapter:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US computer manufacturing industry includes about 1,200 companies 
      with combined annual revenue of about $75 billion. Major companies 
      include Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM. The industry is highly 
      concentrated: the top 50 companies generate about 90 percent of revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand is tied to consumer and business income. The profitability of 
      individual computer companies depends on purchasing and production 
      efficiencies, and on technological expertise. Large companies have 
      economies of scale in purchasing and production. Small companies can 
      compete successfully by specializing in certain products or by 
      developing superior technology. The industry is capital-intensive: 
      annual revenue per employee is about $400,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major products include PCs, printers, monitors, mainframes, servers, and 
      disk drives. Personal computers, mainframes, and servers account for 65 
      percent of industry revenue. Input/output devices (including monitors, 
      printers, keyboards, and mice) make up 20 percent of revenue; storage 
      devices, about 10 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The manufacturing process for PCs consists of integrating circuit 
      boards, disk drives, and input/output devices into a final product. 
      Companies typically assemble PCs from components bought from other 
      manufacturers. Key components like "motherboards" are specially made for 
      a particular product, while disk drives and other components may be 
      off-the-shelf parts. Despite automation gains, some assembly work is 
      still labor-intensive. Manufacturers of specialized devices like 
      printers, monitors, and disk drives may also buy some components from 
      outside vendors. The manufacture of some products requires highly 
      sophisticated machinery.

&lt;p&gt;  LAKE BUENA VISTA, FL, Nov 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Holiday travelers may not know this but Santa Claus goes on a Florida
vacation prior to his big night. This holiday season, guests can visit
with Santa as he relaxes at the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin Hotel.
For the first time, he is bringing along Mrs. Claus to Santa's favorite
Orlando hotel for some fun in the sun before the holidays. He and the
Missus will be decked out in their tropical attire (no red suits with fur
trim here!) sunning and lounging the day away. Everybody knows Santa is
not at all camera shy, so he and Mrs. Claus are taking complimentary
photos with guests at his customized Tiki hut throughout his stay. 

    From being tucked into bed by an elf (yes, an elf!), to ordering a
Christmas tree from room service, the Walt Disney World Swan and Dolphin
Hotel knows how to create a holiday celebration guests will never forget.
It all starts after Thanksgiving when holiday festivities take place
throughout this Epcot Resort hotel, turning it in to a winter wonderland
right in sunny Orlando.

    Life-Size Chocolate Santa
 Santa may be known as sweet, but he even won't
be able to match the sweetness of his likeness that will be on display
throughout December in the lobby of the Swan. The hotel's executive
pastry chef Laurent Branlard has created a life-sized sculpture of Santa,
constructed entirely of chocolate -- approximately 1,200 lbs. of it! The
sculpture also features a fireplace and Christmas tree. Branlard is the
only two-time world pastry champion and renowned for his chocolate and
sugar sculptures. 

    Holiday Tree Guest Room Delivery
 Want to spruce up your room? Seriously.
Guests can order a Christmas tree through room service and have it
delivered right to their room. The 4-ft. tall, pre-lit trees include a
commemorative hotel ornament.

    Bedtime Elf Tuck-ins
 While Santa is out delivering presents on Christmas
Eve, his elves are tucking in children staying at the hotel. The elves
bring milk and cookies, read a bedtime story and then tuck the children
into bed just in time before Santa arrives! Reservations are required and
space is limited for this exclusive Christmas Eve service offered from
6-9 p.m. 

    For more details about all the holiday excitement at the Walt Disney
World Swan and Dolphin Hotel or to make room reservations, please visit

			Ireland Bailout Done, Who Is Next?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      November 22, 2010 - RELATED TICKERS: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: 
      GS), Morgan Stanley 
      (NYSE: MS), Bank of 
      America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) 
      and Wells Fargo  Co. (NYSE: WFC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This morning Ireland is expected to accept a bailout from the European 
      Central Bank (ECB) and the International Monetary Fund. However, there 
      is still a lot of uncertainty regarding which nation in the European 
      Union will need a bailout next. At this time Portugal is the one country 
      that looks as if would be the next bailout candidate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is important to remember that in May 2010 the ECB did a $1 trillion 
      European bank bailout that was similar to the Toxic Asset Relief Program 
      (TARP) in the United States. However, as we can see this bailout by the 
      ECB did not last that long. Spain and Italy are also being mentioned as 
      candidates for a bailout in the not so distant future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      When the European Union begins to experience problems many major 
      institutions will run or move money into the U.S. Dollar Index and flee 
      other foreign currencies. Therefore, when the U.S. Dollar Index trades 
      higher the stock markets will deflate or trade lower.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Please remember that most commodities are traded in U.S. Dollars and 
      commodities are usually the first asset class to deflate and trade 
      lower. Should the U.S. Dollar Index decline intra-day or pullback the 
      stock market should bounce higher or even rally if the U.S. Dollar Index 
      really declined sharply.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) 
      is declining sharply this morning. The stock is trading lower by over 
      $5.50 to $161.15. When this stock struggles or declines most other 
      financial stocks will remain weak. Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) 
      is also trading lower by 0.66 cents to $24.96. The large major bank 
      stocks such as Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) 
      and Wells Fargo  Co. (NYSE: WFC) 
      are trading slightly lower on the session.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mondays are usually a light volume trading session that have favored the 
      upside over the past year. Often companies will announced mergers, 
      acquisitions and stock buybacks on a Monday. This action usually helps 
      to keep the markets positive to begin the week.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, should the news out of Europe become worse and another nation 
      in the Euro-zone say they need a bailout the markets could decline. Keep 
      one eye on the U.S. Dollar Index at all times as the major stock indexes 
      will trade inverse to the dollar.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon&#8217;s Asset Disposal Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a report by Sunday Times, oil major ExxonMobil 
      Corporation (NYSE: XOM) 
      intends to dispose of its North Sea assets worth $2 billion, including 
      its vast Beryl field, to focus more on other fast growing areas such as 
      Brazil. The company declined to comment on the report, but confirmed 
      that it plans to divest 100 petrol stations in Scotland.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regarding the North Sea divestiture plan, Exxon&#8217;s spokesman pointed out 
      that the company intends to continue as a major investor in the North 
      Sea region.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In recent years, major oil companies such as BP Plc (NYSE: BP), 
      Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A), 
      as well as Exxon are divesting their assets in the region, in order to 
      focus on the areas such as Angola and the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). In 
      September 2010, Exxon and Shell had planned to sell their interest in 
      the Corvette field platform in the North Sea. Although the companies are 
      not willing to completely remove their footprints from the area, the 
      domain is expected to be occupied by smaller independent explorers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recently, Exxon and Hess Corp. (NYSE: HES) 
      started drilling the third well in an offshore Brazil Block, BM-S-22, 
      situated in Santos Basin. Each of the companies hold a 40% interest, 
      while Petroleo Brasileiro SA or Petrobras (NYSE: PBR), 
      Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil company, owns the remainder. Hence, this 
      is reflective of the companies&#8217; growing focus on Brazil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The growth outlook of Exxon is more upbeat on the back of solid access 
      to unconventional resources as the entire business of XTO Energy is now 
      on its board. However, as access to new energy resources is becoming 
      more difficult, ExxonMobil, like most of its peers, is facing headwinds 
      to replace its reserve. It remains to be seen how the companies will 
      develop the Brazilian deepwater.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are currently maintaining our long-term Neutral recommendation for 
      the Exxon stock. The company holds a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold 
      rating).

      The Company has set the maximum principal amount of notes to be 
      purchased pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer as $1,601,783,000. Such 
      maximum amount is equal to the difference between US$3,450,000,000 and 
      the aggregate principal amount of notes validly tendered and accepted 
      for payment in the Any and All Offer. The amounts of each series of 
      notes to be purchased in the Maximum Tender Offer are prioritized and 
      may be prorated as set forth in the Offer to Purchase, as supplemented 
      on November 16, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Maximum Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., EST, on 
      December 14, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated. Holders of 
      notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer must tender and not withdraw 
      their notes before the early tender date, which is 5:00 p.m., EST, on 
      November 30, 2010, unless extended, to be eligible to receive the total 
      consideration. Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who 
      tender their notes after the early tender date will be eligible to 
      receive the tender offer consideration, which is the total consideration 
      minus $30 per $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered by such holder 
      that are accepted for purchase. Holders of notes subject to the Maximum 
      Tender Offer who tender their notes after the early tender date may not 
      withdraw their notes except in the limited circumstances described fully 
      in the Offer to Purchase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The total consideration for each $1,000 principal amount of notes 
      tendered and accepted for payment pursuant to the Maximum Tender Offer 
      will be determined in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase by 
      reference to a fixed spread specified for each series of the notes over 
      the yield based on the bid side price of the U.S. Treasury Security 
      specified on the cover page of the Offer to Purchase, as calculated by 
      the dealer managers at 2:00 p.m., EST, on November 30, 2010. In addition 
      to the total consideration or the tender offer consideration, as 
      applicable, accrued interest up to, but not including, the settlement 
      date will be paid in cash on all validly tendered notes accepted in the 
      Maximum Tender Offer. The settlement date for the Maximum Tender Offer 
      is currently expected to be Wednesday, December 15, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Adds New Features to Rightcliq by Visa, Including Google Chrome 
      Browser Support
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the global payments technology leader, introduced a 
      series of enhancements to Rightcliq by Visa that add even more 
      convenience and security to the online shopping experience. The 
      enhancements will nearly triple the number of discounts available to 
      online shoppers, make it even easier to track shipments to their 
      doorstep and include support for the Google Chrome browser.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our goal at Visa has always been to create a series of products and 
      services that make shopping easier for consumers,&#8221; said Gerry Sweeney, 
      global head of ecommerce and authentication, Visa Inc. &#8220;These 
      enhancements are another example of how we are continuing to build 
      Rightcliq by listening to our users and delivering the features they 
      want most.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rightcliq was launched by Visa earlier this year, addressing many of the 
      frustration points consumers experience while shopping online and 
      helping them make smart online buying decisions. Consumers can use 
      Rightcliq with almost any shopping site on the Internet, instantly 
      collect and organize potential purchases in a &#8220;Wishspace&#8221; and share the 
      Wishspace on their social networks to seek advice. When it&#8217;s time to 
      buy, Rightcliq lets consumers automatically fill in online forms, select 
      a payment card from a list held securely by Visa and complete their 
      purchase. Rightcliq even helps track shipments to the consumer&#8217;s door so 
      they can feel confident that their holiday gifts will arrive in time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a recent Visa survey, nearly two-thirds of holiday shoppers 
      will &#8216;make their list and check it twice,&#8217; describing themselves as 
      responsible and organized shoppers. The &#8216;virtual wishlist&#8217; Wishspace 
      feature of Rightcliq makes it the perfect tool for shoppers this holiday 
      season. Also, Rightcliq&#8217;s coupons will be welcomed by the 76 percent of 
      survey respondents who say they will be motivated to shop online more if 
      a site can instantly show discounts and promotions1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			More Offers Save Shoppers Money
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa has expanded its partnerships with leading merchants to deliver 
      nearly three times as many offers for Rightcliq users. As consumers 
      browse participating merchants&#8217; web pages, offers will drop down from 
      the browser tool bar or appear in the Wishspace. Consumers can even 
      share these discounts with their social networks via email or Facebook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We all know that time is money, but with Rightcliq&#8217;s expanded offers, 
      online shoppers can save time while saving money,&#8221; added Sweeney. 
      &#8220;Getting Rightcliq offers is as simple as surfing the websites consumers 
      already love. As they browse, offers will drop down from the browser 
      tool bar ready for shoppers to redeem, exclusively from Visa.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Automatic Package Tracking is as Simple as an Email
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tracking purchase and shipment information is now even easier for 
      Rightcliq users. When a consumer receives their shipping confirmation 
      email, they can simply forward it to trackit@rightcliq.visa.com 
      and the Rightcliq team will populate their purchases tracker and 
      shipping status. This extends the value of Rightcliq throughout the 
      online shopping process, all the way to the consumer&#8217;s doorstep.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Browser, New Educational Tools
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      New Rightcliq features are available to users of all compatible browsers 
      &#8211; which now includes the Google Chrome browser. This connects the ease 
      of Visa&#8217;s online shopping technology with one of the most popular 
      browsers on the market and continues Visa&#8217;s extension of Rightcliq to 
      the widest possible number of consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To help those consumers enjoy more Rightcliq even more, Visa has created 
      a new homepage video at www.rightcliq.visa.com. 
      This video provides a short and fun demonstration of Rightcliq&#8217;s 
      features.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa has also created a Facebook page for Rightcliq users, and everyone 
      else who enjoys shopping online. The page, at www.facebook.com/visapowertotheshopper, 
      is all about the online shopping experience and making it better. Fans 
      of the page can receive cool offers, get tips from shopping experts and 
      share their experiences and thoughts about what makes millions of people 
      love to shop online every day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The power of Visa&#8217;s digital currency is a foundation for online 
      shopping today, and we&#8217;re always working to make it even more valuable,&#8221; 
      Sweeney said. &#8220;Rightcliq helps connect that value to consumers right on 
      their browser. Along with Visa&#8217;s other innovative eCommerce tools, we&#8217;re 
      making it possible for people to use their laptop or mobile device to 
      buy what they want, when they want, all with the convenience and 
      security of Visa.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Visa Offering International Online Shopping Solutions for Consumers This 
      Holiday Season to Access the Global Brands They Love
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) today announced a series of promotions with two 
      online shopping services - Borderlinx in 12 countries around the world 
      and SkyBOX in more than 40 countries in Latin America - making it easier 
      for Visa cardholders to shop on the internet for items from the United 
      States this holiday season.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Borderlinx and SkyBOX are two of the world&#8217;s leading eCommerce shopping 
      enablement services for consumers and merchants. Visa cardholders in 
      Australia, Bahrain, Canada, China, Kuwait, New Zealand, Oman, Qatar, 
      Russia, Saudi Arabia and UAE can now register with Borderlinx (www.borderlinx.visa.com) 
      for free and enjoy shopping at thousands of online merchants from the 
      U.S. and the U.K. Through SkyBOX (www.skybox.net/visa), 
      Visa cardholders in any Latin American or Caribbean country can also 
      register for free and shop at online U.S. merchants. Both Borderlinx and 
      SkyBOX services provide shoppers with a personalized U.S. shipping 
      address to which retailers can mail purchased items. Borderlinx and 
      SkyBOX then arrange for these items to be delivered to the cardholder&#8217;s 
      home country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To promote these cross-border online shopping enablement services and 
      provide value to cardholders, Visa has developed exclusive offers 
      including lucky draws, shopping sprees and discounts. For card-issuing 
      banks, Visa is making available customized platforms in select 
      geographies around the world intended to help issuers nurture and grow 
      cross-border eCommerce sales (issuers can email internationalecommerce@visa.com 
      for more information).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa cardholders purchasing via Borderlinx and SkyBOX will enjoy fast 
      delivery and competitive prices. On top of free registration, Borderlinx 
      is offering a 10 percent savings for Visa cardholders in select 
      countries during promotion periods. In Latin America, SkyBOX is offering 
      a $10 discount on their first shipment on top of free registration. 
      Shoppers are urged to check both www.borderlinx.visa.com 
      and www.skybox.net/visa, 
      for country-specific offers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gerry Sweeney, global head of ecommerce and authentication, Visa Inc. 
      said, &#8220;One inhibitor to the growth of cross-border eCommerce is the 
      delivery of goods. In many countries, buying from U.S.-based online 
      merchants has proven to be costly and logistically complicated. We 
      partner with logistic service providers like Borderlinx and SkyBOX to 
      remove obstacles to cross-border eCommerce transactions by enabling 
      international Visa cardholders to shop online and purchase from 
      thousands of U.S.-based retail stores that wouldn&#8217;t normally ship 
      overseas.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sweeney added, &#8220;Visa recognizes that online shopping is constantly 
      evolving due to changing consumer behavior and the advent, availability 
      and adoption of new technologies. We will continue working to find 
      innovative ways to build new products and services that increase the 
      value of digital currency.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa&#8217;s partnership with Borderlinx and SkyBOX and the facilitation of 
      product shipments from the U.S. are part of Visa&#8217;s global eCommerce 
      efforts to deliver a more satisfying online shopping experience for 
      consumers while also creating an environment that delivers more 
      profitable online sales to merchants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shoppers can register for the Borderlinx service online at (www.borderlinx.visa.com) 
      and SkyBOX at (www.skybox.net/visa).

			Coca-Cola Hellenic Scoops Three Fleet Europe Accolades
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Hellenic has won the prestigious International Fleet Safety of 
      the Year award &#8211; as well as being placed second and third in two other 
      Award categories.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company, which operates its fleet of over 20,000 vehicles across 28 
      countries, received the accolade at the Fleet Europe Awards 2010, which 
      took place on Thursday 18 November at a glittering gala dinner held at 
      the Brussels Stock Exchange.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Hellenic came second in the International Fleet Manager of the 
      Year award and third in the International Green Fleet of the Year. This 
      is the first time in the history of the awards that a company has been 
      recognised in three different categories.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The International Fleet Safety Award recognised the successful 
      implementation of a safety project for Coca-Cola Hellenic&#8217;s fleet, using 
      original tools and programmes to improve driver safety. The company&#8217;s 
      pilot safety programme, utilising the mobileye&#174; active fleet safety 
      system, was implemented in 2010. During the operation of this programme 
      no collisions were recorded, drivers&#8217; performance increased 
      significantly and fuel efficiency was improved.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second place in the International Fleet Manager of the Year award was 
      given was for successfully developing an international fleet management 
      strategy, and implementing an efficient car policy. Coca-Cola Hellenic 
      began building its international fleet organisation in 2007. As a result 
      of excellent co-operation across the 28 countries of operation, the 
      central procurement department, fleet and other experts, Coca-Cola 
      Hellenic achieved solid and consistent improvement and tangible results 
      in terms of supplier portfolio management, fleet downsizing and sourcing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Hellenic came third in the International Green Fleet of the 
      Year award, in recognition of its Safe  Eco drive programme. In 2009 
      the company reduced its fuel consumption by 6.3%, with a further 1.5% 
      reduction in the first half of 2010. This is equivalent to a reduction 
      in CO2 emissions of 7,600 tons over the 2009-10 period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The awards were received by Janos Kis, Group Fleet Support Manager, who 
      commented: &#8220;This is a fantastic result for Coca-Cola Hellenic. To win 
      this award is a great achievement for everyone who has worked so hard 
      across the company. To be the only company to achieve success in three 
      categories at the same time is an added bonus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Being recognised as the best by such a prestigious organisation is a 
      real honour, and this is an important milestone for us. However, we 
      won&#8217;t be resting on our laurels and will be continuing to strive for 
      continuous improvement in the year ahead&#8221;, concluded Janos.

&lt;p&gt; * Consumer stocks a safe bet for now - fund manager&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Fund manager sees policy fears fading early next year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Liqudity flowing out of proporty, commodities to aid stocks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Samuel Shen and Jason Subler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI, Nov 23 (Reuters) - China's stock market, pushed
lower by Beijing's monetary tightening moves, may retreat
further, but investment opportunities will emerge when the
economy stabilises next year, JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N)
Chinese fund joint venture said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks that stand to benefit from government support for
domestic consumption and innovation could be safe bets for now,
while buying opportunities in traditional sectors such as
resources would come during the first half of next year, said Luo
Jianhui, fund manager at China International Fund Management Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .SSEC jumped 12
percent in October, fuelled by inflation expectations, but the
upward trend was snapped by a flurry of tightening measures that
have knocked the market down more than 11 percent from a peak hit
this month. [.SS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Over the short term, I'm cautious -- this is the darkest
period in terms of policy expectations," Luo, who manages 793
million yuan ($119 million) at the China International Dual Core
Balanced Fund, told reporters in Shanghai. "But I'm optimistic
about next year, when the economy is likely to improve each
quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The higher-than-expected 4.4 percent rise in china's consumer
price index in the year to October raised the spectre of runaway
inflation as well as fears of further tightening, effectively
putting an end to October's bull run, Luo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past several weeks, the authorities have raised
interest rates, increased bank required reserve ratios twice,
adopted price controls on certain daily necessities and vowed to
take even tougher measures to fight inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors are now expecting vicious, not just mild,
inflation," said Luo, who will also manage a newly-launched fund
investing mainly in blue-chip stocks. "Market expectations have
turned abruptly for the worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Luo said he expected policy fears to fade early next year as
inflation pressure eases, making stocks attractive again in a
country where liquidity flowing out of suppressed sectors such as
real estate and commodities is constantly seeking higher returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Next year, there will be a need to reallocate the country's
70 trillion yuan money supply, and that's good for stocks," he
said.

claims JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) mismanaged his $1 billion
investment account, can proceed with his case against the U.S.
bank after a state appeals court upheld a lower court's
ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appeals court in New York allowed the case to go

industrial holding company, Access Industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blavatnik's lawyers blamed Ted Ufferfilge, a JPMorgan
banker appointed to manage the assets, for losing about 10
percent of the $1 billion portfolio betting on risky subprime
mortgage securities, according to court documents first filed
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is: CMMF LLC vs. J.P. Morgan Investment

      Research and Markets: US Vending Machine Operators Report: 5,000 
      Establishments such as Coca-Cola, Compass group and ARAMARK with 
      Combined Annual Revenue of $6 Billion
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/c68e5e/vending_machine_op) 
      has announced the addition of the "Vending 
      Machine Operators" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brief Excerpt from Industry Overview Chapter:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US vending machine operators industry includes about 5,000 
      establishments (single-location companies and units of multi-location 
      companies) with combined annual revenue of about $6 billion. Major 
      companies include divisions of Coca-Cola, Compass Group, ARAMARK, and 
      Sodexo. The industry is fragmented: the top 50 companies generate about 
      40 percent of industry sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer spending and business growth drive demand, since many vending 
      machines are located in workplaces. The profitability of individual 
      companies depends on effective merchandising, reliable service and 
      maintenance, and securing prime locations. Large companies can offer a 
      wide product selection, service large accounts, and enjoy scale 
      advantages in purchasing, finance, and distribution. Small companies can 
      compete effectively by serving a local market, providing superior 
      customer service, or offering unique products. The industry is 
      labor-intensive: average annual sales per employee are about $145,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vending machine operators compete with companies providing food and 
      beverages, including restaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores, 
      and coffee shops.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major products sold include cold soda (30 percent of industry sales) and 
      candy and snacks, hot beverages, hot and cold meal products, ice cream, 
      and cigarettes. The majority of cold beverages sold are soft drinks in 
      cans, bottles, or cups. Candy includes chocolate, gum, and mints. Snacks 
      include salty snacks (potato chips and pretzels); baked goods (cookies 
      and cakes); crackers, nuts, and seeds; and nutritious bars.

			Research and Markets: Pfizer: Pipeline, Products, Performance and 
      Potential 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/57e136/pfizer_pipeline) 
      has announced the addition of the "Pfizer: 
      Pipeline, Products, Performance, Potential" company profile to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Headquartered in New York, Pfizer has been the world's largest 
      research-based pharmaceutical company since it stole Merck  Co's crown 
      in 1998. The subsequent acquisition of Warner-Lambert (and with it 
      Agouron) in June 2000 and the merger with Pharmacia in April 2003 (which 
      included the former Monsanto division, GD Searle) cemented this 
      position. Furthermore, in October 2009, the company acquired Wyeth, 
      another leading global pharmaceutical company, in a deal valued at 
      around US$68 billion, which should help the company maintain a 
      leadership position in the longer-term.

			About Acorda 
      Therapeutics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      disorders. The Company is commercializing and marketing AMPYRA&#174;

      States. AMPYRA is a potassium channel blocker approved as a treatment to 
      improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); this was 
      demonstrated by an improvement in walking speed. AMPYRA was developed 
      using Elan&#8217;s Matrix Drug Absorption System (MXDAS&#174;) 
      technology and is manufactured by Elan based on a supply agreement with 
      Acorda.

 (Adds detail, background)

 By Foo Yun Chee

 BRUSSELS, Nov 25 (Reuters) - EU regulators will next month
accept Visa Europe's pledge to cut its debit card fees and drop
antitrust charges that could have brought a fine to the payments
network, two sources familiar with the case said on Thursday.

 The European Commission's decision follows a market test on
Visa Europe's proposals in May. The EU watchdog had charged the
credit and debit card network in 2009 for blocking competition
with its debit fees.
The Commission was expected to announce its decision on Dec.
8, one of the sources said.

 The 0.2 percent fee was set to come into effect in February
and be legally binding for four years. It will apply for
cross-border transactions and for domestic purchases in nine EU
countries, including Ireland, Italy and Sweden.

 The European Union executive said in April the fee cuts
would range from 30-60 percent. More than 70 percent of payment
transactions through Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa
Inc. (V.N), are with debit cards.

 So-called interchange fees, where merchants pay fees to
banks and processing networks like Visa and MasterCard Inc
(MA.N) every time a customer uses a credit or debit card, are a
significant source of revenue for the companies.

 Visa Europe is still facing EU regulatory scrutiny over its
charges for consumer credit and deferred debit card
transactions.

 MasterCard undertook to cut its transaction fees in April
last year in return for the Commission scrapping its
investigation, but has gone to court over the case.

 Visa and MasterCard settled a U.S. Justice Department
antitrust lawsuit over their processing rules last month.

&lt;p&gt;LIMA (Reuters) - Dozens of Peruvians, among them two mayors and leaders of coca growing groups, were arrested on Friday for alleged ties to cocaine traffickers and Maoist guerrillas in the world's No. 1 coca leaf producer, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrests, made in jungle towns in the Alto Huallaga valley, mark the biggest anti-drug sweep by President Alan Garcia's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Garcia has been under intense pressure to crack down on coca growing since the United Nations said this year that Peru had overtaken Colombia as the biggest grower of the leaf used to make cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has also vowed to stamp out what remains of Shining Path rebels who went into the drug trade after their leaders were captured in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a witch hunt against coca growers," Geronimo Villogas, a lawyer for an association of coca growers, said on RPP radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A judge ordered the arrests of up to 45 people after police found chemicals used to refine cocaine and linked them to the suspects, among other evidence, local media said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"How are they going to prove that the chemicals belong to the coca growers?" Villegas asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca growers often back candidates for mayor in small jungle towns where the leaf is grown and a handful of legislators in Congress rely on coca planters for political support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growers say that they plant the crop for its traditional uses in food, tea and indigenous religious ceremonies -- Andean inhabitants chew the leaf for energy-- but police say 90 percent of Peru's crop flows into the drug trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Alto Huallaga valley is one of two major drug regions in Peru where holdouts from the Shining Path insurgency are still active.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, two Peruvian soldiers were killed and five others were wounded when they stumbled onto landmines set by the Shining Path in another coca-growing area known as the VRAE, or the valleys of the Apurimac and Ene rivers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shining Path have been blamed for killing more than 50 soldiers or anti-drug police in the last two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Marco Aquino, Teresa Cespedes, Patricia Velez and Terry Wade; editing by Anthony Boadle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
it was restarting on Friday the last unit shut by a Wednesday
power outage at its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los
Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The refinery is expected to resume normal operations over
the weekend, said Exxon spokeswoman Aarti Ramachandran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The power outage occurred when a raccoon got into a
third-party power provider's substation early on Wednesday
morning, according to California media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Not all units were shut at the refinery, some units reduced
production, while others shut down.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Nov 26 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Medal of Bravery was awarded today to the family of the late Leading
Seaman Robert Binder by the Chief of the Defence Staff, General Walter
Natynczyk, on behalf of His Excellency the Right Honourable David
Johnston, Governor General of Canada, at Her Majesty's Canadian (HMCS)
Ship York.

    "The medal of bravery is one of Canada's highest honours," said General
Natynczyk. "We should all remember Leading Seaman Binder for his courage
and disregard for his own safety while saving the life of another. I am
honoured to present this decoration to his family."

    In the early hours of August 14, 2008, at the age of nineteen, he and two
other Canadian Forces members heard a car crash through a concrete
barrier and plunge into the frigid waters of Lang Cove, at Canadian
Forces Base Esquimalt, B.C. The servicemen quickly dove into the murky
waters and repeatedly attempted to rescue the submerged vehicle's
occupant. With the doors being jammed, they smashed the windows to
extricate the unconscious passenger. Upon bringing him back ashore, they
successfully administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation, ultimately
saving the man's life. 

    Leading Seaman Binder, a Marine Engineering Systems Operator in the Naval
Reserve, passed away in June of this year.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Dynegy Rejects Blackstone Deal
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Asset management and financial services company The Blackstone Group&#8217;s 
      (NYSE: BX) dream to 
      acquire Houston-based merchant generator, Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) 
      went bust with the latter rejecting the proposal at a special 
      shareholder meeting for the purpose.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier faced with a lukewarm response from shareholders for the merger 
      deal, Blackstone offered a final bid price of $5 per share for Dynegy 
      from the earlier bid of $4.50. As a result, the merger agreement has 
      been terminated. The deal was doomed from the start with two major 
      holders of Dynegy, billionaire investor Carl Icahn and Seneca Capital 
      going public with their sentiments about the deal being undervalued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The deal was touted as a win-win for both parties, with Dynegy&#8217;s 
      shareholders hit hard by mark-to-market losses from forward power sales, 
      enjoyed a brief period of near-term valuation upside. On the other hand, 
      Blackstone was eyeing Dynegy&#8217;s generation assets -- a portion of which 
      would have been sold to NRG Energy Inc. (NYSE: NRG) 
      who were looking to augmenting their presence in California.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Post the merger debacle, Dynegy will shortly commence soliciting 
      alternative proposals from alternative parties along with reviewing its 
      standalone restructuring alternatives. The company supplies wholesale 
      electric power to utilities, cooperatives, municipalities and other 
      energy companies in the Midwest, the Northeast and the West Coast -- 
      providing a relatively stable and growing earnings stream.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Geographic disparity in the target markets of Dynegy has helped shape a 
      portfolio that is well-positioned for capitalizing on arbitrage 
      opportunities arising from regional differences in power prices and 
      weather-driven demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Janus Faces Insider Trading Probe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Janus Capital Group Inc. (NYSE: JNS) 
      has hogged the headlines for the wrong reason. In a filing with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the company has revealed that 
      it has received an enquiry from the authorities in an insider trading 
      investigation on Wall Street. While Janus has expressed willingness to 
      fully cooperate with the SEC, it declined to provide any further details 
      on the inquiry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Insider trading is the trading of a corporation's stock or other 
      securities, such as bonds or stock options, by individuals with 
      potential access to non-public information about the company. It refers 
      to a practice in which an insider or a related party trades based on 
      material non-public information obtained during the performance of the 
      insider's duties at the corporation, or otherwise in breach of a 
      fiduciary or other relationship of trust and confidence or where the 
      non-public information was misappropriated from the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Besides Janus Capital, other companies such as SAC Capital Advisors and 
      Wellington Management Co. are said to have received enquiries related to 
      insider trading, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. 
      Investigations are said to be on to see whether there was any leak of 
      information from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) 
      for transactions regarding health care mergers. Hedge fund and mutual 
      fund trading activities by these companies are being probed to see if 
      they have resulted in illegal profits by utilizing inside information 
      which was not made public.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Nov 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The U.S. online retail sector delivered double digit growth on Black
Friday 2010 compared to the same period last year, according to
analytics-based findings by IBM (NYSE: IBM). These findings expand on
IBM's earlier forecast that in-store sales of consumer electronics and
appliances in U.S. retail stores would get an early start this year, with
consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November. 

    Delivered as part of Coremetrics, an IBM Company's third annual Black
Friday Benchmark Report, the analysis of the online retail sector reveals
the following trends as of 12:00 am PST compared to Black Friday 2009
(year/year): 


--  Consumer Spending Increases: Online sales were up a healthy 15.9
    percent, with consumers pushing the average order value (AOV) up from
    $170.19 to $190.80 for an increase of 12.1 percent.
--  Luxury Goods Make a Comeback: Jewelry retailers reported a 17.6
    percent increase in sales. These affluent shoppers appear very willing
    to open their wallets.
--  Surgical Shopping: Consumers know what they want and where to get it.
    People are viewing 18.0 percent fewer products on sites than they did
    last year, suggesting that they are shopping with a specific item in
    mind and quickly moving on.
--  Social Shopping: Consumers appear increasingly savvy about their
    favorite brands' social presence, and are turning to their networks on
    social sites for information about deals and inventory levels. While
    the percentage of visitors arriving from social network sites is
    fairly small relative to all online visitors -- nearly 1 percent -- it
    is gaining momentum, with Facebook dominating the space.
--  Mobile Shopping: Consumers are also embracing mobile as a shopping
    tool. On Black Friday, 5.6 percent of people logged onto a retailer's
    site using a mobile device, a jump of 26.7 percent compared to the
    prior Friday.

    

"On Black Friday, consumers came, they clicked and they shopped
their way across the Internet, and this time, they weren't just looking
for bargains," said John Squire, chief strategy officer, IBM Coremetrics.
"Consequently, we're watching online retail, and increasingly social
media and mobile, become the growth engines for retailers everywhere as
consumers embrace online shopping not only for its ease and convenience,
but as a primary means of researching goods and services." 

    Retail Categories


--  Department stores have become the research engine of choice for
    consumers looking for Black Friday deals and product promotions. As a
    consequence, shoppers are spending 17.7 percent more time year over
    year on department store sites.
    
    
--  Health and Beauty also reported a rise of 73.1 percent in the number
    of new consumers completing their first purchase on their sites and a
    53.4 percent jump in the number of visits in which consumers completed
    an order.
    
    
--  In-Store Sales in the Consumer Electronics and Appliances Sector are
    expected to increase 3.5 percent this year compared to last, with
    consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November, according to
    an analytics-based forecast from IBM's Global Business Services
    division. U.S. consumers have been increasing their savings relative
    to disposable income, from 2 percent in 2007 to nearly 6 percent
    today, leading to strong pent-up demand this holiday season for
    consumer electronics and appliances, both of which are typically seen
    as necessities in the present-day economy.

&lt;p&gt;BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - U.S. major ExxonMobil (XOM.N) and its partners raised their production plateau target from Iraq's West Qurna oilfield to 2.825 million barrels per day after adding new reserves to the area covered by their original development contract, an Iraqi oil official said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The original plateau target when the contract was signed in January was 2.325 million bpd in six to seven years time, but the Exxon-led consortium agreed with Iraq to add four undeveloped reservoirs, Madhi Swadi, a member of the joint management committee that runs the field, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a discussion to develop the discovered undeveloped reservoirs and it was agreed as an addition to the original contract at production rates of 500,000 bpd," he said in an interview at West Qurna oilfield, near the southern oil hub of Basra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a rehabilitation plan for the field, the consortium plans to boost output from the giant field to around 750,000 bpd in three years from between 230,000 to 240,000 bpd now, by drilling new wells, overhauling existing wells and a series of water injection projects, Swadi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) won the contract to develop the 8.7-billion-barrel West Qurna Phase One field in an auction held by Iraq last year for oilfield development contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the early months of next year, Exxon and its partners plan to start a water injection project to help boost the output rate and help overcome production decline in the field, which started production in the late 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to a series of small water injection projects, Exxon is leading a multibillion-dollar water injection project that should be completed by the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group aims to reach its initial production rate of a 10 percent increase to about 268,000 bpd in May next year, Swadi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies start recovering costs when they hit their initial production target, which is a 10 percent increase above the agreed baseline production of 244,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group's rehabilitation plan for the field includes drilling between 100 and 120 new wells through the end of 2011, which could boost production to about 300,000 bpd next year, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan also includes drilling around 1,500 new wells to reach the final plateau target. There are 370 existing wells in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a tender issued for drilling new wells and we are preparing for a new tender now," he said, without adding details. Drilling activities are expected to start by early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing infrastructure on the field can handle oil production of 550,000 bpd, Swadi said, but the plan for West Qurna includes building two to three crude processing units to meet the anticipated output increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon group also aims to float a tender for demining in the two next weeks, and a 3D seismic survey tender by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jason Benham; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Google Inc (GOOG.O) are in talks that would allow ABC's online shows to be viewed on Google TV, but the two remain far apart on piracy concerns, Disney's TV chief Anne Sweeney told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's fair to say there's conversation with Google," Sweeney told Reuters and the Reuters Media Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google TV is a Web television service that lets viewers find Web content on television screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, three networks, including CBS (CBS.N), Disney's ABC and General Electric Co's (GE.N) NBC blocked their programing from Google TV, which puts the Web on people's television sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More conversations are planned with them," she said, but added, "I can't characterize them as negotiations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney said the talks have been mostly focused on Disney's concerns about piracy issues. Disney's concern is that Google TV doesn't completely block out all pirated content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sue Zeidler; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 18 months after U.S. prosecutors charged computer programer Sergey Aleynikov with stealing speed-trading code from Goldman Sachs, Wall Street's most influential bank, a jury was selected on Monday to hear the complex trial evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The panel of 12 and five alternates will first listen to opening statements from the government and Aleynikov's defense lawyer on Tuesday morning at a trial expected to last three weeks in U.S. District Court in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was charged in July last year with trade secrets theft for purportedly taking Goldman code to his new employer -- Teza Technologies LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, an immigrant from Russia who became a U.S. citizen, has been free on bail since his arrest. If convicted by the jury, Aleynikov, 40, faces a statutory maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years on two criminal counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His lawyer, Kevin Marino, said the trial was an opportunity for the public to hear Aleynikov's side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sergey Aleynikov did not steal trade secrets from any Goldman Sachs product. He did not intend to do harm to Goldman Sachs and he could not do harm to Goldman Sachs," Marino said before the trial. "He has been living under a cloud of accusation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-frequency trading, or high-speed automated trading, has become an increasingly important and competitive business, generating millions in profits for banks and brokerages. The computer codes that help firms trade shares in milliseconds are closely guarded secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors had asked Judge Denise Cote to close parts of the trial to protect Goldman's trade secrets, but she indicated at a November 19 pre-trial hearing that it was premature to rule because she would need more specificity and context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll just march through these issues, one by one, as they arise," Cote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Monday's jury selection, the judge asked jurors whether they used computers at work and at home, whether they knew anyone at Goldman Sachs or in law enforcement. The jurors selected include a teacher, a real estate broker and a man who works for a major bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Ed Canaday, declined to comment on the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov worked at Goldman from May 2007 to June 2009. Before leaving, prosecutors say he copied part of the proprietary code Goldman uses for speed-trading and deposited it in a server. They accused him of also downloading the code onto a flash drive and onto his computers at his New Jersey home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securities regulators are examining speed-trading practices following the "flash crash" that rocked stock markets on May 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a trial earlier this month with similar allegations, a former Societe General high-frequency trader, Samarth Agrawal, was convicted of trade secrets theft by a jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agrawal copied and printed out the French bank's proprietary code before planning to move to a new job at a hedge fund in April this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

sentence of up to 10 years on two criminal counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His lawyer, Kevin Marino, said the trial was an opportunity
for the public to hear Aleynikov's side of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sergey Aleynikov did not steal trade secrets from any
Goldman Sachs product. He did not intend to do harm to Goldman
Sachs and he could not do harm to Goldman Sachs," Marino said
before the trial. "He has been living under a cloud of
accusation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High-frequency trading, or high-speed automated trading,
has become an increasingly important and competitive business,
generating millions in profits for banks and brokerages. The
computer codes that help firms trade shares in milliseconds are
closely guarded secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. prosecutors had asked Judge Denise Cote to close parts
of the trial to protect Goldman's trade secrets, but she
indicated at a Nov. 19 pre-trial hearing that it was premature
to rule because she would need more specificity and context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll just march through these issues, one by one, as they
arise," Cote said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During Monday's jury selection, the judge asked jurors
whether they used computers at work and at home, whether they
knew anyone at Goldman Sachs or in law enforcement. The jurors
selected include a teacher, a real estate broker and a man who
works for a major bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Ed Canaday, declined to comment
on the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov worked at Goldman from May 2007 to June 2009.
Before leaving, prosecutors say he copied part of the
proprietary code Goldman uses for speed-trading and deposited
it in a server. They accused him of also downloading the code
onto a flash drive and onto his computers at his New Jersey
home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Securities regulators are examining speed-trading practices
following the "flash crash" that rocked stock markets on May
6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a trial earlier this month with similar allegations, a
former Societe General (SOGN.PA) high-frequency trader, Samarth
Agrawal, was convicted of trade secrets theft by a jury.
[ID:nN19191422]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Agrawal copied and printed out the French bank's
proprietary code before planning to move to a new job at a
hedge fund in April this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is USA v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York, No. 10-96.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is about to jump back into the TV game. Only this time, it may aim at cable, satellite and phone companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The software powerhouse has held talks with TV networks to create a new subscription-based TV service on its Xbox gaming console that would rival efforts by Google Inc, Apple Inc and Netflix Inc, sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's latest explorations after investments in MSNBC and WebTV come as efforts to redefine living room entertainment have accelerated in the past year, with technology companies seeking to offer lower cost alternatives to pricey pay-TV subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One scenario under consideration by Microsoft is to create a new TV service on its Xbox gaming console that would establish a "virtual cable operator." The service would charge a monthly fee for access through the Xbox to networks such as ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS, ESPN or CNN, according to two sources familiar with the plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other options include allowing cable subscribers to use the Xbox to watch shows with more interactive functions. Viewers could, for instance, message with friends over the console while viewing their favorite shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also exploring the possibility of creating programing packages for customers, setting up a bundle of sports or children shows, for example, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, it could sell more individual channels, such as an HBO or Showtime, directly to subscribers. It already has Walt Disney Co's ESPN on the Xbox Live online service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These people said a service may not arrive for another 12 months, but early discussions have been productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment. The people involved in the talks asked not to be identified as the discussions were confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of Microsoft's plans come as the pay-television industry are moving to allay investor concerns that consumers are fleeing expensive subscription packages for cheaper online services operated by companies such as Netflix Inc and Hulu, which both charge $7.99 per month for streamed shows and movies. The phenomenon is called "cord-cutting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worry is that so-called over-the-top services could undermine the lucrative cable TV industry, whose dual-revenue stream model has made pay-TV one of the most resilient sectors during the economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cable networks such as ESPN are paid carriage fees by pay TV operators and also earn revenue from advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But programmers have said they would welcome new types of competition to the cable and satellite companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Reuters Global Media Summit on Monday, News Corp Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey said the arrival of alternative TV services gives cable and broadcast networks yet another way to reach fragmented audiences. News Corp is parent of Fox Broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The emergence of platforms like that -- from people like Microsoft which is really more a theory at this point, or Netflix -- increases the value of content and brands and those who create the content and channels that actually the business and drives consumer demand," Carey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has long held ambitions to be a major player in the TV business and has previously invested in MSNBC and interactive television initiatives including Web TV and MSN TV set-top box software. Its latest plans include offering interactive features to engage viewers through social media, interactive advertising and "gesture" technology that lets viewers change channels and fast forward through shows by waving their arms or speaking instructions, say people who have seen early demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington, company is mulling feedback it has received from programmers including the expense of such a plan, said one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft faces an increasingly crowded field. Google has already launched Google TV, an enhanced Web-TV service with partners including Sony Corp televisions and Logitech set-top boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has also held talks with programmers, but faced resistance industry-wide over its plans to offer a lower-cost subscription TV plan, people familiar with the talks have said. Apple has begun to offer 99-cent TV show rentals for a limited number shows through News Corp's Fox and Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle, editing by Matthew Lewis and Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

      manufacturer based in Salt Lake City, today announced it will be the 
      official health supplements supplier of the Visa Women&#8217;s Ski Jumping

      and has been fighting for inclusion in the Olympic Winter Games has 
      persevered on limited funding.

      Marketing. &#8220;We hope our financial support of these tremendous athletes 
      will help get them the resources and recognition they deserve. We wholly

      Lindsey Van, of Park City, is the sport&#8217;s first female world champion

      In addition to sponsoring the Visa Women's Ski Jumping Team, USANA

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp scored a victory in a long-running patent case by persuading the Supreme Court to hear its appeal against a record-breaking $290 million jury verdict for infringing a patent held by a small Canadian software firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the Supreme Court's review of the three-year old case, which is expected by the middle of next year, could alter the way patents are enforced in the United States by making it easier to challenge their validity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dispute, which started in 2007, was seemingly resolved in 2009 when a federal jury awarded Toronto-based i4i $290 million after finding that Microsoft had infringed the i4i patent relating to text manipulation software in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word, Microsoft's word processing application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's biggest software company, subsequently appealed the verdict but was rebuffed by a federal appeals court that specializes in patent and trademark cases, making the jury award the largest patent infringement verdict ever affirmed on appeal. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of the i4i patent in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft continued to dispute those decisions, but did remove the contested features from its current software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In appealing to the Supreme Court, the country's highest, Microsoft argued that the appeals court had erred in holding that Microsoft's defense -- that the patent was invalid -- must be proved by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said a lower standard should have been used, arguing that the issue is important to the effective functioning of the U.S. patent system, as it may be leaning too far in favor of those who establish questionable patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc, Yahoo Inc, and trade groups such as the Computer  Communications Industry Association and 36 law, business and economics professors all supported Microsoft's appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I4i urged the Supreme Court to reject the appeal. It said Microsoft's arguments lacked merit and that Microsoft sought to bring about a dramatic change in patent law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Congress over the last 27 years has confirmed the correctness of the appeals court's interpretation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any change should come from Congress, which is considering patent law changes, i4i said. The congressional efforts could be disrupted if the court grants Microsoft's appeal, which would signal that it might change the standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft welcomed the Supreme Court's decision to hear the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a clear affirmation that the issues raised in this case are critical to the integrity of our patent system," said David Howard, Microsoft's deputy general counsel for litigation, in a statement. "We look forward to presenting our case to the Supreme Court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I4i said it was confident it would still win the legal argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are vital issues in question, not just for i4i, but for the entire universe of inventors, technology pioneers and entrepreneurial companies," said Loudon Owen, chairman of i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case in March, with a decision likely by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Justice John Roberts, who owns Microsoft stock, recused himself from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 0.5 percent to $25.12 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading, outperforming deeper stock declines in the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is Microsoft Corp v. i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc, No. 10-290.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court case was i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc v. Microsoft Corp, an appeal from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in case no. 07-CV-113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by James Vicini; additional reporting by Bill Rigby in Seattle, Editing by Derek Caney and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft plans for cable package on Xbox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Considering enhanced TV package for cable partners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Also exploring possibility of individual channels
 (Recasts 1st paragraph, adds News Corp COO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Yinka Adegoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
about to jump back into the TV game. Only this time, it may aim
at cable, satellite and phone companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software powerhouse has held talks with TV networks to
create a new subscription-based TV service on its Xbox gaming
console that would rival efforts by Google Inc (GOOG.O), Apple
Inc (AAPL.O) and Netflix Inc (NFLX.O), sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's latest explorations after investments in MSNBC
and WebTV come as efforts to redefine living room entertainment
have accelerated in the past year, with technology companies
seeking to offer lower cost alternatives to pricey pay-TV
subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One scenario under consideration by Microsoft is to create
a new TV service on its Xbox gaming console that would
establish a "virtual cable operator." The service would charge
a monthly fee for access through the Xbox to networks such as
ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS, ESPN or CNN, according to two sources
familiar with the plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other options include allowing cable subscribers to use the
Xbox to watch shows with more interactive functions. Viewers
could, for instance, message with friends over the console
while viewing their favorite shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is also exploring the possibility of creating
programming packages for customers, setting up a bundle of
sports or children shows, for example, these people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, it could sell more individual channels, such
as an HBO or Showtime, directly to subscribers. It already has
Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) ESPN on the Xbox Live online service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These people said a service may not arrive for another 12
months, but early discussions have been productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined to comment. The people involved in the
talks asked not to be identified as the discussions were
confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of Microsoft's plans come as the pay-television
industry are moving to allay investor concerns that consumers
are fleeing expensive subscription packages for cheaper online
services operated by companies such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and
Hulu, which both charge $7.99 per month for streamed shows and
movies. The phenomenon is called "cord-cutting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worry is that so-called over-the-top services could
undermine the lucrative cable TV industry, whose dual-revenue
stream model has made pay-TV one of the most resilient sectors
during the economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cable networks such as ESPN are paid carriage fees by pay
TV operators and also earn revenue from advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But programmers have said they would welcome new types of
competition to the cable and satellite companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at the Reuters Global Media Summit on Monday, News
Corp (NWSA.O) Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey said the
arrival of alternative TV services gives cable and broadcast
networks yet another way to reach fragmented audiences. News
Corp is parent of Fox Broadcasting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The emergence of platforms like that -- from people like
Microsoft which is really more a theory at this point, or
Netflix -- increases the value of content and brands and those
who create the content and channels that actually the business
and drives consumer demand," Carey said. [ID:nN26129622]
 (here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has long held ambitions to be a major player in
the TV business and has previously invested in MSNBC and
interactive television initiatives including Web TV and MSN TV
set-top box software.
Its latest plans include offering interactive features to
engage viewers through social media, interactive advertising
and "gesture" technology that lets viewers change channels and
fast forward through shows by waving their arms or speaking
instructions, say people who have seen early demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Redmond, Washington, company is mulling feedback it has
received from programmers including the expense of such a plan,
said one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft faces an increasingly crowded field. Google has
already launched Google TV, an enhanced Web-TV service with
partners including Sony Corp (6758.T) televisions and Logitech
set-top boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple has also held talks with programmers, but faced
resistance industry-wide over its plans to offer a lower-cost
subscription TV plan, people familiar with the talks have said.
Apple has begun to offer 99-cent TV show rentals for a limited
number shows through News Corp's (NWSA.O) Fox and Disney.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Google Inc (GOOG.O) are in talks that would allow ABC's online shows to be viewed on Google TV, but the two remain far apart on piracy concerns, Disney's TV chief Anne Sweeney told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"It's fair to say there's conversation with Google," Sweeney told Reuters and the Reuters Media Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google TV is a Web television service that lets viewers find Web content on television screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, three networks, including CBS (CBS.N), Disney's ABC and General Electric Co's (GE.N) NBC blocked their programing from Google TV, which puts the Web on people's television sets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"More conversations are planned with them," she said, but added, "I can't characterize them as negotiations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney said the talks have been mostly focused on Disney's concerns about piracy issues. Disney's concern is that Google TV doesn't completely block out all pirated content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sue Zeidler; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Boost for Microsoft after loss on appeal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Google, Yahoo, others support Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * $290 million is largest patent award upheld on appeal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Decision expected mid-2011
 (Rewrites; adds reaction from companies)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By James Vicini&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
scored a victory in a long-running patent case by persuading
the U.S. Supreme Court to hear its appeal against a
record-breaking $290 million jury verdict for infringing a
patent held by a small Canadian software firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The result of the Supreme Court's review of the three-year
old case, which is expected by the middle of next year, could
alter the way patents are enforced in the United States by
making it easier to challenge their validity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dispute, which started in 2007, was seemingly resolved
in 2009 when a federal jury awarded Toronto-based i4i $290
million after finding that Microsoft had infringed the i4i
patent relating to text manipulation software in the 2003 and
2007 versions of Word, Microsoft's word processing
application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's biggest software company,
subsequently appealed the verdict but was rebuffed by a federal
appeals court that specializes in patent and trademark cases,
making the jury award the largest patent infringement verdict
ever affirmed on appeal. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
upheld the validity of the i4i patent in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft continued to dispute those decisions, but did
remove the contested features from its current software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In appealing to the Supreme Court, the country's highest,
Microsoft argued that the appeals court had erred in holding
that Microsoft's defense -- that the patent was invalid -- must
be proved by clear and convincing evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said a lower standard
should have been used, arguing that the issue is important to
the effective functioning of the U.S. patent system, as it may
be leaning too far in favor of those who establish questionable
patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google Inc (GOOG.O), Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), and trade groups
such as the Computer  Communications Industry Association and
36 law, business and economics professors all supported
Microsoft's appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I4i urged the Supreme Court to reject the appeal. It said
Microsoft's arguments lacked merit and that Microsoft sought to
bring about a dramatic change in patent law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said Congress over the last 27 years has confirmed the
correctness of the appeals court's interpretation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any change should come from Congress, which is considering
patent law changes, i4i said. The congressional efforts could
be disrupted if the court grants Microsoft's appeal, which
would signal that it might change the standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft welcomed the Supreme Court's decision to hear the
case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a clear affirmation that the issues raised in this
case are critical to the integrity of our patent system," said
David Howard, Microsoft's deputy general counsel for
litigation, in a statement. "We look forward to presenting our
case to the Supreme Court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I4i said it was confident it would still win the legal
argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are vital issues in question, not just for i4i, but
for the entire universe of inventors, technology pioneers and
entrepreneurial companies," said Loudon Owen, chairman of i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court is expected to hear arguments in the case
in March, with a decision likely by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Justice John Roberts, who owns Microsoft stock,
recused himself from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares fell 0.5 percent to $25.12 on Nasdaq in
afternoon trading, outperforming deeper stock declines in the
broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court case is Microsoft Corp v. i4i Limited
Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc, No.
10-290.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appeals court case was i4i Limited Partnership and
Infrastructures for Information Inc v. Microsoft Corp, an
appeal from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas in case no. 07-CV-113.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Visa Inc and American Express Co will benefit from a partial rebound in consumer spending this holiday season, bolstered by a more financially secure American consumer, but MasterCard Inc may be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card processing network, could grab the lion's share of holiday spending via cards because of its wide acceptance at merchants and the fact that it has a larger debit card portfolio compared with smaller rival MasterCard, according to some analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think American Express will necessarily do poorly, nor will MasterCard... we just believe that Visa should be able to put out better results," said Michael Sansoterra, a portfolio manager of the RidgeWorth Large Cap Growth Fund. Sansoterra has investments in Visa and Capital One Financial Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-income consumers could be key this holiday season as they are expected to spend more and indulge in big-ticket purchases -- something that could be key for American Express, which caters to a wealthier clientele.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. consumer sentiment is at its highest level since June, at 71.6, up from 67.7 in October, bolstered by signs of improved job conditions and early holiday sales, data from a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey revealed earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think consumers are ready for a sentiment shift and some retail therapy, if only for the holiday season," SP Equity Research said in a note on holiday sales forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though a survey suggests only 12 percent of U.S. consumers would pay for their holiday gifts with a credit card this year, compared with 32.4 percent last year, Visa and MasterCard would benefit from both credit and debit card payments as these would in most cases have to pass through their networks for processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For the most part, everyone will use cash and debit cards this Christmas, I don't think you'll see a huge increase in consumer credit balances for this Christmas," said Alan Creech, a co-portfolio manager at the Marshall Large-Cap Growth Fund. Creech holds shares of Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Retail Federation is expecting 2010 holiday retail sales, which exclude online sales, to rise by 2.3 percent this year to $447.1 billion, compared with a rise of 0.4 percent last year. Top retailers Wal-mart and Target Corp are also optimistic about sales during the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG BUYS, BIGGER BITE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say that the high-end spenders "are back" feeling more secure about their jobs and their financial position, and this season will see an increase in big-ticket purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people tend to use their Visa card for normal purchases and their AmEx card for the travel and entertainment side of things," David Wyss, chief economist at Standard  Poors, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And American Express' rewards program could be the factor that makes consumers prefer AmEx card to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are they (high-end customers) going to put it on another card where they get no rewards? Most likely they're going to take out the Amex card," SP equity analyst Rafay Khalid said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. online holiday sales, estimated at an average of $858.49 per person, would see Visa and MasterCard raking in more cash. While options such as eBay's PayPal do exist, analysts say the bulk of the transactions would be processed by Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would definitely expect online sales to benefit Visa and MasterCard just because they're so broadly used online," said SP equity analyst Zaineb Bokhari.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fashion jewelry, fur and electronic goods -- specifically tablet computers, smartphones, and e-Book readers -- would be most sought after this holiday season, SP Equity Research said in a note on retail holiday forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the top 10 items for this Christmas, seven are electronics, including the iPhone and the iPad, which are expensive, said Alan Creech, a co-portfolio manager at the Marshall Large-Cap Growth Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STOCKS BATTLING REGULATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong holiday sales may not be enough to prop up share prices of the card networks. The shares have been on the decline through this year due to uncertainty over the impact of recent regulations on these companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa stock, for instance, has seen an over 20 percent fall since its 52-week high of $97.14 in April on worries that the new law could cut deeply into the company's future profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The reason the stocks are not where they used to be is that although the economy is recovering, the government has stepped in," Susquehanna Financial's analyst James Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debit card industry is now closely awaiting any word from the Federal Reserve, which has been given the task of defining exactly how fees will be imposed and any rules would be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new U.S. Dodd-Frank financial reform law will restrict the processing fees that Visa and MasterCard earn from debit card transactions. In October, both companies settled an antitrust lawsuit over their processing rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Brenton Cordeiro; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, Nov 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NextPlane, a leading provider of enterprise class federation solutions
for unified communication platforms, today announces that both the
NextPlane Federation Server and NextPlane Federation Cloud service
support voice calls between Microsoft OCS and Google Apps.

    "We already use NextPlane to federate Microsoft OCS and Google Apps for
IM, presence and domain sharing between our faculty and students," says
Daniel A Nanto, Director Infrastructure Development &amp; Identity Services
at Vanderbilt University. "With budgets as tight as they are, we are
really looking forward to taking advantage of the savings that will be
enabled by federated UC voice calling."

    "Companies can save on their telecommunication charges by using their UC
systems for voice communications across federated domains," says Farzin
Shahidi, CEO of NextPlane. "Until now it was only possible for companies
to take advantage of inter-domain voice calls if their partners,
customers, or supplier were also on Microsoft OCS, but now with NextPlane
federation, users on Microsoft OCS can call users on Google Apps and vice
versa."

    NextPlane enables hi-fidelity federation across different UC platforms so
that users can exchange presence, send instant messages, participate on
multi-user chat sessions, or make HD quality voice calls as if they are
on the same platform.

for enterprise class federation across Microsoft OCS 2007 R2, OCS 2007 &amp;
LCS 2005, IBM Sametime, Cisco WebEx Connect, Cisco Unified Presence
Server 8.0, Jive OpenFire, Google Apps and Google Talk. NextPlane extends
presence-aware collaboration and communication beyond what unified
communication (UC) platforms permit by offering unique capabilities as
such presence, multi-party federation chat, voice calls, domain sharing,
and coexistence of multiple UC environments.

cloud-based service, NextPlane solutions deliver UC agnostic federation
across all modes of communications including instant messaging,
multi-user chat, persistent chat rooms, Web conferencing, and voice
communications.

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft plans for cable package on Xbox&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Considering enhanced TV package for cable partners&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Also exploring possibility of individual channels&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Yinka Adegoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has
held talks with media companies to license TV networks for a
new online pay-television subscription service through devices
such as its Xbox video game console, two people familiar with
the plans told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software giant's possible push into the television
business comes as Google Inc (GOOG.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and
Netflix have jostled for a seat at the table of television's
future -- a main topic of discussion at the Reuters Global
Media Summit to be held this week. [ID:nN26129622]
(here)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The maker of the Windows operating system has proposed a
range of possibilities in these early talks including creating
a "virtual cable operator" delivered over the Internet for
which users pay a monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other options include using the Xbox to authenticate
existing cable subscribers to watch shows with enhanced
interactivity similar to how pay TV operators have sought to do
over the Web, said these people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is also exploring the possibility of creating
content silos and selling more individual channels directly
such as an HBO or Showtime. It already has Walt Disney Co's
(DIS.N) ESPN on the XBox Live online service for example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These people said a service may not arrive for another 12
months, but early discussions have been productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it does not comment on rumor or speculation.
The people involved in the talks asked not to identified as the
discussions were confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of Microsoft's plans come as the pay-television
industry has sought to allay investor concerns that consumers
are fleeing expensive subscription packages for cheaper online
services operated by companies such as Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) and
Hulu, which both charge $7.99 per month for streamed shows and
movies. The phenomenon is called "cord-cutting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worry is that so-called over-the-top services could
undermine the lucrative cable TV industry, whose dual-revenue
stream model -- cable networks such as ESPN are paid carriage
fees by pay TV operators and also earn revenue from advertisers
-- has made pay-TV one of the most resilient sectors during the
economic recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But programmers would welcome new types of competition to
the cable and satellite companies, senior media executives
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the more competition the better, we will price
and package it in such a way that we still make the dual
revenue stream," said one of the people who spoke to Reuters.
"We could probably charge more for interactive advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has long held ambitions to be a major player in
the TV business and has previously invested in interactive
television initiatives including Web TV and MSN TV set-top box
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its latest plans include offering interactivity to engage
viewers through social media, interactive advertising and
motion control technology, say people who have seen early
demonstrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has bet on new "gesture" technology that lets
users of its Xbox, who buy a camera accessory called the
Kinect, control on-screen functions using voice to launch
channels and waving arms to fast-forward or rewind videos on
ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Redmond, Washington, company is said to be mulling
feedback it has received from programmers including the expense
of such a plan but it is not likely to roll out a service in
the next 12 months, said one person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market to determine the future of television
distribution and technology has accelerated over the past
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google has already launched Google TV, an enhanced Web-TV
service with partners including Sony Corp (6758.T) televisions
and Logitech set-top boxes. While Google has also announced
Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) Turner Networks as a programming
partner, it is not yet planning to offer a full suite of cable
networks in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple has also held talks with programmers, but faced
resistance industry-wide over its plans to offer a lower-cost
subscription TV plan, people familiar with the talks have said.
Apple has begun to offer 99-cent TV show rentals for a limited
number shows through News Corp's (NWSA.O) Fox and Disney.

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The new business environment calls for a heightened understanding of 
      cultural and ethnic drivers&#8221;, says John Lewis, Senior Managing Counsel - 
      Litigation at The Coca-Cola Company. Diversity in the legal workforce 
      would give Counsel the full range of viewpoints necessary for superior 
      decision-making in a highly globalized business setting. A speaker at 
      the marcus evans Chief 
      Litigation Officer Summit Spring 2011 in Hollywood, Florida,

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Why do you consider diversity in the legal team to be critical?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      John Lewis: &#8220;In the US there is an unprecedented demographic shift 
      underway, with &#8220;minority&#8221; groups such as Latinos and Asians continuing 
      to grow in size, visibility, and economic and political clout. Increased 
      globalization, an emerging middle class in the BRIC countries and 
      different economic and political factors are changing the face of 
      business. Together with the proliferation of technology, the Web and 
      social media will add to the complexity of practicing law and defending litigation 
      risks in large companies. This will require heightened understanding of 
      cultural and ethnic drivers, and looking at risks through different 
      lenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      As we move into the 21st century business environment, we have to be 
      purposeful, and change the way we seek and recruit talent. Legal 
      Counsel have to look in non-traditional places to find people with 
      different competencies, backgrounds and language skills. Talent should 
      be diverse in terms of gender, generation and ethnicity. This will 
      ensure the full spectrum of viewpoints at the decision-making table.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How does diversity fit into your legal team?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      John Lewis: &#8220;Diversity is one of the lens through which we approach 
      legal and business problems. It informs how we deal with government 
      entities, regulatory agencies, business constituencies, business 
      partners and other stakeholders. Diversity has become part of the 
      calculus that determines how we manage risks and make decisions. Risks 
      come from a host of different backgrounds so a diverse legal team helps 
      us make better informed decisions. Our team is reflective of the 
      consumer base that our company serves. Not taking that into account 
      would be a significant long-term strategic mistake.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			What is the best way of aligning diversity goals to business goals?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      John Lewis: &#8220;Managing a diverse team requires some additional level of 
      focus and cultural intelligence. That includes taking into account 
      factors based on religion, ethnicity, and what motivates or de-motivates 
      a team from achieving desired goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is important to listen to and value different perspectives. For 
      instance, while young lawyers might bring additional perspective on 
      technology and social media, more seasoned colleagues bring experience 
      and perspective based on past history. Having both at the decision 
      making table is not just about generation diversity but also enables the 
      most well rounded and robust thinking to a given question. The key is to 
      listen and leverage the talents of everyone on the team in order to 
      arrive at the best solution. A 360-degree approach in decision-making, 
      better positions our company for achieving business goals.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
			JAKKS Pacific Launches Kinectimals Plush Toys for Microsoft&#8217;s 
      Kinect for Xbox 360
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JAKKS Pacific, Inc. (Nasdaq: JAKK) announced a licensing agreement with 
      Microsoft to design and manufacture interactive plush toys - beginning 
      with a King Cheetah and Maltese Tiger - that integrate with the 
      &#8220;Kinectimals&#8221; video game for Kinect&#8482; for Xbox 360&#174; entertainment system 
      that launched worldwide this month. In addition, JAKKS will produce a 
      mainline plush assortment, which is expected to be sold at mass 
      retailers in the U.S. starting in Spring 2011 and is slated to feature 
      five unique plush animals in the first wave.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Limited collector&#8217;s editions of the &#8220;Kinectimals&#8221; game packaged with a 
      7&#8221; plush toy are now available at select retailers around the globe. In 
      the U.S., Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us&#174; will exclusively sell the King Cheetah limited 
      collector&#8217;s edition and GameStop&#174; will exclusively carry the Maltese 
      Tiger limited collector&#8217;s edition. Both sell for $59.99 (US ERP).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JAKKS limited collector&#8217;s edition &#8220;Kinectimals&#8221; plush toys work with 
      Microsoft Tag (mtag) technology, allowing players to scan the tag on 
      their plush toy with the Kinect for Xbox 360 sensor and watch the King 
      Cheetah or Maltese Tiger appear in the game. With their very own plush 
      pals, players can keep their new friends with them even when they&#8217;re 
      away from their Xbox 360s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jack McGrath, Executive Vice President, Operations for JAKKS Pacific, 
      stated, &#8220;We are excited to launch an interactive product based on one of 
      the Kinect for Xbox 360 launch titles and pioneer a new way of gameplay.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Kinectimals&#8221; invites children, their parents and animal lovers of all 
      ages to build lasting friendships with some of the world&#8217;s most exotic 
      creatures. Players embark on a journey of discovery with their pets 
      using full body movement, voice commands and gestures, made possible by 
      the controller-free magic of Kinect for Xbox 360. Just like real pets, 
      animals will come running when they hear the player&#8217;s voice, respond to 
      commands* like &#8220;jump,&#8221; &#8220;roll-over&#8221; and &#8220;play dead,&#8221; and purr with joy 
      when they are scratched behind the ears.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The &#8220;Kinectimals&#8221; journey begins when players adopt and name one of five 
      playful feline friends and set out to discover the island they live on. 
      As they journey with their cub to solve the &#8220;Legend of Felis Aurum&#8221; (the 
      Gold Cat), they will unlock six more animals. The standalone 
      &#8220;Kinectimals&#8221; game sells for $49.99 (US SRP). For $59.99, the limited 
      collector&#8217;s editions allow players to add a choice of two additional 
      furry friends &#8211; an exclusive Maltese Tiger or King Cheetah &#8211; to the game.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our goal with &#8216;Kinectimals&#8217; was to create a game where players could 
      form a strong emotional bond with animals, so we thought it would be a 
      great extension to have a physical version of our adorable cubs that 
      people could take home, play with and collect,&#8221; said Jorg Neumann, 
      Studio Manager for Kinect games. &#8220;JAKKS was the perfect partner to 
      create the type of plush toys we felt contained the same high quality 
      and emotional value we focused on in the game. We couldn&#8217;t be happier 
      with the end product.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in
Torrance, California, returned to normal operations on Tuesday
after completing the restart of a unit shut on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  Exxon has declined to identify the unit, but West Coast
traders said the refinery's 100,000-bpd gasoline-producing
fluidic catalytic cracking unit was the unit shut on Friday by
a mechanical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Exxon had been restarting the multiple units at the
refinery last week following a mid-week power outage when the
FCC problem was found.

&lt;p&gt; * Mediation is set for Thursday in contract talks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Talks affect 27,000 full-time workers in central Florida
 (Adds Disney comment on employee health plan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Barbara Liston&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ORLANDO, Fla., Nov 30 (Reuters) - The largest union
representing workers at Walt Disney World (DIS.N) has produced
a documentary critical of wages and benefits at the Orlando
theme park intended to increase pressure on the company to
raise its hourly wage offer in current contract negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The documentary, titled "Mouse Trapped 2010," was scheduled
to premiere at a union meeting on Tuesday. A trailer for the
documentary can be seen here&lt;p&gt; In it, an employee identified as Doug in the Animal Kingdom
said on camera, "For me and my family to survive, we have to go
to the churches. We have to go to the church and we get
handouts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bryan in the Transportation and Ticketing Center said in
the documentary, "I can work for 50 hours a week and bring home
$165 because of my insurance and other deductions that come out
of my check."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's about putting pressure on the company in advance of
mediation. This is us yelling a little louder," said Eric
Clinton, president of UniteHere Local 362, one of six unions
under the umbrella Service Trades Council negotiating a new
42-month contract for 27,000 full-time workers at the theme
park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covered employees -- who include bus drivers, waiters,
custodians, parking attendants and front desk staff --
currently are working under an extension of their old contract,
which expired on Oct. 2. Clinton said workers in his union on
average are paid $10 an hour. Mediation is set for Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger said the company, central
Florida's largest employer, is standing by its original offer
-- voted down by the union -- of 3 percent raises each of the
next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're maintaining it's a fair and competitive offer,"
Finger told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clinton said, however, that Disney also wants to increase
the health insurance premiums paid by employees by more than
the pay raise, with the result that workers would wind up with
a net loss of 8 cents per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The only way to avoid the loss, Clinton said, would be for
workers to step down to a cheaper "value" health insurance
program that Disney is offering, which he said would cover
catastrophic medical conditions but not typical doctor visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finger said some employees might need to scale back their
health coverage to avoid a drop in take-home pay but insisted
most could keep their existing plan and still see a raise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An overwhelming majority of cast members will get more pay
at the end of three years," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The union wants workers to at least break even and hopes
for a net raise of 10 cents an hour or more, Clinton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know the federal government is operating at a deficit,"

&lt;p&gt; * Hertz pleads guilty to one count of wire fraud&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Eighth guilty plea in long-running probe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Nov 30 (Reuters) - A former JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM.N) vice president, James Hertz, has pleaded guilty to
bid rigging and fraud in investment contracts for municipal
monies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Justice Department said that Hertz pleaded guilty to
one count of wire fraud, and agreed to cooperate with its
investigation into accusations that companies decided in
advance which investment house would win the auctions of
guaranteed investment contracts, which cities and counties buy
with the proceeds from municipal bond sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Often, there is a delay between when bonds are floated and
when the money is actually paid out, allowing some time to
invest it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Justice Department said that from 1994 to 2007, Hertz
would market investment agreements and other contracts. The
department said that Hertz and others engaged in bid-rigging
from at least 2001 to 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Hertz and co-conspirators also agreed to submit
intentionally losing bids for investment agreements or other
municipal finance contracts that were steered to other
financial institutions, giving the false appearance that these
deals had been bid competitively," the department added in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hertz is the eighth person to plead guilty in the
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Three others who pleaded guilty worked for CDR Financial
Products, also known as Rubin/Chambers, Dunhill Insurance
Services Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two CDR employees and one former employee were indicted in
October 2009 and charged with participating in bid-rigging and
fraud. Their trial has been set for September 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One person who pleaded guilty had worked for UBS AG
(UBSN.VX), another worked for Bank of America (BAC.N) while
others worked for Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC),
GE Trinity Plus (GE.N) and Financial Security Assurance (FSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Kenneth Barry)

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - The largest union representing workers at Walt Disney World has produced a documentary critical of wages and benefits at the Orlando theme park intended to increase pressure on the company to raise its hourly wage offer in current contract negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documentary, titled "Mouse Trapped 2010," was scheduled to premiere at a union meeting on Tuesday. A trailer for the documentary can be seen here&lt;p&gt;In it, an employee identified as Doug in the Animal Kingdom said on camera, "For me and my family to survive, we have to go to the churches. We have to go to the church and we get handouts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryan in the Transportation and Ticketing Center said in the documentary, "I can work for 50 hours a week and bring home $165 because of my insurance and other deductions that come out of my check."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's about putting pressure on the company in advance of mediation. This is us yelling a little louder," said Eric Clinton, president of UniteHere Local 362, one of six unions under the umbrella Service Trades Council negotiating a new 42-month contract for 27,000 full-time workers at the theme park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Covered employees -- who include bus drivers, waiters, custodians, parking attendants and front desk staff -- currently are working under an extension of their old contract, which expired on October 2. Clinton said workers in his union on average are paid $10 an hour. Mediation is set for Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney spokeswoman Andrea Finger said the company, central Florida's largest employer, is standing by its original offer, which the union voted down, of 3 percent raises each of the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're maintaining it's a fair and competitive offer," Finger told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton said, however, that Disney also wants to increase the health insurance premiums paid by employees by more than the pay raise, with the result that workers would wind up with a net loss of 8 cents per hour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only way to avoid the loss, Clinton said, would be for workers to step down to a cheaper "value" health insurance program that Disney is offering, which he said would cover catastrophic medical conditions but not typical doctor visits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton said the union wants workers to at least break even and hopes for a net raise of 10 cents an hour or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know the federal government is operating at a deficit," Clinton said, reacting to the recently announced federal employee wage freezes.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Nov 30 (Reuters) - The chief executive officer of
Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) will receive an 8 percent increase in
salary next year, while his bonus will jump 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon's CEO, Rex Tillerson, was granted a bonus of $3.36
million, up sharply from his bonus of $2.4 million paid in
2009, according to a regulatory filing with the U.S Securities
and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half of the bonus will be paid in cash by the end of 2010,
while the balance will be linked to quarterly earnings per
share performance, the filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executive, who runs the world's largest publicly traded
oil and gas company, will be paid a salary of $2.39 million in
2011, up from $2.2 million this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's board of directors also granted Tillerson 225,000
shares of restricted stock. Half the shares may not be sold for
five years, and the balance must be held for 10 years, the
filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Irving, Texas-based Exxon shares closed at $69.56
on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The shares have
risen 2 percent so far this year, underperforming a nearly 5.6
percent gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. .DJI

      the early tender date, will receive the total consideration, which 
      includes an early tender premium of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount

      notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who tender their notes before 
      the early tender date may not withdraw their notes after the early

      Offer will receive the tender offer consideration, which is the total

      to Purchase dated November 4, 2010, as supplemented on November 16, 
      2010, and the related Letter of Transmittal. The Maximum Tender Offer is 
      conditioned upon satisfaction of certain conditions described in the

 HOUSTON, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Gulf Coast gasoline climbed 1.5
cents a gallon on Tuesday on news a gasoline-producing fluidic
catalytic cracking unit malfunctioned at Chevron Corp's (CVX.N)
330,000-barrels-per-day refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc computer programer charged with theft of valuable speed-trading code did not, and could not, harm Wall Street's most influential bank, his lawyer told a jury on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But a federal prosecutor told jurors Sergey Aleynikov stole critical parts of Goldman's top-secret high-frequency trading program because he would earn hundreds of thousands of dollars more using the code at another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, 40, is on trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on charges of trade secrets theft, accused of uploading Goldman's proprietary code and storing it on a website. Prosecutors say he planned to use the code to help his new employer, Teza Technologies LLC in Chicago, build a high-frequency trading system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I predict you will not hear one word of evidence that Sergey Aleynikov had any intention to harm Goldman Sachs in any way, shape or form," defense lawyer Kevin Marino told the 12 jurors and five alternates in opening statements. "Nor could he have interfered with Goldman's right to the code."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-frequency trading, or high-speed automated trading, has become an increasingly important and competitive business. The closely-guarded computer codes help firms trade shares in milliseconds and earns millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had asked Judge Denise Cote to close parts of the trial to protect Goldman's trade secrets, but she said she would consider the issues as they came up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marino said in his opening statement that Aleynikov told the FBI after his July 2009 arrest he had copied Goldman directories that were loaded with "open source code," which no person or firm has proprietary control over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Aleynikov mistakenly violated a confidentiality agreement he had as a Goldman Sachs employee, but criminal prosecution was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was a breach of confidentiality, he shouldn't have done it," Marino said.

&lt;p&gt; * Case about programmer's theft and greed - prosecutor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Aleynikov had no criminal intent to harm bank - defense&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Trial over speed-trading code secrets to last 3 weeks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
computer programmer charged with theft of valuable
speed-trading code did not, and could not, harm Wall Street's
most influential bank, his lawyer told a jury on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a federal prosecutor told jurors that Sergey Aleynikov
stole critical parts of Goldman's top-secret high-frequency
trading program because he would earn hundreds of thousands of
dollars more using the code at another company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov, 40, is on trial in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan on charges of trade secrets theft, accused of
uploading Goldman's proprietary code and storing it on a
website. He is also accused of planning to use the code to help
his new employer, Teza Technologies LLC, build a high-frequency
trading start-up in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I predict you will not hear one word of evidence that
Sergey Aleynikov had any intention to harm Goldman Sachs in any
way, shape or form," defense lawyer Kevin Marino told the jury
of 12 and five alternates in opening statements. "Nor could he
have interfered with Goldman's right to the code."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marino said Aleynikov told the FBI after his July 2009
arrest that he had copied directories from the Goldman system
that were loaded with "open source" code, which no person or
firm has proprietary control over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Aleynikov breached a confidentiality agreement he
had as a Goldman Sachs Group Inc employee and this was a
mistake, but criminal prosecution was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High-frequency trading, or high-speed automated trading,
has become an increasingly important and competitive business,
generating millions in profits for banks and brokerages. The
computer codes that help firms trade shares in milliseconds are
closely guarded secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal prosecutor Joseph Facciponti said in his opening
statement that Aleynikov put the code on a storage website and
also copied it onto a flash drive and other computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facciponti said "the evidence will show that he thought he
had found a foolproof way of getting around the security
barriers" at Goldman Sachs by using the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facciponti said that at Teza Technologies, Aleynikov stood
to earn about three times the $400,000 he was paid annually by
Goldman Sachs as one of its highest-paid computer programmers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov, an immigrant from Russia who became a U.S.
citizen, has been free on bail since his arrest. If convicted,
he faces a maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years on two
criminal counts. The judge, prosecutors and defense have agreed
to allow three weeks for the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. prosecutors had asked Judge Denise Cote to close parts
of the trial to protect Goldman's trade secrets, but she said
at a pretrial hearing that she would consider the issues as
they came up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is USA v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York, No. 10-96.

      Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation, and his wife Renda, presented the Children&#8217;s 
      Advocacy Center for Denton County (CACDC) with a $50,000 grant to 
      support its work serving Denton County and area residents with 
      counseling for victims of abuse, child abuse prevention programs and 
      interagency collaboration to keep communities safe by holding offenders 
      accountable for their crimes against children. CACDC is the fifth 
      nonprofit organization to receive ExxonMobil&#8217;s annual Chairman&#8217;s Gift.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is an honor to present the Children&#8217;s Advocacy Center for Denton 
      County with the Chairman&#8217;s Gift this year,&#8221; Tillerson said today at a 
      ceremony at the agency. &#8220;We look forward to seeing the impact this gift 
      will have on the organization and, in turn, the children who will be 
      given a voice and safe haven because of the services it will provide.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CACDC is a nonprofit agency that strives to minimize the trauma of child 
      abuse through a team approach to the investigation, prosecution and 
      treatment of serious child abuse cases. This approach consolidates law 
      enforcement, Child Protective Services, prosecutors, therapists, medial 
      professionals and volunteers in one location. In the past 10 years, the 
      number of clients served increased by nearly 40 percent and the 
      conviction rate for those who committed a crime against a child in 
      Denton County went from 20 percent to nearly 77 percent. In 1996, the 
      year before the agency was established, the conviction rate was eight 
      percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Tillersons toured the facilities with Dan Leal, executive director 
      of the Children&#8217;s Advocacy Center for Denton County. The center includes 
      therapy, interview and medical rooms, the walls are decorated with 
      colorful murals and the rooms filled with stuffed animals for children 
      to choose from when they are finished interviewing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are so grateful to Mr. Tillerson and ExxonMobil for this generous 
      donation,&#8221; said Leal. &#8220;Every year the number of cases we see increases, 
      and with that increase comes rising costs. This grant will allow us to 
      keep up with those expenses while providing justice and healing to every 
      child in need.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tillerson established the Chairman&#8217;s Gift in 2006 to provide a local 
      nonprofit organization with a donation during the holiday season. Since 
      the gift&#8217;s inception, Tillerson has selected St. 
      Philip&#8217;s School and Community Center, Lena 
      Pope Home, Vogel 
      Alcove, Irving 
      Cares and the Children&#8217;s Advocacy Center for Denton County as 
      recipients.

			J.P. Morgan to Drive Growth of Health Savings Account Business 
      Through New Nationwide Broker Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			J.P. Morgan Supplements Existing National Sales Team with Turn-Key, 
      Dedicated Support for Brokers and Third Party Administrators
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan Treasury Services, one of the largest administrators of 
      Health Savings Accounts (HSA) in the United States, today announced that 
      it is expanding its nationwide sales drive by launching an HSA broker 
      program. In response to market demand, J.P. Morgan will provide brokers 
      and third party administrators (TPAs) with a dedicated service and 
      support unit. J.P. Morgan currently serves more than 550,000 HSA account 
      holders, supports more than 10,000 employers and manages deposits 
      approaching $1 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of its new program, J.P. Morgan provides access to 
      administrative, marketing, education and sales tools to facilitate 
      brokers in their dialogue with clients. J.P. Morgan assists brokers with 
      their proposals to clients, and provides detailed cost estimates and the 
      relevant statistical data needed to support sales efforts. Once a client 
      is up and running, J.P. Morgan continues to provide support to help 
      ensure the ongoing success of each program, as well as updates on any 
      pending changes to HSA regulations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For small and mid-sized companies, J.P. Morgan offers streamlined, 
      easy-to-implement HSA programs that can be set up in as little as five 
      days. J.P. Morgan also offers more customizable plans for TPAs and large 
      companies
			with more complex benefit needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Over the past year, J.P. Morgan has seen a significant increase in the 
      number of brokers and third party administrators looking to work 
      directly with us to provide best-in-class HSA programs to small and 
      large employers nationwide,&#8221; said David Josephs, Managing Director, J.P. 
      Morgan Treasury Services. &#8220;We are pleased to offer a new level of 
      service for brokers and TPAs as businesses continue to see the value in 
      offering Health Savings Accounts to their employees.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan has successfully worked with a number of brokers over the 
      past year during the pilot phase of this program. One is Denver-based 
      Gundzik  Associates, Inc. which has been providing its clients with 
      employee and executive benefits products since 1973 and has worked with 
      J.P. Morgan since 2009. According to Michael J. Gundzik, &#8220;Teaming with 
      J.P. Morgan enables me to offer a quality brand to clients and the 
      ability to pair the HSA with High Deductible Health Plans from any 
      insurance company. My clients don&#8217;t have to switch HSA administrators 
      just because they switch health plans. I can count on J.P. Morgan&#8217;s 
      broker service unit to answer any questions I have on enrollment or 
      funding, and help get my clients up and running in just a few days.&#8221;

			Wal-Mart to Buy 51% of Massmart
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE: WMT) 
      today announced its intention to acquire a 51% stake in the South 
      African based consumer goods distributor Massmart Holdings Ltd. Wal-Mart 
      has offered Massmart $2.4 billion (17 billion rand) or 148 rand per 
      Massmart share, reflecting a 19.2% premium over the company&#8217;s 30-day 
      moving average price. The deal is subject to regulatory approvals. 
      However, Massmart shares will continue to trade on the Johannesburg 
      Stock Exchange.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In September 2010, Wal-Mart had initially announced its intention to buy 
      Massmart. The proposed acquisition is in line with Wal-Mart&#8217;s policy to 
      accelerate growth and improve returns in its international business 
      segment. Management believes that Africa is among the high growth 
      developing markets of the world. Management states that the acquisition 
      of Massmart will offer Wal-Mart a convincing growth opportunity, as 
      South Africa comprises attractive market dynamics, encouraging 
      demographic trends and a growing economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Johannesburg-based Massmart is not only a leading distributor of 
      consumer goods in Africa and but is also the largest retailer of general 
      merchandise, liquor, home improvement equipment and supplies as well as 
      the leading wholesaler of basic foods. The company currently operates 
      288 stores in 14 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The company also has 
      nine wholesale and retail chains and one buying group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wal-Mart&#8217;s anti-union policies could see some headwind, since Massmart 
      has a strong labor union, which has threatened to go on strike if 
      required to underscore the position of labor at the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rothschild and J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) 
      are the joint financial advisors for Wal-Mart while Deutsche Bank (NYSE: 
      DB) and Goldman 
      Sachs (NYSE: GS) 
      are the joint financial advisors for Massmart.

			Anadarko Finds Gas in Mozambique
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Oil and natural gas exploration and production company, Anadarko 
      Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: APC), 
      announced that it has made another discovery of natural gas in the 
      Offshore Area 1 of Mozambique's Rovuma Basin at the Lagosta prospect.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the third major discovery for Anadarko in this region. The 
      discovery well encountered a total of more than 550 net feet of natural 
      gas play in multiple high-quality Oligocene and Eocene sands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Anadarko is working in a partnership with five other players in the 
      Offshore Area 1 of Mozambique and has a 36.5% working interest. The 
      working interest of the other players ranges from Cove Energy Mozambique 
      Rovuma Offshore Ltd. (8.5% working interest) to Mitsui EP Mozambique 
      Area 1, Limited (20% working interest).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The exploration wells, drilled at a total depth of approximately 13,850 
      feet, encountered about 5,080 feet of water. The partnership is planning 
      to drill further at a total depth of 15,900 feet to evaluate the 
      prospects at a deeper zone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new Lagosta discovery is located 16 miles to the south of the 
      Barquentine discovery and 14 miles to the southeast of the Windjammer 
      discovery. After completing the work on Lagosta, the partnership is 
      planning to mobilize the rig 17.5 miles to the southwest to drill the 
      Tubarao exploration well, which is also located in the 2.6-million-acre 
      Offshore Area 1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company continues to boost its existing reserves through the finding 
      of oil and gas in areas it has a working interest. Recently, the company 
      announced a 135-net feet of oil play in offshore Sierra Leone. Another 
      recent discovery was a 416-net feet of natural gas play, in the Offshore 
      Area 1 of Mozambique's Rovuma Basin, discovered on October 19, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Anadarko currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating). We 
      maintain a Neutral rating on the stock.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has sold more than 2.5 million of its controller-free Kinect video game systems worldwide only 25 days after launch, the world's largest software company said, keeping it on track to hit its target of 5 million sales this holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, Nov 30 (MARKET WIRE) --

    Jauvin joined N-able as COO in June 2010, and is credited with
incorporating a new level of innovation and next generation IT automation

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Nov 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The U.S. online retail sector delivered strong growth on Cyber Monday
2010 compared to the same period last year, according to powerful
analytics-based findings by IBM (NYSE: IBM). IBM's findings expand on the
company's earlier report that Black Friday 2010 delivered double-digit
growth over 2009, and its forecast that in-store sales of consumer
electronics and appliances in U.S. retail stores would get an early start
this year, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November. 

    Delivered as part of Coremetrics, an IBM Company's third annual Cyber
Monday Benchmark Report, the analysis of the online retail sector reveals
the following trends as of 12 a.m. PST:

    Cyber Monday 2010 Compared to Black Friday 2010


--  Consumer Spending Increases: Online sales were up 31.1 percent, with
    consumers pushing the average order value (AOV) up from $190.80 to
    $194.89 for an increase of 2.1 percent.
--  Luxury Goods Continue Comeback: Jewelry retailers reported a
    significant jump of 60.3 percent in sales.
--  Social Shopping: The growing trend of consumers using their networks
    on social sites for information about deals and inventory levels
    continued on Cyber Monday. While the percentage of visitors arriving
    from social network sites is fairly small relative to all online
    visitors -- nearly 1 percent -- it is gaining momentum, with Facebook
    dominating the space.
--  Mobile Shopping: Consumers continue to use mobile as a shopping tool.
    On Cyber Monday, 3.9 percent of people visited a retailer's site using
    a mobile device.

    

Cyber Monday 2010 Compared to Cyber Monday 2009 (year/year):


--  Consumer Spending Increases: Online sales were up 19.4 percent, with
    consumers pushing the average order value (AOV) up from $180.03 to
    $194.89 for an increase of 8.3 percent.
--  Luxury Goods Report Big Gains: Affluent shoppers opened their wallets
    wide, driving sales of luxury goods up 24.3 percent over 2009.
--  Shopping Peaks at 9:00 am PST/Noon EST: Consumers flocked online, with
    shopping momentum hitting its peak at 9:00 am PST/noon EST. But
    consumer shopping maintained stronger momentum throughout the day than
    on Cyber Monday 2009.

    

"Cyber Monday came in as the biggest shopping day of the year so
far," said John Squire, chief strategy officer, IBM Coremetrics.
"Consumers this year appear much more willing to open their wallets and
are turning to online stores for the convenience of shopping wherever and
whenever they like, but also as their primary source of information about
products and inventory levels. Retailers have done an exceptional job
across the board of appealing to consumers with highly personalized
promotions and a slew of free shipping promotions." 

    According to an analytics-based forecast from IBM's Global Business
Services division, in-store sales in the consumer electronics and
appliances sector are expected to increase 3.5 percent this year compared
to last, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November.
U.S. consumers have been increasing their savings relative to disposable
income, from 2 percent in 2007 to nearly 6 percent today, leading to
strong pent-up demand this holiday season for consumer electronics and
appliances, both of which are typically seen as necessities in the
present-day economy.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Nov 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The U.S. online retail sector delivered strong growth on Cyber Monday
2010 compared to the same period last year, according to powerful
analytics-based findings by IBM (NYSE: IBM). IBM's findings expand on the
company's earlier report that Black Friday 2010 delivered double-digit
growth over 2009, and its forecast that in-store sales of consumer
electronics and appliances in U.S. retail stores would get an early start
this year, with consumers spending a larger-than-usual share in November. 

    Delivered as part of Coremetrics, an IBM Company's third annual Cyber
Monday Benchmark Report, the analysis of the online retail sector reveals
the following trends as of 12 a.m. PST:

    Cyber Monday 2010 Compared to Black Friday 2010


--  Consumer Spending Increases: Online sales were up 31.1 percent, with
    consumers pushing the average order value (AOV) up from $190.80 to
    $194.89 for an increase of 2.1 percent.
--  Luxury Goods Continue Comeback: Jewelry retailers reported a
    significant jump of 60.3 percent in sales.
--  Social Shopping: The growing trend of consumers using their networks
    on social sites for information about deals and inventory levels
    continued on Cyber Monday. While the percentage of visitors arriving
    from social network sites is fairly small relative to all online
    visitors -- nearly 1 percent -- it is gaining momentum, with Facebook
    dominating the space.
--  Mobile Shopping: Consumers continue to use mobile as a shopping tool.
    On Cyber Monday, 3.9 percent of people visited a retailer's site using
    a mobile device.

    

Cyber Monday 2010 Compared to Cyber Monday 2009 (year/year):


--  Consumer Spending Increases: Online sales were up 19.4 percent, with
    consumers pushing the average order value (AOV) up from $180.03 to
    $194.89 for an increase of 8.3 percent.
--  Luxury Goods Report Big Gains: Affluent shoppers opened their wallets
    wide, driving sales of luxury goods up 24.3 percent over 2009.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			NCCN Receives $2.1 Million in Oncology Research Funding from Pfizer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NCCN recently received a $2.1 million research grant from Pfizer to gain 
      further insights into the use of the investigational compound Axitinib 
      in various tumor types. Investigators from NCCN Member Institutions are 
      eligible to apply for the research funding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#174; (NCCN&#174;) 
      has been awarded a $2.1 million grant from Pfizer to develop a program 
      to scientifically evaluate and define the clinical activity of axitinib 
      in various tumor types.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The funding not only helps accelerate potentially life-saving research 
      in the field of cancer, but also creates a collaborative opportunity for 
      investigators from NCCN 
      Member Institutions,&#8221; said William T. McGivney, PhD, Chief Executive 
      Officer, NCCN. &#8220;NCCN is committed to enhancing cancer care by evaluating 
      new investigational agents such as axitinib to determine their full 
      potential in treating several types of cancer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first phase of the program will involve the establishment of an NCCN 
      Axitinib Request for Proposals Development Team to evaluate existing 
      data and to discuss and define the types of studies necessary to further 
      evaluate the activity of axitinib in solid tumors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Axitinib is an oral and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial 
      growth factor receptors (VEGF) I, II and III which may play roles in 
      tumor growth, vascular angiogenesis and metastatic progression of 
      cancer. Axitinib has been tested in various phase I, II and III trials 
      including thyroid cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and advanced renal 
      cell carcinoma. An additional phase II trial in HCC is underway. Pfizer 
      recently announced that the global randomized phase III AXIS 1032 trial 
      (A4061032), studying axitinib in previously treated patients with 
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC), met its primary endpoint of 
      progression free survival. Axitinib is an investigational compound.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is a privilege for us to have the opportunity to collaborate with 
      NCCN on the further evaluation of axitinib,&#8221; said Mace Rothenberg, MD, 
      Senior Vice President of Clinical Development and Medical Affairs for 
      Pfizer&#8217;s Oncology Business Unit. &#8220;Partnerships like this are vitally 
      important in cancer research. By working collaboratively across the 
      scientific community, Pfizer Oncology hopes to add to the broader 
      understanding of new medications and to further our shared goal of 
      improving the outlook for cancer patients worldwide.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The NCCN 
      Oncology Research Program (ORP) facilitates all phases of clinical 
      research by identifying clinical investigators and initiating trials at 
      NCCN Member Institutions. The ORP draws on the expertise of 
      investigators at 21 of the world&#8217;s leading cancer centers and 
      establishes collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotech companies in 
      order to advance therapeutic options for patients with cancer. The ORP 
      will use the grant from Pfizer to support investigator initiated 
      clinical and correlative studies at its NCCN Member Institutions for 
      axitinib. This research grant model has been very successful in moving 
      science forward as evidenced by the many scientific articles published 
      on ORP supported research.

&lt;p&gt;
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Nov. 30, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Icagen, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ICGN) today provided an update on its sodium channel program for pain
and related disorders which is being conducted in collaboration with Pfizer. As
previously reported, the companies recently conducted a clinical study in
healthy volunteers of several collaboration compounds targeting the sodium ion
channel Nav1.7.  Based upon data obtained in this study, the companies have now
selected one of these compounds to advance into further clinical studies. The
selection of this compound has triggered a milestone payment to Icagen of $1.0
million.

P. Kay Wagoner, CEO of Icagen, stated, "We are very pleased that, in
collaboration with Pfizer, we have now selected a novel compound for further
clinical development in our Nav1.7 program.  This marks an important
achievement, as we believe, based upon a wide range of genetic and scientific
evidence, that subtype selective sodium channel blockers represent a promising
approach for the treatment of pain and related disorders. In achieving this
milestone, we feel fortunate to be working with one of the world's leading pain
research groups at Pfizer."

As previously noted, Pfizer and Icagen recently renewed and extended the
research term of their collaboration through year-end 2011. In addition to
Nav1.7, the collaboration also includes certain other sodium ion channel
targets. Pfizer will continue to fund all aspects of the collaboration,
including research and preclinical development efforts at Icagen, and has
exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize products that result from the
collaboration. Icagen is eligible to receive approximately $359 million upon
achievement of specified research, development, regulatory and commercialization
milestones for products under the collaboration, and is also eligible to receive
tiered royalties, against which the commercialization milestones are creditable,
based upon product sales.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - To damn with faint praise: The opening box office for "Tangled" during the holiday-stretched weekend represented the best for any non-Pixar animated release by Disney in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For though undeniably strong, the $68.7 million rung up by the Disney-branded movie during its first five days also serves to underscore some internecine rivalry among the studio's movie animators. And unless "Tangled" continues to outpace expectations during the length of its theatrical run, its Burbank animators will continue to struggle with the knotty problem of competing with their corporate kin at Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar's John Lasseter now helps steer creative activities at Disney Animation, so it's perhaps no surprise that there's finally a spreading sense of revitalization at Disney Animation, which like Pixar produces and releases its movies in 3D. Disney-branded animated releases have fared a bit better both critically and commercially in the past few years after a long, flaccid period for the once-proud label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a true return to greatness for Disney Animation won't mean simply matching the undeniably impressive $217 million run by "Aladdin" in 1992. It would be something more along the lines of the $317 million campaign recorded two years later by "The Lion King."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's how high the bar has been raised by Pixar in the past decade and a half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Disney bought the northern California hit factory in 2006 and began cranking out hits for its Burbank parent, the move only formalized the casting of Disney's legacy toon unit as a ne'er-do-well sibling incapable of matching the many successes of its adoptive kin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its big first frame means "Tangled" is almost certain to make back its $150 million-plus in production costs after accounting for movie theater owners' split of receipts. Whether that's enough to buff the Disney animated brand appreciably is another question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no denying that the animation guys want to restore the luster of the brand," a studio insider noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent previous Disney-branded release -- November 2009's "The Princess and the Frog" -- wooed $104 million domestically and decent reviews from critics. But with much stronger appeal among girls than boys, "Frog" was unable to hop to a more rarefied range of success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar's most recent offering? A little $415 million phenomenon called "Toy Story 3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meantime, "Tangled" faces something of a Princess problem. Featuring both a princess and a prince in its whimsical story line, "Tangled" nonetheless plays more like a movie for girls than an obvious magnet for their brothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our filmmakers have delivered a very competitive picture to the marketplace, and I expect that our audiences will totally embrace this film," Disney distribution president Chuck Viane said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essentially a retelling of the Rapunzel fable, "Tangled" might have opened during Thanksgiving weekend with more support from girls than boys, but it should broaden into more diverse appeal based on positive word-of-mouth, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having just taken my two granddaughters and my grandson to see the picture, I can see they all walked away with their different hot points," Viane said. "He especially loved the rapscallion in the movie and some other characters. But there's no question they all walked out of there with huge smiles on their faces."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, even Disney insiders acknowledge the limitations of movies based on fairy tales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, there will be a concerted shift into more modern themes with future projects. But 2002's $146 million grosser "Lilo  Stitch" shows that's no sure-fire road to mega-riches for Disney Animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At some point, Disney may just accept a lower natural water level for the Disney brand and strategically peg Pixar as its higher-end animated brand.&lt;/p&gt;
