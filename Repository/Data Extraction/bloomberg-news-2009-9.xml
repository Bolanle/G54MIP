Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world's largest
soft-drink maker, will shift some of outgoing marketing chief
Mary Minnick's responsibilities to recently promoted President
Muhtar Kent. 
Kent will oversee marketing for the Atlanta-based company
beginning March 1, Chief Executive Officer Neville Isdell, said
today in an internal memo to employees. Minnick, who was passed
over when Kent was named president and chief operating officer
in December, said last week she will leave in February to pursue
other personal and professional goals in the U.K. 
The move gives more responsibility to Kent, 54, who is
Coca-Cola's second-highest ranking executive and likely
successor to Isdell. Coca-Cola's strategy and innovation groups,
formerly overseen by Minnick, will report to Isdell. 
``As the health of our business continues to improve, the
factors that necessitated the combining of marketing, strategy
and innovation have evolved,'' Isdell, 63, said in the memo. 
The new structure allows Coca-Cola to ``increase the impact
and effectiveness of the global marketing community, while
preserving the benefits we have captured'' by previously
combining the groups, wrote Isdell, who hasn't said when he
plans to retire. 
Coca-Cola also said today Marc Mathieu, who previously
oversaw marketing for brands such as Coca-Cola, Sprite and
Fanta, will assume similar duties for noncarbonated drinks
including Dasani and Powerade. 
Shares of Coca-Cola fell 23 cents to $48.03 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They increased 20
percent last year, the biggest annual gain since 1997.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO) will go head-to-head
with PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) in Super Bowl television advertising for the
first time in almost a decade as it tries to boost sales of its
top-selling drink. 
One new ad for Coca-Cola Classic will air during
professional football's championship game along with two spots
that debuted during the television show ``American Idol,'' the
Atlanta-based company said in a statement today. Coca-Cola hasn't
run promotions during the Super Bowl since 1998. 
Advertising during television's most-watched event pits
Coca-Cola against PepsiCo as both companies try to reverse a drop
in U.S. soda sales. PepsiCo has advertised during the Super Bowl
for 21 consecutive years and will sponsor the half-time show for
the first time. 
``Coke wants back in the game,'' said Z. John Zhang,
marketing professor at the Wharton School at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``They've waited this many years to come back, so
the pressure is on them to have the louder voice.'' 
Both soft-drink makers are trying to stop declines in the
U.S., where soda consumption dropped in 2005 for the first time
in at least 15 years because of concern that sugary beverages
contribute to obesity. Coca-Cola's soft drink volume fell 1
percent in North America during the third quarter, and PepsiCo's
dropped 2 percent. 
Cost of Ads 
Coca-Cola's Super Bowl advertisements include a 60-second
spot titled ``Video Game,'' showing a character who passes out
bottles of Coca-Cola Classic to people he meets on the street.
Coca-Cola will also run a 30-second ad called ``Happiness
Factory'' that follows a bottle of Coke through an imaginary
vending machine. 
The company won't say anything about the new commercial
being made for the Super Bowl. The ads were created by
independent agency Wieden + Kennedy, based in Portland, Oregon. 
``Coca-Cola Classic has always been about having fun, and
that's what people get together to do when they watch the Super
Bowl,'' said Katie Bayne, senior vice president for Coca-Cola
brands in North America. 
Shares of Coca-Cola fell 1 cent to $48.13 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. They gained 20 percent
last year, the biggest gain since 1997. 
PepsiCo shares climbed 36 cents to $65.20. They rose 5.9
percent last year. 
Coca-Cola spokeswoman Susan McDermott wouldn't say how much
the company is spending on the game. A 30-second ad during the
Super Bowl can cost $2.5 million, according to AdWeek. Coca-
Cola's advertising budget was $2.48 billion in 2005. 
Bears vs. Colts 
More than 141 million people watched last year's Super Bowl.
This year's game, scheduled for Feb. 4 at Dolphin Stadium in
Miami Gardens, Fla., is a match-up between the Chicago Bears and
the Indianapolis Colts. 
The Super Bowl will be broadcast on CBS Corp.'s CBS network.
The television show American Idol, the most popular show on
primetime television, airs on News Corp.'s Fox network. 
In addition to the half-time show sponsorship, PepsiCo plans
to run 90 seconds of ads during the first half of the Super Bowl,
spokeswoman Nicole Bradley said. She wouldn't say how much the
company is spending, or which ads it plans to run. 
PepsiCo has a promotion featuring a sterling silver can of
Pepsi studded with diamonds, rubies and sapphires. The company
will give away the can, worth $100,000, and Super Bowl tickets
for life after the half-time show, which includes a performance
by the musician Prince. 
``We thrive on the Super Bowl spotlight. It's been a part of
our game plan for more than two decades,'' Bradley said. 
Last year, Coca-Cola sponsored a Super Bowl pre-game show
with its Full Throttle energy drink. Ads showed a semi-tractor
trailer truck mounted with an oversized can of Full Throttle
overtaking a small pickup truck with a slender can of rival
energy drink Red Bull.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world's largest
soft-drink maker, agreed to buy Fuze Beverage LLC to add more
juice, tea and energy drinks in an effort to catch up with
PepsiCo Inc. 
Coca-Cola gains a half-dozen new products including Fuze
Tea, NOS energy drinks and Fuze Slenderize, which has chromium
and amino acids that Fuze says help promote weight loss. Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola didn't disclose terms of the purchase. 
Fuze beverages may help Coca-Cola win back customers who
switched from sugary sodas to drinks such as PepsiCo's SoBe tea.
It's Coca-Cola's biggest U.S. acquisition since buying Odwalla
Inc. in 2001 for $186 million to gain protein drinks and juices,
said John Sicher, editor of industry journal Beverage Digest. 
``This represents Coke aggressively getting itself into a
better place in the noncarbonated business in the U.S.,'' Sicher
said. ``Fuze is small but growing strongly.'' 
Sicher estimated that Coca-Cola paid $225 million to $250
million for closely held Fuze. He said the Englewood Cliffs, New
Jersey-based company sold about 11.5 million cases last year, up
from 8 million cases in 2005, generating $90 million to $100
million in revenue. 
Shares of Coca-Cola rose 22 cents to $48.10 at 4:22 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They increased 20
percent last year, their biggest gain since 1997. 
Bottlers 
The Fuze purchase may help sate bottlers that had
complained about Coca-Cola falling behind PepsiCo in adding
drinks other than soda. Coca-Cola depends on soda for 80 percent
of its volume, compared with less than 20 percent for PepsiCo. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), the largest distributor, agreed
to distribute Arizona bottled teas in the U.S. last year, making
good on a promise to get new drinks from someone other than Coca-
Cola if it needed to. The bottler is 36 percent owned by Coca-
Cola. 
``This should be well-received by Coke's bottlers,'' Bill Pecoriello, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, wrote today in a note. 
Fuze was already distributed by 20 Coca-Cola bottlers
including Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United of Birmingham, Alabama,
and the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 
Only about 15 percent of Fuze's volume currently goes
through Coca-Cola bottlers, Pecoriello wrote. The Cadbury
Schweppes Bottling Group had distributed Fuze in much of the
U.S., Sicher said. 
Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, the second-largest
bottler for Coca-Cola, sells Cinnabon bottled coffee and created
a separate unit called Beverages and Beyond Brands to create or
buy drinks it wasn't getting from the soda maker. 
Coca-Cola's soda volume in the U.S. dropped by a low single
digit in 2005, while noncarbonated volume jumped 10 percent.

JPMorgan Cazenove Ltd. and Bear
Stearns Cos. will help raise up to $2 billion for a Kuwaiti
buyout fund offering international investors a way to tap oil-fueled economic growth in the Middle East and North Africa. 
Global Investment House KSCC (GI5B), Kuwait's biggest investment
bank, will open its Global Buyout Fund to investors tomorrow,
Shailesh Dash, head of the lender's strategic investment group,
said in a phone interview today from Kuwait. It aims to raise
about $1.5 billion for conventional private equity, and another
$500 million for Islamic investments. 
``This is the first time a Gulf fund has attracted two
international placement agents without giving them a role on
the fund's management board,'' Dash said. ``This region's
current account surpluses, construction boom and opening
economies are really attracting investors now.'' 
The economy of Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil
producer, will expand by 6.5 percent this year as the
government spends oil surpluses on new infrastructure, the
International Monetary Fund forecasts. Economic growth in Egypt
will accelerate to 7.5 percent this year after the government
cut taxes and tariffs to spur investment, Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif said in a Jan. 25 interview. 
The IMF expects Middle Eastern countries will earn a
combined current account surplus of $306 billion in 2007, up
from $282 billion in 2006, it says on its Web site. 
Wall Street 
JPMorgan Cazenove and Bear Stearns, Wall Street's fifth-biggest firm, join Western investors including Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
and Carlyle Group raising money to buy Middle East and North
African companies. 
Deutsche in May started a $2 billion Islamic private
equity fund for the region with Dubai's Abraaj Capital and
Bahrain's Ithmaar Bank that aims to grow investors' money by 15
percent a year. Muslim Shariah law forbids investment in
companies with high levels of debt or that are active in
proscribed businesses like gaming and alcohol sales. 
Carlyle, manager of more than $44 billion worldwide, plans
to hire 15 people to buy companies and identify potential
partners in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey, Walid Musallam, the U.S. buyout firm's regional managing director,
said in November. 
20 Percent Return 
Global Investment's 7-year fund will seek buyouts of
between $100 million and $150 million to achieve an internal
rate of return of 20 percent for its investors, according to
Dash. 
Private equity raised $432 billion globally last year, led
by buyout funds which raised $212 billion, London-based Private
Equity Intelligence Ltd. said in a Jan. 25 report. Investors
like pension funds, endowments and wealthy individuals have
poured increasing amounts of money into private equity as some
funds outperform public markets. 
Blackstone Group LP's 2002 $6.45 billion fund had annual
returns of 63 percent to July compared with an annual return of
6.3 percent in the Standard  Poor's 500 Index from 2002. 
Buyout firms typically aim to increase a company's profit
by changing managers or strategy before selling their holdings
within five years to a new buyer or to investors in an initial
stock sale. The firms raise cash from institutional investors
and use a combination of cash and loans to make purchases. The
acquired company's cash flow is then used to pay down debt. 
Global Investment manages about $1 billion of private
equity investments within a total $7.2 billion of assets under
management, according to Dash. The bank's shares closed down 1
percent to 960 fils ($3.3) in Kuwait today and have fallen by
13 percent this year.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO) Chief Executive
Officer Neville Isdell said the world's largest soft-drink maker
is ``keeping our promise'' to return the company to steady
growth by focusing on emerging markets such as China. 
Coca-Cola's profit has resumed growing after a two-year
slowdown, Isdell said today on a Webcast of the company's annual
meeting in Wilmington, Delaware. The company reported yesterday
that first-quarter profit rose 14 percent on the biggest sales
gain in more than a decade. 
``Last year, I told you the company completed the
transition, and that stabilization would be achieved in 2006,''
Isdell said. ``I said as a result of that, the company would
return to sustainable growth, and my message to you today is
that we are keeping our promise.'' 
Coca-Cola is headed for its biggest increase in annual
profit since 2003, buoyed by demand for its drinks in fast-
growing markets such as China and Brazil. Worldwide volume
increased 6 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 3.3
percent average annual gain since Isdell became CEO in 2004. 
Eleven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate the Atlanta-
based company's annual profit will jump 18 percent this year,
compared with a 4 percent gain last year and less than 1 percent
the prior year. 
Shares of Coca-Cola rose 9 cents to $51.66 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, after closing yesterday
at their highest since June 2004. The shares have gained 25
percent in the past year, compared with 13 percent for PepsiCo
Inc. 
U.S. `Problems' 
Coca-Cola is still ``working through some problems'' in
North America, its largest unit, where volume dropped 3 percent
in the first quarter after higher prices hurt soda sales. 
The company is trying to bolster sales with more
advertising and healthy drinks such as juices and teas made by
Fuze Beverage LLC, which Coca-Cola bought in March. 
Coca-Cola's soft drink volume in the U.S. dropped 1.2
percent last year, according to data by industry journal
Beverage Digest. 
The company wants to ``reinvigorate'' soda sales, Isdell
said. Coca-Cola has promoted and expanded Coca-Cola Zero, a
calorie-free drink formulated to taste like regular Coke. The
company has added a cherry-flavored version, and the drink will
be available in 40 countries by the end of this year. 
``Along the way, we will make corrections wherever we make
inevitable mistakes as we hit the bumps that occur on the
road,'' Isdell said. 
Also at the meeting, shareholders voted against proposals
seeking limits on executive pay and restricted stock grants.

Morgan Stanley (MS), the world's second-largest securities company, raised its forecast for emerging-market stocks this year on expectations for worldwide economic
growth and rising commodity prices. 
Jonathan Garner, head of global emerging-market strategy in
London, raised his year-end projection for the Morgan Stanley
Capital International Emerging Markets Index by 8.2 percent to
1,060. That represents a gain of 7.8 percent from yesterday's
close. 
The benchmark has risen 6.8 percent so far this year after
recovering from a slump that began in late February when equity
markets dropped worldwide on concerns about slowdown of the U.S.
economy. 
``The global growth story is about strengthening economies
in Japan, European Union, especially Germany and emerging
markets,'' Garner said in a telephone interview. ``It's
inappropriate to have such a U.S. centric view.'' 
A report showed today that last quarter's growth rate in the
U.S. was the weakest since the first three months of 2003,
trimmed by the slump in home construction and a bigger trade
deficit. Growth in the 12 months ended in March slowed to 2.1
percent, the weakest year-over-year gain since the second quarter
of 2003, while inflation rose. 
Garner said the slowdown is mostly led by non-traded housing
market in the world's largest economy and doesn't have a major
impact on global and emerging market stocks. 
Counterbalance 
Morgan Stanley expects the global economy to grow 4.5
percent this year, as it expects the slowdown of the U.S. economy
to be counterbalanced by reviving expansion in countries that
share euro currency, Garner said in the note. 
At the same time Morgan Stanley sees commodity prices and
prices for oil to rise above prices in 2006. Garner has
recommended buying South African basic resource stocks in his
report from March 20. 
Metals such as copper has gained 23 percent this year as
demand surged in China, the world's largest copper consumer.
Crude oil has advanced 6.6 percent so far this year. 
Garner added Dongfang Electrical Machinery Co. (600875), China's
third-biggest maker of power-generation equipment, to its list of
recommended shares and removed OAO Gazprom (GAZP), Russia's natural gas
export monopoly, citing concern about dividend yields and
earnings outlook in Russia.

A Chevron Corp. (CVX) unit that produces
about a quarter of Kazakhstan's oil will provide 7 billion cubic
meters of gas a year to the country's first ``world-scale''
petrochemical complex when it opens in 2011. 
The Chevron unit, Tengizchevroil LLP, and Kazakhstan
Petrochemical Industries signed an agreement today to supply gas
from the Tengiz field to the petrochemical complex planned in
western Kazakhstan, the state-run news agency Kazinform reported
from Atyrau. 
``The memorandum of understanding is an important milestone
in our discussions with Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries, a
demonstration of the progress made,'' Tengizchevroil said by an
e-mail. 
``Tengizchevroil and KPI have worked to outline terms for
the sales of feedstock to KPI for their planned petrochemical
facilities,'' Chevron's venture said. It gave no financial
details of the agreement. 
Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries is a venture between a
publicly traded subsidiary of KazMunaiGaz National Co., the
state-owned oil and gas company, and Sat  Co., a privately
owned Kazakh industrial company. 
Tengizchevroil's Supplies 
Tengizchevroil will supply 7 billion cubic meters of dry
gas and 550,000 tons of liquid propane to the plant, Shukhrat
Danbay, KazMunaiGaz National's executive director of refining
and petrochemicals, said in a phone interview today. The complex
will be built in 2010 and 2011, and it will buy gas at an
``acceptable price,'' he said. 
The petrochemical complex will include refineries to
process gas from the Tengiz field, and later from the Kashagan
and Karachaganak fields, all of which are being developed by
foreign-led ventures. Basell Holdings NV, the world's largest
producer of polypropylene, used to make car fenders, will help
build and manage the refineries. 
The partners also have an agreement with an Eni SpA-led
group to provide supplies of 3 billion cubic meters of dry gas
from the Kashagan field, according to the Energy Ministry's May
17 statement. Eni expects to start production in 2010 at
Kashagan, the largest discovery worldwide in the past 30 years. 
Chevron's venture plans to nearly double oil production to
550,000 barrels a day after building a $5.5 billion gas-processing plant and gas-injection system for oil extraction in
2008, TengizChevroil said in January.

The trucking industry and
congressional Democrats are trying to put the brakes on state
efforts to lease toll roads to Macquarie Bank Ltd., Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) and other private investors. 
Urged on by truckers such as U.S. Xpress Enterprises Ltd.,
House Democrats are considering withholding highway funds from
states whose leases with companies fail to meet proposed federal
standards. Critics of leasing say private investors are more
likely to raise tolls than government authorities are. Private
investors would also find it easier to fire toll collectors and
other employees. 
New federal restrictions could make investments in the $1.7
trillion of public roadways less attractive to private interests.
And the mere fact of congressional attention might have a
chilling effect on such deals, says Mike McDermott, an analyst
who works on toll-road transactions in the New York office of
Fitch Ratings Ltd., which rates debt used to finance
infrastructure. 
``Those kinds of public debates would make politicians at
the state level more cautious,'' he says. 
For states with heavily traveled roadways, lease agreements
with the likes of Macquarie and Goldman are potential windfalls
that would allow them to meet budget needs without raising taxes. 
Leasing the Turnpike 
Pennsylvania, which says it faces a $1.7 billion shortfall
in transportation funds during the next 20 years, might raise as
much as $12 billion to $18 billion by leasing the 537-mile
Pennsylvania Turnpike, according to an analysis by Morgan
Stanley. New Jersey Democratic Governor Jon Corzine, 60, is also
looking at leasing state toll roads to raise money for highway
construction and maintenance. 
Such arrangements are common in Australia, Chile, Spain and
elsewhere around the world. Sydney-based Macquarie, the world's
largest private manager of public facilities, said last month
that it raised $10 billion to buy more infrastructure assets in
Europe and North America. Those assets would be added to its
existing stakes in the Indiana Toll Road -- leased in 2006 for
$3.85 billion -- and the Chicago Skyway, leased for 99 years in
2005 for $1.83 billion. 
New York-based Goldman Sachs, the biggest U.S. securities
firm by market value, raised $6.5 billion last year for a new
fund to invest in toll roads and other infrastructure. Goldman is
one of 48 firms interested in leasing the Pennsylvania Turnpike. 
Shortchanging the Public 
Alex Doughty, a spokesman for New York-based Macquarie
Infrastructure Group, didn't respond to requests for comment.
Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment. 
House Democrats say they are concerned the public will be
shortchanged by long-term private leases. ``Public-private
partnerships need to take the public interests in mind,'' House
Transportation Committee Chairman Jim Oberstar, 72, a Minnesota
Democrat, said in a statement provided by his office. 
Oberstar's proposed guidelines for private leasing
agreements would include guarantees that states could upgrade
highways parallel to leased toll roads and protection against
price gouging by private companies. States that didn't comply
would face the loss of federal highway funds. 
Oberstar and House highways subcommittee chairman Peter DeFazio have sent letters to state officials urging them to go
slow. ``If public-private partnerships are abused, what you will
cause is a reaction on the state and federal level that will put
an end to this,'' says DeFazio, 60, an Oregon Democrat. 
A `Patronage Bastion' 
Pennsylvania Governor Edward Rendell -- like Oberstar and
DeFazio, a Democrat -- says the congressional concerns are
overblown. In his state, Rendell, 63, said in an interview, much
of the opposition to leasing the turnpike has come from
entrenched partisan interests fearing the loss of what has been a
``huge patronage bastion for both political parties.'' 
Congressional Democrats have found unlikely allies in
Chattanooga, Tennessee-based U.S. Xpress and other trucking
companies, which in the last 10 years have given about 80 percent
of their campaign donations to Republicans, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research
group. 
The growing interest in road leasing shows that ``someone's
figured out how to make a lot of money doing these deals and also
that someone, probably the users of these roads, is going to pay
exponentially,'' says former Kansas Governor Bill Graves, 54,
chief executive of the American Trucking Associations. The trade
group, based in Alexandria, Virginia, represents among others
U.S. Xpress and Overland Park, Kansas-based YRC Worldwide Inc. (YRCW),
the largest U.S. trucking company. 
Taxes Over Tolls 
The truckers' trade group says the industry pays $3 billion
to $4 billion a year in tolls now. Graves, a Republican, says the
industry would prefer higher fuel taxes to increased tolls. 
Large trucking companies typically sign long-term contracts
with customers that factor in fuel-price fluctuations. Patrick Quinn, 61, president of U.S. Xpress and chairman of the ATA, said
in an interview that private control of U.S. highways is
``unpredictable and unknown'' and could increase tolls. 
Frequent toll hikes, Quinn says, would make cost planning
difficult. ``We feel kind of comfortable with the system'' now,
he says. 
After Indiana signed its lease agreement, truck tolls on its
157-mile toll road rose 24 percent -- the first increase since
1985. They rose another 25 percent in April and are due to go up
again in 2008 and 2009. 
Benefits and Risks 
For politicians, there may be both benefits and risks in
such arrangements. Private control may free officials from being
blamed for higher tolls, says McDermott, the Fitch Ratings
analyst. They can say ``it's not me that's raising rates,'' he
says. 
On the other hand, the higher charges in Indiana helped
Democrats capture control of the state House of Representatives
and win a congressional seat in the district that straddles the
highway. 
``People thought it was done in an unfair way, and they
wanted someone who would stand up for it,'' says Democratic U.S.
Representative Joe Donnelly, 51, who ousted Republican Chris Chocola, 45. 
Matt Pierce, a spokesman for the Indiana Toll Road, says the
lease benefits motorists. ``Our primary responsibility is to the
consumers who travel the road,'' he says. ``We're selling them
time. We're selling them that ease of moving the goods.'' 
The Bush administration is backing the states' drive to get
business investment to run highways. ``Public-private
partnerships are vital to fixing this nation's mounting mobility
crisis because private investment is based on demand and not
political influence,'' Transportation Secretary Mary Peters, 58,
told a highway group in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on June 1. 
With Bush's backing, and given the financial needs of the
states, Pennsylvania's Rendell predicts more such deals in the
future. The balding governor says he'll be able to ``comb my hair
in a pompadour'' before Congress clamps down on the trend.

Shares of Johnson Electric Holdings
Ltd. (179), the maker of miniature motors used in ATMs and Ford Motor
Co. cars, had their biggest drop in more than 12 months after the
company said profit was unlikely to rise this fiscal year. 
The stock fell 6.3 percent to HK$4.73 in Hong Kong, after
slumping as much as 7.5 percent. That was the biggest fall since
April 28, 2006. The company is unlikely to increase its profit in
the year ending March 2008 because of slowing demand and rising
raw material costs, it said on June 8. 
Copper and steel prices have surged as China's economic
growth fuels demand for the metals, pushing up Johnson Electric's
costs. The company will also likely suffer from falling demand
for new vehicles in North America and Europe. 
``The guided business outlook is very disappointing,''
Credit Suisse Group analyst Kenny Lau said in a report today. The
fiscal 2008 profit forecast is 31 percent lower than the
consensus among analysts of $160 million, Lau added. 
Johnson Electric, which makes motors for adjusting
headlights and car seats, increased net income 17 percent in the
year ended March after it bought two companies to expand in
Europe and the U.S. Sales climbed 37 percent to $2.09 billion. 
The price of copper has risen 62 percent since the end of
2005 on the London Metals Exchange. Prices of hot-rolled coil
steel, an industry benchmark, have risen 4.5 percent this year in
China, according to metal research firm Beijing Antaike
Information Co. 
U.S. sales of new cars and light trucks fell 1.2 percent in
the first five months of the year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. European vehicle sales declined 0.2 percent in the
first four month of the year to 5.52 million, according to the
European Automobile Manufacturers Association.

Chevron Corp. (CVX) and PTT Exploration
and Production Pcl (PTTEP), Thailand's two biggest natural gas
producers, have got an extension on their exploration and
production contracts at some fields. 
Chevron can continue exploration and production at three
blocks in the Gulf of Thailand for another 10 years, Energy
Minister Piyasvasti Amranand said in an interview in Bangkok
today. PTT Exploration will also receive permission to develop
the Bongkot field for another 10 years, he said. The contracts
for those gas and oil fields were scheduled to expire in 2012. 
Thailand has given more areas to Chevron, PTT Exploration,
Hess Corp. and other companies to explore as part of the
government's attempt to boost domestic output of natural gas
and oil. The country imports almost all of its crude oil and
about a third of natural gas. 
``Those companies should give more time to develop those
fields as they have done a very good job in exploration and
production,'' said Piyasvasti. ``There are significant amounts
of remaining natural gas reserves in those fields that need
additional investments to be developed.'' 
Chevron may invest $8 billion in the Southeast Asian
nation should the government extend its concessions for another
10 years, the Bangkok Post reported today, citing Songpop
Polachan, deputy director of the Mineral Fuels Department. 
Chevron is working with the department to extend
production period for Blocks 10 to 13 under the existing
concessions until 2022, Nicole Hodgson, Chevron's spokeswoman
in Bangkok, said in an e-mailed response to a question today.
Hodgson declined to comment on the report about Chevron's
investment plan, saying: ``Chevron does not release forward
looking investment figures by country.'' 
Chevron, the second-biggest U.S. oil company, had invested
$11.2 billion in gas and oil exploration and production in
Thailand between 1962 and 2005, according to the company's data.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world's largest
soft-drink maker, and its Mexican bottler received antitrust
approval to buy a juice producer for $380 million with
conditions to encourage competition. 
Mexico's antitrust agency approved the purchase of Mexican
juice-maker Jugos del Valle SAB on the condition that Coca-Cola
and local bottler Coca-Cola Femsa SAB don't impose exclusivity
contracts on retailers or tie juice sales to soft-drink sales,
the regulator said in an e-mailed statement today. 
Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to buy Jugos del
Valle, Mexico's second-largest juice producer, in December to
boost non-carbonated drink sales in Latin America. The company
sells drinks under brands such as Frutsi and Bebere in Mexico
and Brazil. 
Antitrust regulators blocked the purchase in May, then
reversed themselves yesterday with the conditional approval
after the companies appealed. 
Coca-Cola owns 32 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa, which is a
unit of Fomento Economico Mexicano SA (FEMSAUBD), Latin America's largest
beverage company. 
The agency also limited exclusive sales to Fomento
Economico's OXXO stores and said refrigerators the companies
provide to small retailers must be able to display competing
drinks. The companies must also divest Jugos del Valle's soft-
drink brands, among other conditions. 
Separately today, Jugos del Valle said securities
regulators fined the company for failing to fully inform the
public during its sale to Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Femsa. 
Mexico's National Banking and Securities Commission said
the company's statements to the stock exchange before the sale
were ``insufficient.'' The commission fined the company 1.9
million pesos ($176,540), Mexico City-based Jugos del Valle
said. 
Shares of Coca-Cola rose 26 cents to $53.43 at 4:01 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. They've gained 11
percent this year. Shares of Coca-Cola Femsa increased 68
centavos, or 1.3 percent, to 51.5 pesos in Mexico.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world's largest
soda maker, will begin selling an energy drink under its Odwalla
juice line to capture more sales in the faster-growing market. 
The first variety of Odwalla Serious Energy is made with
pineapple, mango, guava and passion-fruit juices, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola said today in an e-mailed statement. The 15.2-ounce
drinks will have a suggested retail price of $3.29. 
Coca-Cola is adding more juice and tea-based beverages to
woo consumers who have cut back on soda amid obesity concerns.
Coca-Cola's energy drink sales almost doubled last year, to 17.8
million cases, led by Full Throttle and Tab Energy, according to
data from industry journal Beverage Digest. 
The company's soft-drink sales have dropped for four
straight quarters in North America. Coca-Cola Classic, the top-
selling soda, posted a 2 percent drop in volume last year to
1.76 billion cases in the U.S., according to Beverage Digest. 
The Odwalla energy drink has extracts of guarana, yerba
mate, green tea and ginseng, which the company says help
increase alertness. Some of those ingredients have naturally
occurring caffeine, although no additional caffeine is added,
Coca-Cola spokesman Ray Crockett said. 
Most energy beverages, such as those made by Red Bull GmbH
as well as Hansen Natural Corp.'s Monster Energy, use caffeine
and guarana as stimulants. 
Coca-Cola rose 53 cents, or 1 percent, to $56.40 at 4:03

Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)'s seizure medicine
Topamax helped alcoholics cut their drinking, according to
research that may lead to a new approach to fighting the
addiction. 
The study, appearing in tomorrow's Journal of the American
Medical Association, found that Topamax, also approved in the
U.S. for the treatment of migraines, helped alcoholics reduce the
number of days they spent drinking heavily. 
Topamax isn't approved for use in alcoholics and Johnson 
Johnson said today it won't conduct further trials or seek U.S.
approval for the medicine for alcohol dependency. Still, Mark
Willenbring, a director at the National Institute on Alcohol
Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda, Maryland, said that won't stop
doctors from using the drug anyway, called ``off label''
prescribing. 
``We now have very high-quality evidence that shows
efficacy. The medical world doesn't wait for the indication,''
said Willenbring, who wrote an editorial that accompanies the
study, in a telephone interview today. ``Topamax is a drug that
many physicians have used and many patients have had an
experience with because of its use in migraines.'' 
About 18 million people in the U.S. have drinking problems.
Alcohol contributes to 100,000 deaths each year, making it the
third-leading cause of preventable death in the U.S. behind
smoking and obesity, according to the National Council on
Alcoholism and Drug Dependence. 
Brain Chemicals 
Topamax is thought to restore balance in the levels of
chemicals released in the brain that are affected by alcoholism,
said Bankole Johnson, a professor at the University of Virginia
in Charlottesville and the study's lead author, in an interview. 
``First, it reduces your craving for alcohol; second, it
reduces the amount of withdrawal symptoms you get when you start
reducing alcohol; and third, it reduces the potential for you to
relapse after you go down to a low level of drinking or zero
drinking,'' Johnson said. ``I wouldn't say it's a cure; I would
say it's a very big improvement over what we've had before. We
will continue working toward a cure.'' 
The company-sponsored study followed 371 men and women who
were heavy drinkers for 14 weeks. About half were given a
placebo. Results showed that 27 of 183 patients, or 15 percent,
taking Topamax quit drinking by the end of the study. That
compares with 6 participants, or 3.2 percent, of 188 given a
placebo. 
Less Heavy Drinking 
The study also found that those taking Topamax had an
average 8.4 percent fewer heavy drinking days than those given a
placebo. One drink is considered a 10-ounce beer (283.5 grams),
four ounces of wine or 1 ounce of 100-proof liquor. 
Study participants taking Topamax also had a higher rate of
achieving 20 or more days of continuous abstinence and 28 or more
days of continuous non-heavy drinking. 
Side effects of the drug included abnormal skin sensations,
distorted sense of taste, anorexia and difficulty with
concentration. 
Three drugs currently are approved in the U.S. to treat
alcoholism. They include naltrexone, which interrupts the high of
drinking, and disulfiram, which makes people sick when they
drink. Forest Laboratories Inc. (FRX) and Merck KGaA (MRK)'s Campral,
approved in the U.S. in July 2004, helps reduce the physical and
emotional discomfort felt in the weeks and months after a patient
stops drinking, making abstinence from alcohol easier. 
Willenbring with the National Institutes of Health said
research in this area should yield more medications to treat
alcoholism in the next five to 10 years. The institute is
sponsoring about 33 clinical trials of drugs that have potential
to treat alcoholism, he said. 
``There are many other medicines that are in the pipeline,''
he said. ``It's a very exciting time.'' 
Public Citizen 
Public Citizen, a Washington-based advocacy organization,
said the study showed an increased incidence of dizziness, injury
and difficulty concentrating among patients who consumed heavy
amounts of alcohol while taking Topamax, the group said in a
letter today to the Food and Drug Administration. 
Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group at
Public Citizen, urged the FDA to stop an ``illegal and dangerous
promotional campaign'' that he said was tied to the Johnson 
Johnson-sponsored study. 
``It is not the research or the publication of the study
that is illegal but the promotional material that goes beyond the
research to solicit new sales for the drug,'' Wolfe said in an e-mailed copy of the letter. 
`Off-Label' Use 
Johnson  Johnson said it won't support off-label use of its
drug, which may lose some patent protection next year. 
``We absolutely, positively don't support any reference to
off-label use of our products,'' said Kara Russell, a spokeswoman
for Johnson  Johnson's Ortho McNeil Neurologics division, in a
telephone interview today. ``We only promote the use of Topamax
for the approved indications of migraine prevention and
epilepsy.'' 
Doctors in the U.S. are free to prescribe any medicine they
feel would best treat a given condition, regardless of what the
label says. Drugmakers are prohibited from promoting medicines
for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

Banks struggling to find buyers for
$131 billion of unsold loans that financed last year's leveraged
buyouts are starting to break ranks and hold individual
negotiations with investors. 
Instead of sticking together in a lending group, or
syndicate, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley (MS) and
Credit Suisse Group have each sought buyers for their portion of
Clear Channel Communications Inc. (CCU)'s $22 billion buyout
financing, said people with knowledge of the situation. They
declined to be identified because the talks are private. 
Banks are under pressure to sell the loans after prices for
debt that paid for last year's record $438 billion of buyouts
fell 12 percent in the past seven months, according to Standard
 Poor's. Banks and securities firms have taken about $188
billion in writedowns and credit losses since the beginning of
2007, including reserves for bad loans, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. 
``It's reached a new stage of every man for himself,''
Martin Fridson, chief executive officer of high-yield research
firm FridsonVision LLC in New York, said in an interview.
``Banks worked hard until now to hold the line and keep the
gentlemen's agreement together.'' 
Jennifer Sala, a spokeswoman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, declined comment. Peter Ward, a spokesman for RBS,
based in Edinburgh, didn't return calls seeking comment. Zurich-based Credit Suisse hasn't sold any of the Clear Channel debt
and plans to work with the syndicate, Tom Newberry, the bank's
global head of syndicated loans in New York, said in a telephone
interview. 
`Circled the Wagons' 
New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C) is leading the group. The
other banks include Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) of Frankfurt and Wachovia
Corp. (WB) in Charlotte, North Carolina. 
Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second-biggest bank, sold its
share of $7.25 billion of loans to Las Vegas-based casino
operator Harrah's Entertainment Inc. in December, before the
other banks, which then struggled to sell the debt, people with
knowledge of the situation said. 
``Up through recently, the banking community kind of
circled wagons and everybody was protecting their positions
because they were involved in the same'' loans, said Matthew Eagan, a money manager at Boston-based Loomis Sayles  Co.,
which oversees $130 billion of assets. ``What you didn't want
was somebody under-pricing you and hurting you.'' 
In syndicated loans, banks form a financing group. One or
two institutions typically take charge in finding buyers for
chunks of the loans, such as other banks, money managers and
hedge funds, at an agreed upon price. 
Buyout Frenzy 
Investor demand for riskier assets including high-yield
loans used to finance buyouts began to dry up in the second half
of last year as losses related to the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market spread. Banks were stuck with $163 billion of
the loans at the beginning of 2008, according to a Bank of
America Corp. report last week. 
Financial firms will likely see their credit-related losses
reach at least $600 billion, UBS AG analysts wrote in a report
dated Feb. 29. 
Loans trade at an average price of 89.02 cents on the
dollar, down from 100 cents in July, according to SP data.
High-yield, or leveraged, loans are rated below BBB- by SP and
Baa3 by Moody's Investors Service. 
`Steady Decline' 
``It's been a reasonably steady decline in market
conditions,'' Blackstone President Hamilton James said on a
conference call today. The publicly traded buyout firm raised a
$1.4 billion fund to invest in loans stuck on bank balance sheets
last November. The firm still has ``100 percent dry powder'' and
expects conditions to get worse before improving, James said. 
``Temptation is growing. Some time in the next 90 days
might be the time to do something significant,'' he said on a
separate call with investors today. 
San Antonio-based Clear Channel, the largest U.S. radio
broadcaster, is being bought for $19.5 billion by private-equity
firms Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, both
located in Boston. 
The banks financing the deal agreed in April to provide $22
billion in debt. Banks will extend about $19.5 billion in bank
loans at the London interbank offered rate plus as much as 3.25
percentage points. The premium over Libor (US0003M) has since widened to
about 6.65 percentage points, according to SP, meaning the
banks must sell the Clear Channel loans at a discount to reflect
the wider spreads and current prices. Three-month Libor was 2.94
percent last week. 
Betrayal 
Clear Channel fell 18 cents to $33.96 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading today. The shares have climbed 18
percent over the past month as more investors bet the deal would
be completed. The buyout firms agreed to pay $39.20 a share. 
The decision by the banks to approach investors separately
probably means they will be able to buy the loans cheaper. 
``From an investor viewpoint, they are unlikely to be upset
about banks betraying one another, because investors feel they
were treated shabbily by the banks all through the bull
period,'' Fridson said.

The following is a list of companies
whose shares had unusual price changes in U.S. markets. Stock
symbols are in parentheses after company names, and prices are as
of 4 p.m. in New York. 
Advance America Cash Advance Centers Inc. (AEA US) dropped 16
percent to $5.98, the lowest since December 2004. The provider of
short-term loans to individuals was reduced to ``equalweight'' from
``overweight'' by analyst Dennis Telzrow at Stephens Inc. 
Allion Healhcare Inc. (ALLI US) fell for the first time in
four days, sinking 3.8 percent to $5.31. The pharmacy operator
signed a definitive agreement to buy Biomed America Inc, which
provides specialized biopharmaceutical medications and services to
chronically ill patients. Melville, New York-based Allion said in a
statement after the market closed yesterday it will pay $117.8
million for Biomed. The price includes $48 million of cash as well
an offering of common and preferred shares. The company will also
assume as much as $18.6 million of Biomed's debt. 
 AnnTaylor Stores Corp. (ANN)  declined the most since Jan.
10, sliding 8.2 percent to $21.95. The clothing retailer geared
toward women 25 to 55 forecast profit of 35 cents to 40 cents a
share in the first quarter. That missed the average estimate of 42
cents, according to a Bloomberg survey of analysts. 
Bear Stearns Cos. (BSC US) had its biggest drop since its
initial public offering in October 1985, falling 47 percent to $30.
The securities firm, to which JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)  and the
New York Federal Reserve agreed to provide funding, said its cash
position has ``significantly deteriorated.''

U.S. banks from Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc. to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. have whittled their
holdings of leveraged buyout loans to $129 billion from $163
billion at the beginning of the year by offering the debt at
discounts, according to analysts at Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
The decline is a ``ray of hope'' for banks amid a slump in
credit markets and a slowing economy, said analysts led by
Jeffrey Rosenberg. The firms also have $73.6 billion of high-yield bonds they need to sell, they said. 
Banks have been breaking ranks from their lending groups and
offering their own pieces of the LBO loans at as little as 80
cents on the dollar to get the debt off their books. New York-based Lehman yesterday said it has reduced its LBO backlog by
$6.1 billion to $17.8 billion since the beginning of the year.
Goldman Sachs halved its holdings to $20 billion and Morgan
Stanley (MS) reduced its pipeline by 20 percent. 
The buyout industry, including Blackstone Group (BX), Apollo
Management LP and Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts  Co. (KKR), all based in
New York, negotiated more than $370 billion in financing to back
acquisitions such as the $32 billion purchase of Texas power
producer TXU Corp. and the $46.8 billion sale of Canadian
telecommunications company BCE Inc. (BCE) to an investor group led by
the Ontario Teachers Pension Plan, the largest buyout ever. 
Plunging Demand 
Investor demand for the debt plummeted in July as losses on
U.S. subprime securities spread to other asset classes. The
average price of a leveraged loan fell from par to a record low
of 86.28 last month, according to Standard  Poor's data. Prices
have since climbed to 87.32 cents on the dollar. 
Banks began tackling the backlog in September, when lenders
for KKR sold $9.4 billion of loans at a discount of up to 4
percent for its takeover of Greenwood Village, Colorado-based
First Data Corp., the biggest processor of credit card payments. 
Goldman, the world's biggest securities firm by market
value, is selling its portion of Chrysler LLC's $7 billion in
loans for as little as 72 cents on the dollar, said investors,
who declined to be identified because the terms are private.
Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment on
individual sales. 
Cerberus Capital Management LP bought Chrysler Group LLC
last August. Bankers for the Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
automaker twice failed to sell the Chrysler loans. JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM), Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns Cos. and Goldman,
all of New York, tried in November to sell $4 billion of the
loans at 97.5 cents on the dollar. 
The loan is priced at 400 basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor (US0003M), a borrowing
benchmark. Three-month Libor is 2.6 percent. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. 
Backlogs Reduced 
Goldman reduced its backlog of loans by $20 billion in the
past quarter from $43 billion, chief financial officer David Viniar said on an investor call yesterday. The New York-based
firm, which booked a loss of $1 billion on the loans, also added
$4 billion of new commitments during the period. 
Lehman, the fourth-biggest U.S. securities firm, booked
losses of $500 million on leveraged loans last quarter, CFO Erin Callan said on a conference call with investors yesterday. 
Morgan Stanley, the second-biggest U.S. securities firm,
reduced its leveraged finance pipeline to $16 billion from $20
billion during the first quarter, CFO Colm Kelleher said in an
interview today after the company reported first-quarter profit
fell 42 percent. 
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Morgan Stanley and Credit
Suisse Group have each sought buyers for their portion of Clear
Channel Communications Inc.'s $22 billion buyout financing, said
people with knowledge of the situation. 
LBO Buyers 
Some of the same LBO firms that generated the debt in the
first place are raising funds to buy it back at reduced prices.
Blackstone raised a $1.4 billion fund last November to buy bank
loans, and Leon Black's Apollo  has bought $1 billion of
distressed loans and bonds. 
``The leveraged loan forward calendar continues to
decline,'' Rosenberg wrote in the report on March 17. ``The
ongoing raising of distressed debt funds,'' including Apollo's,
``appears to support these efforts.'' 
In addition to the buyout firms, traditional loan investors
and hedge funds are also buying the debt. 
Dallas-based Highland Capital Management LP has raised $1
billion in the past four months from pension funds and sovereign
wealth funds, to invest in debt, including bank loans, according
to Mark Okada, co-founder and chief investment officer. 
``We are more willing to participate in new issues at these
distressed prices,'' said Scott D'Orsi, a partner at Boston-based
Feingold O'Keeffe Capital, which has $1.25 billion in assets.
``It's been a waiting game between the buy side and the banks
over the past several months, with pricing moving in favor of
investors.''

New York paid 10 securities firms
more than $600,000 since mid-February to handle bids for
auction-bonds even though the sales failed, saddling the state
with penalty interest rates. 
Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and eight more
firms receive $10 million a year to oversee periodic bidding
that sets rates on about $4 billion of auction bonds. When there
aren't enough buyers, the yields rise. A total of 188 of the
state's 201 auctions since Feb. 12 have failed, according to
data supplied by the state. 
``We are contractually obligated to pay these fees
regardless of whether the auction fails, and we will fulfill our
commitment,'' Matt Anderson, a spokesman for New York's Division
of Budget said in an e-mailed statement. 
State and local governments pay almost $8 million a week in
fees to banks for auctions-rate bonds, based on standard fees.
About two-thirds of auctions in the $330 billion market have
failed since mid-February, including periodic sales of preferred
stock for closed-end bond funds, Bloomberg data show. Securities
firms are receiving the same fee even when investors who wanted
to sell are unable to do so because bankers haven't found enough
bidders. 
`Systemic Problems' 
Banks covered shortfalls in demand at auctions in the $330
billion market buy purchasing bonds for their own account, even
though they weren't obliged to. They didn't tell investors or
issuers about the extent of the activity, which was one of the
practices cited by the Securities and Exchange Commission in
2006 when it fined 15 banks a total of $13 million for bid-rigging. 
New York isn't trying to renegotiate the contracts with the
10 broker-dealers it uses for auction bonds, Anderson said. The
firms also include Bank of America Corp., Wachovia Corp., UBS
AG, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Merrill Lynch  Co., Bear Stearns Cos.
Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
``These failed auctions were not caused by these banks, but
by systemic problems within this market beyond their control,''
he said. 
A spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, declined to comment, as did Michael DuVally, a
spokesman for New York-based Goldman. Citigroup was the biggest
underwriter of auction-rate debt from 2000 to 2007, according to
Thomson Financial. Goldman is the most profitable investment
bank. 
Higher Rates 
When there aren't enough bidders in auctions that typically
take place every seven, 28 or 35 days, rates get set by formulas
spelled out when the debt is issued. In New York, the penalty
rates ranged from 3.59 percent to 5.64 percent in the week ended
March 14. That compares with yields on the variable-rate demand
bonds, an alternative to auction-rate notes, that were less than
3 percent for 27 of 43 issues, according to state data. 
Seven-day auction rates averaged 4.36 percent on March 19
for borrowers in New York, New Jersey, California and
Massachusetts, up from 3.47 percent on Feb. 6, the last week
before New York auctions began failing, according to index data
published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association. The rate peaked at 5.98 percent March 5. 
Before the failures, auction-rate bonds were a way to sell
long-term bonds at money market rates. They were the least
expensive kind of borrowing for New York until demand began to
weaken in September, according to a state report. 
Bank Contracts 
Anderson said copies of the contracts with banks handling
the auction bonds weren't available. Anderson and Ronald
Greenberg, a first deputy director of the budget, said state
officials are in daily contact with bankers about auction bonds.
He declined to respond to questions about the shortage of
bidders since Feb. 12. 
``Contracts for handling auctions are written by broker
dealers and presented to issuers as part of a negotiated
transaction,'' said Joseph Fichera, chief executive officer of
Saber Partners, a New York based adviser to companies and
governments. ``They can be terminated or renegotiated, like any
contract.'' 
Fichera, a financial adviser to the New York State
Dormitory Authority, declined to comment on the state's bonds. 
There is precedent for broker-dealer agreements that don't
pay banks a fee when auctions fail. 
After auctions failed to attract enough bidders in 1990 for
bonds of Tucson Electric Power Co., now a unit of Unisource
Energy Corp. (UNS), Fichera arranged a new contract that rewarded
bankers with a higher fee for selling bonds that resulted in a
lower auction rate, and no fee if bonds sold at the highest
permitted rate.

The cost to protect the debt of
banks and securities firms from default rose for a third day amid
renewed concern that losses will increase after declining asset
values forced Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. to bail out five
funds. 
Credit-default swaps tied to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS),
Merrill Lynch  Co. and Lehman Brothers reached the highest
levels since the start of the month, signaling a decline in
investor confidence. Benchmark credit indexes in the U.S. and
Europe rose earlier today, before falling back to little changed
as stocks in the U.S. rallied. 
Lehman took $1.8 billion in assets from five of its short-term debt funds onto its balance sheet last quarter after
``market disruptions.'' Goldman, the most profitable securities
firm, late yesterday reported a 39 percent increase in hard-to-value assets, and some analysts have scrapped their earnings
estimates for Merrill Lynch and are now predicting a first-quarter loss. 
``When the banks report in the next couple of weeks, there's
going to be a reminder to a lot of investors that there's more
damage to balance sheets beyond structured finance, beyond
leveraged finance,'' said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit analyst at
BNP Paribas in New York. ``It's extending to a broader range of
credit classes.'' 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman climbed 8 basis points to
133 basis points, Phoenix prices show. They earlier reached
140 basis points, the highest since March 31. Lehman contracts
climbed 17 basis points to 212 and traded as high as 217, Phoenix
prices show. New York-based Merrill, which is scheduled to report
earnings April 17, rose 15 basis points to 200. 
$245 Billion 
Credit-default swaps, financial instruments based on bonds
or loans, were conceived to protect bondholders by paying the
buyer face value in exchange for the underlying securities should
the borrower default. A decrease in the price indicates improving
perceptions of credit quality, an increase shows deterioration. 
The world's largest banks and securities firms have reported
$245 billion of asset writedowns and credit losses amid record
home foreclosures and a loss of investor confidence in so-called
structured securities linked to home loans. The housing turmoil
triggered a collapse of the subprime mortgage market and spread
to debt once considered among the safest, including commercial
paper backed by assets such as mortgage securities. 
Goldman Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told
investors today that the credit crisis is nearing an end. 
``We're closer to the end than the beginning,'' Blankfein,
53, said today at the company's annual shareholder meeting in New
York. ``We're maybe at the end of the third quarter, or the
beginning of the fourth.'' 
Money-Market Funds 
New York-based Lehman, the fourth-biggest securities firm,
recorded a $300 million loss from the bailout of five short-term
debt funds, according to a person familiar with the writedown.
Lehman's actions followed a $780 million charge by Credit Suisse
Group in February after the Zurich-based firm bought assets from
its money-market funds that had fallen in value because of a
freeze in some commercial paper markets. 
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Legg Mason Inc. also have propped
up money-market funds and General Electric Co.'s GE Asset
Management liquidated a short-term bond fund in November after it
lost about $225 million. 
Most of the funds held commercial paper and medium-term
notes issued by structured investment vehicles, which were shut
out of debt markets last year amid concern that some of them
bought securities linked to subprime mortgages. 
Goldman, also based in New York, disclosed in a regulatory
filing yesterday that its so-called Level 3 assets, those hardest
to value, jumped to $96.4 billion at the end of February, with
the ratio to total assets rising to 8.1 percent from 6.2 percent. 
Asian Markets 
``Investors don't like the uncertainty that it brings to
balance sheets,'' said Mark Bayley, director of credit and
structuring at ABN Amro Holding NV in Sydney. ``It indicates a
deterioration of liquidity and transparency in the markets.'' 
Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, linked to the debt of 125 companies in
the U.S. and Canada, fell 2 basis point to 122 basis points as of
2:59 p.m. in New York, according to Phoenix Partners. The index
earlier reached 130 basis points, the widest since April 1. The
Markit iTraxx Europe index fell 0.5 basis point to 104.5 basis
points in London, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) 
In Asia, the Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 16 basis points
to 120 basis points, according to Morgan Stanley. The benchmark
gauge of credit risk has erased almost half its decline this
month. 
Bear Stearns 
The iTraxx and CDX indexes reached record highs last month
after a cash squeeze at Bear Stearns Cos., the fifth-biggest U.S.
securities firm, prompted the Federal Reserve to back an
emergency sale of the firm to JPMorgan Chase  Co. 
The Fed's intervention in the Bear Stearns crisis on March
14, and its creation of a new lending facility designed to
prevent other banks from collapsing, eased investor concern and
sent credit-default swaps plunging from their record highs. The
North American investment-grade index reached a record 198.5
basis points on March 14, according to CMA Datavision in London. 
``I think we're going to settle into a range here for a
little bit; the market needs to figure out what it wants to do
next,'' said Ashish Shah, head of credit strategy at Lehman
Brothers in New York. ``The good news is that you are going
through the de-levering process as banks and brokers try to shed
assets they don't want and continue to raise capital.''

Johnson Electric Holdings Ltd. (179), the
Hong Kong-based maker of electric motors for automakers including
Ford Motor Co. (F), said full-year profit rose 19 percent on demand
for its products in North America and China. 
Net income climbed to $130.8 million, or 3.57 cents per
share, in the year ended March 31, from $109.7 million, or 2.99
cents, a year earlier, the company said in a Hong Kong stock
exchange filing today. Sales rose 6 percent to $2.22 billion. 
Johnson Electric said it has relocated plants to China to
cuts costs, ``strengthened'' technologies and closed some ``non-core'' businesses. It expects sales to grow 5 percent to 7
percent in the fiscal year ending March 2009. 
``Growth in emerging economies remains extremely robust,
partially cushioning global manufacturers from weaker domestic
demand,'' Johnson Electric said in the statement. ``In coming
years, we plan to increase our focus on and direct resources
towards rapidly developing countries such as Brazil and Russia.'' 
European sales rose 10 percent, those in North America
climbed 3.8 percent and those in Asia rose 3.4 percent. 
Johnson Electric, controlled by the family of Chairman
Patrick Wang declined 8.4 percent this year in Hong Kong trading,
compared with the 12 percent drop in the benchmark Hang Seng
Index. The stock rose 0.5 percent to HK$3.92 today, before the
earnings announcement. 
The company will pay a final dividend of 1.25 cents per
share, an increase from 1.09 cents a year earlier.

``Wall-E,'' the movie about a trash-compacting robot, may end a slide in U.S. box-office sales for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and its Pixar animation studio. 
The film, opening in about 4,000 theaters today, probably
will exceed Pixar's 2007 release ``Ratatouille,'' which garnered
$47 million in its first weekend, according to Steve Mason, an
analyst in Los Angeles at FantasyMoguls.com, a box-office Web
site. He estimated weekend sales of $55 million. 
Disney, which bought Pixar in 2006, needs a hit to climb
from last place among the largest studios in 2008 U.S. sales.
``The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'' missed Box Office
Mojo LLC's $86.9 million estimate last month, taking in $55
million in its opening weekend. Through June 22, Disney's
domestic ticket sales dropped 36 percent to $457.4 million,
according to the Burbank, California-based film tracker. 
```Wall-E' translates well around the world because of the
physical comedy and emotional aspects,'' Mark Zoradi, president
of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Group, said in an
interview. ``Nothing binds it to the United States. It's a
creative project that will work in 100 countries around the
world.'' 
The movie from ``Finding Nemo'' creator Andrew Stanton
follows Wall-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, who clears garbage left by humans who fled the planet to
live on space ships. He falls in love with another robot, Eve,
the Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator sent to Earth to look
for signs of life. 
`Love Story' 
The film may take in as much as $210 million in ticket
sales during its U.S. run, said David Joyce, an analyst at
Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, who recommends shares of
Burbank, California-based Disney and doesn't own them. That
would pass the $206 million of ``Ratatouille,'' according to
Internet Movie Database Inc., a unit of Amazon.com Inc. that
provides film data. 
```Wall-E' boasts the best love story I've seen in 2008,''
said Gitesh Pandya, editor of industry newsletter
BoxOfficeGuru.com in New York. ``Word of mouth will be terrific
with all ages and this will last a long time.'' 
Disney, the second-largest U.S. media company, rose 4 cents
to $31.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have slipped 2.2 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent drop in the SP 500 Index. 
2003 Peak 
Since 2003's ``Finding Nemo,'' the No. 2 animated film of
all time according to Box Office Mojo, each Pixar release has
produced lower U.S. box-office sales, a benchmark for subsequent
sales of DVDs and television revenue. 
``U.S. box office is the most important factor in
anticipating all the other ancillary revenue streams,'' said
David Davis, founder of Arpeggio Partners LLC, a Santa Monica,
California-based consultant to Hollywood studios. ``It's not the
only factor, but it's the best indicator.'' 
U.S. box-office sales for Pixar, which Disney bought for
$8.06 billion, peaked in 2003 with ``Finding Nemo,'' which was
produced for $94 million and took in $340 million, according to
Internet Movie Database. ``Ratatouille'' cost $150 million,
while ``Wall-E'' cost $120 million, IMDB said. 
``The jury is still out'' on the Pixar purchase, said Tuna Amobi, an analyst at Standard  Poor's in New York who
recommends Disney shares and doesn't own them. ``It was a hefty
price, no doubt about it. Disney is looking at it as a marathon,
not a sprint.'' 
Fewer Films 
Since buying Pixar, Disney has cut film production overall,
betting it could boost profit by making fewer, more popular
movies. Last year, filmed entertainment generated profit of $1.2
billion, a sixfold increase over two years, on slightly lower
sales of $7.49 billion. 
The company produced 13 films last year, down from 17 in
2005, and will release 11 in 2008. 
This year is proving tougher. Through the first half of
fiscal 2008, studio profit rose 6.5 percent to $891 million,
while sales gained 6.7 percent to $4.46 billion. For the year
ending in September, the unit's profit is likely to fall 1
percent to $1.19 billion, as sales dip 1.8 percent to $7.36
billion, according to Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. 
Robert Iger, Disney's chief executive officer, said last
month at an investor conference that Hollywood makes too many
movies. 
``It shouldn't surprise anybody in the business why there
is so much failure and why the returns on investment are so
modest,'' Iger said. 
The following table ranks Pixar movies by their worldwide
box-office sales. Figures are in millions of dollars.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world's largest
software maker, is being probed by Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission
after an activist group filed a complaint saying consumers are
being forced to buy its Windows Vista operating system. 
``We have received the complaint and are now conducting our
own investigation, which may last around six months,'' Chou Ya-shu, the antitrust regulator's spokeswoman, said in a telephone
interview today. Microsoft can face fines of as much as NT$25
million ($796,000) and be ordered to halt illicit practices if
found guilty of fair-trade breaches, she said. 
Sophia Chang, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Taipei, denied
the company forces people to buy Vista and declined to comment
further on the case. 
Microsoft should be fined for using its monopoly to force
consumers to adopt Vista after the company ended sales of Windows
XP in June, Taiwan's Consumer Foundation, a non-profit group,
said in its complaint posted on its Web site on Aug. 15. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, stopped selling XP
individually and pre-installing the operating system in most
computers in June to spur Vista sales. Vista, which was released
for consumers in January last year, requires more memory capacity
and greater processing power than XP. 
``It would be a very unusual and creative interpretation of
antitrust law to say that a company is obliged to keep selling a
product,'' said Brendon Carr, an attorney who advises
multinational companies on antitrust issues at the law firm Hwang
Mok Park in Seoul. 
Demand For XP 
The Consumer Foundation said its research showed 56 percent
of consumers buying a computer with Vista would reinstall XP,
while 67 percent oppose Microsoft ending the sale of the earlier
operating system. Windows XP remains available preinstalled in
some low-cost computers such as Acer Inc. (2353)'s Aspire One laptop. 
Under Taiwan's Fair Trade Act, a company may not ``use
incentives or other devious means to induce a business to alter a
consumer's shopping choices,'' the foundation said in the
statement. 
``The Fair Trade Commission should fine Microsoft a large
enough amount that would strip away its profits from selling
Vista,'' the foundation said.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) lost
more than 82 percent of its market value in the past year as
investors punished the mall owner for the loans it has coming due.
There may be more around the corner for other landlords. 
Maguire Properties Inc., down 37 percent since Sept. 12;
Glimcher Realty Trust (GRT), down 22 percent; and Education Realty Trust
Inc. (EDR), down 9.8 percent, are among the real estate investment
trusts that, like General Growth, face debt repayment deadlines
through 2009. General Growth has dropped 65 percent since Sept.
12, the last trading day before New York-based securities firm
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection. 
``There is a general fear of real estate,'' said Raphael Bostic, a real estate finance professor at the University of
Southern California and former Federal Reserve senior economist.
``The business strategy very much relies on a liquid financing
market, and that just doesn't exist right now. So when you rely on
that kind of strategy, you're at risk of that excess volatility.'' 
General Growth shares tumbled on investors' concern that the
Chicago-based company wouldn't be able to refinance about $1.2
billion of debt it has coming due this year, said Rich Moore, an
analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Cleveland. Then they fell
further after company executives reported they had sold 5.67
million of their own shares for $112.5 million since Aug. 1. 
`Poster Child' 
General Growth shares today rose $2.08, or 27 percent, to
$9.67 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading after the
company announced it had fired Chief Financial Officer Bernard Freibaum and suspended dividends. Freibaum was replaced by Chief
Accounting Officer Edmund Hoyt until a permanent successor is
found, the company said. General Growth will stop paying dividends
because of ``uncertainty and volatility in the capital markets.'' 
If credit markets stay frozen, a similar fate may await other
REITs whose cash flow hasn't yet caught up with expensive loans
financing acquisitions made as prices peaked, Moore said. 
General Growth, whose troubles stem from the $11.3 billion
purchase of Rouse Co. in 2004, is the ``poster child'' for REITs
that are highly leveraged and have loans reaching maturity soon,
said Moore and Mathew Kirschner, an investment analyst at New
York-based REIT investor Cohen  Steers (CNS) Inc. No other U.S. REIT
has close to as much debt reaching maturity as soon as General
Growth, Kirschner said. 
General Growth Chief Executive Officer John Bucksbaum called
the company's share drop a ``tremendous overreaction'' by
investors and said in an interview last month that he has ``every
confidence'' debt coming due this year will be refinanced. 
Short Selling 
Proxy adviser Glass, Lewis  Co. this week criticized the
company for asking the New York Stock Exchange to ban short
selling of its shares even as executives, not including Bucksbaum,
sold 2.44 million of their own shares. 
``You're going to have a lot of companies that had prudent
approaches that are going to be caught in this wave,'' Bostic
said. ``It really affects how investors view these companies.'' 
Like General Growth, companies such as Maguire, the largest
landlord in downtown Los Angeles, and shopping-mall owner Glimcher
are leveraged enough to worry investors who expect the troubles
afflicting lenders to continue, Moore said. 
``You really have to look at it on a case-by-case basis,''
said Scott Black, founder and president of Delphi Management Inc.
in Boston, which has about $1.4 billion under management and is
considering buying shares of apartment and medical REITs. 
REITs are ``definitely affected by the lack of credit
availability in the banking system,'' Black said. ``But you better
look at when the debts are coming due.'' 
Maguire Properties 
Glimcher shares are down 41 percent this year and Maguire's
are down 78 percent. The drops are greater than the 15 percent
decline in the Bloomberg REIT Index and the 25 percent drop in the
Standard  Poor's 500 Index. 
In addition to General Growth, Los Angeles-based Maguire is
most at risk, Moore said. The company, which owns 30 office
properties in Southern California and one in Denver, plunged as it
reported losses, replaced the chief executive officer, and was
criticized by investors who wanted Maguire to put itself up for
sale. 
Maguire has an 89 percent implied leverage, making it the
most highly leveraged of the 15 office REITs tracked by Green
Street Advisors Inc., the Newport Beach, California-based research
company said in a report last month. 
The debts are the result of Maguire's $2.88 billion purchase
last year of 24 office properties and 11 development sites from
Blackstone Group LP. (BX) The purchase encompassed all of the real
estate in downtown Los Angeles and Orange County that Blackstone
acquired in its takeover of Equity Office Properties Trust, and
came shortly before the collapse of the subprime mortgage industry
boosted office vacancies in Orange County. 
Debt Coming Due 
``That was financed all with debt, and it was a big
percentage expansion to their portfolio, so it was definitely the
thing that put them in the position they're in today,'' said
Michael Knott, a senior analyst at Green Street, which has a
``sell'' rating on Maguire's stock. 
Maguire, as of June 30, had 11 percent of its total debt
coming due by the end of 2009, including $244.2 million in
construction loans and other debt maturing this year and $301.8
million in floating-rate debt, construction loans and other debt
coming due next year, according to the company. 
The company said this week it extended maturities until 2010
on two construction loans totaling $49.1 million, completed a $100
million financing secured by a hotel, office and retail complex in
Pasadena, California, and extended until Sept. 28, 2009, the
maturity on an Orange County office construction loan. 
Shopping Malls 
``We are mindful of the near-term maturities and are working
to extend those accordingly,'' Maguire spokeswoman Peggy Moretti
said in an interview. The company is ``in ongoing discussions''
with its lenders and the ``recent meltdown does not affect those
discussions,'' she said. 
Green Street calculates leverage using the current market
value of a company's assets. Columbus, Ohio-based Glimcher is 65
percent leveraged, more than any other shopping-mall REIT the
research company tracks except Chattanooga, Tennessee-based CBL 
Associates Properties Inc. (CBL), which also has debt equaling 65
percent of its net asset value. CBL shares have declined 39
percent this year. Green Street has a ``sell'' rating on the
shares of both CBL and Glimcher. 
Loan Financings 
Glimcher has two loans totaling $92 million maturing this
year, and is working on restructuring one loan and refinancing the
other, said Lisa Indest, the company's vice president for finance
and accounting, in an e-mail. In 2009, Glimcher has a $30 million
loan maturing on a mall it's selling, a $46 million loan that's
under discussion with lenders, and a line of credit with a June 30
balance of $297 million that can be extended one year, she said. 
``We feel the 2008 and 2009 maturities are manageable,''
Indest said. 
CBL said last week it refinanced $288.1 million of debt and
secured an $85 million term loan, satisfying all of its remaining
debt maturities for 2008. 
``It's a tough environment, but this year we've been able to
work through it, and we expect that to continue,'' CBL President
Stephen Lebovitz said in an interview. Refinancing the $400
million in mortgages maturing in 2009 probably will give CBL
additional cash because its malls have risen in value, he said.
``Most of these loans have been in place for seven to 10 years, so
the cash flow has increased considerably over that time.'' 
Resistant to Recession 
Among REITs that own apartment buildings, the company with
the highest 2008 and 2009 funding requirements as a percentage of
total assets is Memphis, Tennessee-based Education Realty Trust,
which develops and manages college student housing in 21 states.
The company has loans equivalent to more than 30 percent of its
total assets coming due in 2009, and ``stands out as the most at
risk to a continued freeze-up in the credit markets,'' Green
Street said in an August report. 
Education Realty executives wouldn't comment on the company's
debt, outside spokesman Brad Cohen of ICR Inc. said. 
While student housing is more resistant to recession than
other parts of the real estate industry, Education Realty's
properties tend to be farther from campus than rival American
Campus Communities Inc. (ACC)'s housing, making them less attractive to
both renters and lenders, said Green Street analyst Andy McCulloch. He has a ``hold'' rating on the shares of both
companies. American Campus's shares are up 20 percent this year,
compared with the 11 percent drop in Education Realty. 
Freddie and Fannie 
Education Realty is in a better position than some REITs
seeking financing because the loans it will need are relatively
small, and Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae have given indications that
they will continue to finance the development of apartment
buildings, giving the company a potential source of funds,
McCulloch said. 
``The fact that Fannie and Freddie are out there puts them in
a little better situation than some of these companies, that's for
sure,'' he said. 
The only U.S. REITs with debt-to-asset-value ratios that
alarm Kirschner of Cohen  Steers, which has about $27 billion
under management, are Maguire and General Growth. General Growth
not only has ``high leverage, but they have short-term
maturities,'' he said. 
``Generally speaking, REITs operate at conservative leverage
levels,'' Kirschner said. ``Absent the General Growths of the
world, the REITs are in pretty good shape.''

Johnson Electric Holdings Ltd. (179), the
maker of electric motors for automakers including Ford Motor Co. (F),
fell as much as 15 percent after saying first-half profit may
drop 42 percent on higher costs. 
Johnson Electric fell the most in a week and traded 11

stock has dropped 67 percent this year, compared with a 47
percent decline in the Hang Seng Index. 
In the coming year, ``profitability should benefit from the
current downward trends in copper and steel costs and from the
actions we are taking to reduce our overall cost structure,''
Johnson Chairman Patrick Wang said in the statement. 
Net income in the six months ended September may decline to
about $46 million from $79.8 million a year earlier, the company
said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today. Sales
will probably rise 3.3 percent to $1.13 billion on currency gains.

Johnson Electric Holdings Ltd. (179), the
maker of electric motors for automakers including Ford Motor Co. (F),
posted a drop in half-year profit on a global recession,
prompting it to discontinue the scrap-metal trading and
recycling business. 
Net income fell 43 percent to $45.5 million, or $0.0124 per
share, in the six months ended Sept. 30 from $79.79 million, or
$0.0217 per share, according to a release to the Hong Kong Stock
Exchange today. Sales rose to $1.13 billion from $1.09 billion. 
Johnson Electric recorded $28 million of loss relating to
the closure of Green Vision Group&#8217;s scrap metal business. 
&#8220;Weaker end-use demand in the North American automotive
and power tools market, and the strength of the euro and other
currencies against the U.S. dollar&#8221; hurt sales and profit,
Johnson Electric said in the statement. It was also hit by
rising copper and steel prices, and higher manufacturing costs
in China because of rising wages and a stronger yuan. 
The company said it&#8217;s &#8220;extremely difficult to gauge with
any degree of precision&#8221; the outlook for the remainder of the
financial year. 
The global automotive industry, which accounts for about
half the company&#8217;s sales, &#8220;is undergoing the sharpest
contraction in demand in recent history with no clear signs yet
as to how long the downturn will persist or what will be the
ramifications for the industry&#8217;s future structure,&#8221; Johnson
Electric said in the earnings release. 
The company is &#8220;anticipating and preparing for weaker
sales and contribution to profit from the automotive products
group division for the second half and well into the following
financial year,&#8221; the company said. 
Johnson Electric shares have lost 72 percent this year,
compared with the benchmark Hang Seng Index&#8217;s 50 percent decline.

Johnson Electric Holdings Ltd., (179) the
maker of electric motors used in cars around the world, rose the
most in 18 years in Hong Kong trading after General Motors Corp. (GM)
received $4 billion in initial rescue loans. 
Johnson Electric rose 41 percent to close at HK$1.85, the
biggest increase since at least March 21, 1990. That trimmed its
decline in the past year to 55 percent, compared with 45 percent
for the benchmark Hang Seng Index. 
The supplier of motors for car windows, headlamps and seat
adjusters to companies including Ford Motor Co. lost 69 percent
of its market value last year as a recession weakened demand from
U.S. automakers. GM&#8217;s infusion will help the Detroit-based
carmaker pay suppliers as its cash dwindles. 
&#8220;All technology, telecom and electric motors makers&#8217; stocks
rose on the news&#8221; that the U.S. Treasury provided the initial
loans, said Alex Tang, an analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi
International Ltd. in Hong Kong. &#8220;The increase will continue as
Johnson Electric is still extremely undervalued,&#8221; said Tang, who
has a &#8220;hold&#8221; rating on the company&#8217;s stock. 
The loans are part of $17.4 billion in financing that the
Treasury has promised to GM and Chrysler in a bid to avert a
bankruptcy by either company.

Morgan Stanley is seeking a
supertanker to store crude oil, joining Citigroup Inc. (C) and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc in trying to profit from higher prices later in
the year, four shipbrokers said. 
The bank has yet to find a suitable vessel, said one of the
brokers, all of whom asked not to be identified because the
information is private. Carlos Melville, a spokesman for Morgan
Stanley in London, declined to comment. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of people looking for storage,&#8221; Denis Petropoulos, London-based head of tankers at Braemar Shipping
Services Plc (BMS), the world&#8217;s second-largest publicly traded
shipbroker, said by phone. 
Banks and commodity traders are seeking new ways to make
money after the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell by the most
since 1937 last year and crude oil prices dropped more than $100
a barrel from their peak. Companies including Koch Industries
Inc. and BP Plc are hoarding enough crude at sea to supply the
world for almost a day. 
Frontline Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest owner of supertankers,
yesterday said about 80 million barrels of crude oil are being
stored in tankers, the most in 20 years. A purchaser could buy
oil now, keep it for months at sea and fetch better prices by
selling oil futures that are higher than the spot price. 
The so-called contango pricing structure has been caused by
excess oil supply as demand slows and speculation that output
cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries will
reduce the glut later this year. 
Tanks Filling Up 
Slumping U.S. oil demand means tanks are filling at Cushing,
Oklahoma, the pricing point for the benchmark West Texas
Intermediate grade. Futures contracts indicate WTI will gain an
average of about $2.15 a barrel a month until December. 
Supertanker storage deals are being done at about $75,000 a
day, according to Petropoulos. Assuming the ship has a 2 million-barrel cargo, that works out at $1.12 a barrel over a 30-day
period. Traders also need to pay financing and insurance costs. 
Phibro LLC, Citigroup&#8217;s commodities trading unit, has the
carrier Ice Transporter stationed off north Scotland, according
to people familiar with the matter. Shell, Europe&#8217;s largest oil
company, has booked the supertankers Leander and Eliza. 
Oil traders hired two more ships to store North Sea crude
off Scotland&#8217;s Orkney Islands. The 2 million-barrel supertanker
Luxembourg is scheduled to arrive at Scapa Flow on Jan. 21 while
the 600,000-barrel transporter Atlantic Galaxy is already there,
said Captain William Sclater, operations manager at the port. 
Oil Grades 
The easiest types of oil to buy for the trade are likely to
be either WTI or the North Sea grades Brent, Forties, Oseberg or
Ekofisk. That&#8217;s because they are the ones used to settle the
most-traded futures contracts. 
Other oils, such as those from the Middle East and Africa,
are usually bought and sold at prices related to the main
European and U.S. grades. Because those prices fluctuate, it
means traders assume an extra risk by hoarding them. 
Morgan Stanley (MS) owns half of Heidmar Inc., which operates
smaller oil tankers. Heidmar hasn&#8217;t had demand for its tankers to
store oil, probably because they aren&#8217;t the largest supertankers
that investors need for the contango trade, Tim Brennan, the
company&#8217;s chief executive officer, said by phone Jan. 8.

Stocks of road builders and
construction companies were jolted last week when the $819
billion stimulus plan passed by the House of Representatives
proved to have only $30 billion designated for roadways, bridges
and tunnels. 
Many investors had expected more money for such
infrastructure projects. Shares in Granite Construction Inc. (GVA), a
road construction company based in Watsonville, California, have
fallen to $36.45 from more than $44 in early January. They had
risen 23 percent in November and December in anticipation of the
stimulus package. 
If not road builders, then which stocks will be the major
beneficiaries of the stimulus plan now working its way through
Congress? The dimensions of the plan are huge -- $819 billion in
the House version and about $900 billion in the Senate version --
and the bills are complex. Final details aren&#8217;t yet known. 
Both plans stick closely to the blueprint provided to
Congress by President Barack Obama. He has met with Congressional
leaders to rally support; so far he has it from most Democrats
but not from Republicans. 
Here are six stocks I believe could benefit from the
stimulus package: Pfizer Inc., Nikon Corp. (7731), Jos. A. Bank (JOSB)
Clothiers, Inc, Garmin (GRMN) Ltd., Lincoln Electric (LECO) Holdings Inc. and
Parker Hannifin (PH) Corp. 
Healthcare Emphasis 
The House bill includes $81 billion for Medicaid, a program
that pays for healthcare for poor people. There is also $30
billion to extend the Cobra health-care program for people who
lose their health insurance when they lose a job. These funds
could expand the market for pharmaceuticals. 
While several pharma stocks are appealing, I&#8217;m especially
partial to Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, based in New
York. It sells for six times earnings and currently yields 8
percent a year in dividends. In a thorny market like the current
one, that dividend yield is especially welcome. Pfizer (PFE) last week
agreed to buy Wyeth for more than $68 billion; I think the
proposed acquisition makes sense. 
The administration&#8217;s plan includes about $275 million in tax
relief for consumers and businesses. About a third of that total
takes the form of tax cuts for families earning as much as
$150,000 or individuals making up to $75,000. Families would be
eligible for a tax credit of as much as $1,000; individuals would
get one of up to $500. 
Consumer Spending 
I can picture some people using the savings to buy a nice
camera. That would redound to the benefit of Nikon The Tokyo-based company is best known for high-quality cameras; it also
makes microscopes and other instruments. 
Nikon (NINOY) stock, traded in the U.S. as an American depositary
receipt, sells for seven times earnings and yields 2.6 percent in
dividends. Its balance sheet is strong, with debt only 24 percent
of stockholders&#8217; equity. 
Consumers might take their tax credit and buy some new
clothes. And someone who was recently laid off may want to spend
money on a new suit for job interviews. This could work to the
benefit of Jos. A. Bank, a Hampstead, Maryland-based retailer
selling classic men&#8217;s clothing. 
Jos. A. Bank pays no dividend, and its stock sells for 10
times earnings. The company has recorded a profit 11 years
running, and the streak should go to 12 when results are reported
for the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, 2009. 
Garmin&#8217;s Gains 
One more potential beneficiary in the consumer realm is
Garmin, the largest U.S. maker of car-navigation devices. Garmin
had a 59 percent market share in the U.S. as of mid-2008, and a
19 percent share in Europe as of 2007. 
Competition and the recession have forced Garmin to cut
prices. Garmin shares fetch a mere five times earnings, and the
stock yields 4 percent in dividends. The Cayman Islands-based
company is debt-free. 
The stimulus package also includes provisions designed to
make it easier for businesses to invest in new equipment. These
provisions might benefit Lincoln Electric of Cleveland, the
world&#8217;s largest maker of welding equipment. 
A few years ago, it looked as if Lincoln might be imperiled
by lawsuits alleging that use of its welding equipment could
produce symptoms similar to those of Parkinson&#8217;s Disease.
However, the company prevailed in the vast majority those
lawsuits. Of some 15,000 cases filed, about 12,000 have been
dismissed. Lincoln has lost in four cases, three of which are
being appealed. Lincoln Electric shares trade for seven times
earnings, and the stock yields 2.4 percent in dividends. Debt is
admirably low at 11 percent of equity. 
Another potential beneficiary of the proposed liberalized
tax treatment of new-equipment purchases is Parker Hannifin, also
of Cleveland. It is the world&#8217;s largest manufacturer of hydraulic
equipment. On Jan. 28 the company announced it had won a contract
worth as much as $2.5 billion to make jet engine parts for Rolls
Royce. 
Parker Hannifin&#8217;s other products include systems for
regulating fluid flow, fluid purification and assembly line
processes. The stock sells for seven times earnings and yields
2.5 percent in dividends. 
Disclosure note: I own shares of Pfizer and Lincoln Electric
personally and for clients. I don&#8217;t currently own the other
stocks mentioned in this column.

Johnson Electric Holdings Ltd., (179) the
maker of electric motors used in cars around the world, fell the
most in more than four months in Hong Kong trading after saying
it will become unprofitable for the first time since 1990. 
The stock slumped 18 percent to HK$1.07, the steepest decline
since Oct. 27, after the Hong Kong-based company said it expects
to post a loss for the year ending March 31. 
Johnson Electric said low demand will likely continue this
year and probably well into 2010, according to a filing to the
Hong Kong stock exchange today. The company will focus on
conserving cash, Chairman Patrick Wang said in the statement.

When General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP)
bought Rouse Co. for $11.3 billion in 2004, then-Chief Executive
Officer John Bucksbaum said the deal amounted to &#8220;five years
worth of acquisitions in one fell swoop.&#8221; Now the challenge
will be keeping those assets. 
Purchasing Rouse gave General Growth malls including
Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall, New York&#8217;s South Street Seaport and the
Woodlands in Houston. It also added almost $10 billion in debt
to its balance sheet and led the second-largest U.S. mall owner
to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection yesterday. 
&#8220;Paying the highest price was not the fatal flaw,&#8221; said
Jim Sullivan, head of retail real estate investment trust
research at Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, California-based property research company. &#8220;The fatal flaw was financing
this giant purchase exclusively with debt.&#8221; 
Mall owners Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), Macerich Co. (MAC),
Vornado Realty Trust and Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO) rallied yesterday
on speculation the biggest real estate bankruptcy in the U.S.
will allow competitors to buy General Growth&#8217;s assets at a
discount. 
Hedge fund manager William Ackman, whose firm owns about 25
percent of General Growth, said he doesn&#8217;t think the real estate
investment trust will have to resort to a fire sale. 
&#8220;The probability of Simon or the other mall REITs buying
any of General Growth Properties on the cheap is zero,&#8221; Ackman
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re not going to be forced
to do anything because they&#8217;re in bankruptcy.&#8221; 
Credit Crunch 
The Rouse acquisition gave General Growth, the owner or
manager of about 200 properties in 44 states, premier malls with
strong occupancy rates and tenants. The company already has
tried to sell South Street Seaport as well as Las Vegas assets
such as Fashion Show Mall and The Shoppes at the Palazzo. 
&#8220;Now that it&#8217;s gone Chapter 11, the playbook starts from
scratch,&#8221; said Jonathan Miniman, senior analyst at ING Clarion
Real Estate Securities, which manages $10.8 billion. &#8220;This
could be a huge opportunity for the Simons or Vornados of the
world to buy some trophy assets at some pretty good prices.&#8221; 
Indianapolis-based Simon, the largest U.S. shopping mall
owner, has stakes in 386 properties. Vornado Realty Trust (VNO), one
of the country&#8217;s biggest office landlords, also owns or manages
more than 31 million square feet of retail properties in the
U.S. and Puerto Rico. ING Clarion is Simon&#8217;s seventh-largest
shareholder, with 9 million shares, or 3.7 percent, on Dec. 31. 
High Debt 
&#8220;The Rouse portfolio for the most part was a really high-quality portfolio,&#8221; said James S. Corl, managing director for
distressed real estate investments at private-equity firm
Siguler Guff  Co. in New York. Still, with &#8220;the price General
Growth paid, there was a reason why they were the winning
bidder. They weren&#8217;t disciplined on the acquisition front, and
certainly not on the financing front.&#8221; 
The Chicago-based company was blocked by the global credit
freeze from refinancing some of the $27.3 billion of debt it
amassed over the years. General Growth&#8217;s debt-to-asset ratio was
92 percent at the time it sought protection, according to the
filing. 
The bankruptcy may remake the nation&#8217;s mall business and
allow Simon to strengthen its position as the No. 1 mall owner,
said Dan Fasulo, managing director at real estate research firm
Real Capital Analytics. 
&#8216;Distress&#8217; Cycle 
General Growth&#8217;s filing is the &#8220;beginning of the distress
cycle,&#8221; Fasulo said, and may lead other companies to fail. 
General Growth&#8217;s competitors may not have an easy or
immediate way to capitalize on its woes. The company said it
wants to stay intact. Its success may depend on convincing the
bankruptcy judge to consolidate its debts until credit markets
recover. 
General Growth on March 23 said that a deadline for
bondholders to agree to new terms for $2.25 billion in debt
expired without the minimum number of holders accepting the
agreement. General Growth said on March 30 it was continuing to
negotiate with creditors. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not looking for wholesale sales of assets,&#8221;
General Growth President Thomas Nolan said yesterday in an
interview with Bloomberg Television. &#8220;We intend to emerge as a
leaner company.&#8221; 
Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management LP will
provide General Growth with $375 million in financing to help
run the company during the Chapter 11 process, may join the
board after the court approves the interim financing. Pershing
is the company&#8217;s third-largest shareholder. 
Low-Leverage Competition 
Financing for acquisitions remains scarce and some of
General Growth&#8217;s individual assets are debt-laden, making them
potentially less attractive to an acquirer. 
The nine regional mall owners tracked by Green Street have
an average leverage to asset ratio of 75 percent, according to a
March report by the firm. 
CBL  Associates Properties Inc. (CBL) of Chattanooga, Tennessee,
Glimcher Realty Trust (GRT) of Columbus, Ohio and Philadelphia-based
Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PEI) have the highest
leverage ratios, at more than 90 percent. Only companies with
relatively low debt ratios, such as Sydney-based Westfield at 56
percent, and Simon and Taubman, each at 60 percent, will likely
have the financial wherewithal to buy assets from General
Growth, said Sullivan. 
No Thaw 
&#8220;There&#8217;s very little sign that the real estate capital
markets are unfreezing in a huge way,&#8221; said Sullivan. &#8220;Even
for those raising equity, it&#8217;s been very expensive.&#8221; 
Simon on March 20 sold 15 million shares at $31.50 each,
raising $472.5 million, and $650 million of 10-year notes. The
notes were priced to yield 10.75 percent. By comparison, last
May, Simon sold 10-year bonds that were priced to yield 6.14
percent. 
&#8220;They have some very good assets,&#8221; Stephen E. Sterrett,
Simon&#8217;s chief financial officer, said yesterday in a telephone
interview. &#8220;Some of them would probably fit very well in our
portfolio, but now is probably not the right time to talk about
that.&#8221; 
General Growth in October put three Las Vegas properties up
for sale, the Fashion Show Mall, the Grand Canal Shoppes and the
Shoppes at the Palazzo. Simon&#8217;s Forum Shops at Caesars is next
to the Caesars Palace hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. 
&#8220;The issue with the Vegas assets was they were extremely
overleveraged,&#8221; said Miniman. &#8220;Fashion Show is one of the best
assets in the country but you couldn&#8217;t refinance it.&#8221; 
No Sale 
General Growth last month received offers of almost $400
million for properties including Faneuil Hall and the South
Street Seaport, according to a person familiar with the matter.
More than 10 bids were received. It didn&#8217;t sell. 
&#8220;By going the Chapter 11 route, it helps them maximize
asset values,&#8221; said Miniman. &#8220;I think the courts will force
them to sell assets to pay down some of the debt and emerge as a
smaller, better, re-equitized company.&#8221; 
After trying for seven months to refinance its debt,
General Growth filed for bankruptcy, listing $29.5 billion in
assets and debts of about $27.3 billion. General Growth will
continue operating. The company previously suspended its cash
dividend and cut its workforce by 20 percent. 
The Rouse transaction sealed the company&#8217;s fate, said
Sullivan of Green Street. 
General Growth bought Rouse after a bidding contest with
Simon, Westfield and others in what was then the largest
takeover of a real estate investment trust. 
Missed Chance 
By the time some of the debt came due, the credit crunch
halted bank lending and pushed the U.S. into a recession that
cut consumer spending and property values. Commercial real
estate prices in the U.S. dropped 15 percent last year,
according to Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. Retail sales in the U.S.
fell in March as job losses forced consumers to pull back. 
General Growth had chances to refinance since 2004 and
didn&#8217;t take advantage of them, said Sullivan. Now it faces the
prospect of emerging from bankruptcy a smaller player in an
industry that has consolidated to the point where an
&#8220;oligopoly&#8221; of publicly traded REITs own about 80 percent of
the country&#8217;s malls, he said. 
&#8220;Bigger is better in the mall business,&#8221; said Sullivan.
&#8220;The more malls you own, the stronger the relationship is with
your tenants.&#8221;

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP)
agreed to pay a $15 million commitment fee to William Ackman&#8217;s
Pershing Square Capital Management LP under an agreement for a
$375 million bankruptcy loan. 
The loan is to fund General Growth&#8217;s operations during a
Chapter 11 case that it filed on April 16, as well as to pay off
about $210 million in existing debt owed to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., according to court papers. 
General Growth, which has about $27 billion in debt, will
pay an interest rate of the London Interbank Offered Rate plus
12 percentage points, according to a regulatory filing on April
17 by Pershing Square. 
&#8220;It is anticipated that William A. Ackman will join the
board of directors&#8221; of General Growth once the loan is approved
by the bankruptcy court, though the loan isn&#8217;t contingent on his
appointment, the SEC filing said. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper scheduled another
hearing in the case for May 8. 
Pershing Square also will receive warrants to buy 4.9
percent of the Chicago-based real estate investment trust&#8217;s new
equity when it emerges from bankruptcy, the filing said. General
Growth also has the option under certain circumstances to use a
put option that will require Ackman to convert some or all of
the outstanding balance of the loan to equity, according to the
filing. 
A lawyer representing the company told Gropper at an April
16 hearing that the opportunity to convert the loan to equity
was an important inducement to the company in taking the loan. 
The U.S. Trustee&#8217;s Office, the arm of the Justice
Department that monitors bankruptcy cases, has scheduled an
April 24 meeting at the New York Marriott Marquis to form an
unsecured creditors&#8217; committee in the case. 
Gropper on April 16 gave General Growth the right to use
so-called cash collateral owed to lenders to continue operating
its business until he decides on the bankruptcy loan. According
to court papers filed with the company&#8217;s Chapter 11 petition,
the company will have about $122.4 million in cash on hand at
the end of this week and expects that amount to rise to $238.7
million by July. 
The case is In re General Growth Properties Inc., 09-11977,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.

General Growth&#8217;s Reliance on Debt May Allow Rivals to Buy Malls 
General Growth Properties Inc.&#8217;s purchase of Rouse Co. for
$11.3 billion in 2004 added almost $10 billion in debt to its
balance sheet and led the second-largest U.S. mall owner to file
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection April 16, according to
analysts. 
Purchasing Rouse gave General Growth malls including
Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall, New York&#8217;s South Street Seaport and the
Woodlands in Houston. Chief Executive Officer John Bucksbaum
said the deal amounted to &#8220;five years worth of acquisitions in
one fell swoop.&#8221; 
&#8220;The fatal flaw was financing this giant purchase
exclusively with debt,&#8221; said Jim Sullivan, head of retail REIT
research at Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, California-based property research company. 
Mall owners Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), Macerich Co. (MAC) and
Taubman Centers Inc. (TCO) rallied April 16 on speculation that the
biggest real estate bankruptcy in the U.S. will allow
competitors to buy General Growth assets at a discount. 
William Ackman, whose firm owns about 25 percent of General
Growth, said he doesn&#8217;t think the real estate investment trust
will have to resort to a fire sale. 
The Rouse acquisition gave General Growth, the owner of
about 200 properties in 44 states, premier malls with strong
occupancy rates and tenants. The company already has tried to
sell South Street Seaport as well as Las Vegas developments like
Fashion Show and the Shoppes at the Palazzo. 
The Chicago-based company was blocked by the global credit
freeze from refinancing some of the $27.3 billion of debt.
General Growth&#8217;s debt-to-asset ratio was 92 percent at the time
it sought protection, according to the filing. 
The bankruptcy may remake the nation&#8217;s mall business and
allow Simon to strengthen its position as the No. 1 mall owner,
said Dan Fasulo, managing director at real estate research firm
Real Capital Analytics.

Abitibi-Consolidated Files for Bankruptcy in U.S. 
Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., a Canadian unit of
AbitibiBowater Inc., sought bankruptcy protection in the U.S.
after lenders refused to accept a proposed debt restructuring. 
Abitibi-Consolidated listed assets and debt of more than $1
billion in a Chapter 15 petition filed April 17 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. Chapter 15 allows a
company to seek protection from creditors in the U.S. while its
primary bankruptcy case is pending in another country. Abitibi-Consolidated Co. of Canada also sought protection. 
The newsprint company said April 18 in a statement that
both courts granted the requests it made April 17 and it will be
able to keep paying employees and fulfilling customer orders.
Also, Abitibi-Consolidated will be allowed to enter into debtor-in-possession financing commitments totaling about $200 million
for certain subsidiaries. 
The company said its shares will be delisted from the New
York and Toronto stock exchanges.

Washington Gaming Files for U.S. Bankruptcy Protection 
Washington Gaming Inc., a non-hotel gaming and recreation
company, sought protection in a U.S. bankruptcy court in Seattle
on April 15. 
The company filed under Chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code,
which lets foreign companies reorganize outside the U.S. while
protecting them from U.S. lawsuits and creditor claims.
Washington Gaming&#8217;s main foreign proceeding is in the Supreme
Court of British Columbia in Vancouver, according to papers
filed in the bankruptcy court in Seattle. 
Washington Gaming has assets of $1 million to $10 million
and debts of $10 million to $50 million, court papers said.
Washington Gaming&#8217;s foreign representative is Deloitte  Touche

News-Journal Exploring Chapter 11 Reorganization, Paper Says 
The News-Journal Corp. is seeking to cut its ties with Cox
Enterprises by hiring a bankruptcy lawyer so the company may
explore reorganizing its debt, the paper reported. 
The potential bankruptcy filing was mentioned during a
court hearing by Bruce A. Hanna, an attorney representing the
newspaper in a civil suit, the paper said. 
Hanna said a Chapter 11 filing would allow the Daytona
Beach, Florida-based paper to continue operating and save
several hundred jobs, the News-Journal reported April 17. 
Cox Enterprises Inc. owns 47.5 percent of the newspaper the
paper said. 
GM Is Still Working on New Plan With U.S. to Avoid Bankruptcy 
General Motors Corp. (GM) is still working with U.S. Treasury
officials on its restructuring plan and trying to avoid
bankruptcy, Chief Executive Officer Fritz Henderson said on a
conference call on April 17. He described the process as &#8220;much
like a private-equity due-diligence process.&#8221; 
The Obama administration said last month that GM&#8217;s initial
plan to cut costs and keep a government loan isn&#8217;t sufficient.
Henderson says talks continue with debt holders and unions to
get deeper cuts. The company is operating with $13.4 billion in
U.S. loans and probably still will need $4.6 billion in
additional aid this quarter, Henderson said. 
No decision has been made on the amount or timing of
additional federal loans beyond the $13.4 billion GM has
borrowed so far, Henderson said. GM initially had asked for as
much as $16.6 billion in additional loans. Henderson didn&#8217;t
specify timing for when funding would be needed. 
The Detroit automaker has decided to keep its AC Delco
parts unit and has about three bidders for its Hummer brand,
Henderson said. GM also said it has several parties interested
in buying its Saturn and Saab brands and investing in its German
Opel unit. 
GM has received expressions of interest for a stake in its
Opel division from &#8220;well more than six investors,&#8221; including
financial companies and manufacturers, Henderson said on a
conference call. 
To stay out of court protection, Henderson needs agreements
from unions and debt holders for savings beyond GM&#8217;s Feb. 17
proposal for slashing $47 billion in unsecured claims by 59
percent. 
GM plans to make a formal offer to bondholders by April 27
to exchange their $27.5 billion in claims for equity, according
to a person with knowledge of the discussions. President Barack Obama&#8217;s automotive task force told GM to try to restructure its
debt out of court, people familiar with the matter said. 
Notes on Public Companies 
Unisys Reviews Debt Options as Credit Line Expires Next Month 
Unisys Corp. (UIS), with more than $2 billion of losses in the
past four years, may lose its line of credit next month, making
it harder and more costly to pay off its 2010 notes as sales
dwindle in the recession. 
The computer-services manager for the U.S. government
probably won&#8217;t be able to renew a $275 million credit line that
expires May 31, according to a filing last month. The line is
provided by banks led by Bank of America Corp. Unisys, which
ended last year with $544 million in cash and has $300 million
of debt due in March, said it&#8217;s reviewing options to pay off the
notes. 
Unisys had $62.1 million outstanding from the credit line
at the end of last year. 
Sales at Unisys have fallen as customers switch to servers
from the mainframe computers that once were its main business.
The company now relies on services such as managing clients&#8217;
computer networks for more than 80 percent of sales. 
Unisys debt is rated junk, or below investment grade, and
has a negative outlook from Fitch, Moody&#8217;s Corp. and Standard 
Poor&#8217;s. As of April 16, its borrowing costs were about 12 times
higher than those of Affiliated Computer and 48 times industry
leader IBM, based on debt yields.

Six Flags Offers Debt For Equity Exchange on Senior Notes 
Six Flags Inc. (SIX), the New-York based owner of amusement
parks, said it is offering to exchange $588.3 million of its
senior notes for equity. Bond holders would receive about 19
shares for each $1,000 in principle, as well as accrued and
unpaid interest through June 25 on senior notes due 2010, 2013,
and 2014, the company said April 17 in a statement. The proposal
requires 95 percent of the holders to accept the offer and their
tenders would eliminate restrictive covenants and events of
default in the current bond agreement. Six Flags, which missed a
$7 million interest payment, seeks to restructure before a
mandatory Aug. 15 redemption of $287.5 million of Preferred
Income Equity Redeemable Shares, known as PIERS. A Fitch analyst
described this type of offer as a &#8220;coercive debt exchange.&#8221;

Lender Processing Trades Halted on Inquiry News; Bankruptcy Link 
Lender Processing Services Inc. stock trading was halted on
the morning of April 17 after Dow Jones News Service reported
that the company is being investigated by the U.S. Department of
Justice. The probe is linked to evidence that emerged in a U.S.
Bankruptcy Court. 
Federal prosecutors are probing whether Lender Processing&#8217;s
automated mortgage systems provided inaccurate information to
lawyers who rely on it for court evidence, Dow Jones said. 
The company&#8217;s stock plunged as much as 37 percent after Dow
Jones News Service reported that the company was the subject of
an inquiry by the U.S. Trustees Office, an arm of the Justice
Department that monitors bankruptcy courts. 
A ruling by Judge Diane Weiss Sigmund in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Philadelphia questioned inaccurate court filings made
by HSBC Mortgage Corp. in a personal bankruptcy case. HSBC
relied on electronic information from a Lender Processing system
that manages foreclosure data. Sigmund&#8217;s 58-page decision,
released April 16, said the homes of &#8220;poor and unfortunate
debtors&#8221; threatened with foreclosure were at issue. 
Lender Processing, based in Jacksonville, Florida, runs an
automated system to track mortgage payments and defaults and as
recently as 2007 was used by 39 of the country&#8217;s 50 largest
banks, according to Sigmund&#8217;s ruling. 
Lender Processing issued a statement on PRNewswire saying
it was unaware of an investigation and has voluntarily
cooperated with the U.S. Trustee&#8217;s office.

BearingPoint Gets Approval to Sell Most Assets to Deloitte 
BearingPoint Inc., the bankrupt provider of computer
services to the U.S. Navy, won permission to sell most of its
assets to Deloitte LLP for about $350 million. In approving the
sale, a bankruptcy judge overruled concerns that the sale gutted
the estate to the detriment of many creditors. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber said in Manhattan court
on April 17 that BearingPoint can proceed with the sale to New
York-based Deloitte 60 days into its reorganization, after
receiving no competing bids. 
Business partners objected to the way the sale might treat
intellectual property. Bondholders, unsecured creditors and
noteholders objected to the sale. Concerns were also raised that
the sale would cut off the right to pursue claims in lawsuits.
Gerber told the parties to amend the sale agreement to resolve
objections. 
Gerber was concerned that a delay might decrease the value
of BearingPoint&#8217;s assets as its liquidity dwindles. He also
ruled April 17 that BearingPoint&#8217;s managers and directors acted
in &#8220;good faith&#8221; in deciding to make the sale, a finding that
would shield them from lawsuits claiming otherwise. 
The case is In re BearingPoint Inc., 09-10691, U.S.

Delphi Corp. Drops Claim Against Tepper&#8217;s Appaloosa Management 
Delphi Corp. dropped a part of its complaint against
Appaloosa Management LP that claimed the hedge fund worked to
scuttle the auto-parts maker&#8217;s bankruptcy exit loan and sold
short Delphi securities while saying it would support the
company&#8217;s emergence from Chapter 11. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Drain gave Delphi permission
to amend its complaint at a hearing April 17 in New York. Delphi
chose to drop a portion of the complaint because it was having
difficulty collecting sufficient evidence to show willful
misconduct, according to court papers. 
Troy, Michigan-based Delphi sued after an Appaloosa-led
group of investors backed out of a $2.55 billion deal to buy
equity in its reorganized business in April 2008 on the day
Delphi planned to exit bankruptcy. Appaloosa said Delphi didn&#8217;t
meet the deal&#8217;s terms and was relying too heavily on former
parent General Motors Corp. for financial support. Delphi said
it complied with the terms of the deal. 
A trial is planned for mid-June. 
The bankruptcy case is: In re Delphi Corp., 05-44481, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
adversary case is Delphi v. Appaloosa Management LP, 08-1232,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York

AbitibiBowater May Get Loans of Up to $600 Million, Globe Says 
AbitibiBowater Inc., North America&#8217;s biggest newsprint
maker, which filed for Chapter 11 protection April 16, may get
loans of as much as $600 million from Avenue Capital Group and
Canada&#8217;s Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. (FFH) to help the company
restructure debt, the Globe and Mail reported. 
The two firms, which agreed to give AbitibiBowater a $206
million emergency loan to help the company reorganize, could win
$42 million in fees if the total $600 million is allocated, the
report said, citing court documents. 
GE Capital withdrew its bid to be one of AbitibiBowater&#8217;s
lenders in the restructuring process, the Globe reported, citing
people it didn&#8217;t identify. 
In other news about AbitibiBowater, credit-default swap
traders set a value of 3.25 cents on the dollar for bonds of
Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. 
The price means sellers of default protection on the
AbitibiBowater Inc. unit will pay 96.75 cents on the dollar to
settle the contracts. 
Eleven dealers, including JPMorgan Chase  Co., Barclays
Plc and Morgan Stanley, bid in the auction, administered by
Markit Group Ltd. and broker Creditex Group Inc. 
Briefly Noted 
American Sterling Bank of Sugar Creek, Missouri, became the
24th U.S. bank to fail this year, as a recession drives up
unemployment and makes it harder for homeowners to pay off
loans.  American Sterling, with assets of $181 million and total
deposits of $171.9 million, was closed April 17 by the Office of
Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. was
named receiver, according to a statement from the regulators.
Metcalf Bank of Lee&#8217;s Summit, Missouri, will assume deposits of
the closed bank. Metcalf Bank will buy about $173.6 million in
assets, with the FDIC sharing the losses on $100 million of
them. The cost to the agency&#8217;s insurance fund is estimated to be
$42 million. American Sterling&#8217;s three offices in the Kansas
City area will open as Metcalf branches tomorrow, and its other
two branches, in Carefree, Arizona, and Foothill Ranch,
California, will open April 20.

Downgrades 
Headwaters&#8217; Corporate Family Rating Downgraded by Moody&#8217;s 
Headwaters Inc. (HW), converter of fossil fuels and other
resources into alternative energy, had its corporate family
rating downgraded to Caa1 from B2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service
April 17, the ratings company said in a statement. 
Moody&#8217;s also downgraded the company&#8217;s senior secured credit
facility to B1 from B2 and the probability of default rating was
lowered to Caa1/LD, the statement said. The LD &#8220;denoted a
limited default&#8221; according to the statement. 
The downgrade &#8220;reflects earnings pressure on Headwaters
businesses due to weaknesses in the housing and commercial
construction sectors,&#8221; Moody&#8217;s said in the statement. Moody&#8217;s
also noted concern that the company had not &#8220;replaced or
extended its revolving credit facility, which matures in early
September, 2009 and is the company&#8217;s primary source of
liquidity,&#8221; the statement said. 
Mega Brands, Toymaker, Sees Moody Downgrade Its Ratings 
Mega Brands, Inc., worldwide maker and marketer of toys,
had its ratings and those of its guaranteed subsidiaries
downgraded by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service April 17, according to a
statement issued by the ratings company. 
Moody&#8217;s downgraded the corporate family rating to Ca from
Caa2 and the probability of default rating to Caa3 from Caa2,
the statement said. The ratings outlook is negative, according
to the statement. 
Moody&#8217;s said the ratings downgrades reflect the &#8220;fact that
financial flexibility of the company deteriorated further in the
fourth quarter of 2008 due both to lower than expected sales and
high costs,&#8221; the statement said. Moody&#8217;s noted that the company
faces challenges that include risks specific to the toy industry
and general risks of the retail business. 
MetoKote, Industrial Coating Maker, Downgraded by SP 
MetoKote Inc., a maker of industrial coating for autos,
appliances and other applications, saw its corporate credit
rating downgraded to CCC+ from B by Standard  Poor&#8217;s Ratings
Services on April 17, a statement by the ratings service said. 
SP said in the statement the &#8220;outlook is developing.&#8221; 
SP also lowered the issue-level rating on the company&#8217;s
senior secured debt to CCC+ from B+, revising its recovery
rating to 3 from 2, indicating its expectation of meaningful
recovery for lenders in the event of a payment default, the
statement said. The ratings were removed from CreditWatch, where
they had been placed with negative implications on Nov. 13,
according to the statement. 
The downgrade reflect SP&#8217;s view that &#8220;declining light-vehicle sales and production in North America and Europe during
2009 will continue to lower the company&#8217;s profitability and cash
flow generation,&#8221; the statement said.

Municipal bondholders with $700
million of General Motors Corp.-backed debt will have to wait
until the company develops a plan to exit bankruptcy to find out
how much, if anything, will be repaid. 
GM, the largest manufacturer to go bankrupt, has used the
municipal bond market to pay for features at plants from
Michigan to Georgia. The Detroit-based carmaker&#8217;s plan for
repayment &#8220;is still being evaluated,&#8221; and a decision will be
made by the time a new company is formed to emerge from
bankruptcy, said GM spokeswoman Julie Gibson. 
&#8220;The investors are in limbo,&#8221; said Richard Lehmann, a
registered investment adviser in Miami Lakes, Florida, and
president of Income Securities Advisors Inc. &#8220;There&#8217;s real
concern for the bondholders.&#8221; 
Unsecured corporate bondholders will share in a 10 percent
stake in the new GM when the company emerges from Chapter 11
bankruptcy, according to court documents. The new government-controlled GM will keep major assets of the old company. GM
backed 15 bond issues in eight states totaling just over $700
million, Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;There is uncertainty about what&#8217;s going to happen in
bankruptcy,&#8221; said Dan Solender, who oversees $10 billion as
director of municipal bond management at Lord Abbett  Co. in
Jersey City, New Jersey. His firm owns about $7 million of GM-backed bonds in Ohio and Michigan, according to Bloomberg data. 
Tax Exempt 
Federal laws allow state and local governments to lend
their names to corporations wanting to sell tax-exempt debt for
specific types of facilities at plants such as pollution-control
or sewer systems. 
The municipalities that allow their names to be used to
sell the debt don&#8217;t bear any liability for repayment. So far,
none of the General Motors-backed debt has missed any payments,
according to Bloomberg data. A June 1 payment due for bonds sold
for pollution-control equipment at a facility in Fort Wayne,
Indiana, was made, according to Bloomberg data. 
Repayment will hinge, as it has in other bankruptcies
involving corporate-backed municipal debt, on whether GM decides
to keep an asset funded with the debt in the company going
forward, said James Spiotto, a partner and municipal bankruptcy
expert with the law firm of Chapman  Cutler in Chicago. 
&#8220;Until it is clear what&#8217;s going to happen with the assets,
you can&#8217;t predict what&#8217;s going to happen with the debt,&#8221;
Spiotto said. 
Anticipating Bankruptcy 
Prices of some GM-backed municipal bonds had fallen in
recent months to less than 10 cents on the dollar, Bloomberg
data show, as investors sold the debt in anticipation of
bankruptcy. Those prices are similar to unsecured benchmark GM
corporate bonds, which have risen since the filing. 
GM-backed municipal debt has risen since the filing earlier
this week. A GM-backed bond for a solid waste disposal facility
at a plant in Moraine, Ohio, traded at 9.75 cents on the dollar
in April. After the filing it rose as high as 15 cents. 
The prices are based on investors&#8217; estimates about how much
debt in the new company will be worth, said John Miller, chief
investment officer of Nuveen Asset Management in Chicago.
Nuveen, which has about $115 billion under management, sold its
GM-backed municipal securities earlier this year. 
&#8220;Fifteen cents on the dollar is probably pretty close to
what GM&#8217;s unsecured obligations are worth today,&#8221; Miller said.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, failed to maintain its patent on the hypertension
drug Norvasc in Canada after a federal judge granted Ratiopharm
GmbH permission to sell a generic version of the medicine. 
More than 7.8 million prescriptions of amlodipine besylate,
marketed by Pfizer as Norvasc, are sold annually in Canada, Ulm,
Germany-based Ratiopharm said yesterday. A generic version
probably will save Canadian patients about C$180 million ($155
million) a year, the closely held company said. Pfizer said it
will appeal. 
&#8220;We are extremely pleased at the decision by the Federal
Court,&#8221; Jean-Guy Goulet, chief executive officer of Ratiopharm
Canada, said in a statement. &#8220;This decision opens the
amlodipine patent to generic manufacturers in Canada, the last
major jurisdiction where the patent was held.&#8221; 
Ratiopharm challenged the Canadian patent in 2004 and won
in 2006. Pfizer successfully reversed the ruling on appeal.
Ratiopharm then sued to invalidate Pfizer&#8217;s patent, with Judge
Roger Hughes ruling in favor of Ratiopharm yesterday. 
The three-paragraph judgment says the patent is &#8220;invalid
and void&#8221; and orders the Canadian Patent Office to record an
entry to that effect. Hughes didn&#8217;t release the reasons for his
decision, giving the two sides 20 days to make submissions on
which portions of the reasons should remain confidential. 
Pfizer said in a statement that it will ask the Federal
Court of Appeal of Canada to overturn the decision. The New
York-based company also said legal challenges to the patent in
Canada by other drugmakers are still pending. 
&#8220;Pfizer remains committed to protecting its intellectual
property rights and to ensuring the long-term viability of its
research and development programs,&#8221; the company said in the
statement. 
Ratio-Amlodipine, Ratiopharm&#8217;s version of Norvasc, will be
available in Canadian pharmacies &#8220;imminently,&#8221; the company
said. Norvasc sales plunged 52 percent in the first quarter of
2008 to $513 million after generic copies of the medicine came
on the U.S. market in March 2007. 
The case is Ratiopharm Inc. v. Pfizer Ltd., T-1712-07,
Federal Court of Canada (Toronto). 
Ocean Spray Patents Cranberry-Based Breast-Cancer Treatment 
Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. (OCESO), a marketing cooperative based
in Lakeville, Massachusetts, received a U.S. patent on a method
of using cranberry seed oil to treat and prevent breast cancer. 
Patent 7,517,540, covers cranberry seed oil used to lower
blood cholesterol, prevent blood clotting, inflammatory
illnesses, autoimmune disorders and cancer. The patent also
covers methods of extracting cranberry seed oil in a form
suitable for adding to food, dietary supplements, or
pharmaceutical compositions. 
Ocean Spray applied for the patent in November 2003, with
the assistance of Boston&#8217;s Lahive  Cockfield LLP. 
Vizio Gets Favorable U.S. Customs Ruling Against Funio Patent 
Vizio Inc., the maker of flat-panel television sets sold by
Costco Wholesale Corp. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc., will be able to
continue bringing its Taiwan-made televisions into the U.S., the
Irvine, California-based company said in a July 8 statement.
Vizio says it&#8217;s the No. 1 seller of flat-panel high-definition
television sets in the U.S. 
The company said the U.S. Customs and Border Protection
Agency issued a ruling finding the Vizio sets don&#8217;t infringe
U.S. Patent 6,115,074 owned by Japan&#8217;s Funai Electric Co. In
March, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued its final
rejection of the disputed patent. 
Vizio then sued Funai in federal court in Virginia on May
20, accusing the Japanese company of infringing seven patents
related to flat-panel televisions. 
Rob Brinkman, Vizio&#8217;s vice president of operations, said
the customs ruling, together with the patent office action, will
bring the question of whether it&#8217;s infringing Funio&#8217;s patent to
a close. 
The case is Vizio v. Funai Electric Co., 2:09-cv-00236-RGD-JEW, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Norfolk). 
310 Holdings Seeks U.S. Patent on Plastic-to-Oil Process 
310 Holdings Inc. filed an application for a U.S. patent on
a process for breaking down molecules in order to extract fuel
from plastic, the Niagara Falls, Ontario-based company said in a
statement yesterday. 
The process, known as &#8220;Plastic2Oil,&#8221; can extract one
liter of fuel from a kilogram of plastic, according to the
statement. The process can be completed in four hours from &#8220;a
large source of raw unwashed, mixed plastic,&#8221; the company said
in its statement. 
It&#8217;s acquiring from China the apparatus used to perform
this process, the company said, with the arrival expected in
mid-August. John Bordynuik, 301 Holdings&#8217; president and chief
executive, said in the statement that his company will
demonstrate the process as soon as its application is accepted
by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and the apparatus
arrives from China. 
Operations will take place at a new office in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, according to the company statement. 
Copyright 
EU Seeks to Reform Copyright Rules to Compete With Google Books 
The European Union&#8217;s executive arm plans to change
copyright rules that have prevented the bloc&#8217;s Internet
companies from competing with Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s book-scanning
service. 
Viviane Reding, European media commissioner, said common EU
rules are needed so companies can provide an alternative to
Google&#8217;s Web-based book publication service. 
Reding said she understands &#8220;the fears of many publishers
and librarians facing the market power of Google.&#8221; Internet
companies are frustrated by the &#8220;fragmented regulatory system
in Europe,&#8221; she said in a speech in Brussels yesterday. 
Reding&#8217;s call for harmonized rules follows complaints from
German authors that Google, owner of the most-visited Internet
search engine, is violating copyright laws by allowing their
works to be viewed online free of charge and without previous
author approval. Google, based in Mountain View, California, is
creating an online book database by scanning millions of titles
from libraries. 
The company reached a $125 million deal with publishers
last year to settle copyright issues. The U.S. Justice
Department began an antitrust probe last month of the
settlement, which could make Google the main online source for
millions of out-of-print books. 
&#8220;Book digitization projects send a strong signal that
authors, publishers, libraries and technology companies can work
together to bring back to life the world&#8217;s lost books,&#8221;
Santiago de la Mora, Google&#8217;s head of European book
partnerships, said in an e-mailed statement. 
Germany asked European regulators in May to look into how
the settlement, which must be reviewed by a U.S. federal court,
affects authors&#8217; rights in the EU. 
Reding said 90 percent of books in Europe&#8217;s national
libraries are no longer commercially available for scanning.
That&#8217;s because they are either out of print or so-called orphan
books, titles for which no one can be identified to give
permission for digital use, she said. 
Without change &#8220;attractive content offers won&#8217;t take place
in Europe, but on the other side of the Atlantic,&#8221; Reding said. 
She proposed a registry for out-of-print and orphan books
that would allows authors to get &#8220;fair remuneration&#8221; for
online publications. A registry would help end the &#8220;rather
ideological debate&#8221; on Google books, she said. 
Symantec Gets $18 Million in Judgments Over Software 
Symantec Corp. (SYMC), the world&#8217;s largest maker of security
software, said yesterday it was awarded a total of $18.6 million
in damages against two closely held companies that it accused of
distributing fake versions of its products. 
Federal courts in Los Angeles and San Jose, California,
ruled against V-Micro Inc. and Higher Model Computer LLC in
February, court records show. Symantec waited to publicize the
awards to &#8220;squeeze&#8221; the companies for information about their
distribution networks and locate &#8220;bigger fish,&#8221; said Cris Paden, a spokesman for Cupertino, California-based Symantec. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve never really focused on recovering damages in these
types of rulings,&#8221; Paden said yesterday in an e-mail. &#8220;Our
main focus has always been to protect unsuspecting users and
prospective customers.&#8221; 
U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti on Feb. 4 ordered New
Jersey-based V-Micro to pay Symantec $9.7 million for violating
its trademarks and copyrights by distributing counterfeit
software. Two weeks later, U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson in
Los Angeles ordered Connecticut-based Higher Model to pay $8.9
million. Court records show that neither company had responded
to the complaints, which were filed in 2007 and 2008. 
&#8220;The damage awards are a way of financially crippling the
piracy rings by having a legal ruling to seize their assets,
usually to pay for damages,&#8221; Paden said. 
The companies were accused of selling knockoffs of Symantec
products including Norton Antivirus and Norton Ghost. The
default judgment rulings against the companies bar them from
using the copyrighted software or the trademarked product names. 
Representatives of V-Micro and Higher Model couldn&#8217;t be
reached for comment through phone directory listings, and
lawyers for the companies weren&#8217;t listed on court dockets. 
Higher Model was sued by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in 1999 for
dealing in counterfeit software, Symantec said in court papers.
A federal court in Connecticut awarded Microsoft money damages
and a court order barring Higher Model from violating its
trademarks or copyrights, Symantec said. 
Symantec learned that Higher Model was buying Symantec-branded software from unauthorized distributors and selling it
to customers who thought it was legitimate. Symantec bought the
disks and inspected them for authenticity. In 2006, the company
warned Higher Model it was dealing in counterfeit products and
later sent it a cease-and-desist letter. 
&#8220;The defendants willfully and maliciously continued to
purchase and sell counterfeit Symantec products even after they
were given an opportunity by Symantec to purchase from
legitimate distributors,&#8221; the software maker said in court
filings. 
The cases are Symantec Corp. v. Higher Model Computer LLC,
2:07-cv-06581, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles) and Symantec Corp. v. V-Micro Inc.,
3:08-cv-02063, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). 
Trademark 
Mary Kay Sues Yahoo! for Infringement by Hyperlinks in E-Mails 
Mary Kay Corp. sued Yahoo! Inc. for trademark infringement. 
The Sunnyvale, California-based Internet media company is
accused of inserting hyperlinks that infringe the Mary Kay
trademarks into messages sent to those who receive e-mail on
Yahoo! Mail. 
These hyperlink ads are often from unauthorized resellers
of Mary Kay cosmetics and neither the Dallas-based cosmetics
company nor its independent sales agents have authorized their
use of the company trademarks, according to court papers filed
July 6 in federal court in Dallas. 
Mary Kay says a &#8220;substantial number&#8221; of the recipients of
marketing emails sent by the cosmetics company or its authorized
independent consultants are users of Yahoo! Inc.&#8217;s e-mail
service. The recipients are likely to believe the hyperlink ads
were authorized by Mary Kay and are likely to be confused and
follow the links to unauthorized sellers, according to court
papers. 
The hyperlink ads appear &#8220;with no indication that the e-mails were manipulated and revised en route by Yahoo! without
the authorization of Mary Kay,&#8221; the cosmetics company said in
its pleadings. 
Mary Kay asked the court for an order barring Yahoo from
inserting &#8220;any hyperlinks, Webtags, advertisements, text or
other materials&#8221; using its marks into e-mails sent or received
by the Yahoo! Inc., e-mail subscribers. 
Additionally, it&#8217;s seeking an accounting and award of
Yahoo!&#8217;s profits related to the alleged infringement, attorney
fees and money damages. 
Veronica S. Lewis and Allen W. Yee of Houston-based Vinson
 Elkins LLP represent Mary Kay. 
The case is Mary Kay Inc., v. Yahoo Inc., 3:09-cv-01278-M,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas). 
Moulin Rouge SA Forces New Jersey Salon to Change Its Name 
Despite having spent years decorating the shop with a Paris
cabaret theme, owners of a New Jersey hair salon are changing
its name after being threatened with a trademark-infringement
suit, the Philadelphia Enquirer reported yesterday. 
Owners of Salon Moulin Rouge in Rockaway Township received
a letter from a lawyer representing Belgium&#8217;s Moulin Rouge SA,
according to the Enquirer. 
The Belgian company, which is represented by Deborah Nilson
of New York-based Rozan  Nilson, seldom licenses its name, the
lawyer told the Enquirer. 
Owners of the salon will invite members of the public to
pick a new name, the Enquirer reported. 
University of Utah Protests Shot of Logo in HBO&#8217;s &#8216;Big Love&#8217; 
Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s HBO received a cease-and-desist letter
from the University of Utah after a scene in the cable channel&#8217;s
polygamy drama &#8220;Big Love&#8221; showed what appeared to be the
university&#8217;s logo on a piece of letterhead, Salt Lake City&#8217;s
Deseret News reported. July 7. 
The use of the letterhead &#8220;may have led some viewers to
believe the school is associated with &#8216;Big Love,&#8217;&#8221; when it is
not, university spokeswoman Coralie Alder told the Deseret News. 
&#8220;We will not tolerate a misuse of our trademarks,
especially if it could lead the public to erroneously believe
the university is associated with a production over which the
university has no control, Michael Young, the university&#8217;s
president, said in a statement, according to the Deseret News. 
The cease-and-desist letter, sent on the university&#8217;s
behalf by its licensing agent, Collegiate Images, demanded that
shots including the logo be deleted from the episode and never
used again, the Deseret News reported.

Wasik</headline><body>
Banks continue to feast at the
bailout banquet while consumers are getting thrown the crumbs. 
The most vexing result of last year&#8217;s financial meltdown is
that loans are harder to get and more expensive, even if your
credit is good. Yet on Wall Street, happy days look like they
are here again. 
To almost no one&#8217;s surprise, the nation&#8217;s largest banks are
returning to their old, pre-crisis ways, even in the midst of a
$23.7 trillion bailout, the biggest financial rescue in history. 
Banks based on trading and highly leveraged business models
still pose a huge risk to the financial system, so much so that
our government has enshrined as policy the doctrine of &#8220;too big
to fail.&#8221; Haven&#8217;t we learned anything from the past year? 
While trading and investment-banking profits for Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. soared in the second
quarter, Washington&#8217;s attitude toward policing financial
services practices is still a weak, unpracticed theory. 
The second banking crisis unfolds with the realization that
&#8220;reckless banking practices&#8221; translated into $65 trillion in
global wealth lost since September 2007, says Nomi Prins, a
former Goldman Sachs managing director, who is publishing a book
on the financial debacle titled &#8220;It Takes A Pillage.&#8221; This
meltdown will continue to pummel Western economies for years if
not decades. 
Culture Thriving 
Prins, who once marketed collateralized debt obligations --
which were often used to bundle toxic mortgages -- notes that
the largest banks have actually grown during this crisis: Bank
of America Corp. took over Merrill Lynch  Co., JPMorgan assumed
Bear Stearns Cos. and Wells Fargo  Co. acquired Wachovia Corp. 
Bigger isn&#8217;t better for consumers. Prins says these
institutions have &#8220;less incentive (since they have more market
share) to offer higher savings rates, or broader credit terms to
consumers, or open mortgage restructuring policies, or even
lower fees on regular accounts -- they simply don&#8217;t have to, and
it was not a condition of their bailout money to make it so.&#8221; 
Nothing has changed in recent months, except that taxpayers
are increasingly getting treated as if they&#8217;re homeless and
begging for money. Congress has yet to find the gumption to make
lower financing rates and foreclosure-halting mortgage
modifications mandatory. 
Banks are bringing in more money, although they aren&#8217;t
making credit widely available, prolonging the recession. 
Consumers Aren&#8217;t Helped 
While two-thirds of all government-insured banks reported
asset growth in the first quarter, total loans fell by about
$160 billion, or 2.1 percent, according to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. 
Of those banks that received bailout money from the
government&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, only 29 of
103 surveyed said they loaned out funds for &#8220;residential
mortgage activities.&#8221; 
A July 21 report from the TARP special inspector general
also noted that 17 of 61 banks surveyed said they were doing
&#8220;other consumer lending&#8221; and only nine of 34 banks were doing
mortgage-loan modifications. 
Banks are missing in action on the foreclosure front as
well. Only a handful of mortgages for those facing default due
to higher adjustable rates or job losses are being modified. A
recent Federal Reserve of Boston study found that only 3 percent
of &#8220;seriously delinquent loans&#8221; were being made more
affordable by the banks they studied. 
Meanwhile, lending across the board has tightened.
Mortgages are difficult to obtain -- even for the most
creditworthy -- and banks are lowering credit-card limits, which
can impair one&#8217;s ability to borrow if your credit scores drop. 
Little Support 
Even as the cost of funds to banks has held near historic
lows since the end of last year, annual credit-card finance
rates rose from an average of 12.02 percent to 13.08 percent
between November and February, according to the Congressional
Oversight Panel. 
If anything, fees on credit cards and bank accounts will
continue to rise as banks try to recoup their losses and shift
their risk to you through obnoxious overdraft fees, higher
finance rates and lower credit limits. 
Want to push back? Just maybe the best treatment for mega-
banking&#8217;s avarice-addled culture is for us to stop enabling
their addiction. 
Your best recourse may be to limit credit card use, make
insured deposits at local thrifts and regional banks -- the
deposit insurance limit is generally $250,000 per account
through 2013 -- and turn to alternative sources of lending such
as credit unions and your own family. Avoid commission-based
services through banks, insurers and brokers. 
A brand-name big bank may represent the old way of doing
business. And that&#8217;s been one of the surest ways to part you
from your wealth.

Johnson Electric Holdings Ltd. (179), the
maker of electric motors used in cars around the world, advanced
to a 10-month high in Hong Kong stock-market trading after
Credit Suisse Group AG upgraded the stock to &#8220;outperform.&#8221; 
Johnson Electric climbed 6.5 percent to HK$2.78 as of 12:14
p.m. local time, set to close at its highest level since Oct. 3.
The stock has more than doubled this year. Kenny Lau, an analyst
at Credit Suisse, raised the stock from &#8220;underperform,&#8221; a report
dated today said. 
Johnson Electric gets 60 percent of its total revenue from
the automotive sector and is &#8220;set to be a multi-year structural
recovery story,&#8221; Lau wrote in the note. A U.S. government
program to boost its auto industry and growing sales in China
will boost Johnson Electric&#8217;s earnings, he wrote. 
The company makes about a quarter of its revenue in America.
The U.S. Congress has approved an emergency measure to grant an
extra $2 billion for the &#8220;cash for clunkers&#8221; auto purchase
program, which aims to increase the country&#8217;s vehicle sales.
July auto sales in the U.S. increased 16 percent from the
previous month, according to Lau&#8217;s report. 
&#8220;Johnson should soon feel the positive impact,&#8221; Lau said.
&#8220;Further improvement in the upcoming monthly car sales data
could be a powerful share-price driver.&#8221; 
The company said on June 5 that sales will improve in the
first half of its current financial year and predicted a return
to profitability.

President Barack Obama sent Congress
his plan to rein in the $592 trillion over-the-counter
derivatives industry, a measure that would cut into a profitable
market for banks led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) 
The proposal issued yesterday would pressure derivatives
users such as banks and hedge funds to move away from opaque
customized contracts by imposing higher capital and margin
requirements on the instruments. Standardized derivatives would
be moved to regulated exchanges or trading platforms and sent
through official clearinghouses, according to the draft measure. 
&#8220;The big broker dealers make a lot of money trading these
customized derivatives,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a banking analyst
for FBR Capital Markets in Arlington, Virginia. 
Custom derivatives are more profitable than contracts
traded over an exchange, so the dealers will work to get the
legislation &#8220;watered down,&#8221; Miller said. The derivatives
proposal is part of a broader overhaul of financial industry
rules meant to prevent a repeat of last year, when the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American International
Group Inc. (AIG) froze credit markets. 
&#8220;These markets have largely gone unregulated since their
inception,&#8221; the U.S. Treasury said in a statement yesterday.
&#8220;Enormous risks built up in these markets -- substantially out
of the view or control of regulators -- and these risks
contributed to the collapse of major financial firms in the past
year and severe stress throughout the financial system.&#8221; 
Biggest Users 
New York-based JPMorgan was the largest derivatives user
among U.S. banks as of March 31, with $81.2 trillion in notional
contracts, according to the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency. New York-based Goldman Sachs was the second-biggest
with $39.9 trillion, followed by Bank of America Corp. with
$38.9 trillion and Citibank N.A. with $29.6 trillion. 
The draft legislation would require the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
to set capital and margin requirements for non-bank swap dealers
and &#8220;major swap participants&#8221; that are &#8220;as strict or
stricter&#8221; than those set for U.S. depository institutions by
federal bank examiners, according to the proposal. 
Hedge funds and private equity firms would be among the
hardest hit, said Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at
research firm Federal Financial Analytics in Washington. Unlike
federally insured banks, hedge funds and other corporations
aren&#8217;t currently subject to capital standards. 
&#8220;A lot of the big counterparties, like AIG, lack the
capital to back their bets,&#8221; Petrou said. 
&#8216;Back Your Debts&#8217; 
&#8220;Hedge funds and private equity players would be the ones
for which the capital requirement would be the highest reach,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;It makes it hard to be a trader when you have to put
up capital to back your debts.&#8221; 
Derivatives are contracts used to hedge against changes in
stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, interest rates and
weather. Credit-default swaps are derivatives created primarily
to protect lenders and bondholders from company defaults. 
The Obama legislation sent to Capitol Hill yesterday
mirrors the administration&#8217;s preliminary proposals by asking
Congress to impose higher capital and margin requirements, move
most derivatives to regulated exchanges and clearinghouses and
impose supervision over all dealers. The legislation also aims
to &#8220;better protect&#8221; small municipalities and &#8220;unsophisticated
investors&#8221; by limiting their eligibility to trade derivatives. 
The Justice Department is investigating at least seven
former JPMorgan bankers for possible violations for selling
unregulated derivatives to local governments, according to
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority records. Former bankers
from Wachovia Corp. and Bear Stearns Cos. are also under
investigation, according to filings with Finra, the largest
self-regulator for securities firms doing business in the U.S. 
Frank&#8217;s Support 
House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat, told reporters last month he supports
proposals to restrict derivatives sales to municipalities. 
Banks that are derivatives dealers and major market
participants would be regulated by federal banking agencies,
while non-bank investors would be regulated by the SEC and the
CFTC, according to the Treasury statement. The industry would be
subject to greater disclosure requirements, giving regulators
confidential access to data on transactions and open positions
and giving the public aggregate data and trading volumes. 
&#8220;What&#8217;s really starting to hit home is how bifurcated the
regulatory environment&#8217;s going to be for the OTC swap market,&#8221;
said Kevin McPartland, a senior analyst in New York at TABB
Group, a financial-market research and advisory firm. The dual
regulators will create &#8220;a reporting registration nightmare,&#8221;
he said. 
&#8216;Complicated and Costly&#8217; 
&#8220;Operationally and legally, at least for a few years, it
seems like it&#8217;s going to be complicated and costly,&#8221; he said. 
Congress, which is scheduled to return from recess on Sept.
8, must reconcile the Obama administration&#8217;s ideas with other
legislative proposals already under consideration. 
Frank and House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat, have already embraced many of
Obama&#8217;s plans for derivatives markets, according to a three-page
proposal they released last month. Lawmakers still need to
decide how to split oversight and enforcement between the SEC
and CFTC. 
Opaque financial products, including some derivatives,
contributed to almost $1.6 trillion in writedowns and losses at
the world&#8217;s biggest banks, brokers and insurers since the start
of 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Exxon Mobil Corp. is trying to put
one over on you. 
The world&#8217;s biggest publicly traded oil company wants you
to believe that it actually supports the fight against global
warming. But its tactics, which have been unfolding on opposite
sides of the globe, are just another recipe for cooking the
planet in three easy steps. 
Exxon&#8217;s old formula wasn&#8217;t working anymore. The oil giant
used to bankroll scientists who claimed all that stuff about
starving polar bears and melting ice caps was just mumbo jumbo.
In a 1998 memo, the American Petroleum Institute -- the industry
group in which Exxon has long been dominant -- said it would
achieve &#8220;victory&#8221; when doubts about climate science become
&#8220;part of the &#8216;conventional wisdom.&#8217;&#8221; That helped create a
noisy minority of skeptics, but it won&#8217;t block climate
legislation forever. 
So now Exxon is playing a more subtle game. It runs plenty
of ads featuring people in lab coats talking about clean energy.
It spent $15 million on Washington lobbyists in the first half
of this year -- more than all the solar and wind companies
combined. And it has created its new three-step program, which
is based on bad economics instead of shady science. 
Step One: Gin up some frightening numbers, and use scare
tactics and lobbying muscle to kill the Obama administration&#8217;s
proposed mandatory cap on carbon emissions. 
Job-Killer 
As the U.S. Senate begins work on the climate-change bill,
which squeaked through the House of Representatives in June,
Exxon is among those denouncing the plan to cap emissions as a
stealth tax that would destroy jobs and drive up energy costs.
How does the oil producer know this? Because think tanks funded
by Exxon and others say so. 
The company announced last year that it had stopped giving
money to global-warming skeptics who &#8220;divert attention&#8221; from
the need for clean energy. 
Instead, it supports groups such as the American Council
for Capital Formation and the National Center for Policy
Analysis, which issue industry-friendly research. One study
released in May by the Heritage Foundation, which received at
least $50,000 from Exxon last year, claims that by putting a
price on carbon, the measure will kill millions of jobs and send
gasoline soaring. 
The study has been criticized for making wildly pessimistic
economic assumptions -- no energy efficiency gains, no increased
use of renewables -- and for ignoring the bill&#8217;s many cost
containment provisions. The non-partisan Congressional Budget
Office found that middle-class households would pay only $175 a
year more in 2020 because of the legislation. 
Doomsday Study 
But let&#8217;s look closer. This doomsday study claims the
measure would drive gasoline prices to $4 a gallon -- in 2035!
If we don&#8217;t develop alternative energy, which is the whole point
of climate legislation, a gallon of gas will cost a lot more
than that in 25 years. The price of inaction is far higher than
the cost of acting now, though that&#8217;s not a discussion Exxon
wants to have. 
Step Two: Organize demonstrations. On Aug. 18, about 3,500
people rallied in Houston against the bill -- the first of some
20 such &#8220;Energy Citizen&#8221; events sponsored by API and other
industry groups. The participants were energy industry workers,
many of whom wore T-shirts saying, &#8220;I&#8217;ll Pass on $4 Gas.&#8221; 
How did they come to be there? A leaked memo from API
president Jack Gerard asked the group&#8217;s member companies to send
employees to the rallies to &#8220;focus our message&#8221; against
&#8220;Waxman-Markey-like legislation, tax increases, and (energy)
access limitations.&#8221; He also asked them to keep it quiet. 
Legislative Caricature 
Royal Dutch Shell and BP refused to participate in the
events because they support cap and trade, but Chevron,
ConocoPhillips and Anadarko Petroleum are involved, along with
more than 60 other businesses and associations. Exxon advised
its workers that attendance was &#8220;at their own discretion and
not required,&#8221; spokesman Rob Young told me, while saying that
Exxon &#8220;opposes this deeply flawed legislation&#8221; and agrees with
the rally&#8217;s job-killer message. How could it not? It helped pay
for studies that &#8220;prove&#8221; the point. 
Step 3: Offer a seemingly sensible alternative policy.
Having caricatured the legislation, Exxon then offers a
compromise. That&#8217;s what it did in Australia earlier this month,
after the legislature shot down Prime Minister Kevin Rudd&#8217;s
climate proposal. Last week the chairman of Exxon&#8217;s Australian
unit, John Dashwood, called for replacing cap and trade with a
carbon tax. Echoing a January 2009 speech against cap and trade
by Chief Executive Rex Tillerson, Dashwood said the carbon tax
&#8220;is more transparent to consumers, will achieve greater
environmental benefits and is more difficult to manipulate than
a cap-and-trade program.&#8221; 
Tax Without Change 
Let&#8217;s get this straight. Exxon is demonstrating against a
climate bill in the U.S. because it is supposedly a hidden tax,
and on the other side of the globe it is lobbying for a tax.
This may seem contradictory, but it&#8217;s not. I believe the company
simply recognizes what so many others have missed in the debate
over the tax versus the cap: The cap requires economy-wide
emissions reductions, and the tax doesn&#8217;t. 
Exxon doesn&#8217;t want to do business in a world where cuts in
carbon dioxide are mandatory. It would prefer to pay a modest
tax and keep on polluting. 
A tax wouldn&#8217;t guarantee any carbon reductions, let alone
bring about the steep cuts needed to stave off the worst climate
changes. By calling for a small tax instead of a mandatory cap,
that&#8217;s exactly the kind of solution Exxon is proposing.

Australia approved Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s
A$50 billion ($42 billion) liquefied natural gas venture on a
remote island, adding stricter conditions to quell environmental
concerns about the nation&#8217;s biggest resources project. 
The additional terms for the Gorgon project will enable it
to proceed within a nature reserve &#8220;without unacceptable
impacts,&#8221; Environment Minister Peter Garrett said in Canberra
today. Chevron has said the venture off the northwest shelf may
produce its first LNG in 2014. 
The decision clears one of the final obstacles to Chevron,
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) building the venture
on Barrow Island, 50 kilometers (32 miles) off the West
Australian coast. Gorgon has contracts to supply fuel to China,
India and Japan and is among more than 12 LNG projects in the
region competing for Asian buyers. 
&#8220;Gorgon is big and going to fill the available hole&#8221; for
LNG demand, said Peter Arden, a Melbourne-based analyst at Ord
Minnett Ltd., an affiliate of JPMorgan Chase  Co. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
case for some of the proposed projects that if they don&#8217;t move
quickly then it may get congested and some might not make it.&#8221; 
The Gorgon partners will make a development decision after
they win production licenses from the Australian government and
development approvals from the Western Australian state
government, Nicole Hodgson, a Chevron spokeswoman, said today in
an e-mailed response to questions. 
Australia&#8217;s LNG Ambition 
Combined with Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)&#8217;s Pluto project due
to come on line in 2011, Gorgon would leapfrog Australia to
second place behind Qatar among global LNG producers. Australia
ranked sixth among LNG exporters in 2008, according to BP Plc&#8217;s
2009 statistical review of energy. 
Gorgon will have capacity to produce 15 million metric tons
of LNG a year, according to Chevron. Current Australian LNG
output of 20 million tons a year may eventually reach 100
million tons, Peter Cleary, president of North West Shelf LNG,
said this month, more than double Qatar&#8217;s current output. 
Environmentalists have opposed developing Gorgon and an oil
spill in the Timor Sea off the coast of Australia&#8217;s Kimberley
wilderness region five days ago renewed concerns over
exploration. 
Australian Greens Senator Rachel Siewert attacked today&#8217;s
decision, claiming Garrett is &#8220;signing off on the destruction
of this unique environment.&#8221; 
&#8216;Australia&#8217;s Ark&#8217; 
&#8220;Barrow Island is an A-Class Nature Reserve,&#8221; Siewert
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;It has been dubbed &#8216;Australia&#8217;s
Ark&#8217; for its unique range of endangered species.&#8221; 
The 202 square-kilometer (78 square-mile) island is a home
to flatback turtles, along with the burrowing bettong, a type of
small kangaroo that lives underground and has died out on the
mainland. The government describes flatbacks as &#8220;vulnerable.&#8221; 
Chevron must submit plans for approval covering the
protection of animals such as the spectacled hare-wallaby, the
bettong and the golden bandicoot among 28 additional conditions
for the project, Garrett said today. 
The San Ramon, California-based company must set up a
monitoring program to detect changes in the turtle population
and take measures to avoid impact on flatbacks, particularly
from light and noise, Garrett said. 
The venture, which Chevron says has enough gas to last 40
years, will pipe the fuel to Barrow Island from 11 fields that
contain about 40 trillion cubic feet, Exxon says on its Web site. 
Carbon Capture 
Carbon dioxide generated as the gas is turned into liquid
form will be captured and stored underground, reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent, Chevron says on its Web
site. The federal and Western Australian governments have agreed
to jointly pay any long-term liability arising from this plan,
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said Aug. 17. 
The ruling brings the three companies closer to building a
venture that on Aug. 18 secured Australia&#8217;s record export
contract with China at a time of tension between the countries.
PetroChina Co. will pay Irving, Texas-based Exxon $41 billion
over two decades for gas from Gorgon, the Australian government
said Aug. 18. 
China&#8217;s detention of Rio Tinto Group executives last month
and a visit by Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer to Australia have
strained relations between the two countries. Stern Hu, an
Australian passport holder, and three other Rio executives were
detained for allegedly stealing commercial secrets. 
PetroChina, Petronet 
Petronet LNG Ltd. (PLNG), India&#8217;s biggest importer of liquefied
natural gas, also signed an agreement with Exxon to buy 1.5
million metric tons of the fuel from Gorgon, the company said
Aug. 10 in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange. The venture
also has accords to supply the fuel to Japanese utilities Tokyo
Gas Co., Osaka Gas Co., and Chubu Electric Power Co. 
Gorgon will generate about A$40 billion in revenue for the
Western Australian and federal governments that will be used to
build schools, hospitals and roads, Rudd said on Aug. 17. About
6,000 jobs will be created at the peak of construction, he said. 
Western Australia will earn about A$100 million a year from
Gorgon revenue, state Premier Colin Barnett said today. 
The Gorgon partners will buy about A$33 billion worth of
goods and services and sell LNG valued at around A$300 billion
to customers in the Asia-Pacific region over the next 20 years,
Rudd said. Chevron estimates the venture&#8217;s contribution to
Australia&#8217;s gross domestic product at A$64 billion, according to
its Web site. 
Chevron and its venture partners applied to resources and
Energy Minister Martin Ferguson for production licenses on Aug.
18, Rudd said in Parliament on Aug 20. 
Timor Sea Spill 
&#8220;The Gorgon Project has been deliberately sited to avoid
areas of particular conservation significance,&#8221; Roy Krzywosinski, managing director of Chevron&#8217;s Australia unit,
said today in a statement. 
Western Australian Premier Barnett made the A$50 billion
estimate of Gorgon&#8217;s construction costs in March, a figure that
would make it the country&#8217;s biggest resources project. The
venture has yet to release its own projection. 
PTT Exploration  Production Pcl (PTTEP), Thailand&#8217;s only publicly
traded exploration company, said it may take 50 days to stop an
oil and gas leak about 250 kilometers from the coast in an area
some 800 kilometers north of Barrow Island. 
LNG is natural gas that has been chilled to liquid form,
reducing it to one-six-hundredth of its original volume at minus
161 degrees Celsius (minus 259 Fahrenheit), for transportation
by ship to destinations not connected by pipeline. On arrival,
it&#8217;s turned back into gas for distribution to power plants,
factories and households.
