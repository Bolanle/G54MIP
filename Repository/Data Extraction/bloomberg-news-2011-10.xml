Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to lend its
Quigley unit as much as $65 million in cash to extend the
subsidiary&#8217;s bankruptcy, potentially giving Pfizer further
protection against claims for asbestos-related health issues. 
Quigley asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein for
permission to borrow the money in court papers filed July 29 in
Manhattan. The cash would extend Quigley&#8217;s $20 million loan
agreement from 2004, when the unit entered bankruptcy, and
finance the case until Feb. 24, 2012, Quigley said. 
The additional money and time will free Quigley to work
with Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, and a committee of
creditors &#8220;toward confirmation and consummation of a
reorganization plan,&#8221; Quigley said. 
Lawyers for the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice
Department, asked in December to end Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy.
Creditors alleging asbestos-related health issues have been
unable to sue New York-based Pfizer during the case, and many of
them have died, the U.S. Trustee said. 
Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company
looks forward to working through a bankruptcy plan with Quigley
and creditors, which the extension of the credit agreement will
allow. 
&#8220;In 30 years of asbestos litigation, Pfizer has never been
found to be derivatively liable for Quigley&#8217;s liabilities,&#8221;
Loder said. Quigley&#8217;s products were made for decades before
Pfizer acquired it, he said. 
Reorganization Hearing 
A hearing on a request to dismiss Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy or
approve proposed terms of its reorganization, set for Aug. 4,
was adjourned without being rescheduled, according to court
papers. 
Quigley Co., founded in 1916, made three products for the
steel industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained
asbestos. Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped
most operations in 1992. Pfizer said it never made or sold any
Quigley products, and some claimants hadn&#8217;t released Pfizer from
alleged &#8220;derivative liability.&#8221; 
Bernstein refused to allow Quigley to exit Chapter 11 court
protection in September, saying Pfizer had manipulated the
process to benefit itself. Pfizer and a committee of asbestos
claimants won his approval of an agreement that will support the
new Chapter 11 plan, which still requires court approval. 
A committee of creditors known as the &#8220;Ad Hoc Committee of
Tort Victims&#8221; asked in October 2010 to have Quigley&#8217;s
bankruptcy dismissed so it could bring tort claims, which are
otherwise blocked by bankruptcy law. 
&#8216;Asset-Less Dummy&#8217; 
In court papers, the group called Quigley an &#8220;asset-less
dummy entity that was resurrected, handed Pfizer&#8217;s money-losing
claims handling unit, and then propped up by Pfizer pursuant to
a non-arm&#8217;s-length contract of limited duration -- all in order
to provide Quigley&#8217;s extremely well-heeled non-debtor parent
Pfizer with a channeling injunction against present and future
asbestos claims.&#8221; 
The group said Quigley has depleted insurance assets to
sustain $54 million in operating losses and $34 million in
professional fees. 
Quigley&#8217;s sixth outline of a plan to reorganize, filed in
April, would have resolved disputes over how much Pfizer should
contribute by having it turn over a 281,581-square-foot building
leased to a brewery to help pay asbestos claims. The terms of
that reorganization also required Pfizer to forgive a secured
claim of $86 million, a $12.6 million bankruptcy loan and
unsecured claims of $33 million. The drugmaker would also
contribute $81 million in insurance proceeds, according to court
papers. 
Asbestos Claims 
Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. In November, Pfizer reported a $701
million third-quarter charge for asbestos litigation related to
Quigley. 
The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income trading revenue would likely be crimped
if the U.S. credit rating is downgraded, according to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst. 
A downgrade will bring a &#8220;never before experienced&#8221;
environment with changing rates, currency-market volatility and
widening credit spreads, Hintz wrote in a note to investors
today. &#8220;This environment will negatively impact trading
revenue, repo financing and debt capital markets activity,&#8221; he
said. Both firms have liquidity and capital &#8220;to navigate
challenging market conditions successfully.&#8221; 
President Barack Obama and Congressional leaders are
rushing to push through a compromise to raise the U.S. debt
limit by at least $2.1 trillion and slash government spending by
$2.4 trillion or more. Ratings companies including Standard 
Poor&#8217;s have warned that the nation may lose its top AAA
sovereign grade depending on the contents of the debt deal. 
While a downgrade is likely to happen soon, firms have had
time to prepare for the event, Hintz said. That means the
decline in Wall Street&#8217;s fixed-income trading revenue will
likely be less than the 36 percent drop that followed the 1998
Russian default, he wrote. 
&#8220;Wall Street&#8217;s fixed-income trading units are positioning
themselves in anticipation of a downgrade and are minimizing
their inventory positions,&#8221; Hintz wrote. &#8220;These events tend to
be painful but relatively short lived.&#8221; 
Viewed as &#8216;Manageable&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are based in New
York, may each have to post $5.2 billion in additional
collateral for so-called repurchase agreements, Hintz wrote.
Banks and other financial companies use U.S. Treasuries as
collateral for loans in repurchase-agreements, or repos, and the
prospect of a downgrade has raised questions about whether such
loans would become more expensive. 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mary Claire Delaney at Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment on the
note. 
Goldman&#8217;s senior executives view a potential downgrade of
the U.S.&#8217;s credit rating as &#8220;manageable,&#8221; Citigroup Inc.
analysts led by Keith Horowitz wrote in a note to investors last
week. The analysts said that they met with Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar, Co-Head of Securities Harvey M. Schwartz, and Co-Head of Investment Banking David M. Solomon. 
&#8220;Management noted that they have run through various
scenarios and implied the risk of a U.S. debt downgrade seems
manageable, with the important caveat that there is always the
possibility of more severe knock-on effects,&#8221; the Citigroup
note said. Goldman Sachs &#8220;noted that collateral agreements
related to Treasuries are not dependent on Treasury ratings.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley is &#8220;not rushing&#8221; to raise collateral
requirements ahead of a potential downgrade, David Hilder, an
analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP, wrote in a note to
clients last week, citing a meeting with Ken deRegt, who helps
lead Morgan Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income trading group. 
Only a small number of investors are required to own AAA-
rated securities, limiting the impact of a downgrade, deRegt
said, according to Hilder&#8217;s note.

Thailand&#8217;s Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn will use his personal funds to recover an
airplane seized by German liquidators in Munich last month as
part of a bankruptcy dispute. 
Werner Schneider, the insolvency administrator for builder
Walter Bau AG (WTB), seized a Boeing 737 belonging to the crown prince
on July 11 to force payment on a 30 million-euro ($43.3 million)
claim against the Thai state, the company said last month. 
The crown prince &#8220;has no connection with the dispute
between the Thai government and Walter Bau, and didn&#8217;t cause the
dispute,&#8221; the crown prince&#8217;s secretariat said in a statement
late yesterday. &#8220;To avoid any impact to the good relationship
between Thailand and Germany and to end the dispute on good
terms and in an expeditious manner, the crown prince will
provide his personal funds to end the dispute.&#8221; 
A 2009 decision by the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law, or Uncitral, ordered Thailand to pay
Walter Bau more than 30 million euros for breaching a bilateral
investment treaty between Germany and Thailand. The order found
that Thailand&#8217;s government breached the terms of a toll road
concession operated by a venture partly owned by Walter Bau. 
A Berlin court ruled on July 20 that Thailand must deposit
20 million euros to secure the release of the aircraft,
according to the crown prince&#8217;s statement.
The crown prince&#8217;s statement didn&#8217;t say how much will be paid.
He is the only son of head of state King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Thai law imposes a jail sentence of up to 15 years for defaming,
insulting or threatening the king, queen, heir apparent or
regent. 
Marco Polo Seatrade Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in New York 
Marco Polo Seatrade BV, a manager of funds, trusts and
foundations, filed for bankruptcy court protection in New York. 
The Amsterdam-based company listed both assets and debt of
$100 million to $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed July
29 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
Affiliates Seaarland Shipping Management BV, Magellano
Marine CV and Cargoship Maritime BV also sought court
protection. 
Falm International Holding BV owns 100 percent of the
equity of Marco Polo, court papers show. 
The case is In re Marco Polo Seatrade BV, 11-bk-13634, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Bundesbank Loses U.K. Bid to Seize Assets in Lehman CDO Deal 
Germany&#8217;s central bank lost its bid to take control of a
2.9 billion-euro ($4.2 billion) securitization set up by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) just before its collapse. 
Judge Michael Briggs on July 29 ruled Excalibur Funding No.
1 wasn&#8217;t in default for long enough to allow the senior
noteholder, the Bundesbank, to wrest control away from Lehman. 
Excalibur was created by Lehman in May 2008 when the U.S.
bank packaged together a group of loans and collateralized debt
obligations. New York-based Lehman filed for bankruptcy three
months later listing assets of $639 billion. 
Under the rules of the Excalibur agreement, if the special
purpose vehicle was found to be in default, management of its
assets would pass to the Bundesbank as holder of 2.1 billion
euros of its senior debt. Lawyers for Lehman, which holds 722
million euros of Excalibur&#8217;s junior debt, argued Excalibur had
enough cash to meet its obligations. 
Magnus Makela, a spokesman for the Bundesbank, said the
central bank came to own the Excalibur notes because they were
used as collateral on a loan for a German subsidiary of Lehman,
which followed its parent into bankruptcy. 
The central bank won&#8217;t comment further until it&#8217;s examined
the ruling in detail, Makela said. 
Kimberly Macleod, a spokeswoman for Lehman, declined to
comment. 
While there was a default on Jan. 25, it didn&#8217;t continue
beyond Jan. 28, Justice Briggs said in his ruling. He granted
all parties permission to appeal his decision. 
Standard  Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC, which gave
Excalibur&#8217;s senior notes an &#8216;A&#8217; rating when the security was
issued in 2008, warned in November the vehicle didn&#8217;t have
enough income to pay interest on the junior notes held by Lehman
and that senior noteholders were unlikely to be repaid in full. 
In the latest of a series of downgrades, it lowered
Excalibur&#8217;s rating to &#8216;D&#8217; in March. 
Pakistani Investor Fiyaz is Third A-Tec Suitor, Oesterreich Says 
Pakistani investor Alshair Fiyaz is the third bidder for A-

Investments and hedge fund Springwater in bidding for the

Tokyo Electric Power Shouldn&#8217;t Enter Bankruptcy, Kaieda Says 
Japan&#8217;s Trade Minister Banri Kaieda said it isn&#8217;t
&#8220;appropriate&#8221; for Tokyo Electric Power Co. to enter bankruptcy
proceedings. Tokyo Electric isn&#8217;t expected to become insolvent
for now, Kaieda told upper house lawmakers in Tokyo. There are
&#8220;various possibilities&#8221; in dealing with the company in the
future, he said.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said he won&#8217;t seek large deals to replace falling
revenue, as the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker loses patent
exclusivity to drugs responsible for 60 percent of yearly sales. 
&#8220;We are not going to chase revenue at the destruction of
capital,&#8221; Read said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;We have
geographic breadth, we have portfolio breadth, we have
technology breadth. We never say never, but I don&#8217;t see why we
would need that.&#8221; 
Read has been shrinking the company by selling units and
buying back shares, in contrast to his predecessors Jeffrey Kindler, who bought Wyeth for $64 billion in 2009, and Henry McKinnell, who bought Pharmacia for about the same price in
2002. Pfizer will still form partnerships and pursue companies
with treatments in mid- to late-stage testing, Read said. 
Pfizer, based in New York, faces competition from cheaper
generic medicines to at least 19 drugs from 2010 through 2015,
led by the cholesterol pill Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling
drug, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors have
rewarded Read&#8217;s strategy for dealing with the acquisitions, with
shares climbing about 14 percent since he took over on Dec. 5,
more than double the return of the company&#8217;s U.S. peers.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
No. 2 U.S. shopping-mall owner, fell the most in more than a
year after reporting lower-than-estimated funds from operations
before items and saying that it plans to spin off 30 properties. 
Second-quarter &#8220;core&#8221; FFO fell to $199.6 million, or 20
cents a share, from $206.1 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier,
the Chicago-based real estate investment trust said in a
statement today. Analysts expected 23 cents a share, the average
of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, said late yesterday that it plans a spinoff of the 30
malls to shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse Properties
Inc., the company said. General Growth spent $11.3 billion to
buy commercial-property developer Rouse Co. in 2004. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re probably malls that don&#8217;t have the same kind of
growth prospects,&#8221; Craig Guttenplan, an analyst at CreditSights
Inc. in London, said in a telephone interview, of the malls to
be spun off. &#8220;It&#8217;s not where GGP wanted to focus its
investment.&#8221; 
The company&#8217;s shares fell $1.45, or 8.7 percent, to $15.32
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It
was the biggest loss since May 7, 2010. 
Bankruptcy Filing 
General Growth, which owns Water Tower Place in Chicago and
Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, filed for Chapter 11
protection in April 2009 after weighing itself down with debt
from the Rouse purchase that it was unable to refinance because
of the credit crisis and collapse of the commercial mortgage-
backed securities market. 
FFO, a measure of a property company&#8217;s ability to generate
cash, was hurt in the second quarter by lower income from lease
terminations, General Growth said. Core FFO excludes items such
as discontinued operations and costs related to debt retirement. 
The malls to be spun off have lower occupancy and are in
smaller markets, according to Guttenplan. They may need
&#8220;substantial investment,&#8221; he said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s only a couple of properties that were legacy
Rouse properties,&#8221; Guttenplan said. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of almost
ironic that they&#8217;re bringing back the Rouse name.&#8221; 
Malls in Plano, Texas, and Taylor, Michigan, are the only
ones acquired in the Rouse deal that will be in the new REIT,
according to a comparison of Rouse&#8217;s last annual report in 2003
and the list of General Growth&#8217;s planned malls to be spun off. 
166 Malls 
General Growth has ownership and management interest in 166
shopping malls in 43 states. The properties proposed to be spun
off account for 7 percent of the company&#8217;s net operating income,
according to yesterday&#8217;s statement. 
The decision to spin off the malls &#8220;suggests that the
market for B quality regional mall assets is not strong,&#8221; Rich Moore, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Solon, Ohio, said in
a note to investors today. General Growth&#8217;s operational results
were &#8220;lighter than those produced&#8221; by its peers, Moore wrote. 
Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, last week reported second-quarter FFO that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates on higher rents and occupancies. The
Indianapolis-based company raised its full-year forecast.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, reported second-quarter profit that topped analyst
estimates as sales of pain medicines offset declining revenue
from expired patents. 
Profit excluding some items was 60 cents a share, beating
by a cent the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue fell 0.9 percent to $16.98 billion, matching
estimates. Sales of the New York-based company&#8217;s Lyrica pain
pill and Enbrel arthritis medicine topped analyst predictions. 
Pfizer is selling its animal health and infant formula
units and trimming its workforce to prepare for the loss in
November of exclusive rights to Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-
selling drug with $10.7 billion in annual sales. Pfizer has
three late-stage experimental medicines that analysts estimate
may bring in more than $3.5 billion annually by 2015. 
&#8220;Investors are shifting their focus back to the pipeline,
shifting back to the cost cutting and the share repurchases,&#8221;
said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We probably have one more quarter where
the divestitures will be of high interest, but people are going
back to the core business.&#8221; 
Net income rose 5.2 percent to $2.61 billion, or 33 cents a
share, from $2.48 billion, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the
company said. Pfizer reiterated its 2011 profit forecast range
of $2.16 to $2.26 a share. It also maintained its guidance for
2012, the first full year of generic competition to Lipitor.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, plans to spin off 30 of its
malls to shareholders through a special dividend. 
General Growth will issue the dividend in the form of
common stock in Rouse Properties Inc., a recently formed company
into which General Growth will transfer the shopping centers,
the Chicago-based company said in a media release. 
The group, which came out of bankruptcy in November, has
sold about $300 million of properties since then, has another
$387 million under contract for sale, and plans to dispose of
another $350 million of assets by the end of this year, Chief
Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani said on June 9. The spin-off
was one of the options considered for the properties, the group
said in a statement distributed through PR Newswire. 
The transaction &#8220;enables General Growth shareholders to
participate in Rouse&#8217;s significant growth potential as a
standalone entity and efficiently streamlines General Growth
into a highly focused, premier mall operator,&#8221; Mathrani said in
the statement. 
The distribution will be made on a pro-rata basis to
holders of General Growth common stock on the dividend record
date in the fourth quarter, the company said. The properties in
Rouse, which accounts for about 7 percent of General Growth&#8217;s
net operating income, are about 87.7 percent leased, the group
said. 
Rouse will be listed on the New York stock exchange as a
real estate investment trust, General Growth said.

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest retail brokerage, named Charlie Mak president of the
firm&#8217;s international wealth-management unit. 
Mak, previously head of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
unit in Asia, will report to Greg Fleming, president of global
wealth management, according to an internal memo today from
Fleming. Jim Wiggins, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. 
Fleming, 48, said in April that he asked Michael Armstrong,
who headed international wealth management, to focus on his role
as head of capital markets for the brokerage. The wealth-
management group had $10 billion in international client inflows
in 2010, compared with $12.9 billion from domestic customers. 
James Jesse, chief operating officer of the capital markets
unit, will become COO of Morgan Stanley International Wealth
Management, according to the memo. Jesse will relocate from New
York to Hong Kong, Fleming said in the memo. 
Chris Van Aeken will lead the brokerage&#8217;s international-
banking and lending efforts, in addition to his role as chairman
of the firm&#8217;s Swiss private bank, according to the memo.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its forecast
for U.S. economic growth in the third quarter by a percentage
point to 1.5 percent, partly because of a slowdown in consumer
spending, chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note today. 
Feroli also lowered the forecast for fourth-quarter growth
to 2.5 percent from a prior estimate of 3 percent. The world&#8217;s
largest economy will expand 2 percent in the first six months of
2012, less than a previous projection of 2.5 percent. 
With the economy expanding at that pace, the jobless rate
will hold at 9 percent or above until the third quarter of 2012,
he said. Recent production data wasn&#8217;t &#8220;setting up well&#8221; for
the current quarter, while early surveys suggested activity
&#8220;may have stalled&#8221; amid wrangling over the debt-ceiling
extension, Feroli said. 
&#8220;The revised forecast implies very little improvement in
the unemployment rate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anticipated drag from higher
taxes and lower federal outlays&#8221; was behind the lower estimates
for next year, Feroli wrote. 
JPMorgan also pushed back its estimate for the first
increase in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s overnight lending rate until
mid-2013 from a prior forecast for the beginning of the year.
The Fed will &#8220;undertake further measures to deliver monetary
stimulus to the economy,&#8221; even though they may not be
&#8220;particularly powerful,&#8221; he said. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t see more asset purchases forthcoming but we do
think the committee will take incremental steps to signal
increasingly accommodative policy,&#8221; Feroli wrote, referring to
the Federal Open Market Committee. 
The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending grew 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, the final months of the recession.

Morgan Stanley (MS) puts were the most
active in the U.S. equity-options market after an investor
bought a block of contracts with a strike price 25 percent below
yesterday&#8217;s closing level. 
A trader purchased 34,532 October $16 puts to sell the
owner of the world&#8217;s largest retail brokerage for 28 cents each,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The October $16 put
contract had an open interest of 193 before today, the data
show. This was the biggest trade in New York-based Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s puts since January 2010, according to Henry Schwartz,
president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of
options-market data and analytics. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty impressive trade,&#8221; said Schwartz in a
telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a downside hedge into the fall.
Somebody is maybe getting seriously nervous. It does show some
significant concern or desire to hedge risk of a move lower.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley has been trading below book value, or the
value of its assets, and the shares are near the lowest level
since March 2009. Revenue climbed to $9.28 billion from $7.96
billion a year earlier, the highest since the end of the
financial crisis, the company said July 21. The stock jumped 11
percent that day. It has dropped 14 percent since, as financial
companies in the SP 500 retreated 6.8 percent amid concerns the
U.S. recovery is weakening and the European sovereign-debt
crisis will spread. Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.7 percent to
$20.74 at 2:52 p.m. in New York. 
Right to Sell 
The 34,532-option trade would give the right to sell
3,453,200 Morgan Stanley shares at $16. The company hasn&#8217;t
closed below $16 since January 2009. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s September $20 puts were the sixth-most-
traded equity contracts in the U.S. after two blocks of more
than 5,000 traded. Those puts rose 62 percent to 89 cents each. 
Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in 30 days, advanced to 42.35 from
37.11 yesterday. 
More than 90,000 Morgan Stanley puts changed hands, 6.1
times the four-week average and 3.5 times the numbers of calls
to buy. Volume of the bearish options rose to its highest level
since April 2010. The October $16 puts were the most traded and
accounted for more than a third of all put volume. The
contracts, which expire Oct. 21, gained 65 percent to 33 cents
each.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the most
prolific U.S. issuer of corporate bonds this year, tapped the
market again as yields on the debt fall to the lowest on record. 
JPMorgan sold $1.25 billion of 4.35 percent, 10-year notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investment-grade
corporate bond yields fell to 3.51 percent yesterday, surpassing
the previous all-time low of 3.53 percent set Nov. 4, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show. 
Borrowing costs for companies are plunging along with
Treasury yields amid mounting evidence that the U.S. economy is
faltering. Banks have taken advantage of the decline to lock in
funding, selling about 60 percent of investment-grade corporate
bonds last month, the biggest proportion of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s notes yield 175 basis points, or 1.75 percentage
points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries. The New York-
based company sold $17.6 billion of bonds in the U.S. this year
through yesterday, including $855 million of 3.15 percent, five-
year notes on July 29, Bloomberg data show. 
Its $2 billion of 4.625 percent notes due in May 2021
traded yesterday at 103.4 cents on the dollar to yield 158 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. 
Banks&#8217; issuance accounted for $31.6 billion of last month&#8217;s
$50.2 billion of investment-grade corporate bond sales in the
U.S., Bloomberg data show.

Three companies are dropping European
Union antitrust complaints against International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) over its mainframe computers. 
T3 Technologies Inc. and Neon Enterprise Software LLC have
or will withdraw separate complaints filed with the European
Commission, IBM said in a regulatory filing last month.
TurboHercules SAS has also withdrawn its complaint, said Carina
Oliveri, a spokeswoman for the company in Paris. 
The European Commission declined to comment on the status
of its investigation into allegations IBM linked sales of its
mainframe computers to its software and that it discriminated
against competing sellers of services for the computers. 
EU antitrust regulators often end investigations into
companies after complaints from rivals or customers are
withdrawn. The European Commission ended a four-year-old probe
into Qualcomm Inc. in 2009 after all complaints were withdrawn. 
IBM, the biggest computer-services company, declined to
comment beyond its regulatory filing. 
Austin, Texas-based Neon said in May that it settled its
legal dispute with IBM and would stop selling its zPrime
software and request customers to remove and destroy their
copies. Two calls and two e-mails to the company today weren&#8217;t
immediately answered. 
Dropped Appeal 
T3 withdrew its EU complaint in May after dropping an
appeal to a U.S. court ruling dismissing its claims against IBM,
according to IBM&#8217;s filing. T3 didn&#8217;t respond to a telephone
message and e-mail to its Tampa, Florida offices. 
The European Commission opened two separate investigations
into Armonk, New York-based IBM last year over possible anti-
competitive behavior that may have blocked competition for rival
mainframe software and on maintenance contracts for the systems
by &#8220;restricting or delaying access to spare parts.&#8221; 
While IBM has shifted its focus away from hardware toward
its more profitable software and services businesses, the
mainframe operations have high gross margins and helps pull in
revenue for other IBM divisions. IBM began developing mainframe
computers in the 1940s and 1950s and is now among the few
companies to offer the systems. 
Reuters reported the IBM regulatory filing earlier today.

Chip Skowron, the ex-FrontPoint
Partners LLC hedge-fund manager charged as part of a nationwide
insider-trading crackdown, will waive his right to be indicted,
the government said in a court filing. 
Skowron, charged in April with conspiracy, securities fraud
and obstruction of justice, was in talks with federal
prosecutors to resolve the case, prosecutors said in court
papers in June. Yesterday, the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in
Manhattan filed a notice of intent to submit a criminal
information in Skowron&#8217;s case after he waives indictment. 
Defendants regularly waive their right to be indicted when
entering into an agreement in which they plead guilty. 
The one-page filing was signed by prosecutors and by James
Benjamin Jr., a lawyer for Skowron. Benjamin declined to comment
on whether his client will plead guilty. 
In the U.S. federal system, a defendant charged with a
felony has the right to be charged by an indictment, which is a
document approved by a grand jury. A defendant may instead agree
to be charged in a criminal information, which is filed by
prosecutors. 
The government claims Skowron obtained nonpublic
information from Yves Benhamou, an expert in hepatitis drugs and
a former adviser for Human Genome Sciences Inc. The tips
concerned hepatitis C drug trials and enabled Greenwich,
Connecticut-based FrontPoint to avoid more than $30 million in
losses, the government said. Benhamou has pleaded guilty. 
In addition to the criminal case, Skowron has been sued by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The case is U.S. v. Skowron, 11-MAG-00997, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
JPMorgan Asks Judge to Toss $19 Billion Madoff Trustee 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asked a judge to dismiss a $19 billion
lawsuit by the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm, saying the
trustee lacks &#8220;standing&#8221; to bring common-law claims against
the bank. 
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff last week threw out trustee
Irving Picard&#8217;s bid for almost $9 billion in damages from HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) and feeder funds, saying Picard has no right to sue
using common-law claims against parties &#8220;who allegedly violated
a duty to Madoff Securities&#8217; customers by failing to detect
Madoff&#8217;s fraud.&#8221; Citing the ruling, JPMorgan asked Judge
Colleen McMahon, who is handling its dispute with Picard, to
toss out similar demands. 
&#8220;As Judge Rakoff held in the HSBC case, the trustee has no
standing to bring customer damages claims,&#8221; the New York-based
bank said in a filing Aug. 1. 
Separately, UBS AG (UBSN), saying Picard sued it for more than $2
billion based on common-law claims of aiding and abetting the
fraud, asked McMahon to bar the trustee from seeking such
damages. 
The JPMorgan and UBS filings were &#8220;expected,&#8221; said Picard
spokeswoman Amanda Remus. The Madoff trustee is preparing to sue
HSBC for $2 billion in bankruptcy court, she has said. 
Remus declined to comment on Rakoff&#8217;s remarks. 
The bankruptcy court case is Picard v. Katz, 1:10-ap-05287,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The review is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Kohlberg Capital Wins Dismissal of Investor Lawsuit 
Kohlberg Capital Corp. (KCAP), the investment company taken public
in 2006 by leveraged-buyout pioneer Jerome Kohlberg, won
dismissal of a lawsuit filed by an investor. 
Kohlberg Capital was sued in federal court in Manhattan in
December 2009 by investor Dennis J. Angeleri of Muskegon,
Michigan, who accused the New York-based company of lying about
the value of its portfolio. 
Angeleri said in the suit that Kohlberg Capital issued a
release in November 2009 that was &#8220;materially false&#8221; because
it misstated the value of the company&#8217;s investment portfolio.
Kohlberg asked U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldbaum Cedarbaum in
June to dismiss the complaint, saying its investments are
difficult to value. 
Cedarbaum on July 28 signed an order approving Kohlberg&#8217;s
motion, according to a court document filed yesterday. Cedarbaum
said Angeleri can file an amended complaint no later than Aug.
22. 
The case is Angeleri v. Pearson, 09-cv-10609, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Macquarie, Bank of Queensland Lose Bid to Throw Out ASIC Suit 
Bank of Queensland Ltd. and two other lenders lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit that claims they knew Storm Financial Ltd. was
violating regulations before the fund manager and adviser
collapsed in 2009. 
Federal Court of Australia Justice John Reeves ruled
yesterday the lawsuit can proceed. Investors will be able to
claim damages from Bank of Queensland, Macquarie Bank Ltd. and
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) if a judge rules that Storm broke
the rules and they knew about it. 
The Australian Securities  Investments Commission, which
filed the lawsuit in December, &#8220;has now made a valid and
justiciable claim for relief,&#8221; Reeves wrote in a ruling posted
on the Federal Court&#8217;s website. 
Storm, which had managed A$4 billion ($4.4 billion),
induced investors to mortgage their homes, take out margin loans
and put the money into Storm Australian Index Trusts with the
promise their returns would be enough to pay the loans and live
off the proceeds in retirement, according to ASIC&#8217;s statement of
claim. 
The banks didn&#8217;t exercise due diligence to determine if the
investors could afford the loans, failed to warn them of the
risks and received interest fees, possible commissions and the
prospect of further referrals from Storm, according to the ASIC
statement. 
Storm got commissions from the trust investments and had an
incentive to encourage clients to put more money into the funds,
the regulator said. 
The company collapsed in January, 2009. Storm said at the
time trading losses resulted in a decline in income which the
company couldn&#8217;t absorb any longer. 
The case is Australian Securities and Investments
Commission v. Bank of Queensland Ltd. (BOQ) NSD1797/2010. Federal
Court of Australia (Sydney). 
New York State&#8217;s Fracking Lawsuit Barred by Law, U.S. Says 
The U.S. government said it will ask a judge to dismiss a
New York lawsuit that seeks to force a fuller environmental
review of how natural-gas extraction could affect 9 million
water drinkers in the state. 
The U.S. plans to ask U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis
in Brooklyn, New York, to dismiss the case on the grounds that
the state can&#8217;t prove injury and doesn&#8217;t have the right to sue
federal agencies, according to a letter filed with the court
Aug. 1. 
The New York state complaint is &#8220;barred by well-settled
principles of sovereign immunity,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney
Sandra Levy wrote in the letter to the judge. Sovereign immunity
protects the U.S. from lawsuits unless it waives the right. 
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued on May 31,
saying a commission that oversees the Delaware River Basin has
proposed regulations that will allow hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, at 15,000 to 18,000 gas wells without a full
environmental review. Fracking is the process in which water,
sand and chemicals are pumped underground to break apart rock
formations and release natural gas. 
&#8220;As our complaint makes clear, the federal government has
an obligation to undertake the necessary environmental impact
study,&#8221; Schneiderman spokeswoman Lauren Passalacqua said in a
statement. 
Schneiderman&#8217;s suit seeks to halt the regulations until the
commission complies with the National Environmental Policy Act&#8217;s
requirement for a full review of all health and safety risks. 
The case is New York v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 11-
cv-2599, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York

New Suits 
TIAA Sues Deutsche Bank Over Mortgage-Backed Securities 
Teachers Insurance  Annuity Association of America sued
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) in New York state court for fraud over
residential mortgage-backed securities the Frankfurt-based bank
sold it. 
TIAA invested in the securities unaware that the bank
internally viewed the loans and securities as &#8220;pigs&#8221; and
&#8220;crap,&#8221; according to the suit, filed Aug. 1 in New York state
Supreme Court. 
The suit duplicates wording and claims that Dexia SA (DEXB), the
lender to local governments rescued by France and Belgium in
2008, made in a similar suit filed against Deutsche Bank last
month in connection with more than $1 billion in residential
mortgage-backed securities. 
Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest bank, originated,
purchased, financed and securitized &#8220;exception&#8221; loans into the
securities while betting against the U.S. housing market as far
back as 2005, ultimately developing a $10 billion short position
that paid off when the loans backing the securities failed,
according to the TIAA complaint. 
&#8220;We will vigorously defend ourselves against this suit
which we believe is without merit,&#8221; Renee Calabro, a
spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, said in an e-mailed statement.
The bank gave the same response to the Dexia suit. 
The case is Teachers Insurance  Annuity Association of
America v. Deutsche Bank AG, 652122/2011, New York state Supreme
Court (Manhattan). 
Ex-UBS Banker Martin Lack Is Indicted in Tax Conspiracy Case 
A former UBS AG banker was indicted on a charge of
conspiring to help wealthy Americans evade taxes by hiding
accounts in a smaller Swiss regional bank. 
Martin Lack, a Swiss resident and independent investment
adviser, helped U.S. clients hide assets from the Internal
Revenue Service through accounts at UBS and the so-called
cantonal bank, according to an indictment in federal court in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. That bank, not named in the
indictment, is Basler Kantonalbank, according to a person
familiar with the matter. 
The indictment cites nine U.S. customers that Lack
assisted. He helped them withdraw cash from undeclared accounts
and discouraged them from joining an IRS amnesty program,
according to the indictment. UBS, the largest Swiss bank,
avoided prosecution in 2009 by paying $780 million and admitting
it helped Americans evade taxes. 
&#8220;Lack would and did solicit U.S. customers to open
undeclared accounts at UBS and Cantonal Bank because Swiss bank
secrecy would assist U.S. customers to conceal their ownership
of the accounts,&#8221; according to the indictment. 
Lack is accused of conspiring with Renzo Gadola, a UBS
banker from 1995 until 2008. Gadola pleaded guilty Dec. 22 in
federal court in Miami, admitting that he encouraged U.S.
clients to move their undeclared UBS accounts to Basler
Kantonalbank. (BSKP) He is cooperating with prosecutors. 
Lack didn&#8217;t immediately return a call left at the firm
yesterday. 
Michael Buess, a spokesman for Basler Kantonalbank, a Swiss
regional lender based in Basel, said he couldn&#8217;t confirm or deny
any &#8220;cooperation between Lack and Basler Kantonalbank.&#8221; 
The Lack case is U.S. v. Lack, 11-cr-60184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). The
Gadola case is U.S. v. Gadola, 10-cr-20878, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Florida (Miami).

Ex-News of the World Editor Said to Be Arrested in Probe 
London police arrested former News of the World managing
editor Stuart Kuttner as part of their probe into phone hacking
and bribery at News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s now-defunct Sunday tabloid, two
people familiar with the case said. 
A 71-year-old man was arrested by appointment at a north
London police station and later released on bail, the
Metropolitan Police said in statements yesterday. The man is
Kuttner, said the people, who declined to be identified because
they&#8217;re not authorized to name suspects. 
It is the 11th arrest stemming from police investigations
opened this year into allegations that journalists at the
tabloid hacked into the phones of celebrities, politicians, and
murder victims, and bribed police for information. The scandal
forced News Corp. (NWS) to shutter the 168-year-old News of the World
and drop its bid for British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) 
Police have previously arrested Rebekah Brooks, a former
chief executive officer of News Corp.&#8217;s News International unit,
and ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who was Prime
Minister David Cameron&#8217;s press chief until January. 
A number for Kuttner couldn&#8217;t be located in public filings
or on the Internet. A police spokesman declined to comment
beyond the statement. 
&#8220;News International continues to fully cooperate with the
Metropolitan Police Service in their ongoing investigations,&#8221;
spokeswoman Daisy Dunlop said in a phone interview. She declined
to provide contact information or the name of an attorney for
Kuttner.

NBA Sues Players Association to Forestall Antitrust Claims 
The National Basketball Association sued its players
association, asking a court to rule that the league&#8217;s lockout of
players doesn&#8217;t violate antitrust law. 
The suit arises from the union&#8217;s &#8220;threatened use of
antitrust litigation to extract more favorable terms and
conditions of employment&#8221; in collective-bargaining
negotiations, the NBA said in a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. 
&#8220;The union&#8217;s improper threats of antitrust litigation are
having a direct, immediate and harmful effect upon the ability
of the parties to negotiate a new collective bargaining
agreement,&#8221; the NBA said in the complaint. 
The league said it&#8217;s seeking court orders stating that the
lockout doesn&#8217;t violate antitrust laws and that federal courts
don&#8217;t have jurisdiction to end the lockout. The case was
assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe. 
The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association
made no significant progress Aug. 1 in their first formal
bargaining session on a new labor contract since the lockout
began one month ago. 
The NBA also filed an unfair labor practices charge with
the National Labor Relations Board yesterday, accusing the
players association of failing to negotiate in good faith, the
league said in a statement. In May, the union filed a complaint
against the league with the NLRB. 
The players&#8217; association will seek the dismissal of both
the lawsuit and the unfair labor practice charge, said William
Hunter, the union&#8217;s executive director. 
The association &#8220;has not made any decision to disclaim its
role as the collective bargaining representative of the players

Trials/Appeals 
Ex-TCW Employee Searched New Space Before Gundlach&#8217;s Firing 
DoubleLine Capital LP communications director Barbara
VanEvery said she started looking for office space months before
TCW Group Inc. fired her and Jeffrey Gundlach in December of
2009. 
VanEvery testified yesterday at a trial that pits Gundlach,
her and two other former TCW employees against the company over
claims they stole TCW&#8217;s trade secrets and proprietary
information to set up DoubleLine within weeks after they were
terminated. They have countered that TCW fired them to avoid
paying Gundlach&#8217;s group hundreds of millions of dollars in
performance fees. 
Under questioning by TCW&#8217;s lawyer, VanEvery said she
retained a real estate broker in September 2009 to find office
space because she expected that either Gundlach would get fired
or that he and his group would leave TCW through a negotiated
departure. 
&#8220;I was under the impression that something was going to
happen by December,&#8221; VanEvery told jurors yesterday in state
court in Los Angeles. &#8220;It was coming to a head. I felt there
was going to be some kind of separation.&#8221; 
Gundlach, 51, was the investment chief at TCW, the Los
Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale. (GLE) He started DoubleLine in
December 2009, 10 days after TCW fired him. TCW sued Gundlach a
month later, after half of its fixed-income professionals had
joined DoubleLine. Gundlach countersued, saying he was fired so
that TCW wouldn&#8217;t have to pay management and performance fees. 
VanEvery wasn&#8217;t cross-examined by DoubleLine lawyers
yesterday and she is scheduled to finish her testimony today. 
The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County.

Citigroup Gave Negligent Advice to 88-Year-Old, Lawyer Says 
Citigroup Inc. (C) had undue influence over 88-year-old Ie Seng
Hoan and was negligent in its investment advice to the partly
deaf client, resulting in a loss of $18.1 million, his lawyer
said yesterday. 
&#8220;It knew full well of Pak Ie&#8217;s health problems, his
language difficulties and his lack of financial acumen and
education,&#8221; Ie&#8217;s lawyer Koh Hai Keong said in his opening
statement at a Singapore High Court trial. 
Ie, an Indonesian textile businessman, accused Citigroup&#8217;s
Singapore unit, where he was a client since 2003, of negligent
misrepresentations and hiding material facts and claimed the
bank had &#8220;undue influence&#8221; on his investment decisions. He was
also misled by his banker into believing he made a profit when
he suffered a loss after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in Sept. 2008, according to the lawsuit. 
Citigroup has denied wrongdoing and sent Ie a letter in
2007 confirming that he had extensive investing experience and
had an &#8220;aggressive&#8221; risk tolerance, according to the bank&#8217;s
defense filed by its lawyer Hri Kumar. 
The bank acted professionally in managing the accounts of
Ie and his company Zhen Yin at all times, Hong Kong-based
spokesman Godwin Chellam said yesterday. 
&#8220;The litigation is wholly without merit and we will defend
it vigorously in court,&#8221; Chellam said, adding it would be
inappropriate to comment further. 
The case is Zhen Yin Co. v Citibank NA S550/2009 in the
Singapore High Court.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest energy company, said its Nigerian Escravos gas-to-
liquids plant is more than 70 percent complete and on course to
start production in 2013. 
The facility, which will refine natural gas to produce
33,000 barrels a day of fuels including diesel, is set &#8220;to be
completed at the end of 2012,&#8221; Andrew Fawthrop, chief executive
officer of the company&#8217;s Nigerian unit, said in an interview
yesterday in Abuja, the capital. 
Chevron holds a 75 percent interest and will operate the
estimated $8.4 billion project jointly developed with the state-
owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corp., he said. 
Nigeria, holder of Africa&#8217;s largest gas reserves of about
187 trillion cubic feet, burns off, or flares, most of the fuel
it produces along with oil because it lacks the infrastructure
to process it. At least $3 billion in revenue is lost annually
due to flaring, according to the Petroleum Ministry. The country
flared 15.2 billion cubic meters last year, according to the
World Bank&#8217;s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership. 
Chevron&#8217;s daily production in Nigeria averaged 524,000
barrels of crude, 206 million cubic feet (5.8 million cubic
meters) of natural gas and 5,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum
gas in 2010 as security improved in the oil-rich Niger River
delta, according to the company. 
The company holds interests in 10 deepwater oil blocks in
Nigeria, including its 250,000 barrels per day Agbami field
located 70 miles (113 kilometers) off the country&#8217;s coast. A 10-
well development program within the next three years is expected
to boost output to offset declining production in the field. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re continuing the development of the Agbami field and
we&#8217;re looking for new opportunities in deepwater continuously,&#8221;
Fawthrop said.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, may say second-quarter profit declined 24
percent on higher writedowns and taxes. 
Net income will probably fall to 262 million euros ($372
million) from 346 million euros a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates ranged from 81 million euros to 387 million euros. 
&#8220;Impairments on Greek bonds and higher taxes&#8221; hurt
second-quarter results, Cristian Galizzi, an analyst at
Intermonte SIM SpA, who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; recommendation on
the stock, wrote in a July 29 report. &#8220;Results net of those
one-offs should remain operationally sound.&#8221; 
Generali said on July 5 that it will participate in a plan
to roll over part of its 3 billion euros of Greek debt, the most
held by any Italian financial institution. The insurer, led by
Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto, has net exposure,
which refers to bonds in its own portfolio, of 500 million
euros. 
Generali&#8217;s quarterly earnings may also include about 80
million euros of writedowns of the stake held in Telco SpA, the
holding company that controls Telecom Italia SpA. 
The insurer&#8217;s combined ratio, a measure of profitability,
may have improved to 97.1 percent in the first half from 98.8
percent a year earlier, the survey shows. Operating profit at
the Trieste, Italy-based insurer probably rose 2 percent to 1.03
billion euros in the quarter. 
The insurer is scheduled to report earnings on Aug. 5 and
to hold a conference call at 4 p.m. the same day. Following is a
table of the analysts&#8217; estimates and the year-earlier results
calculated by Bloomberg by subtracting published first-quarter
figures from the first-half results. The figures are in millions

James Gorman, chief executive officer
of Morgan Stanley, purchased $2.06 million of stock in the firm
as the shares touched their lowest level since March 2009. 
Gorman bought 100,000 shares today at a weighted average
price of $20.62, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The stock tumbled $1.32 on the New York
Stock Exchange, or 6.3 percent, giving Gorman a $92,000 one-day
loss on the transaction. 
The purchase, which was larger than his cash bonus for
2010, increased Gorman&#8217;s holdings to 955,370 shares, worth about
$18.8 million at today&#8217;s closing price of $19.70. It was
Gorman&#8217;s first outright purchase since he became CEO of the New
York-based firm at the start of 2010. 
Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 28 percent this year, making its shares
worth 35 percent less than book value. The bank&#8217;s puts were the
most active in the U.S. equity-options market yesterday after an
investor bought a block of contracts with a strike price 25
percent below the previous day&#8217;s closing level. 
Morgan Stanley shares dropped to $19.70 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest level since
March 9, 2009. 
Gorman said in May that the market was assuming worst-case
scenarios for financial companies, which may get a boost if a
notable value investor were to step in and take a large
position. Gorman said in an internal memo in December that the
stock, then trading at $26.86, was &#8220;meaningfully undervalued.&#8221; 
Gorman&#8217;s Stake 
Gorman&#8217;s net worth has dropped with Morgan Stanley&#8217;s plunge
this year as the firm tries to raise its market share in fixed-
income trading and increase profitability at the retail
brokerage. His shareholdings were worth about $26.2 million when
he received his annual stock award in January. That figure had
dropped to about $18 million yesterday. Gorman also holds more
than 800,000 options, all of which are more than 30 percent out
of the money. 
The stock jumped 11 percent on July 21 after Morgan Stanley
reported a smaller loss than analysts estimated on higher
trading revenue. It has dropped 19 percent since then, as
financial companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index retreated
amid concern the U.S. recovery is weakening and the European
sovereign-debt crisis will spread. 
A trader yesterday purchased 34,532 October puts to sell
Morgan Stanley shares at $16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the biggest trade in Morgan Stanley&#8217;s puts
since January 2010, according to Henry Schwartz, president of
Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market
data and analytics.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), seeking to
placate buyers and guard its reputation, is compensating
investors for losses they incurred after a $1.5 billion
commercial-mortgage bond deal was pulled last week. 
The bank is paying clients that purchased the securities
and entered into contracts that protect against changes in
interest rates and prices for the debt, according to two people
familiar with the transaction who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. The investors will be paid for
contracts that lost money between when the deal was placed and
its withdrawal five days later. 
Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. (C) were forced to scuttle the
deal on July 28 after Standard  Poor&#8217;s withdrew its grades
because the rating company spotted an error in its process. The
banks already had to boost yields and restructure the
transaction, tied to loans on everything from shopping centers
to student housing, as investors pushed back on deal terms. 
&#8220;The bankers have enterprise value to protect,&#8221; said
Richard Jones, a partner in the real estate group at law firm
Dechert LLP. &#8220;Once something goes this fundamentally wrong, it
doesn&#8217;t matter who is responsible.&#8221; 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Costiglio of Citigroup, declined to comment. 
Losses were likely &#8220;relatively small&#8221; because markets
weren&#8217;t volatile between the time the deal priced and when SP
pulled its ratings, said Richard Parkus, a commercial-mortgage
debt analyst at Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;The issuers did the right thing by absorbing investors&#8217;
hedging losses,&#8221; he said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reduced its
estimate for U.S. end-summer natural gas inventories by 1
percent after a heatwave, while forecasting prices will remain
&#8220;under pressure&#8221; as temperatures ease. 
A surge in demand amid the hottest July in U.S. history
contributed to the bank revising its forecast for inventories at
the end of the Northern Hemisphere summer to 3,770 billion cubic
feet, down from an earlier outlook of 3,807, Johan Spetz and
Samantha Dart, London-based analysts at the bank, wrote in an
Aug. 3 report. 
Incremental gas demand for power generation more than
doubled in July to 105 billion cubic feet from 43 billion in
June, according to the bank&#8217;s estimates. Temperatures surpassed
100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in cities from New York to
Houston in June and July, diverting more gas to plants to
generate electricity for air conditioners. 
Natural gas futures have dropped since the middle of July
after temperatures subsided and hydroelectricity generation
increased, reducing the need for the fuel, the report said.
Goldman said it sees a &#8220;structural oversupply&#8221; in the U.S. as
a result of shale production. 
&#8220;We expect the underlying balance to remain soft in coming
months, although less so as the transient effect of strong
hydro-generation subsides,&#8221; the analysts wrote, saying they
maintained a &#8220;moderately bearish&#8221; outlook for prices. 
The bank forecasts gas will average $4 per million British
thermal units for the third quarter and $4.25 per million Btu in
the October-to-December period. 
Natural gas futures for delivery in September traded at
$4.09 per million Btu today on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped 10 percent since July 15.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, is studying whether its Lipitor cholesterol pill can
be sold as an over-the-counter medicine, according to a person
familiar with the discussions. 
The company hasn&#8217;t determined whether the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration would allow the drug to be sold without a
prescription, the person said. Pfizer has assembled a team to
examine the feasibility of a switch to over-the-counter sales,
as well as other options for the medicine, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. 
Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world with $10.7
billion in sales last year, loses U.S. patent exclusivity in
November. Previous attempts to sell over-the-counter versions of
cholesterol-lowering drugs, including Merck  Co.&#8217;s Mevacor and
Zocor, were unsuccessful because of the side effects. Patients
using Lipitor need regular tests of their cholesterol and liver
functioning, according to the drug&#8217;s label. 
&#8220;There is no reason to think that somehow where Mevacor
and Zocor failed, Lipitor would be successful,&#8221; David Maris, an
analyst with CLSA in New York, said in an e-mail. &#8220;This also
would not be a savings to consumers, just to insurance
companies, managed-care plans and the government,&#8221; he said. 
MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer,
declined to comment on the company&#8217;s plans to pursue an over-
the-counter version of Lipitor. 
&#8216;Strategic Plans&#8217; 
&#8220;We can confirm that we have strategic plans in place for
Lipitor&#8217;s loss of exclusivity,&#8221; Jimeson said. 
Pfizer gained 13 cents to $17.49 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The drugmaker has gained 8
percent in the past 12 months. 
In order to sell Lipitor without a prescription, Pfizer
must show that patients can safely diagnose themselves and use
the drug properly, said Shelly Burgess, a spokeswoman for the
FDA. No cholesterol-lowering drug, or statin, has been able to
do that, she said. 
&#8220;They would have to provide data to show that consumers
understand the treatment and recognize that cholesterol-
monitoring is required,&#8221; Burgess said. In previous studies
&#8220;most study participants made mistakes and chose to take the
proposed over-the-counter statin when they should not have done
that.&#8221; 
Drugs with U.S. sales of more than $1 billion a year
typically lose 73 percent of revenue in the first three months
after generic copies are introduced, according to an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. Pfizer successfully took its allergy
medicine, Zyrtec, over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its
consumer unit that year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. 
Pfizer last month completed a review of four business units
for possible sale or divesture. The company decided to keep the
consumer unit that it gained in the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth
and its established products unit, which makes generic drugs and
branded versions of drugs with expired patents. The company said
it plans to sell its animal health and baby formula units.

million. 
Taubman bought 50,000 shares yesterday at a weighted-
average price of $20.3847, worth $1.02 million, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.
Porat purchased 25,000 shares at $20.50, worth $512,500,
according to a separate filing. 
Morgan Stanley rose 1.6 percent today, the second-largest
gain in the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index,
after earlier touching the lowest price since March 2009. The
shares have fallen 26 percent this year. The bank&#8217;s puts were
the most active in the U.S. equity-options market on Aug. 3

Taubman, 50, who has worked at the New York-based firm for
almost 30 years, now owns 1.15 million shares, worth $23 million
at today&#8217;s closing price. Porat, 53, owns 695,667 shares, worth
$13.9 million. Board member Hutham Olayan purchased 5,000 shares
at $20, worth $100,000, according to a filing today. 
Morgan Stanley rose 32 cents to $20.02 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the largest
increase in more than two weeks and made the firm one of only 10
companies in the SP 500 Financials Index (S5FINL) to climb. 
Gorman&#8217;s Purchase 
Gorman, 53, bought 100,000 shares yesterday at a weighted
average price of $20.62, according to a filing yesterday. The
purchase, which was larger than his cash bonus for 2010,
increased Gorman&#8217;s holdings to 955,370 shares, worth about $18.8
million at yesterday&#8217;s closing price. It was Gorman&#8217;s first
outright purchase since he became CEO last year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, had two days of trading losses last
quarter after a perfect first three months in 2011. 
Gains from market-related risk in the investment bank,
chief investment office and mortgage-banking unit topped $200
million on four days during the first half, New York-based
JPMorgan said today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
The two days of losses didn&#8217;t exceed the firm&#8217;s value-at-
risk gauge, JPMorgan said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today
it saw a one-in-three chance of a renewed recession in the U.S.
within the next nine months as it cut its growth forecast to 2
percent through the first quarter of 2012, chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients. 
Goldman now sees growth averaging 1.7 percent this year,
from a prior 1.8 percent forecast, Hatzius said. The world&#8217;s
largest economy will expand 2.1 percent in 2012, down from a
previous estimate of 3 percent, he wrote. 
The U.S. unemployment rate will rise to 9.25 percent by the
end of 2012, reflecting the weaker pace of growth, Hatzius said.
A worsening of the European debt crisis, failure to extend the
U.S. payroll-tax cut beyond 2011 and further increases in
unemployment were cited as key risks to the outlook. 
&#8220;Even our new forecast is subject to meaningful downside-
risk,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &#8220;Increases in the U.S. unemployment rate
have historically had a tendency to feed on themselves, and this
could happen again.&#8221; 
Goldman expects the Federal Reserve will &#8220;provide more
guidance&#8221; about the future size of its balance sheet at next
week&#8217;s policy meeting, Hatzius wrote. Goldman anticipates &#8220;no
rate hikes or changes in the size of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet
until 2013 or later,&#8221; he wrote. 
The unemployment rate fell to 9.1 percent in July from 9.2
percent in June, the Labor Department reported today. Payrolls
rose by a more-than-forecast 117,000 after a 46,000 increase in
June, the report said. 
The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending rose 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, when the recent recession ended.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), ranked
second among takeover advisers this year, would be No. 1 if the
bank had its way after a call made to Medco Health Solutions
Inc. (MHS) following its $29.1 billion sale to Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) 
Days after the second-largest takeover this year, Medco
received a request from Goldman Sachs to be credited for helping
to arrange the deal, said four people with knowledge of the
matter, who declined to be identified because the conversation
was private. In the July 21 statement announcing the
transaction, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) were
identified as Medco advisers. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) worked with Express Scripts. 
During the discussion between Goldman Sachs and Medco, a
Goldman Sachs banker reminded Medco of the firm&#8217;s past work for
the company and Medco&#8217;s role as a manager of pharmacy benefits
for some Goldman employees, the people said. Medco considered
the discussion of its business relationships as pressure to put
Goldman Sachs on the deal and was concerned the bank would yank
the benefits contract if it weren&#8217;t credited, the people said. 
People close to Goldman Sachs said the banker was
highlighting its relationship with Medco, and the firm deserved
recognition for previous work related to the transaction.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.

providing equity-market trading and clearing reports to some
clients this morning because of the high volume yesterday. 
&#8220;We told clearing clients that some reports might be
delayed due to the high volume of trading yesterday,&#8221; said
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm. &#8220;Ninety-
five percent of the usual data was available by 7 a.m. and the
rest was available by the time the U.S. stock market opened.&#8221; 
The affected unit was Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing

options and futures. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, made
the most revenue from trading equities of any bank in the world
last year.

message on a client website this morning notifying customers
that there would be custody reporting delays.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), sued for
$8.6 billion by bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), said the
defunct firm&#8217;s common-law claims against it must be decided by a
U.S. district court judge rather than a bankruptcy judge. 
In a court filing yesterday in Manhattan, the New York-
based bank said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Anna Nicole
Smith case limited the power of bankruptcy judges to rule on
such claims. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, has been fighting
Lehman&#8217;s suit in bankruptcy court, fending off demands for the
return of $8.6 billion in collateral, plus &#8220;tens of billions&#8221;
in damages for allegedly accelerating the former investment
bank&#8217;s demise. After the ruling in the Smith case, a district
judge must determine damage claims brought under New York state
law, JPMorgan said in the filing. 
&#8220;Those claims, through which plaintiffs seek to augment
the estate by recovering damages for JPMorgan&#8217;s alleged
misconduct in precipitating LBHI&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, are
legally indistinguishable from the state-law tortuous
interference counterclaim in Stern,&#8221; the bank said, referring
to the Supreme Court case known as Stern v. Marshall. 
Recent rulings by higher courts have left bankruptcy cases
in disarray. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff threw out demands by
the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm for billions of dollars
in damages from London-based HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The Supreme
Court&#8217;s June decision limited bankruptcy courts&#8217; ability to rule
on state-law claims as well as ending any chance for heirs of
Smith, a former Playboy model, to collect a $449 million
judgment against the estate of J. Howard Marshall, the Texas
billionaire to whom she had been married. 
Collateral Demand 
According to JPMorgan, Lehman&#8217;s demand for return of the
collateral can&#8217;t be decided by a bankruptcy judge either. Those
claims were made to pad out bankrupt Lehman&#8217;s estate, and &#8220;fall
outside the claims-allowance process&#8221; that is the business of a
bankruptcy court, it said. 
Lehman disagreed about the impact of Stern v. Marshall. 
&#8220;The Stern court left untouched the bankruptcy courts&#8217;
authority to enter final judgments on common-law claims&#8221; that
stem from the bankruptcy, it said in a filing. 
Lehman claimed in the lawsuit filed last year that JPMorgan
demanded loan guarantees that fatally weakened the firm.
JPMorgan, which lent about $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, responded by
suing Lehman, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the
loan. 
The Lehman suit is: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Mexican traders are postponing bets
for interest-rate increases to August after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. lowered the country&#8217;s growth
forecast amid concern the U.S. may relapse into recession. 
Yields on futures for the 28-day interbank due in August,
known as TIIE, sank 15 basis points in the past week to a record
low 5.02 percent. The contracts indicate traders expect Banco de
Mexico to leave its key rate unchanged at 4.5 percent until that
month. They have delayed their estimates for a rate boost 14
times this year. In Brazil, traders are pricing in the
possibility the central bank may lower borrowing costs by
December after betting on an increase three weeks ago. 
Mexico&#8217;s growth prospects are dimming after the economy in
the U.S., the Latin American country&#8217;s biggest trade partner,
grew less than forecast in the second quarter. Mexico is more
likely to cut interest rates than raise them next year, Goldman
Sachs economist Alberto Ramos wrote in a research note. Mexico
is the only major Latin American country to keep its key rate
unchanged in the past year as inflation holds near a five-year
low. 
&#8220;With the data where they are and inflation so benign,
some are betting there could be an even longer pause,&#8221; Gabriel Casillas, chief Mexico economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in
Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We expected a long
pause.&#8221; 
The yield on Mexico&#8217;s benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell
56 basis points, or 0.56 percentage point, in the past month to
6.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Brazil,
yields on similar-maturity government debt fell 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, in the past five sessions while those
on Colombian debt fell eight basis points. 
&#8216;Highly Dependent&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs on Aug. 5 reduced its Mexican growth forecast
for this year to 4.1 percent from 4.4 percent and its estimate
for 2012 to 3.9 percent from 4.5 percent, citing weakening
demand from the U.S. A day earlier, Bank of America cut its 2012
growth projection to 4 percent from 4.5 percent, while leaving
its forecast for this year at 4 percent. 
&#8220;Given the logistical proximity to the U.S., Mexico will
always be an economy that is highly dependent on the U.S.,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Ramos said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There is
not much they can do. When the U.S. is doing well, they benefit
handsomely. When the U.S. is not doing so well, they are more
exposed than other economies.&#8221; 
&#8216;Remain Cautious&#8217; 
The U.S. economy, the destination for 80 percent of Mexican
exports, grew at a less-than-forecast 1.3 percent pace in the
second quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the
first three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department said July 29. U.S. consumer
spending grew 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, the final months of the recession. 
Press officials at Mexico&#8217;s central bank didn&#8217;t return
telephone calls seeking comment. 
The Finance Ministry maintained its forecast of 4.3 percent
growth this year and 4.2 percent in 2012, Miguel Messmacher,
chief economist, said in an Aug. 5 phone interview. 
&#8220;The different indicators of economic activity aren&#8217;t for
the moment sounding any alarms, even though we have to remain
cautious,&#8221; Messmacher said from Mexico City. 
The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican government
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 19 basis points to
160 at 6:01 p.m. New York time, according to JPMorgan Chase 
Co. 
The peso weakened 2.7 percent to 12.3253 per U.S. dollar.
It&#8217;s up 0.1 percent this year. 
Default Swaps 
The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years rose 24 basis points to 152, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a government
or company fails to adhere to its debt agreements. 
Mexico&#8217;s economy will weather the slump in the U.S. and
grow 4.8 percent this year, said Sergio Luna, head of economic
research at Citigroup Inc. in Mexico City. Central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens will raise the benchmark rate from 4.5 percent
in January, Luna said. 
&#8220;The market reaction has been disproportionate to the data
in the U.S.,&#8221; Luna said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
see a deterioration in the data that indicates any more
difficulty for the U.S. markets. The data in Mexico has also
been much better than that in the U.S.&#8221; 
Rate Outlook 
Economists expect Banxico, as Mexico&#8217;s central bank is
known, to stay on hold until May, according to the median
forecast of 21 economists in a survey distributed Aug. 4 by
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Banamex unit. 
Inflation slowed in Mexico to 3.28 percent in June from
3.69 percent a year earlier. It touched a five-year low of 3.04
percent in March. 
The Mexican economy is still struggling to rebound from its
2009 recession, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Ramos said. Mexico&#8217;s economy
shrank 6.1 percent that year, the worst since 1995. 
&#8220;The recovery from the brutal 2009 recession has been very
moderate,&#8221; Ramos said. &#8220;Things never accelerated to gain a lot
of momentum.&#8221;

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest publicly traded oil company, said it&#8217;s trying to sell
its interests in some Indonesian natural-gas operations that are
part of an ongoing lawsuit. 
The properties include the Arun field and satellite fields,
and the North Sumatra Offshore field, David Eglinton, a
spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an e-
mailed statement today. The assets had annual average net
production of 215 million cubic feet a day of gas last year, as
well as some liquids, Eglinton said. 
In July, a U.S. appeals court reinstated a lawsuit thrown
out by a lower court, ruling that Exxon must face allegations
that it aided and abetted murder, torture and sexual assault by
its security forces in Indonesia&#8217;s Aceh province. At the time,
Exxon said it has &#8220;fought these baseless claims for many
years.&#8221; Today, the company asked the full appeals court to
review the three-judge panel&#8217;s decision. 
The attempt to sell assets in Indonesia is consistent with
the company&#8217;s &#8220;long-standing practice of continually reviewing
assets for their contribution to Exxon Mobil&#8217;s operating and
financial objectives, as well as their potential value to
others,&#8221; Eglinton said in the statement today. 
The asset sale &#8220;has nothing to do with the Aceh lawsuit,&#8221;
he said. Eglinton said the sales process doesn&#8217;t involve other
Exxon projects in Indonesia. Exxon and predecessor companies
have operated in Indonesia for more than 100 years and will
retain &#8220;an active presence&#8221; in the country, he said.

General Maritime Corp. (GMR) led declines
by oil-tanker stocks in New York as the threat of a second U.S.
recession in three years increased the risk that energy imports
into the world&#8217;s largest economy may fall. 
General Maritime fell 29 cents, or 39 percent, to 45 cents
in New York Stock Exchange trading. The six-member Bloomberg
Tanker Index (TANKER) dropped 11 percent, the most since March 5, 2009,
to the lowest level since May 9, 2003. 
&#8220;The stock market is discounting problems ahead,&#8221; Andreas Vergottis, research director at Tufton Oceanic Ltd., manager of
the world&#8217;s biggest shipping hedge fund, said by phone. &#8220;It
will be very bad for tankers.&#8221; 
The U.S. economy is heading into a &#8220;double-dip&#8221;
recession, Nouriel Roubini, the co-founder and chairman of New
York-based Roubini Global Economics LLC, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. 
Tanker shares retreated as equities slumped globally. The
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index dropped 6.7 percent to 1,119.46, the
lowest level since September. The MSCI World (MXWO) Index slid 5.1
percent, extending its drop from this year&#8217;s high to 19 percent. 
A return to recession in the U.S. would delay any rebound
in charter rates for tankers until after 2013, said Jonathan Chappell, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in New York. Hire
costs for very large crude carriers, each able to haul 2 million
barrels of oil, are at the lowest level in 10 years, according
to the analyst. 
34% Decline 
&#8220;What this could do is delay the recovery out further,&#8221;
Chappell said. 
Hire costs on the industry&#8217;s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-
Japan route fell 1.7 percent to 46.09 industry-standard
Worldscale points today, according to the Baltic Exchange in
London. The decline was the 12th in a row. Rental rates are down
34 percent this year. 
Seaborne shipments of oil into the U.S. were forecast to
reach 6.9 million barrels a day, or 17 percent of all crude
shipped this year, an 11-year low, according to Clarkson
Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world&#8217;s largest
shipbroker. The country is the world&#8217;s biggest oil importer. 
Owners are facing a glut of ships after ordering the most
in almost three decades in 2007 and 2008 before the world
economy entered its worst recession since World War II. Supply
and demand in the tanker market probably would only return to
balance later than 2013 if demand were to weaken further,
Chappell said. 
Negative Rates 
Average quarterly rates for VLCCs carrying crude to the
U.S. from the Middle East have been unprofitable since October,
according to data from the exchange. It assesses freight costs
on more than 50 international maritime routes. 
Unprofitable, or negative, rates mean tanker owners
effectively are paying some of charterers&#8217; costs because agreed
daily hire rates fail to cover all fuel and operating expenses
for a journey. 
Tankers will ship an estimated 40.9 million barrels of
crude oil, Clarkson said. 
&#8220;Trade will slow down, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we
see negative growth,&#8221; Tufton&#8217;s Vergottis said.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and
other energy companies fell the most in more than two years on
concern that a cut in the U.S. debt rating signals lower crude
oil prices, investors and analysts said. 
Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, dropped $4.63, or 6.2
percent, to $70.19 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, wiping out its gain this year. Chevron, based
in San Ramon, California, fell $7.36, or 7.5 percent, to $90.25.
The one-day declines were the steepest since Dec. 1, 2008. 
The downgrade of U.S. debt by Standard  Poor&#8217;s Aug. 5
crystallized recession concerns based on rising U.S. and
European debt and a U.S. government report last week that those
out of work 27 weeks or more comprise 50 percent of the
unemployed, said James Glickenhaus, who manages about $2 billion
at Glickenhaus  Co. in New York. 
&#8220;People are calling up mutual funds, saying, &#8216;Get me out
of stocks,&#8217;&#8221; Glickenhaus, said today in an interview. 
Widely owned and easily traded stocks like Exxon are part
of the general selloff, he said. 
&#8220;This is contagion,&#8221; Donald Coxe, who manages $500
million at Coxe Advisors in Chicago, said in an interview.
&#8220;Gold is going up because of fear the financial system is going
to implode.&#8221; 
Oil Falls 
Gold rose $61.40 to a record $1,713.20 an ounce, up 3.7
percent at today&#8217;s close in New York. Crude oil for September
delivery fell $5.57, or 6.4 percent, to $81.31, on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price since Nov. 23. 
&#8220;The SP downgrade confirmed everybody&#8217;s fear,&#8221; Fadel Gheit, a New York-based energy analyst for Oppenheimer  Co.
said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;Less confidence in the
U.S. economy alone will bring the outlook for consumption lower.
We&#8217;ll use less oil.&#8221; 
Quicksilver Resources Inc. (KWK), based in Fort Worth, Texas,
fell $2.65, or 23 percent, to $9.10, the lowest price in more
than two years. The oil and natural-gas producer said it will
raise spending 39 percent this year after missing its second-
quarter production target. 
&#8220;Every company that&#8217;s had the big increase in capital

Lowering U.S. credit one level to AA+ won&#8217;t hurt Exxon

Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth largest
U.S. bank by assets, said Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade of the
nation&#8217;s credit rating may have a &#8220;material adverse&#8221; impact on
financial markets and the firm&#8217;s business. 
The downgrade could affect the firm&#8217;s credit ratings and
require it to post more collateral on some loans, the New York-
based company said today in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Spreads in money markets and other short-
term rates already increased in anticipation of the downgrade,
the bank said. 
&#8220;Because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit
rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the
ultimate impacts on global markets and our business, financial
condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be
immediately apparent,&#8221; the firm wrote. 
Group of Seven and Group of 20 leaders said they are ready
to stabilize financial markets after SP lowered the top U.S.
rating by one level to AA+. Policy makers held emergency
conference calls over the weekend to try to stave off weakening
investor confidence that has already wiped out about $5.4
trillion in global equity values since July 26. 
&#8220;It could disrupt payment systems, money markets, long-
term or short-term fixed-income markets, foreign-exchange
markets, commodities markets and equity markets and adversely
affect the cost and availability of funding,&#8221; Morgan Stanley
said of the downgrade in the filing.

(Corrects currency from euros to dollars in ninth paragraph
of story that ran Aug. 5.) 
Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, said second-quarter profit fell 45
percent, hurt by writedowns of Greek bonds and its stake in
Telco SpA. 
Net income declined to 190 million euros ($269 million)
from 346 million euros a year earlier, missing the 261 million-
euro estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The second-
quarter figures were calculated by Bloomberg by subtracting
first-quarter numbers from the first-half results. 
&#8220;We are confident that we will reach our full-year target
of an operating result of between 4 billion euros and 4.7
billion euros,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto
said in a statement today. 
Generali joined insurer Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI) and
Italian banks in writing down Greek debt after signing the
Institute of International Finance&#8217;s rescue plan last month. The
company wrote down 140 million euros of its 500 million-euro net
exposure, which represents Greek bonds in its own portfolio. 
The company wrote down bonds expiring by 2020, which
account for 70 percent of its holdings. Quarterly earnings at
the Trieste, Italy-based insurer were also hurt by a 143
million-euro writedown of the stake held in Telco, the holding
company that controls Telecom Italia SpA (TIT), as well as the
increase of an Italian regional tax, known as IRAP. 
Operating Margins 
Generali expects higher operating margins both in the life
and non-life segments this year. &#8220;We continue our strategy of
expansion in markets with high growth potential and our focus on
efficiency improvements in the core European countries,&#8221; the
CEO said. 
Quarterly operating profit rose 20 percent to 1.15 billion
euros on growth of its non-life business. The insurer&#8217;s non-life
premiums climbed 2 percent to 5.2 billion euros, while the
combined ratio, a measure of profitability, improved to 96.5
percent in the first half from 98.8 percent a year earlier. 
&#8220;Operating results beat expectations,&#8221; Werner Eisenmann,
an analyst at DZ Bank AG, wrote in a note to clients. &#8220;New
business in life was still sluggish,&#8221; he said. 
The insurer, which gets about 13 percent of its operating
income in central and eastern Europe, is in talks with VTB Group
to form a joint venture to sell its products in Russia,
Perissinotto said in May. Generali expects to increase assets
under management in Asia and eastern Europe to $30 billion by
2015. 
Generali fell 3.3 percent to 11.6 euros in Milan, giving
the company a market value of 18 billion euros. The Bloomberg
Europe 500 Insurance Index, which was down 3 percent today, has
dropped 24 percent in the past six months, compared with
Generali&#8217;s 31 percent decline. 
Europe at Risk 
The euro region is at &#8220;serious risk&#8221; of breaking up,
Perissinotto said. &#8220;Europe faces a serious risk of breaking up
into its constituent parts and finding itself and its various
member states impoverished,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Unfortunately we have
not seen yet a coordinated response and I urge our central
authorities, such as the ECB, to act in a decisive way.&#8221; 
Generali cut its exposure to corporate bonds and Italy&#8217;s
financial industry in the first half, while it boosted the
weight of Italian government bonds from 49 billion euros at the
end of March to 51 billion euros. 
The CEO also said that the company aims to grow internally
because &#8220;it&#8217;s no time for acquisitions.&#8221;

Morgan Sindall Group Plc (MGNS), a U.K.
construction and refurbishment company, said first-half profit
climbed 14 percent as affordable housing revenue was boosted by
an acquisition and it reduced its share of public-sector work. 
Net income rose to 14.9 million pounds ($24.5 million),
from 13.1 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Revenue advanced 11 percent
to 1.09 billion pounds. Pretax profit dropped 9 percent to 16.7
million pounds as &#8220;challenging&#8221; market conditions affected
margins. 
Morgan Sindall bought Connaught&#8217;s maintenance business out
of administration last year, helping to boost revenue for its
affordable housing unit 32 percent to 228 million pounds. The
company also reduced the effect of government spending cuts by
reducing its share of public-sector work, which now accounts for
50 percent of business, compared with 60 percent a year earlier. 
In February, Chairman John Morgan said the company expected
the private sector &#8220;to pick up some of the slack&#8221; from
spending cuts. 
&#8220;In the last few downturns we&#8217;ve increased our market
share and we expect to do the same this time,&#8221; Morgan said in a
phone interview today. &#8220;Our biggest challenge at the moment is
how do we make the most of this so that we can look back in four
years time and say we had a good recession. Margins are very
tough but we&#8217;re in a strong place&#8221; 
Morgan Sindall shares slipped 0.9 percent to 612 pence as
of 11:34 a.m. in London. The stock has dropped 13 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 264.3 million pounds.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, posted third-quarter sales and profit that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN sports
network countered flat cable advertising sales. 
Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Profit
excluding some items was 78 cents, beating the 73-cent average
of 22 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Cable-network profit rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year&#8217;s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of &#8220;Cars&#8221; and Marvel merchandise. 
&#8220;This is a little better than expected, but there was
really nothing that&#8217;s remarkable in these numbers,&#8221; said
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities in
Denver who recommends the stock. &#8220;The affiliate fees at ESPN
were a little unexpected, and the parks were able to take
advantage of the Easter holiday.&#8221; 
Disney may consider new discounts at its domestic theme
parks if the economy weakens, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said on a conference call with analysts, adding &#8220;We&#8217;re not
thinking of doing that any time soon.&#8221; 
Attendance at Disney&#8217;s domestic theme parks increased by 2
percent, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call,
and per-capita spending by 8 percent. 
Seeking Acquisitions 
Disney will continue to make acquisitions, Iger said,
without identifying potential targets. Since becoming CEO in
2005, the company has acquired Pixar and Marvel. Last month,
Disney offered to buy the 49.6 percent of India&#8217;s UTV Software
Communications Ltd., a production company, it doesn&#8217;t own for
$454 million. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue to deploy capital in this
direction,&#8221; Iger said. He estimated that the $13 billion Disney
has spent to acquire companies in the last five years
represented about $23 billion in &#8220;enterprise value.&#8221; 
Disney fell 45 cents to $34.25 in extended trading. The
shares gained $1.67, or 5.1 percent, to $34.70 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and have declined 7.5
percent this year. 
Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts&#8217; projections of $10.5 billion. 
Cable Revenue 
Cable revenue advanced 7.2 percent to $3.52 billion, with
fees from pay-TV systems countering ad sales at ESPN that were
little changed, the company said. 
ABC&#8217;s profit rose 20 percent to $250 million, benefiting
from lower production costs and higher network advertising.
Total revenue from broadcasting decreased 1 percent to $1.43
billion, reflecting lower ad sales at local television stations,
Disney said. 
Profit at Disney&#8217;s consumer products division increased 32
percent to $155 million, buoyed by merchandise from the &#8220;Cars&#8221;
animated movies and the Marvel character line. Revenue rose 13
percent to $685 million. 
Revenue at Disney&#8217;s parks division increased 12 percent to
$3.17 billion.

The cost to protect against a default
by U.S. banks plunged after soaring yesterday by the most in
almost three years, as the Federal Reserve vowed to keep
interest rates near zero through mid-2013. 
Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), which decline as investor confidence improves, dropped
by the most since at least May 2010, according to data provider
CMA. A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk also fell by the most
since that month. 
Traders pushed the cost of protecting corporate and
financial debt lower after the Fed discussed a range of policy
tools to bolster the economy. Investor confidence in bank and
corporate creditworthiness improved after deteriorating
yesterday at the fastest pace in a year following Standard 
Poor&#8217;s cut of the U.S. government&#8217;s credit rating on Aug. 5. 
&#8220;While we appreciate the uncertainty regarding the
economy, confidence, mortgage putbacks and Europe contagion, we
firmly believe that yesterday was way overdone in the credit
markets,&#8221; Jonathan Hatcher, a credit strategist at Jefferies
Group Inc. in New York, wrote in a note to clients. U.S.
financial companies today have better balance sheets and
stronger capital and are no longer reliant on overnight
liquidity, he said. 
Swaps on New York-based JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, declined 19 basis points to 116 basis points,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. 
Citigroup, Goldman 
Contracts linked to Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) each decreased 25 to 185. Swaps tied to Morgan Stanley debt
dropped 30 to 250 and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) declined 20 to
115, the data show. Contracts on Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the
largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 17 to 278, the data show. 
The average credit swap price on the six biggest U.S. banks
fell 23 to 188 after jumping 51 yesterday to 211, the largest
gain since September 2008 when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed for bankruptcy and caused credit markets to seize up. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 7.6 basis points to a mid-price of 107.5 as of 5:30 p.m. in
New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
The index of default swaps climbed 12.1 basis points
yesterday to reach 115.1 points, the highest level since July 7,
2010, Markit data show.

The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s
chairman illegally transferred more than $2.5 million to his own
accounts while running the Albert Ellis Institute, the nonprofit
said in a lawsuit claiming JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) let it happen. 
Jeffrey Bernstein, the former president of Albert Ellis&#8217;
board of trustees, &#8220;secretly and without authority or the
knowledge of its other trustees&#8221; moved institute funds into
personal bank accounts he owns or controls, the organization
said in the lawsuit. 
Bernstein was first elected to the institute&#8217;s board of
trustees in March 2006 and was chosen as president of the board
in July 2006, the institute said in the lawsuit. He was named
acting director of administration in January 2010 and appointed
to the permanent post the following month. Bernstein resigned
from all offices he held at the institute after the fraud was
discovered in February 2011, lawyers for the group said in the
complaint, which was filed today in federal court in Manhattan. 
JPMorgan has been provided with a list of 65 unauthorized
transactions by Bernstein and has refused to restore the funds
to the institute&#8217;s account, lawyers for the institute said in
the lawsuit, which seeks more than $2.3 million in damages. 
U.S. Investigation 
The institute contacted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance&#8217;s office about the alleged fraud, and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s
Office in Manhattan is investigating, David Blasband, an
attorney representing the institute, said in a telephone
interview. 
Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Vance&#8217;s office, declined to
comment on whether the district attorney is investigating. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. 
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Patrick J. Smith, an
attorney representing Bernstein, didn&#8217;t return a telephone
message left at his office seeking comment on the complaint.
Bernstein isn&#8217;t named as a defendant in the suit. 
The institute, located on East 65th Street in Manhattan, is
a not-for-profit psychotherapy organization founded in 1959 by
its late namesake, Dr. Albert Ellis. It is &#8220;committed to
alleviating emotional disturbances and enhancing emotional well-
being through the study, teaching and application of rational
emotive and cognitive behavioral therapy,&#8221; according to the
lawsuit. 
&#8216;Chart Our Course&#8217; 
The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce has no information about
the matter, President Nancy Ploeger said in an e-mailed
statement. Bernstein has resigned as the chamber&#8217;s chairman
effective immediately, and the organization&#8217;s board will meet as
soon as possible to &#8220;chart our course going forward,&#8221; Ploeger
said in the statement. 
Bernstein serves as chairman of the New York-based
Archstone Group, a corporate management consulting group, and
was the founder of TruFoods Systems Inc., a company that
operated more than 100 restaurants until 2007 when it was sold
to Trufoods LLC, according to a biography posted on the
Manhattan Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s website. 
TruFoods began in 1998 when Bernstein acquired Pudgie&#8217;s
Famous Chicken at a bankruptcy court auction, according to the
biography. Digital Creative Development Corp. (DCDC), which operated
the Arthur Treacher&#8217;s Fish  Chips chain, bought Pudgie&#8217;s in
October 2000 and named Bernstein chief executive officer of the
combined company. 
Stalking Horse Bidder 
Digital Creative sold its interest in the combined company
to an affiliate of Bernstein&#8217;s in March 2002. TruFoods also
participated as a stalking horse bidder in bankruptcy
transactions, according to Bernstein&#8217;s biography. 
Bernstein previously served as president and CEO of
Consolidated Services Inc., a management consulting firm that
was retained by debtors, creditor committees and secured lenders
in more than 100 Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases, according to the
biography. Bernstein has also served as chief restructuring
officer and an examiner in several Chapter 11 cases, the
biography says. 
Bernstein told the institute shortly after he was appointed
director of administration that an operating account it had
maintained at JPMorgan had been closed, the institute said in
the lawsuit. 
The institute discovered in February that the account
hadn&#8217;t been closed and started an investigation that revealed
that the funds in question had been used by Bernstein for his
&#8220;personal benefit,&#8221; the institute claims in the complaint. 
&#8220;When questioned about the allegedly closed Chase Bank
account, Bernstein refused to provide any information, failed to
explain his actions or account for the monies misappropriated
from the institute,&#8221; lawyers for the institute said in the
lawsuit. &#8220;However, as noted, Bernstein resigned all offices he
held at the institute. Bernstein&#8217;s fraud was immediately
reported to law enforcement authorities.&#8221; 
The case is Albert Ellis Institute v. JP Morgan Chase Bank
NA, 11-cv-5504, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, was sued over its sale of mortgage-
linked securities to now-failed credit unions hours after it
disclosed a list of other potential complaints. 
The National Credit Union Administration filed a lawsuit in
California today and said it&#8217;s seeking more than $491 million of
damages from Goldman Sachs. American International Group Inc. (AIG),
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are among firms that have also
threatened to take legal action against the bank over mortgage-
related securities, Goldman Sachs said in a regulatory filing. 
The bank was already facing active mortgage-linked lawsuits
from companies and investors that the firm estimated had
experienced cumulative losses of $485 million as of June 30. The
new potential claims aren&#8217;t included in that estimate or in the
firm&#8217;s $2 billion estimate of &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses
from legal cases. 
The list of entities, which also includes the Federal
Housing Finance Agency and insurance companies Allstate Corp. (ALL)
and John Hancock, &#8220;threatened to assert claims against the firm
in connection with various mortgage-related offerings,&#8221; New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in the quarterly filing. The
company has reached agreements with some of the entities to toll
the relevant statute of limitations. 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. The stock rose $5.07, or 4.3 percent, to
$122.73 in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading after
falling as low as $111.60 earlier in the session. Goldman Sachs
is down 27 percent so far this year. 
Lawsuit Targeting JPMorgan 
The NCUA&#8217;s suit against Goldman Sachs, which relates to the
collapse of U.S. Central and Western Corporate federal credit
unions, follows a complaint against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and two
against Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS) 
&#8220;Those who caused the problems in the wholesale credit
unions should pay for the losses now being paid by retail credit
unions,&#8221; NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz said in a statement. 
AIG, the insurer rescued by U.S. bailouts during the 2008
financial crisis, yesterday sued Bank of America Corp. (BAC) In that
case, AIG claimed that Bank of America caused more than $10
billion in losses at AIG, which specialized in investments and
insurance tied to mortgage bonds. Bank of America rejected the
assertions of New York-based AIG. 
Possible Losses 
Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment on the
company&#8217;s potential suit against Goldman Sachs, as did Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for Allstate. Laurie Lupton, a
spokeswoman for Toronto-based Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC), which
owns John Hancock, had no immediate comment. 
Spokespeople for the FHFA and Freddie Mac also declined to
comment, while Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae,

Goldman Sachs reduced its estimate of &#8220;reasonably
possible&#8221; losses from lawsuits to $2 billion as of June 30 from
$2.7 billion on March 31, according to the quarterly filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October that they
should disclose such costs &#8220;when there is at least a reasonable
possibility&#8221; that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. 
The estimate, the third of its kind made by Goldman Sachs,
is the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of losses in matters where the risk is
&#8220;more than remote but less than likely,&#8221; the New York-based
firm said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said some current and former
employees are the target of a criminal complaint in South Korea
related to sales of collateralized debt obligations. 
Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. &#8220;filed a criminal complaint
against certain past and present employees of the firm in South
Korea relating to its purchase of a CDO securitization from
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today. 
Heungkuk Life and Heungkuk Fire  Marine Insurance Co.
filed a complaint to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors&#8217;
office on June 28 against nine Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
executives and employees, accusing them of fraud, Lee Yun No, an
official at Heungkuk Life, said by phone on July 5. 
The Korean companies have seen losses from purchasing
collateralized debt obligations in 2007 from Goldman Sachs, Lee
said, without elaborating. 
Goldman Sachs confirmed the complaint for the first time
publicly in today&#8217;s quarterly submission to the SEC. 
The complaint &#8220;does not represent any judgment by a
governmental entity, but starts a process whereby the prosecutor
investigates the complaint and determines whether to take
action,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said
American International Group Inc. (AIG), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
are among companies that have threatened to take legal action
against the firm over mortgage-related securities. 
A list of entities, which also includes the Federal Housing
Finance Agency and insurance companies Allstate Corp. (ALL) and John
Hancock, &#8220;threatened to assert claims against the firm in
connection with various mortgage-related offerings,&#8221; New York-
based Goldman Sachs said in a quarterly filing today. Goldman
Sachs said it reached agreements with some of the entities to
toll the relevant statute of limitations. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
already facing active mortgage-related lawsuits from companies
and investors that the firm estimated had experienced cumulative
losses of $485 million as of June 30. The new potential lawsuits
aren&#8217;t included in that estimate or in the firm&#8217;s $2 billion
estimate of &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses from lawsuits. 
AIG, the insurer rescued by U.S. bailouts during the 2008
financial crisis, yesterday disclosed plans to sue Bank of
America Corp. In that case, AIG alleges that Bank of America
caused more than $10 billion in losses at AIG, which specialized
in investments and insurance tied to mortgage bonds. Bank of
America rejected the assertions of New York-based AIG. 
Goldman Sachs reduced its estimate of &#8220;reasonably
possible&#8221; losses from lawsuits to $2 billion as of June 30 from
$2.7 billion on March 31, according to its quarterly filing
today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes more than half its revenue from trading, lost
money in that business on 15 days during the second quarter, the
most daily losses since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
The firm&#8217;s traders lost more than $100 million on one of
the days, according to the New York-based company&#8217;s quarterly
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They
generated more than $100 million on four days out of 63 total
days, the filing showed. The second quarter ended June 30. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of
analysts&#8217; estimates as fixed-income trading revenue plunged 63
percent from the first quarter. The company blamed the fixed-
income trading drop, which was more than twice as large as any
other bank&#8217;s, on a reduction in risk-taking. 
The company reported zero days of trading losses during the
first quarter of last year, the first perfect quarter in the
firm&#8217;s history. It reported 10 such days in the second quarter,
two in the third and 13 in the fourth. 
The company said its trading losses exceeded the firm&#8217;s
value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the company could
lose in the securities markets in one day, on one occasion
during the quarter. Average daily value-at-risk was $101 million
in the quarter.

A former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) manager
fired for allegedly kissing a colleague at a conference, and
then lying about the incident, sued the company in a London
court. 
Simon Negus, a partner and general manager at Microsoft&#8217;s
U.K. unit until he was dismissed in September, filed the lawsuit
on Aug. 3. The complaint followed one made by Microsoft in April
against Negus, now chief operating officer of Upstream Systems,
seeking to reclaim holiday pay and part of his signing on bonus. 
The dispute relates to an incident at Microsoft&#8217;s annual
conference in Atlanta in July 2009. Negus, a U.K. board member,
may have been seen kissing a female colleague in full view of
other attendees, Microsoft said in a court filing. 
Negus denied the &#8220;kissing incident&#8221; had taken place and
when further information came out suggesting it had, he was
dismissed for dishonesty, the Redmond, Washington-based company
said in its claim. 
Negus didn&#8217;t respond to calls and e-mails for comment. 
Microsoft&#8217;s disciplinary panel found Negus had &#8220;behaved
dishonestly, and thereby acted in a manner calculated or likely
to destroy trust and confidence between him and Microsoft,&#8221;
according to court documents. 
A spokeswoman at Edelman, a public relations firm employed
by Microsoft, declined to comment. 
Microsoft is seeking the return of 75,000 pounds
($122,600), part of a signing bonus paid to Negus when he joined
from Dell Inc. in 2008 that required him to remain at Microsoft
for three years. The company is also claiming 2,563 pounds of
holiday pay. 
Negus joined Upstream, a mobile-marketing technology
company, on July 20. In a press release issued at the time,
Upstream said Negus led Microsoft&#8217;s U.K. Enterprise and Partner
Group, and the U.K. unit had won Microsoft &#8216;Subsidiary of the
Year&#8217; in 2010. 
The cases are: Simon Negus v. Microsoft Limited,
HQ11X02875, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division; and

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
theme-park company, fell the most since 2008 on concern that
slowing consumer spending and rising costs at the ESPN sports
network may crimp profit growth. 
Among the largest media companies, including Time Warner
Inc. (TWX), News Corp. and Viacom Inc., Disney is the most exposed to
consumer spending through its theme parks, as well as broadcast
and cable-TV units, said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg
Industries. Increasing costs to broadcast sports on ESPN and a
declining DVD market may also hurt earnings, according to
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities. 
&#8220;Certainly there are cost pressures at ESPN and at the
parks, but they were a little worse than I would have thought,&#8221;
said Harrigan, who cut his rating on the shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; after the company reported quarterly earnings. 
The stock dropped 9.1 percent to $31.54 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most since Dec. 1,
2008. With today&#8217;s decline, the shares have fallen 16 percent
this year. 
Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion in the fiscal
third quarter ended July 2, the Burbank, California-based
company said in a statement yesterday after the markets closed. 
ESPN Affiliate Fee 
While earnings of 78 cents beat the 73-cent average of
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg, they included 6 cents
in deferred ESPN affiliate revenue that analysts expected in the
fourth quarter. Without that fee, earnings would have fallen
short, Harrigan said. 
U.S. personal spending fell 0.2 percent in June, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke vowed yesterday to keep borrowing costs at an all-time
low to revive an economic recovery that&#8217;s &#8220;considerably
slower&#8221; than expected. 
Higher costs at ESPN and lower syndication sales at the ABC
broadcasting network will lower this quarter&#8217;s earnings by 7
cents a share, Chief Financial Officer James Rasulo said
yesterday on the conference call. The ESPN expenses are
associated with new contracts to broadcast college sports, Major
League Baseball, and the National Football League, he said. 
&#8220;Earnings upside was less than met the eye,&#8221; Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets in New York, said
in a note to investors. The fiscal fourth-quarter oulook is
&#8220;muddied,&#8221; said the analyst, who rates the stock &#8220;neutral.&#8221; 
Studio Costs 
Studio entertainment operating income fell 60 percent to
$49 million in the quarter. While &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: On
Stranger Tides&#8221; earned more than $1 billion at the box office
worldwide, &#8220;increased revenue was largely offset by higher
marketing and distribution costs,&#8221; said Rasulo, the financial
chief. 
&#8220;The costs just need to be trimmed,&#8221; said Harrigan, the
Wunderlich analyst. 
Time Warner last week reported a 14 percent increase in
second-quarter net income as revenue from its cable-TV, movie
and magazine businesses rose. 
News Corp. (NWSA) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of 35
cents, excluding some items, beating the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by five cents. The shares rose
2.1 percent in after-hours trading at 4:22 p.m. New York time.

Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Gilead
Sciences Inc. (GILD) won U.S. approval of a once-daily HIV treatment
that combines multiple medicines into one tablet. 
The Food and Drug Administration cleared the therapy that
combines New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ&#8217;s Edurant and
Gilead&#8217;s Truvada, Foster City, California-based Gilead said
today in a statement. A single, or fixed-dose, daily tablet
simplifies HIV therapy, said John Martin, Gilead&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer, in the statement. 
The combination product, called Complera, is expected to
generate $567 million in revenue in 2013, said Joel Sendek, an
analyst with Lazard Capital Markets in New York. He called the
drug a &#8220;catalyst&#8221; for Gilead, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of
AIDS drugs, in a July 27 note to clients. 
&#8220;The concept of a single-tablet regimen has become a goal
in HIV drug development and the standard of care in medical
practice in the United States,&#8221; Tony Mills, an investigator in
Complera studies, said in the Gilead statement. &#8220;Given its
efficacy, safety and convenience, the availability of Complera
represents an exciting milestone in addressing the individual
needs of patients new to HIV therapy.&#8221; 
About 1.2 million people in the U.S. have HIV with about
48,100 new patients contracting the virus in 2009, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention said Aug. 4 in a report. 
Gilead&#8217;s Pill 
Gilead now sells the only single-pill HIV regimen, Atripla,
a triple-drug combination approved in 2006 that includes Sustiva
from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) Atripla was Gilead&#8217;s top seller in
2010, generating $2.9 billion. 
Gilead and JJ announced an agreement June 28 to develop a
fixed-dose HIV treatment combining Gilead&#8217;s experimental
cobicistat and Prezista from JJ. Cobicistat increases blood
levels of certain HIV medicines to allow for once-daily dosing,
according to a statement from Gilead. 
The companies also said they are negotiating the terms of
an agreement to develop a single-tablet regimen combining
Prezista with Gilead&#8217;s Emtriva, cobicistat and investigational
GS 7340. 
Truvada is Gilead&#8217;s second-highest selling drug behind its
Atripla with $2.6 billion in sales last year, according to
Bloomberg data. The FDA approved Edurant May 20, in combination
with other antiretroviral agents, for patients who have never
taken HIV treatment before. 
The companies originally filed an application for the
Truvada and Edurant combination Nov. 23. The FDA told the drug
manufacturers Jan. 25 the agency needed more information, which
Gilead and JJ included when they refiled their application Feb.
10, according to a statement from Gilead.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said his company, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, will
fight attempts to cut Medicare payments for medicines after the
industry helped underwrite the U.S. health-care overhaul. 
Drug companies contributed $112 billion in discounts and
refunds to last year&#8217;s health-care law, helping Democrats make
up for new spending in the bill. U.S. drugmakers led by Pfizer
and Merck  Co. (MRK) are concerned they will be asked to give more in
the debt-limit deal President Barack Obama signed Aug. 2 that
requires further negotiated cuts in government expenditures. 
&#8220;We made a contribution to the Affordable Care Act that
was substantial and fundamental,&#8221; New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s Read
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We are only 10 percent of the
health-care spend in the United States, and we are the most
efficient part of that.&#8221; 
Squeezing drug savings from Medicare, the U.S. health
program for the elderly and disabled, may cost makers $20
billion and eliminate 260,000 jobs, according to the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in
Washington. Obama endorses a proposal to discount drugs for
Medicare patients who also qualify for Medicaid, the federal-
state health program for the poor.

 Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
largest theme-park company, is seeking acquisitions, a year and
a half after completing its $4.2 billion takeover of Marvel
Entertainment&#8217;s cast of film and comic-book characters. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have what I&#8217;d call a strategic hole,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said yesterday on a conference
call after the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings release. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ve looked expansively at opportunities across the world to
buy either new characters or businesses that are capable of
creating great characters and great stories.&#8221; 
Iger didn&#8217;t specify any targets. He cited international as
an area of interest, and India as &#8220;another example of a high-
growth market. We think investing in it, at least in today&#8217;s
world, is a smart move,&#8221; Iger said. 
Disney is in the middle of a regulatory review of its
proposal to buy the 49.6 percent of UTV Software Communications
Ltd. (UTV), a Mumbai-based film and TV production company, that it
doesn&#8217;t own for as much as 20.1 billion rupees ($445 million). 
From fiscal 2006 to 2010, Burbank, California-based Disney
has spent $13 billion on acquisitions, Iger said. The company
now puts a $23 billion enterprise value on those purchases, he
said. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s been smart about buying assets that contribute to
the core of the company,&#8221; said Bill Smead, chief investment
officer of Seattle-based Smead Capital Investment, which owns
57,813 shares of Disney. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t overpaid, and he has
created value.&#8221; 
Pixar Purchase 
Disney acquired Pixar Animation for $8.06 billion in stock
in 2006, a deal announced three months after Iger assumed the
CEO&#8217;s job. The company completed the Marvel acquisition in
January 2010 and acquired the Internet casual game company
Playdom in August 2010 for $563 million in cash. 
Iger spoke after Disney posted third-quarter sales and
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN
sports network countered flat cable advertising sales. 
Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Disney said
yesterday in a statement. Profit excluding some items was 78
cents, beating the 73-cent average of 22 analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. 
Cable-network earnings rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year&#8217;s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of &#8220;Cars&#8221; and Marvel merchandise. 
Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts&#8217; projections of $10.5 billion. 
Disney fell 5 cents to $34.65 at 7:34 a.m. before the open
of the New York Stock Exchange, after gaining 5.1 percent to
$34.70 yesterday. The shares had declined 7.5 percent this year
before today.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is being probed about its
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the firm
said in a filing yesterday. 
The bank and some of its units are subject to a number of
probes and reviews, some of which also involve other firms,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Goldman Sachs officials in London couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. 
Regulators are probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s dealings with the
Libyan Investment Authority, the Wall Street Journal reported
today, citing people familiar with the investigation. 
The SEC opened an investigation in January into whether
banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms paid placement
agents to win access to the government-run funds, people
familiar with the matter said at the time. 
An agent working with a sovereign wealth fund may be
considered a government official, making interactions with that
person subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which
forbids U.S. companies from paying bribes to officials of
overseas governments.

A single trade for 100 shares of
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) more than 6 percent below yesterday&#8217;s closing

trading in the stock. 
The trade, later canceled, was executed at 10:33 a.m. New

Jerry Wood is relying on skills that
helped him recruit and develop top talent at Morgan Stanley (MS) in
his latest endeavor: coaching the men&#8217;s golf team at Manhattan
College. 
Wood, 57, has spent 30 years at Morgan Stanley, where he&#8217;s
a senior adviser after holding managerial roles including global
head of sales for fixed income and equities. 
While the duties of part-time college golf coach may not
seem to dovetail with that of an executive at the world&#8217;s top
merger adviser, Wood says he sees similarities. 
&#8220;You recruit kids from schools, you try to get the best
talent, you give them the tools to learn the business, then
basically mentor them, and hopefully they come through in a big
way,&#8221; Wood, of Huntington, New York, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;A lot of the kids I hired as MBA&#8217;s and analysts are
now managing directors running the business. It&#8217;s very rewarding
seeing somebody who you kind of picked.&#8221; 
Wood never has coached golf before but brings a competitive
background to his new job. 
He was captain of the golf team in 1975 as a senior at
Manhattan, which plays in the Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference, and has memberships at Huntington Country Club and
Garden City Golf Club on New York&#8217;s Long Island. He finished
ninth at last year&#8217;s Long Island Senior Open at Fresh Meadow
Country Club against professionals and amateurs. He has a 2.3
handicap index and said he&#8217;s played all but six or seven of Long
Island&#8217;s 140 golf courses. 
Golf Management 
&#8220;If you talk to anybody who played golf in college or high
school at the competitive level, they&#8217;ll tell you that as they
got older they learned a lot more about the game and their
swing,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I can bring to the table for
these kids: How do you manage yourself around the golf course as
opposed to just getting up and ripping it?&#8221; 
After graduating from Manhattan with an accounting degree,
Wood started his career at Ernst  Ernst, then spent one year at
Merrill Lynch before joining Morgan Stanley in 1978 as a
municipal bond trader. He got his MBA in 1980 after taking night
classes with his wife. 
Wood left in 2003, going to Credit Suisse Group AG and
working with John Mack, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s current chairman. Wood
returned to Morgan Stanley in 2005 and a year or so later
resumed playing competitive golf in senior tournaments. In his
current advisory position, Wood helps with Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
charity efforts and client relationships. 
Wood&#8217;s ability to manage -- in the boardroom and on a long
par-5 -- appealed to Manhattan Athletic Director Bob Byrnes. The
two were introduced within the last year by a mutual golf
partner, school chaplain Rev. George Hill, and Byrnes contacted
Wood when his previous coach retired. 
Bunker Lesson 
Wood invited Byrnes out for a round at Huntington and
offered an impromptu lesson when the athletic director was
struggling in a bunker. Wood accepted the coaching vacancy soon
after, his flexibility at Morgan Stanley allowing him the chance
to pursue the new role. Manhattan College, in New York City&#8217;s
Riverdale section, is about an hour&#8217;s drive from his home. He&#8217;s
donating his $11,000 salary back to the golf program. 
&#8220;A lot of this is weekend and some mid-week tournaments,
and some time with practice, so it&#8217;s a full-time job that&#8217;s part
time, so to speak,&#8221; Byrnes said. &#8220;But once you meet Jerry, you
see why he&#8217;s such a successful businessman because he quickly
gets to the subject and heart of the matter. He&#8217;s a terrific
player himself and is going to be a great teacher.&#8221; 
Perfect Score 
Wood, who is married with three children between the ages
of 23 and 27, got a perfect score on the National Collegiate
Athletic Association&#8217;s recruiting test for coaches and has
already arranged team travel for the season that begins Sept. 9
with the Central Connecticut State Blue Devil Fall Invitational.
He can&#8217;t meet or practice with his players until classes start
at the end of this month. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m excited because a lot of the kids on our team are
business students or engineering students and I think that not
only will he help them in golf, but really in their future
lives,&#8221; Byrnes said. &#8220;This is a unique hire for me, and I&#8217;m
not a rookie. This is my 24th year. It&#8217;s very energizing for me
that Jerry will be with us.&#8221; 
Swing Tips 
Steve D&#8217;Antonio, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global head of
securitized products, has seen Wood&#8217;s competitive drive, on and
off the course. D&#8217;Antonio, who said it&#8217;s a &#8220;rare but wonderful
moment&#8221; when he takes Wood&#8217;s money in a match, predicts his
colleague and golfing buddy will be as successful with college
players as he has been with clients. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s had leadership roles, he&#8217;s a very good communicator
and he gets along with a very wide range of people,&#8221; D&#8217;Antonio,
who&#8217;s known Wood since his first day at Morgan Stanley 25 years
ago, said by phone. &#8220;He had relationships with a very broad set
of people and clients.&#8221; 
Byrnes said Wood has a natural &#8220;knack for communicating
and that&#8217;s really what coaching is.&#8221; 
While Wood has a lot of experience to impart, D&#8217;Antonio
joked that it&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;ll be sharing too many swing tips
with his players when they step to the tee. 
&#8220;I can tell you one thing, his kids will have much better
looking swings than his,&#8221; said D&#8217;Antonio, 51. &#8220;He has an ugly
swing, it just works. He just repeats it. The kids on the team
will have a good time with that, but he gets it done. He&#8217;s in
the fairway all day long.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Charles LeCroy said the key to landing bond deals in Jefferson County,
Alabama, was finding out whom to pay off. In one example, that
meant a $2.6 million payment to Bill Blount, a local banker and
longtime friend of County Commissioner Larry Langford. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of money, but in the end it&#8217;s worth it on a
billion-dollar deal,&#8221; LeCroy told a colleague in 2003, according
to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
That&#8217;s because in the $2.9-trillion market for state and
local government debt, where 80 percent of all financings are
negotiated in private, conflicts of interest prevail. While
Langford and Blount are in jail, LeCroy is fighting an SEC
action. JPMorgan, which provided most of the toxic debt that
devastated Jefferson County, has suffered no loss of business as
the nation&#8217;s third-largest underwriter of municipal bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Just 21 months ago, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million SEC
settlement to end a case over secret payments to friends of
Jefferson County commissioners. The financings arranged by
JPMorgan, a package of floating-rate debt and derivatives,
exposed taxpayers to the 2008 credit crisis and dealt a blow
that may lead the county to approve the biggest U.S. municipal
bankruptcy as soon as today. 
&#8220;As an outsider looking in, it just certainly appears to me
that JPMorgan ravaged this county,&#8221; said Robert Brooks, a
finance professor at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and
the author of a textbook on derivatives. &#8220;They convinced
Jefferson County to pursue a strategy they never would have
followed to generate a lot of fees.&#8221; 
Deals Backfired 
Jefferson County&#8217;s financing shows how Wall Street peddled
complex bond-and-derivative deals that backfired on taxpayers,
from small Pennsylvania school districts to California&#8217;s state
government. Banks may have charged $20 billion in hidden fees on
the derivatives alone, Andrew Kalotay, a New York-based
financial consultant who specializes in such agreements, told an
SEC hearing in Jefferson County last month. The agreements
allowed lenders to earn fees that were rarely, if ever,
disclosed, while exposing municipalities to unexpected increases
in borrowing costs. 
Yet while JPMorgan&#8217;s deals denuded Jefferson County, the
company has emerged with its municipal-debt underwriting
business unscathed. During the past two years, public officials
from California to Massachusetts hired the New York-based bank
to arrange $64.7 billion of bond offerings, making it the third-
largest underwriter in the market for state and local
securities, according to Bloomberg data. 
&#8216;Very Aggressive&#8217; 
&#8220;The issuers need the bankers,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen,
managing director of Torrance, California-based Institutional
Risk Analytics, which assesses banks. &#8220;Morgan&#8217;s a big house and
they&#8217;re very aggressive and they&#8217;re out there looking for
business everywhere. So people tend to forget.&#8221; 
Last month, without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
JPMorgan agreed to pay $211 million in a separate settlement
with state and federal regulators over charges that its
municipal-derivatives unit participated in an industry-wide
scheme to fix prices and overcharge local governments on
investment contracts. The bank blamed former employees and said
it has increased oversight of its public finance business. 
In a motion to dismiss a lawsuit by Jefferson County,
JPMorgan said the county was inappropriately attempting to lay
blame for the debt crisis at the bank&#8217;s feet. 
&#8220;The simple fact is that the county took on too much debt
and vastly underestimated the cost of building out its sewer
system,&#8221; lawyers for JPMorgan argued. &#8220;These problems were
only exacerbated by the county&#8217;s poor management of its sewer
system and the current credit crisis.&#8221; 
Dodd-Frank Law 
JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras declined to comment for
this story and said Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who
joined JPMorgan after the Jefferson County deals were done,
wasn&#8217;t available for an interview. William B. Harrison Jr., the
bank&#8217;s CEO at the time it sold the contracts, didn&#8217;t return
phone calls seeking comment. 
The county&#8217;s collapse has loomed over the municipal bond
market for more than three years and inspired provisions in the
Dodd-Frank law seeking to protect localities from complex
financial trades involving derivatives. Officials are asking
JPMorgan and other creditors to forgive about $1 billion of the
bonds or may decide as soon as today to file for bankruptcy
protection to escape the debts. 
Money-Saving Plan 
In Jefferson County, JPMorgan pitched a money-saving plan
that converted almost all the county&#8217;s $3 billion of sewer-
system debt into floating-rate securities coupled with
derivatives. The deals comprised the largest transactions in
municipal swaps and auction-rate bonds, a form of floating-rate
borrowing, in the bank&#8217;s history, according to the SEC. 
Like homeowners who turned to exotic mortgages, officials
refinanced 93 percent of the sewer bonds into securities with
adjustable interest rates. They bought interest-rate swaps, in
which two parties make periodic payments based on an underlying
measure of borrowing costs. The contracts were supposed to
offset the floating rates the county paid and give it a fixed
rate that was lower than on traditional bonds. 
The county paid JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos, Bank of America
Corp. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. $120 million in fees for
swap trades. Those fees were as much as six times the prevailing
rate, according to a report by former county financial adviser
Porter White  Co. of Birmingham, Alabama. 
The money-saving strategy backfired. JPMorgan&#8217;s financings
unraveled in early 2008 as the subprime mortgage-market meltdown
sent ripples through Wall Street, undermining the credit ratings
of the companies that insured Jefferson County&#8217;s bonds. 
Interest Costs Soared 
The county&#8217;s interest costs soared as investors dumped the
bonds. After banks demanded early payoffs, the county defaulted.
The swaps exposed the county to hundreds of millions in fees to
refinance. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Dimon has moved to put the municipal crisis
behind him. 
In 2008, the bank said it got out of the business of
selling interest-rate swaps to state and local governments. In
November 2009, it settled with the SEC over allegations that
LeCroy and former JPMorgan colleague Douglas MacFaddin funneled
$8 million of secret payments to bankers, including Blount, who
had ties to Jefferson County politicians. 
&#8220;It looks like they&#8217;ve done the right things to limit the
reputational damage,&#8221; said Matt Fabian, who tracks the state
and local government securities industry for Municipal Market
Advisors Inc. in Concord, Massachusetts. 
In the Jefferson County case, much of the blame for the
collapse has been cast on corrupt politicians. 
&#8216;Hasn&#8217;t Hurt&#8217; 
&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t hurt them a bit because the whole thing has
been sold that they were dealing with corrupt officials,&#8221; said
Christopher Taylor, the executive director of the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board from 1978 until 2007. &#8220;But the
truth of the matter is they were in bed with the issuer.&#8221; 
Larry Langford, the former commissioner in charge of
finance, was found guilty on U.S. criminal charges of accepting
bribes from Blount, who pleaded guilty in the case. 
LeCroy and MacFaddin, the former head of municipal
derivatives for the bank, are fighting SEC civil claims that
they failed to disclose payments to Blount and others. JPMorgan
fired LeCroy in 2004 and terminated MacFaddin in 2008. No one
from JPMorgan is accused of criminal wrongdoing. 
MacFaddin and LeCroy have argued that the SEC lacks
authority to pursue them under federal anti-fraud statutes
because the interest-rate swaps aren&#8217;t securities. 
Richard Lawler, MacFaddin&#8217;s attorney, declined to comment.
LeCroy&#8217;s lawyer, Lisa Mathewson, also declined to comment. 
21 People 
In Jefferson County, 21 people, including four county
commissioners, were convicted or pleaded guilty to charges
related to the sewer construction or financing. 
Former County commissioner Langford, 63, a longtime friend
of Blount&#8217;s who was responsible for finance, was convicted of
taking $242,000 in bribes in exchange for steering business to
Blount. Langford lost an appeal of his convictions, according to
a notice posted Aug. 5 by the federal appeals court in Atlanta. 
According to the SEC, LeCroy also paid fees to two other
local firms to win the support of another former commissioner. 
LeCroy joked about the tactics with a fellow JPMorgan
banker in 2003. &#8220;We have to pick the partners who are going to
get free money from us this time,&#8221; he said, according to the
SEC complaint. 
Deals Raised Questions 
Bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc., which backed about $1
billion of the bonds, said in a lawsuit that JPMorgan knew that
the county wouldn&#8217;t have enough revenue to pay its debts in a
few years but kept a report documenting that secret. 
A least one banker at JPMorgan, Charles Giffin, raised
internal questions about the risk. 
&#8220;Do these guys know the risks they are taking (in large
doses)?&#8221; Giffin wrote in a May 12, 2003, e-mail to a colleague,
when asked to prepare materials explaining why the county should
buy more derivatives, according to SEC records. &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t we
be pitching diversification arguments?&#8221;

Nathan Myhrvold -- the former chief
strategist and chief technology officer at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) --
opens a bottle of wine and pours it into a kitchen blender. 
&#8220;Decanting is about doing two things,&#8221; Myhrvold, 52, says
before flipping on the power switch. &#8220;It&#8217;s about mixing oxygen
in with the wine and about taking dissolved gasses out of the
wine. So, if a little bit of decanting works, why not a lot?&#8221; 
We&#8217;re in an industrial unit in suburban Seattle, the home
of Myhrvold&#8217;s company, Intellectual Ventures. He&#8217;s giving a
PowerPoint presentation before a 30-course dinner made up of
dishes from &#8220;Modernist Cuisine, The Art and Science of
Cooking,&#8221; the six-volume, 2,438-page book he&#8217;s produced. 
(Myhrvold is also a columnist for Bloomberg View.) 
To say the dishes are unusual would be an understatement.
The first consists of watermelon chips with spicy pickles. Thin
slices of fruit and pickle are mixed with modified starch
slurry, compressed in vacuum bags and then deep fried. 
&#8220;I figured that if I could make chips out of watermelon, I
could do it for anything,&#8221; Myhrvold explains as we sip hyper-
decanted wine. (I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed it was from a blender.) 
Next up? Corn and green-pea butter spread on brioche and
walnut-bread toasts. Run through a centrifuge, the corn and peas
yield three distinct layers: juice, starch and a small quantity
of a substance that has 20 times the flavor intensity of the raw
ingredient and the texture of soft butter, Myhrvold says. 
MasterChef Contestant 
Fifteen people from around the world are attending the
dinner. My table includes a journalist from Germany, an academic
from New York, a food technologist who works for Mars Inc. and
Alvin Schultz, a Houston-based contestant from chef Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s Fox TV show, MasterChef. Myhrvold divides his time
between providing a commentary and helping prepare the food. 
We&#8217;re sitting in the laboratory with chefs working along
one side. Heading the kitchen is Maxime Bilet, co-author of
&#8220;Modernist Cuisine.&#8221; He graduated with highest honors from the
Institute of Culinary Education in New York and also worked at
the Fat Duck, outside London. 
The courses keep coming: Puffed Chicken Skin, Peking
Flavors involves the skin being cooked sous vide -- in an
airtight bag in a water bath -- then puffed in oil with hoisin
sauce, scallion oil emulsion, cucumber and shaved scallions.
Liquid Caprese is a cold, emulsified soup of olive oil and
tomato water. The equipment required? A rotor-stator
homogenizer, a pressure cooker and a centrifuge. 
Baked Potato Soup consists of wafer-thin potato ravioli
filled with shallots melted in bacon fat, and dressed with an
intense broth of potato juice infused with roasted potato skins. 
Kansas Ribs 
The recipe for the Hot-Smoked Spare Ribs, Barbecue Sauces
from Kansas City, South Carolina, requires an Enviro-Pak cold
smoker, an ultrasonic bath, centrifuge, liquid nitrogen, vacuum
sealer and a water bath. The ribs are cooked sous vide for 48
hours, then dry rubbed, smoked and vacuum sealed. The chefs then
warm them in a bath and &#8220;cryofry&#8221; by dipping them in liquid
nitrogen and then deep-frying them. This process creates an
intense crust without overcooking the meat below. 
You may be asking by this stage: How does the food taste?
The answer is great. The flavors are intense, the textures
distinct, the aromas enticing. Many courses evoke memories of
childhood, when a simple strawberry may be a mouthful of heaven
and chocolate more fun than playing in the park. 
Yet somewhere in multicourse modernist meals -- and 48
dishes at El Bulli was my limit -- I tend to tire of perfection.
I want a piece of meat that hasn&#8217;t been cooked for days, I don&#8217;t

Lemongrass Egg 
Myhrvold is such an entertaining host, sharing funny
stories and being completely un-precious about his food, that an
evening at his laboratory is a delight. Even the food has wit.
The waitresses said that one dish, Raw Quail Egg, came from
birds kept on the roof of the building. The yolk turned out to
be passion fruit, the white a gel of lemongrass. 
Myhrvold was a postdoctoral fellow in the department of
applied mathematics and theoretical physics at Cambridge
University in the U.K. and worked with Professor Stephen Hawking
on research in cosmology, quantum field theory in curved space
time and quantum theories of gravitation. He doesn&#8217;t keep all

A Pfizer Inc. (PFE) patent for the
impotence pill Viagra is valid, a U.S. judge ruled, blocking
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) from marketing a generic
version until 2019. 
The decision, protecting Pfizer&#8217;s $1 billion a year in U.S.
Viagra sales for most of the next decade, was handed down Aug.
12 after a two-week non-jury trial that began June 15, according
to court papers. 
&#8220;The pharmaceutical industry will take note&#8221; of the
ruling, Navid Malik, a London-based analyst with Matrix
Corporate Capital LLP, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The
generic companies are still going to be aggressive, but the
pharmaceutical companies aren&#8217;t going to be easy touches,
they&#8217;re fighting back.&#8221; 
U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in Norfolk,
Virginia, ruled against Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, which
claimed the patent wasn&#8217;t valid and couldn&#8217;t be enforced. 
&#8220;Teva has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that
the patent is invalid,&#8221; Smith said in a 110-page opinion.
&#8220;There is utterly no evidence&#8221; to support Teva&#8217;s claim that
that Pfizer intentionally withheld documents from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Smith wrote. 
Denise Bradley, a Teva spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the ruling. 
Viagra sales increased 1 percent in the second quarter from
a year earlier to $495 million, Pfizer said this month. New
York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, posted net
income of $8.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, last year on sales of
$67.8 billion. 
&#8216;Innovative Core&#8217; 
&#8220;Protecting the intellectual property rights of our
innovative core is critical,&#8221; Amy Schulman, Pfizer&#8217;s general
counsel, said in a statement. &#8220;Friday&#8217;s court decision
acknowledges Teva&#8217;s clear violation of our patent rights.&#8221; 
Teva fell 3 percent to 138.30 shekels in Tel Aviv. The
company&#8217;s American depositary receipts, each representing one
ordinary share, rose 79 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.49 at 2:55
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 
Pfizer gained 41 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $18.27 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The ruling is worth about 3 cents to Pfizer&#8217;s 2012 per-
share earnings and 6 cents to the company&#8217;s annual per-share
earnings through 2019, Christopher Schott, a New York-based
analyst for JPMorgan Chase  Co., said in a note to clients
today. Teva will probably appeal, he wrote. 
The ruling was &#8220;a surprise,&#8221; Bloomberg Industries analyst
Asthika Goonewardene said in an interview. 
&#8220;The patent was a method-of-use patent, and usually these
don&#8217;t hold up that well in court for small molecular drugs,&#8221;
Goonewardene said. &#8220;The court&#8217;s decision to uphold this patent
means other filers wanting to enter in 2012 are not likely to do
so then.&#8221; 
The case is Pfizer v. Teva, 10-cv-128, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk).

(Corrects date of memo in second paragraph.) 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Glenn Earle, chief operating officer of its European, Middle East and
African unit, will retire after almost 25 years with the firm. 
Earle, 53, will be replaced by Robin Vince, global head of
operations, the bank said in a memorandum to employees last
month. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London confirmed the
contents of the document today. 
Earle&#8217;s &#8220;judgment regarding reputational and suitability
matters was invaluable in meeting the needs of our clients and
protecting the firm&#8217;s global franchise,&#8221; New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in the memo. 
The bank was last year accused by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and a Senate subcommittee of misleading
customers in a 2007 mortgage-linked investment. Goldman Sachs
paid $550 million in July 2010 to settle the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit,
without admitting or denying guilt, and said it made a mistake
in the marketing materials. 
Earle, who received a master&#8217;s in business administration
from Harvard Business School, joined the firm in 1987 and became
a partner in 1996. Between 1996 and 1999 he helped the firm
develop its operations in central and eastern Europe, the Middle
East and Africa. He was co-head of the European advisory group
within the investment banking unit from 1999 to 2004 before
being named chief operating officer for the region in 2006. 
In the first half of 2011, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s operations in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, known as EMEA, contributed
$4.63 billion of revenue, 24 percent of the total, down from 28
percent in the same period a year earlier, according to the
firm&#8217;s quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The region contributed $1.57 billion toward pretax
profit in the first half, 27 percent of the total. 
Vince, who will remain global operations head, will be
based in London. He became a managing director in 2002 and a
partner in 2006. Financial News reported Earle&#8217;s retirement
earlier today.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is selling $1.85
billion of bonds, including its first 30-year debt in almost a
decade, as the Federal Reserve pledges record-low interest rates
through mid-2013. 
The world&#8217;s largest theme-park company plans to sell $750
million each of five- and 10-year notes and $350 million of 30-
year bonds, said a person with knowledge of the transaction.
Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, said the
person, who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. 
Disney is selling bonds for the second time in 2011 even as
Standard  Poor&#8217;s said the company already has &#8220;exceptional
liquidity&#8221; that could cover its uses by more than two times
during the next two to three years. Investors are seeking
longer-term bonds for relatively higher yields after the Fed&#8217;s
pledge last week while companies are taking advantage of about
the lowest borrowing costs on record. 
Yields on corporate debt maturing in 15 years or more fell
to 5.42 percent yesterday, compared with the 1.72 percent on
company debentures due in one to three years, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data. Overall investment-grade
bond yields tumbled to a record low of 3.45 percent on Aug. 4
before rising to 3.62 percent yesterday, the index data show. 
Burbank, California-based Disney&#8217;s five-year notes may pay
60 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the 10-
year notes may pay a 72 basis-point spread, and the 30-year
bonds may pay an 87.5 basis point spread, said the person with
knowledge of the transaction. 
2002 Offering 
Disney last sold 30-year debt in 2002, Bloomberg data show.
The company issued $500 million of 10-year notes in May, which
was its first return to the bond market in more than two years,
the data show. 
The theme park operator sold $500 million of 7 percent, 30-
year debt in 2002 that yielded 170 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show. The notes traded on
Aug. 8 at 133.8 cents on the dollar with a spread of 79.6 basis
points and a yield of 4.47 percent, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. 
Disney is rated A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the data show. 
The company is joined by Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the
railroad purchased by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., in selling 30-
year bonds today, said the person with knowledge of that
transaction.

Exxon Mobil Corp. sued the U.S.
Interior Department, asking a judge to set aside the agency&#8217;s
decision to cancel offshore leases that may yield &#8220;billions of
barrels of oil.&#8221; 
The department overstepped its authority in a ruling on
Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia Unit, Exxon Mobil
said in a complaint filed Aug. 12 in federal court in Lake
Charles, Louisiana. Statoil ASA (STL), a partner of Exxon Mobil&#8217;s in
the Julia fields, filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on
Aug. 15. 
&#8220;The Interior decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse
of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law,&#8221; and &#8220;deprives
Exxon Mobil of property without due process of law,&#8221; the
Irving, Texas-based company said in its complaint. 
Exxon Mobil, the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded oil
company, said federal regulations allow oil producers to suspend
production in their fields, partly &#8220;to facilitate proper
development of a lease.&#8221; Because of drilling complexity, Exxon
Mobil said, it asked for a suspension for Julia in 2008. 
The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating
that the company &#8220;had not demonstrated a commitment to
production,&#8221; according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals
followed. 
The Interior Department is reviewing the Exxon Mobil
complaint, Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for the department&#8217;s
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement,
said in an e-mailed statement. 
&#8216;Safe Development&#8217; 
&#8220;Our priority remains the safe development of the nation&#8217;s
offshore energy resources, which is why we continue to approve
extensions that meet regulatory standards,&#8221; Schwartz said. The
government must respond to the Exxon suit within 60 days of
receiving the Aug. 15 summons, according to a court filing. 
The lawsuits were reported earlier by the Wall Street
Journal. 
Analysts Fadel Gheit at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York and
Brian Youngberg at Edward Jones in St. Louis said they
ultimately expect Exxon Mobil to reach an agreement with the
government to keep the leases. Both said they hadn&#8217;t heard of
the Julia discovery before the lawsuit. 
&#8220;Exxon&#8217;s not just going to walk away from it,&#8221; said
Gheit, who rates the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221; and owns an
undisclosed number of them. 
Shares Drop 
Exxon Mobil fell $3.24, or 4.4 percent, to $70.92 at 2:49
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading as crude oil
slumped the most in a week after Morgan Stanley and Deutsche
Bank AG cut their forecasts for global economic expansion.
Statoil&#8217;s American depositary receipts, each representing one
ordinary share, declined $1.68, or 7 percent, to $22.40. 
Wyn Hornbuckle, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman,
declined to comment on the dispute. Jonathan A. Hunter, lead
attorney on the suit for Exxon, couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached
for comment. 
President Barack Obama stopped deep-water oil and natural-
gas drilling early last year after a BP Plc (BP/) well blew out off
the Louisiana coast, claiming 11 lives and causing the largest
U.S. oil spill. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the ban in
October. 
Exxon alleges that the Interior Department terminated the
Julia leases to gain new leases and make more money. 
&#8220;Cancellation of the original Julia leases would give
Interior the opportunity to collect millions of dollars in
bonuses and royalties that it otherwise would not be entitled to
collect,&#8221; Exxon said in court papers. 
If the agency&#8217;s decision stands, Exxon Mobil and Statoil
will &#8220;lose the enormous value of those leases and their
hundreds of millions of dollars in investments,&#8221; Statoil said
in its complaint. 
Ola Morten Aanestad, a spokesman for Stavanger, Norway-
based Statoil, had no immediate comment on the complaints. 
The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) v. Kenneth Salazar, 11CV1474,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Louisiana (Lake
Charles).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will start offering banking
services to South Africa&#8217;s largest companies as it seeks to tap
faster growth outside the U.S. and Europe. 
The bank will offer corporate clients lending as well as
treasury and foreign exchange services, Eric von Glehn, managing
director of JPMorgan in Johannesburg, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. The lender, which has been in South Africa
since 1998, already offers clients services such as advice on
mergers and acquisitions and on debt and stock offerings. It
doesn&#8217;t plan to compete with South African banks, he added. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re broadening our products and services,&#8221; von Glehn
said. &#8220;We have lots of big multinationals doing business all
over Africa and in South Africa and we&#8217;re in Africa so it makes
enormous sense to be their partners.&#8221; 
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has made expanding
overseas a priority as growth in the U.S. and Europe stalls.
South Africa&#8217;s economy is forecast to grow 3.7 percent this
year, according to the central bank. JPMorgan, the top-ranked
adviser on mergers globally, is also trying to add clients as
its share of South Africa&#8217;s market for stock offerings shrinks. 
The bank, the top-ranked adviser on stock offerings in
South Africa between 2001 and 2004, fell every year to ninth
position last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This year it doesn&#8217;t feature at all in the equity rankings. In
mergers, JPMorgan worked with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) on its
acquisition of a 16.5 billion-rand ($2.32 billion) stake in
South African retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM), a deal which
started last year and was approved in May. 
Gaining Market Share 
Competitors such as BNP Paribas (BNP) SA and Citigroup Inc. (C) are
gaining market share and are the two top-ranked stock
underwriters in Africa&#8217;s largest economy this year.
Johannesburg-based Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) has worked with parent
Barclays Plc (BARC) to net 37 debt underwriting assignments in 2011. 
Transactions may come from working more closely with South
African companies, Von Glehn said. Banks, retailers and mining
companies are all expanding across the continent with South
Africa home to some of the world&#8217;s biggest metals producers
including Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Gold Fields Ltd. 
&#8220;The mining sector is certainly an area we&#8217;re going to be
focusing on,&#8221; he said. We&#8217;ll be looking at the blue chips, the
top 40.&#8217;&#8217; 
Companies have held nine share sales for a combined total
of $1.4 billion in South Africa this year, according to
Bloomberg data. That compares with 21 offerings valued at $4.5
billion in total last year. In the year to date South African
companies have also proposed 156 takeovers valued at 81.8
billion rand, compared with 195 mergers in the first three
quarters of 2010 which were valued at almost 130 billion rand. 
&#8220;A lot of deals are taking longer to close than we had
hoped but it probably means next year will be exciting,&#8221; Von
Glehn said. &#8220;The difficulty closing is a function of markets
being wobbly, concerns about economic growth and a lack of
confidence.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for
global growth this year, citing an &#8220;insufficient&#8221; policy
response to Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis, weakened confidence
and the prospect of fiscal tightening. 
The bank estimates expansion of 3.9 percent, down from a
previous forecast of 4.2 percent, according to an e-mailed
report dated today. Morgan Stanley cut its China growth forecast
for next year and Deutsche Bank AG reduced its estimates for the
nation for 2011 and 2012. 
The threat to the global economy from the debt burdens of
developed nations from the U.S. to Europe has roiled world
markets this month and wiped trillions of dollars off the value
of equities. At the same time, slowing expansions in countries
including Germany, the key driver of European growth, are
hurting confidence. 
The U.S. and Europe are &#8220;dangerously close to
recession,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analysts including Chetan Ahya said
in the note. &#8220;Recent policy errors, especially Europe&#8217;s slow
and insufficient response to the sovereign crisis and the drama
around lifting the U.S. debt ceiling, have weighed down on
financial markets and eroded business and consumer confidence.&#8221; 
The MSCI All-Country World Index slid 0.7 percent to 305.64
as of 4:24 p.m. in Hong Kong, set for the steepest drop since
Aug. 10. 
&#8216;Stagnating&#8217; Economies 
In the euro area, &#8220;broadly stagnating&#8221; growth later this
year and in early 2012 will mean that &#8220;it won&#8217;t take much to
tip the balance towards recession, especially as a final
resolution of the debt crisis -- in the form of fiscal transfers
or common bond issuance -- is likely to be very slow in
coming,&#8221; the Morgan Stanley economists wrote. 
The bank cut an estimate for China&#8217;s growth next year to
8.7 percent from 9 percent. Deutsche Bank trimmed a prediction
for this year to 8.9 percent from 9.1 percent, and a forecast
for 2012 to 8.3 percent from 8.6 percent, in a report dated
yesterday. 
&#8220;In the near term, the single most important shock to the
Chinese economy will be the likely slowdown -- or even recession
-- of the EU and U.S. economies,&#8221; Deutsche Bank economist Ma
Jun said in a note. 
Hong Kong will have a &#8220;shallow recession&#8221; with the
economy contracting in the third quarter from the previous three
months after already shrinking in the second quarter, Morgan
Stanley said in another e-mailed note today. 
&#8220;Western demand will shrink as they need to tighten their
fiscal policies,&#8221; Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said in
Hong Kong yesterday. 
Merkel, Sarkozy 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy this week ruled out steps such as the issuance
of euro bonds or expanding a bailout fund to counter the
European debt crisis. Pacific Investment Management Co., the
world&#8217;s biggest bond fund manager, said that European
politicians should let Greece, Ireland and Portugal default
while taking steps to ensure Italy and Spain won&#8217;t. 
Morgan Stanley cut its estimate for growth in the Group of
10 nations to 1.5 percent this year and next, down from previous
forecasts of 1.9 percent in 2011 and 2.4 percent in 2012,
today&#8217;s report showed. 
&#8220;A negative feedback loop between weak growth and soggy
asset markets now appears to be in the making in Europe and the
U.S.,&#8221; the analysts said. &#8220;This should be aggravated by the
prospect of fiscal tightening in the U.S. and Europe.&#8221; 
France&#8217;s growth stalled in the second quarter, while the
German economy gained 0.1 percent from the first quarter. In the
U.S., the Federal Reserve has pledged to keep interest rates at
a record low through mid-2013, indicating that the world&#8217;s
biggest economy will continue to need support.

Morgan Stanley (MS), ranked by Global
Custodian magazine as the second-largest prime broker worldwide,
named Mehdee Reza as Asia head of the business that provides
services to hedge funds. 
Reza, currently Hong Kong-based head of Asian generalist
cash sales at the New York-based bank, will take up the new job
in late September, Morgan Stanley confirmed in an e-mailed
response to a Bloomberg News query. 
Global investors added $2.6 billion to hedge funds focused
on Asia, pushing regional industry assets to $89.5 billion at
the end of the second quarter, a post-2007 high, according to
Chicago-based data provider Hedge Fund Research Inc. 
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. each had 179
hedge fund mandates in Asia with the former&#8217;s estimated $23.4
billion of client assets closing gap with Goldman Sachs&#8217; $23.7
billion, said an AsiaHedge survey published in May. 
In his new role, Reza will take charge of prime brokerage
sales, capital introduction and client services in the region
which includes Japan and Australia, the e-mail said. Prime
brokers&#8217; capital introduction teams link hedge funds with
potential investors. 
Reza will report to Alex Ehrlich, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global
head of prime brokerage in New York, and to Ed Sisterson,
regional head of equity financing products in Hong Kong, the e-
mail said. 
Global Franchise 
Reza joined Morgan Stanley&#8217;s London office as a generalist
sale person in 2005 after a stint as a partner of an
unidentified London-based hedge fund, according to the e-mail.
He had spent eight years with Credit Suisse Group AG in Hong
Kong before that, heading the regional banks research team, it
added. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Asian prime brokerage business is &#8220;a
critical part of our growing global franchise,&#8221; Ehrlich said in
the e-mail. &#8220;Mehdee&#8217;s wealth of experience in Asia and
specifically with Asian hedge funds will help ensure we continue
to offer the very best services to our global and regional
client base.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley commanded nearly 12 percent of the global
prime brokerage market by assets, second to Goldman Sachs&#8217; 13
percent, with Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG trailing by
about 1 percentage point, according to the survey by Global
Custodian released in June.

The European Central Bank may cut
interest rates next year amid a &#8220;dire&#8221; economic outlook,
Morgan Stanley economists said after reducing their euro-area
growth forecasts. 
&#8220;Slower growth, falling capacity utilization and rising
unemployment will likely put a dampener on underlying inflation
in the euro area,&#8221; economists including Elga Bartsch wrote in a
research note to clients. A &#8220;benign inflation outlook would
allow the ECB to reverse the course of its monetary action and
start to cut interest rates in early 2012 when inflation falls
meaningfully below 2 percent.&#8221; 
At the same time, &#8220;the possibility of the ECB raising
rates once more in October cannot be completely dismissed yet,&#8221;
they said. President Jean-Claude Trichet has indicated the bank
is still in tightening mode and stressed that interest rates can
change independently from liquidity measures, the economists
wrote. 
Morgan Stanley predicted the ECB will lower its benchmark
rate -- currently at 1.5 percent -- to 1 percent by the end of
2012. The economists cut their euro-area growth forecasts to 1.7
percent for this year and 0.5 percent for next year from 2
percent and 1.2 percent respectively. 
&#8220;While not our base case at this stage, we see a material
risk of outright recession,&#8221; they said.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has developed a computer chip inspired by the human brain
that may predict tsunamis and highlight risks in financial markets. 
The technology, called cognitive computing, is programmed
to recognize patterns, make predictions and learn from mistakes,
human-like capabilities not possible using today&#8217;s best
computers. It&#8217;s a sharp departure from traditional chip design
concepts, IBM said in a statement today. 
Systems built with the new chip can synthesize events
currently occurring and make decisions in real time, the Armonk,
New York-based company said. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Defense, IBM has received $21 million more in funding after
today&#8217;s developments to bring the technology to applications.
The advancement marks the end of a conceptual phase and
initiates the first step to find out how to bring the chips to
scale for production, said Kelly Sims, an IBM spokeswoman. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re inventing a new system, changing the game,&#8221;
Dharmendra Modha, the project&#8217;s leader, said in an interview.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a new generation of computers, bypassing the hurdles
faced by today&#8217;s computers.&#8221; 
While current computers handle commands individually on a
linear if/then basis, Modha said machines equipped with the new
chips will &#8220;rewire themselves on the fly.&#8221; Without any set
programming, the devices reach decisions through integrated
memory, computation and communication cores that resemble
synapses, neurons and axons, respectively, in the brain&#8217;s
nervous system. The sensor network is three times larger than
any ever created, he said. 
Reacting to Surroundings 
Cognitive computers may react to taste, touch, smells and
sound, Modha said, while consuming less power and volume than
today&#8217;s technology. 
The core of the device has 3.8 million transistors in a 4.2
millimeters square of silicon, a tiny scale for what the chip
accomplishes, said Richard Doherty, research director at
Seaford, New York-based Envisioneering Group, a technology
assessment firm. 
&#8220;Research like this has been going on for decades, but
this marks the beginning of commerce, industry and profits for
cognitive computing,&#8221; Doherty said in an interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re
going to be more like humans and primates than ever before.&#8221; 
Current chips using 2 billion transistors couldn&#8217;t perform
similar tasks, he said, and they&#8217;d have to be 10 times as large. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re giving birth to a new type of architecture-enabling
applications to ask computers to help us with today,&#8221; Modha
said. 
Potential Uses 
Some of that help may come, for example, in the form of
predicting tsunamis or creating financial opportunities, he
said. By constantly recording and reporting temperature,
pressure, wave height and ocean tides, such a system could issue
a warning for giant waves based on its decision making. 
&#8220;In a financial sense, it would be looking not for micro
opportunities, but a macro pattern that spots anomalies, risks,
and creates new possibilities,&#8221; he said. 
The technology also might be used in a doctor&#8217;s glove,
providing real-time patient data during surgery based on the
body&#8217;s texture, smell and temperature. 
&#8220;The impact of this is inevitable, but the timing is
unpredictable,&#8221; Modha said. &#8220;As a civilization we&#8217;re computing
with half a brain, and now we&#8217;re bringing forth that other half
to complement it.&#8221;

A one-atom-thick layer of carbon may
one day help International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and the U.S.
military build more precise radar and computers that operate at
near the speed of light. 
Physicists Konstantin Novoselov, 36, and Andre Geim, 52, at
the University of Manchester in the U.K., have found a way to
manipulate how graphene, the thinnest and toughest material ever
produced, conducts electricity, a breakthrough that opens the
door to its use in digital electronics. 
Because graphene conducts electricity 30 times faster than
silicon -- approaching the speed of light, according to the
researchers -- the finding may be used by companies such as IBM
to speed up computers. The material was first isolated by the
two Russian-born scientists in 2004, and they were awarded a
Nobel Prize last year. The latest research was published last
week in the journal Science. 
&#8220;They&#8217;ve observed a phenomenon that was unattainable
previously,&#8221; said Yu-Ming Lin, an IBM researcher who developed
the first integrated circuit from wafer-size graphene in June.
The Armonk, New York-based company, which funded the study along
with Samsung Electronics Co. and the U.S. Air Force and Navy,
will now consider how to use graphene in semiconductors and
computers, he said. 
Until recently, use of graphene was limited to development
of more-efficient batteries and foldable touch screens, items
that didn&#8217;t require scientists to be able to stop and start the
movement of electrons in the material. Novoselov and Geim were
able to control the current by suspending two layers of graphene
in a vacuum, reordering the electronic structure. 
&#8216;New-Type Transistors&#8217; 
The finding may lead to &#8220;completely new types of
transistors,&#8221; Novoselov said in a telephone interview. &#8220;You
can probably start using it for computer chips, but we believe
we have something different, bigger here.&#8221; 
The finding is &#8220;bringing people&#8217;s attention back to
graphene,&#8221; and spurring a new look at whether the material &#8220;is
usable in digital widgets,&#8221; IBM&#8217;s Lin said. 
The international market for graphene-based products may
reach $675 million by 2020, Wellesley, Massachusetts-based BCC
Research LLC estimated in February, when the material&#8217;s use as a
semiconductor was considered impossible. If the new research
leads to semiconductor devices, graphene would be entering what
the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association said was
a $298.3 billion industry worldwide in 2010. 
&#8220;Within the next couple years you will hear a lot about
transistors based on bilayer graphene,&#8221; Geim said in an e-mail.
&#8220;It will be a very long road to graphene integrated circuits.&#8221; 
Mobile Phones, Radar 
IBM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, is researching the material&#8217;s
ability to create more-efficient mobile phones, clearer wireless
signals, and better radar, Lin said. The material&#8217;s magnetic
traits may also enable IBM to utilize high frequency waves for
medical devices that would spot diseases early on, Lin said. 
Novoselov and Geim are part of a $1.4 billion effort put
together by nine European organizations, including the
University of Cambridge and Finland-based Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), to research
graphene. Geim and Novoselov discovered graphene by extracting
the material from a piece of graphite such as is found in
ordinary pencils, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said
last year when announcing the scientists won the Nobel in
Physics. 
Nokia Research 
Nokia, the world&#8217;s largest maker of mobile phones by
volume, is investigating the material&#8217;s potential use in cell
phones, touch screens, and printed electronics. Graphene as a
cheap replacement for current touch screen technology is right
around the corner, said Jani Kivioja, a research leader at Nokia
whose team develops graphene&#8217;s electronic sensing ability.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and other employees hired
attorneys this year when the U.S. began a probe of matters
raised by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
Attorney General Eric H. Holder said on May 3 that the
Justice Department was reviewing an April report on the
financial crisis by the Permanent Subcommittee, led by Carl M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, and Thomas A. Coburn, Republican of
Oklahoma. The report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients
about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Levin
alleged that Blankfein misled Congress. 
&#8220;As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department&#8217;s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset,&#8221; the
company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. 
Goldman Sachs fell 4.7 percent in New York trading on
concern that Blankfein&#8217;s hiring of a criminal defense attorney
could mean the firm will face more legal woes. He has been
represented by Reid H. Weingarten, a partner at Steptoe 
Johnson LLP in Washington, since the Justice Department inquiry
began, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Weingarten is a friend of Holder&#8217;s, with whom he helped
found the nonprofit See Forever Foundation, according to
Weingarten&#8217;s biography on Steptoe  Johnson&#8217;s website. 
Wall Street&#8217;s Role 
Blankfein, 56, hasn&#8217;t been charged with wrongdoing amid
federal probes of Wall Street&#8217;s role in the housing boom and
credit crisis. Goldman Sachs is paying Blankfein&#8217;s legal costs,
according to the bank. 
Goldman Sachs has said the testimony its employees gave to
the Permanent Subcommittee &#8220;was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee&#8217;s own report.&#8221; 
Reuters reported yesterday that Blankfein had hired
Weingarten, citing an unidentified government source. The report
contributed to the decline in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock, which
closed at $106.51 on the New York Stock Exchange and has dropped
37 percent this year. 
&#8220;The fact that the attorney was hired months ago rather
than recently moderates the impact and implications of the
story,&#8221; William Tanona, an analyst at UBS AG who has a &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating on the stock, wrote in a note yesterday. Still &#8220;these
continued distractions increase the probability of a management
reshuffle over the next few years, which will undoubtedly cause
some investor angst.&#8221; 
Built a Reputation 
Weingarten won the acquittal in May of Lauren Stevens, a
former GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) attorney accused of impeding a U.S.
Food and Drug Administration investigation. He also represented
Elizabeth Monrad, the former chief financial officer at General
Reinsurance Corp. who was convicted in an accounting fraud
scandal. She won a retrial earlier this month. 
Weingarten previously represented former WorldCom CEO
Bernard Ebbers, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison after he
was convicted of an $11 billion fraud. He defended former Enron
Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey, who was sentenced to 5
1/2 years in prison. 
Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment. Weingarten didn&#8217;t respond to e-mail and phone
messages requesting comment. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
subpoenaed earlier this year by the Manhattan District
Attorney&#8217;s office for information related to the Permanent
Subcommittee&#8217;s report, a person familiar with the matter said in
early June.

As markets convulsed in September
2008, Morgan Stanley (MS) Treasurer David Wong briefed the Federal
Reserve on a &#8220;dark&#8221; scenario in which the U.S. firm would need
at least $10 billion of emergency loans from the central bank. 
It got 10 times darker by month&#8217;s end. Morgan Stanley
borrowed $107.3 billion, the most of any bank, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News using information released in
response to Freedom of Information Act requests, related court
orders and an act of Congress. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s borrowing -- more than twice the amount
all banks got from the Fed in the market squeeze that followed
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- peaked after hedge funds
pulled $128.1 billion from the firm in two weeks, documents
released by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission show. 
The first comprehensive examination of the Fed&#8217;s emergency
lending reveals how close the New York-based bank came to
running out of cash because of a run on its prime brokerage, the
unit that finances hedge funds&#8217; trades and holds their cash and
securities. The Fed loans also show the degree to which Morgan
Stanley and other banks depended on such brokerage accounts for
funding, even though clients could close them on short notice. 
&#8220;These were like hot-money deposits that could flee in an
instant,&#8221; said Tanya Azarchs, a former Standard  Poor&#8217;s
analyst who covered Morgan Stanley during the crisis and is now
a consultant in Briarcliff Manor, New York. The firm &#8220;never
thought that the hedge funds would get that spooked.&#8221; 
29,346 Pages 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Fed loans -- tallied in a Bloomberg News
database assembled from government records of more than 21,000
transactions and 29,346 pages -- open a window on Wall Street&#8217;s
secretive, lucrative and risky dealings with hedge funds. 
(View the Bloomberg interactive graphic to chart the Fed&#8217;s
financial bailout.) 
The bank never told investors about the extent of its Fed
borrowings, even as they rose to the most in the 97-year history
of emergency lending by the U.S. central bank. Citigroup Inc. (C),
the New York-based lender whose balance sheet is more than twice
the size of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s, was the second-largest Fed
borrower, with a balance of $99.5 billion in January 2009. 
At the peak of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Fed borrowings, on Sept.
29, 2008, the firm reported that liquidity was &#8220;strong,&#8221;
without mentioning how dependent its cash stores had become on
the government lifeline. Liquidity refers to the daily funds a
bank needs to operate, including cash to cover withdrawals. 
&#8216;Black Box&#8217; 
Neither Morgan Stanley nor its competitors in prime
brokerage -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
Citigroup and Credit Suisse Group AG -- disclose the size of
their hedge-fund balances, leaving shareholders dependent on
regulators who previously failed to rein in the risks. 
&#8220;It remains a black box,&#8221; said Adam Hurwich, a former
member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s Investors
Technical Advisory Committee who&#8217;s now a portfolio manager at
New York-based investment firm Ulysses Management LLC. &#8220;They
don&#8217;t give you the information to be able to decipher whether
they have changed anything.&#8221; 
Prime brokers facilitate short trades, the sale of borrowed
stock in the hope of buying it back later at a lower price. They
also make margin loans to finance stock purchases. In exchange,
hedge funds usually keep their cash and stock in accounts at the
prime-brokerage companies. 
Frozen Assets 
Few analysts understood how dependent the brokerages had
become on such balances as a cheap source of funding, said Frank Suozzo, a former head of growth financial-services research at
AllianceBernstein LP. 
&#8220;Prime brokerage was presumed to be a pretty secure
business, where the funding was not actually part of the
liquidity of the bank,&#8221; said Suozzo, now president of advisory
firm FXS Capital LLC in Goldens Bridge, New York. &#8220;So if
clients pulled their money out, the view was that money had not
been lent out, so the cash would have been sitting there able to
hand over. It turns out that that was not entirely correct.&#8221; 
In reality, &#8220;prime brokers were able to reuse clients&#8217;
assets to raise cash for their own activities,&#8221; the financial
crisis commission wrote in its final report, published in
January. Azarchs said that in her years covering Morgan Stanley
for SP she never heard executives discuss the risk that the
funding might evaporate. 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy changed matters
when it froze at least $65 billion of assets held by that firm&#8217;s
London-based prime brokerage. For hedge funds, it was a lesson
not to bank with companies perceived to be at risk of failure,
according to the commission report. So hedge funds moved quickly
to pull their money from Morgan Stanley, viewed as the next
weakest securities firm after Lehman, according to the report. 
Unregulated, Unrated 
Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
disclose the bank&#8217;s current hedge-fund balances. 
&#8220;The financial crisis of 2008 caused&#160;the industry to
fundamentally&#160;re-evaluate the way it manages liquidity,&#8221; Lake
said. &#8220;We have taken the lessons we learned from that period
and applied them to&#160;our liquidity-management program to protect
both our franchise and our clients going forward.&#8221; 
Lake wouldn&#8217;t say what practices the firm has changed. 
Hedge funds are mostly private, unregulated and unrated
investment pools that often try to increase trading returns by
supplementing their own capital with stock and cash borrowed
from Wall Street&#8217;s prime-brokerage divisions. 
Prime-Brokerage Revenue 
The world&#8217;s 10 largest investment banks garnered about $10
billion in revenue from prime brokerage in 2010, almost as much
as they made trading stocks, according to London-based research
firm Coalition Development Ltd. The top 25 hedge-fund managers
earned $22.1 billion in 2010, according to AR magazine. 
Prior to the crisis, prime brokerage was one of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s most profitable businesses, generating at least $2
billion of revenue a year, according to Brad Hintz, a former
Morgan Stanley treasurer who now follows the firm as an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The bank doesn&#8217;t
disclose how much revenue it gets from the business. 
Any requirement that prime brokers keep more cash on hand
to survive a hedge-fund run may cut into the profitability of
the business. That&#8217;s because cash and Treasury securities that
can be liquidated easily in a squeeze are less profitable to
hold than loans and bonds that pay higher interest rates. Also,
prime brokers may have to issue more long-term debt, which would
force them to pay higher interest rates, said Richard Lindsey, a
former prime-brokerage chief at Bear Stearns Cos. 
&#8216;Infinitely Lived Borrowing&#8217; 
&#8220;The safest way to fund something is to take out long-term
debt or, even better, equity, which is essentially infinitely
lived borrowing,&#8221; said Lindsey, now principal of Callcott Group
LLC in New York, which advises pension funds and endowments on
portfolio risks. &#8220;The problem of course is that those are the
most expensive forms of financing.&#8221; 
In July 2008, Morgan Stanley said in a regulatory filing
that its policies were designed &#8220;to ensure adequate funding
over a wide range of market environments.&#8221; The firm&#8217;s
&#8220;contingency&#8221; plan anticipated a &#8220;potential, prolonged
liquidity contraction over a one-year time period,&#8221; according
to the filing. Resources included a $5 billion credit line from
a group of banks that could be used in an emergency. 
At the end of August, Morgan Stanley had $179 billion of
liquidity, filings show. The firm had $2 billion of Fed loans
outstanding on Aug. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
As of Sept. 29, its liquidity had shrunk 44 percent to
$99.8 billion, according to internal reports released by the
crisis commission. By then, the firm had $107.3 billion of Fed
loans outstanding, the Bloomberg data show. 
&#8216;Adverse Funding Flows&#8217; 
The bank didn&#8217;t mention the Fed loans in a press release
about its financial condition that day. Two weeks later, in
another filing, the firm disclosed it was benefiting from
&#8220;expanded sources of funding and liquidity resulting from the
Fed&#8217;s current policies,&#8221; without specifying the amount. 
Staffers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were
astonished at how quickly Morgan Stanley&#8217;s cash dwindled, e-
mails released by the crisis commission show. 
At 11:05 p.m. on Sept. 15, 2008, William Brodows, a bank
supervision officer at the New York Fed, wrote to colleagues
that Wong, 44, the Morgan Stanley treasurer at the time, and two
other executives had called him at home that night. They wanted
&#8220;to express their concern that MS had experienced some adverse
funding flows late in the day from prime brokerage accounts,&#8221;
Brodows, 61, wrote. 
Free Credit 
Executives had already begun estimating Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
potential use of the Fed&#8217;s Primary Dealer Credit Facility, a
program created that year to supply emergency funds to
securities firms. Such companies lacked access to the central
bank&#8217;s discount window, its last-resort lending program. 
&#8220;In their &#8216;dark&#8217; scenario, they felt their PDCF usage
would increase to $10-$15 billion,&#8221; Brodows wrote in the e-
mail. 
At 6:59 a.m. the next morning, the concerns were echoed in
an e-mail by Matthew Eichner, 46, then an assistant director at
the Securities and Exchange Commission, to Brodows and other New
York Fed employees. 
&#8220;Definitely some major outflows of PB balances at both GS
($5 b) and MS ($7 b),&#8221; Eichner wrote, referring to prime-
brokerage balances at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. &#8220;Not
pretty.&#8221; 
It got uglier. At 10:18 p.m. that night, a New York Fed
&#8220;on-site primary dealer update&#8221; stated that Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
prime brokerage had suffered &#8220;free credit withdrawals of $20
billion over the last two days, contributing to a $23 billion
decline in the parent company liquidity pool to $106 billion.&#8221;
Free credit is an industry term for hedge-fund cash balances,
according to Lindsey. 
&#8216;Catastrophic Scenario&#8217; 
Two hours later, at 12:30 a.m. on Sept. 17, New York Fed
Senior Vice President Til Schuermann forwarded the update to
Brodows. Under Morgan Stanley&#8217;s &#8220;catastrophic scenario,&#8221;
Schuermann wrote, &#8220;they expect to lose $21.5 bn over the first
2 weeks -- not 2 days -- from PB!&#8221; 
Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, declined to
comment. Eichner now works for the Fed in Washington. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s shares fell 24 percent that day, and then-
Chief Executive Officer John Mack sent a memo to the firm&#8217;s
46,000 employees saying &#8220;there is no rational basis for the
movements in our stock.&#8221; 
&#8220;We&#8217;re in the midst of a market controlled by fear and
rumors, and short-sellers are driving our stock down,&#8221; Mack,
66, wrote, adding that &#8220;we have talked to&#8221; Henry Paulson, U.S.
Treasury secretary at the time, and then-SEC Chairman
Christopher Cox about the issue. He reiterated that the firm had
$179 billion of liquidity as of Aug. 31. He didn&#8217;t mention that
the figure had since dwindled to $117.7 billion, even as the
firm drew an additional $38.5 billion from the Fed. 
Chanos Withdrawal 
Jim Chanos, president and founder of New York-based hedge
fund Kynikos Associates LP, which specializes in short selling,
decided to pull $1 billion out of Morgan Stanley because he was
angry that Mack had put out a memo demonizing short sellers, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. 
Chanos, 53, has since returned to Morgan Stanley as a
prime-brokerage client, partly because the firm in September
2009 announced that Mack would give up his daily operational
role as CEO, while remaining chairman, the person said. 
On Sept. 19, 2008, Citigroup representatives told Fed
staffers that &#8220;Goldman and Credit Suisse are actively pursuing
Morgan&#8217;s prime business clients,&#8221; according to an internal
report that afternoon. The flows from Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs were coming in so quickly that Citigroup barely had time
to vet the new clients, the report said. 
Counterparty Risk 
Within a week of Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy, Morgan Stanley had
lost $84.8 billion of prime-brokerage free credits, according to
a Morgan Stanley treasurer&#8217;s report released by the crisis
commission. The next week, $43.3 billion more flowed out. 
By Sept. 29, the bank was borrowing $61.3 billion from the
PDCF through units in the U.S. and London and getting $36
billion from the Term Securities Lending Facility. The TSLF
allowed broker-dealers to swap mortgage bonds for liquid
Treasuries that could then be sold or pledged for cash close to
their face value. Morgan Stanley also received $10 billion from
the Fed&#8217;s single-tranche open-market operations, another
emergency-lending program for broker-dealers. 
The firm, which routinely demands collateral from hedge
funds to guard against default, faced a bigger risk when clients
suddenly began worrying the bank might not survive. 
&#8220;This was a world turned on its head,&#8221; said Bernstein&#8217;s
Hintz. &#8220;Who would have guessed that hedge funds would have
worried about the counterparty risk of Morgan Stanley? Morgan
Stanley worried about the counterparty risks to hedge funds, not
the other way around.&#8221; 
Mitsubishi Stake 
The bank&#8217;s draws from the Fed began to ebb after Sept. 29,
2008, when the firm announced an agreement for Tokyo-based
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. to invest $9 billion in
Morgan Stanley for a 21 percent equity stake. 
&#8220;This $9 billion investment will further bolster Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s strong capital and liquidity positions,&#8221; the firm
said in a press release that day. 
Colm Kelleher, 54, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s chief financial officer
at the time, disclosed on Dec. 18, 2008, that the firm&#8217;s prime-
brokerage balances had tumbled 46 percent to about $150 billion
as of Nov. 30 from $280 billion on Aug. 31. On a conference call
that day, Kelleher said the erosion was &#8220;clearly a function of
the downsizing of the hedge-fund business.&#8221; 
&#8216;Safer Place&#8217; 
While many hedge funds have since returned to Morgan
Stanley, the firm doesn&#8217;t provide detailed updates on its prime-
brokerage balances. 
&#8220;Prime-brokerage revenues were up significantly&#8221; over the
previous quarter, while client balances &#8220;continued to grow
modestly,&#8221; Ruth Porat, 53, who replaced Kelleher as CFO, said
on a call with investors on July 21, without disclosing amounts. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s liquidity stood at $182 billion as of June
30 and represents 22 percent of total assets, up from 18 percent
just before the crisis. 
&#8220;Nobody could withstand a run on liquidity, except, of
course, the government,&#8221; Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 53,
said in a May 24 speech in New York. &#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;re in a much
safer place as a result of it.&#8221; 
In a brief interview afterward, Gorman declined to comment
on what changes the firm had made in its prime brokerage. 
&#8220;We give out as much as we feel is appropriate on that
business,&#8221; he said. 
A new rule adopted in December by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, an international panel of regulators,
requires global banks to keep enough cash or cash-like reserves
on hand to survive a 25 percent run-off of balances in
&#8220;clearing, custody or cash-management&#8221; accounts during a
crisis lasting 30 days. The rule doesn&#8217;t take effect until 2015. 
&#8216;Almost Impossible&#8217; 
While Morgan Stanley&#8217;s liquidity has increased, &#8220;it&#8217;s
almost impossible&#8221; to judge whether it&#8217;s enough, Hintz said. 
&#8220;You don&#8217;t know whether the liquidity pool is required by
the ratings agencies, or whether it is required by the Federal
Reserve,&#8221; Hintz said. &#8220;I suspect there&#8217;s something of both.
But it&#8217;s a recognition that the old contingency funding plans
had a flaw, and that these events can happen very quickly.&#8221; 
Hedge funds have changed their business practices to
protect themselves from the collapse of a prime broker, limiting
the amount of funding that securities firms can get from such
relationships, said Allan Yip, a former in-house prime-brokerage
lawyer for Bear Stearns. 
Repledging Assets 
Many funds now restrict the ability of securities firms to
repledge assets to obtain funding, a process known as
&#8220;rehypothecation,&#8221; Yip said. More funds stipulate that their
cash must be held in separate bank accounts. 
&#8220;This has been a market-driven change, in terms of what
liquidity can be obtained by the banks,&#8221; said Yip, who now
advises hedge funds on prime-brokerage and trading documentation
as a partner in London at law firm Simmons  Simmons LLP. 
Not that the funds have to worry. It&#8217;s probable the central
bank would again lend to a big firm such as Morgan Stanley if
another crisis hit, said Viral Acharya, a New York University
finance professor who serves as an academic adviser to the Fed,
according to the university&#8217;s website. 
For hedge funds, &#8220;it&#8217;s basically like you get the too-big-
to-fail benefit from being connected to a large financial
firm,&#8221; Acharya said. &#8220;If you dealt with a small prime broker,
say a boutique investment firm, it&#8217;s unlikely to be bailed
out.&#8221;

Investor confidence in U.S.
corporate credit deteriorated to the worst level since June 2010
and the cost to protect Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) debt jumped
following a report that Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
hired a defense attorney. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 4 basis points to a
mid-price of 126.8 basis points as of 5:35 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. Credit-
default swaps on Goldman Sachs jumped 40 basis points to 255.4
basis points, the highest level since April 2009, according to
data provider CMA. 
Traders earlier pushed down the benchmark gauge of
investment-grade debt risk, which typically falls when investor
confidence improves and rises when it deteriorates, before the
Federal Reserve holds its annual symposium in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming this weekend. The index reversed as credit risk at
finance companies including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) gained. 
&#8220;Monday saw a tug-o-war of themes that pitted financial
sector concerns against bullish sentiment tied to speculation
Bernanke&#8217;s speech on Friday will deliver a message of further
stimulus,&#8221; Adrian Miller, fixed-income strategist at Miller
Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mail. 
The index has soared from 96.3 at the end of July as
investor concern mounted that the global economic recovery is
slowing. 
Goldman Sachs said Blankfein and other people hired
attorneys in relation to a U.S. probe of matters raised by the
Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
Justice Department 
&#8220;As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department&#8217;s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset,&#8221; the New
York-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. 
Contracts linked to the debt of Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, added 38.6 basis points to 380.6, the
data show. 
Investor confidence in high-yield, high-risk debt plunged
for a third day to the lowest level in almost two years. The
Markit CDX North America High Yield Index, which falls as
investor confidence deteriorates, dropped 0.6 percentage point
to 91.8 percent of face value, the lowest level since Sept. 10,
2009. High-yield, high-risk bonds and loans are rated below Baa3
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by SP. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, began arguing its U.S. trade case that Android-
based smartphones made by Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. use
technology derived from Microsoft inventions. 
In a trial that began today before the International Trade
Commission in Washington, Microsoft accused Motorola Mobility of
infringing seven of its patents and requested a halt to imports
of certain Motorola phones. The ITC has the power to stop
imports of products that violate U.S. patent rights. 
The case is the first smartphone dispute to be heard by the
agency since Google Inc. (GOOG) said Aug. 15 it would buy Motorola
Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that could be used
as a bulwark against a surge of lawsuits targeting handsets and
tablet computers that use Google&#8217;s Android operating system. 
&#8220;We have a responsibility to our employees, customers,
partners and shareholders to safeguard our intellectual
property,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate vice president
and deputy general counsel for litigation, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;Motorola is infringing our patents and we are confident that
the ITC will rule in our favor.&#8221; 
Motorola Mobility is &#8220;vigorously defending&#8221; itself
&#8220;against Microsoft&#8217;s patent attack business strategy,&#8221;
Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;We have also brought legal actions of our own in the
U.S. and in Europe to address Microsoft&#8217;s large scale of
infringement of Motorola Mobility&#8217;s patents.&#8221; 
Smartphone Market 
Microsoft&#8217;s claim against Libertyville, Illinois-based
Motorola Mobility is one of more than a dozen smartphone cases
before the ITC, as companies seek to use patents to gain a
bigger share of a market projected by researcher IHS Inc. to
reach $206.6 billion this year. Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft makes its own mobile operating system, Windows Phone
7, which competes with Android and Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone. 
The Android platform accounted for 43.3 percent of the
smartphone market last quarter, according to Stamford,
Connecticut-based research firm Gartner Inc. (IT) Microsoft, with
less than 2 percent of the market, is counting on an agreement
with Espoo, Finland-based Nokia Oyj (NOK) to put Windows Mobile on its
phones to increase market share. 
Cases brought by Microsoft and Cupertino, California-based
Apple are targeting devices that run on Android. Microsoft,
which contends all Android devices use its technology, also has
a case against Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS), targeting the Nook reader. 
Testimony in today&#8217;s Motorola Mobility trial focused on
details about functions that Microsoft calls &#8220;essential to the
smartphone user experience,&#8221; including ways to synchronize e-
mail, calendars and contacts; schedule meetings; and notify
applications of changes in signal strength and battery power. 
Block Imports 
Microsoft has asked the agency to block imports of Motorola
phones including the Droid 2, Droid X, Cliq XT, Devour, Backflip
and Charm. Administrative Law Judge Theodore Essex is scheduled
to release his findings in the case Nov. 4, and the commission
has a target to complete its investigation by March 5, according
to information on the agency&#8217;s website. 
Mountain View, California-based Google, which wasn&#8217;t named
in the complaint, accused Microsoft of disclosing Google&#8217;s
source code to a Microsoft expert without first letting Google
know. Essex on Aug. 15 denied Google&#8217;s request that sanctions be
imposed on Microsoft, saying Google had failed to provide any
information that it has made a &#8220;reasonable, good-faith effort
to resolve the matter with Microsoft.&#8221; 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile Devices,
Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington).

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Nigerian unit is
awaiting an arbitration ruling to end its dispute with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. over &#8220;entitlements to lift
crude oil&#8221; from the Erha offshore field. 
&#8220;We can confirm that the arbitration hearing ended in
Abuja on March 2,&#8221; Nigel Cookey-Gam, an Exxon spokesman in
Nigeria, said today in an e-mailed statement. The &#8220;parties are
currently awaiting an award by the tribunal.&#8221; 
Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest company, sought arbitration in
2009 after talks with the Nigerian government and the state oil
company, known as NNPC, had &#8220;been unsuccessful,&#8221; the statement
said. There&#8217;s no specific date yet for the ruling, said Cookey-
Gam. Levi Ajuonuma, a NNPC spokesman, declined to comment. 
The Erha field, located about 97 kilometers (60 miles)
offshore Nigeria, started production in 2006 and has the
capacity to pump about 190,000 barrels of crude a day. Exxon
Mobil, operator of the field, holds a 56.25 percent interest and
Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co., a local unit of
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), holds 43.75 percent. 
Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s top oil producer, is the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. imports of the fuel. Shell, Exxon, Chevron Corp.,
Total SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with state-owned NNPC,
which pumps about 90 percent of the country&#8217;s crude.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest oil company by market value, estimated the cost to clean
up a July 1 oil spill into the Yellowstone River in Montana will
be $42.6 million, according to a filing with federal regulators. 
The company&#8217;s emergency response to the spill from the
Silvertip pipeline will cost $40 million and property claims
will be $2.5 million, the company said in a July 29 filing with
the Transportation Department&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration. Exxon also lost about $100,000 of oil and
other commodities in the spill, according to the document,
obtained by Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act
request. 
Exxon&#8217;s 69-mile (111-kilometer) Silvertip line spilled an
estimated 1,000 barrels of crude into a flood-swollen
Yellowstone River near Laurel, Montana. The pipeline runs from
Elk Basin, Wyoming to Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Billings, Montana. 
More than 1,000 people were working to clean up the site as
of Aug. 12, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, which is leading the response effort. Sampling results
for air, water, soil and sediment around the river show &#8220;no
levels of concern&#8221; for water supplies or air quality, the
agency said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lowered its
forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2011 on signs the recovery
in the world&#8217;s largest economy lost momentum. 
The U.S. will expand 1.5 percent this year, down from a
previous forecast of 1.7 percent, Goldman economists in New York
including Jan Hatzius said in a note published on Aug. 19.
Credit Suisse was also among banks lowering growth forecasts this 
month. 
Federal Reserve surveys showed manufacturing in
Philadelphia and New York contracted in August, while a Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment
plunged to a three-decade low. Goldman&#8217;s change comes amid a
monthlong drop in global equities and as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke prepares to speak at the bank&#8217;s annual symposium in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week. 
The data &#8220;are pointing to even weaker growth ahead,&#8221; the
economists said. While Bernanke &#8220;is likely to be downbeat about
recent developments, we expect that he will still argue that the
conditions for an acceleration later this year and in 2012
remain in place.&#8221; 
Goldman forecasts third-quarter growth of 1 percent and a
fourth-quarter expansion of 1.5 percent, down from an earlier
projection for 2 percent growth in each quarter. 
Credit Suisse lowered its forecast for U.S. third-quarter
growth to 1.5 percent from from 3.3 percent, and for the fourth
quarter to 2.2 percent from 3.1 percent, according to a research
note dated Aug. 18. The bank cut its projection for global
growth to 3.9 percent in 2011 from 4.1 percent. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) predicts 1 percent growth in U.S.
gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, down from an
earlier projection of 2.5 percent, the bank said last week.
Citigroup Inc. (C) lowered its 2011 growth forecast to 1.6 percent
from 1.7 percent.

Charlotte Roche likes to shock. Her
first book, whose teenage heroine is hospitalized with an anal
lesion after an intimate shaving accident, sold more than 2
million copies in German. 
Roche, a sparky 33-year-old brunette who combines tattoos
and floral dresses, used to be a music and entertainment
television presenter. 
Her second novel, which entered Der Spiegel&#8217;s fiction
bestseller list at slot No. 1 this week, is also not for the
fainthearted. It&#8217;s titled &#8220;Schossgebete,&#8221; a made-up word that
is a play on Stossgebet -- a desperate prayer -- and Schoss,
which can refer to the female reproductive organs though more
generally means the lap area. 
&#8220;Schossgebete&#8221; opens with 15 pages of pornography,
describing a married couple having sex with the electric
blankets on and the windows closed, as the heroine prefers. 
Yet like its predecessor &#8220;Wetlands,&#8221; whose yuckiness
cloaks the story of a lost girl trying to reunite her divorced
parents, &#8220;Schossgebete&#8221; presents an exhaustively intimate
psychological portrait of a very disturbed young woman. 
The reader is forced into voyeurism -- and not just of the
sexual variety -- as Roche bares all in this relentlessly frank,
often funny novel about a troubled 33-year-old traumatized by a
tragedy in her past. The author admitted in an interview with
Spiegel that it is dangerously close to autobiography.

The cost to protect bonds of U.S.
companies fell from the highest level in 14 months as investor
speculation the Federal Reserve will act to spur the economy
overshadowed concern that banks will be forced to raise capital. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 1.3 basis points to a
mid-price of 125.5 basis points as of 5:27 p.m. in New York,
Markit Group Ltd. data show. The index earlier jumped as much as
4.9 basis points. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) credit swaps declined
after earlier soaring to a record. 
Corporate and financial company debt is being whipsawed
before central bankers meet this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
The credit risk benchmark, which rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, dropped even after a
magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Virginia and shook buildings in
Washington and New York. 
Investor confidence in corporate credit decreased earlier
on &#8220;concerns about the sovereign situation, concerns about our
own domestic macro situation,&#8221; John Guarnera, a financial
analyst at Societe Generale SA in New York, said in a telephone
interview. The rise signaled investors were &#8220;ignoring the fact
that the financials are fundamentally better-positioned than
where we were coming out of the credit crisis.&#8221; 
Credit-default swaps tied to Bank of America fell 2 basis
points to 378.5 as of 5 p.m. in New York, according to data
provider CMA. That pared an earlier surge to at least 445 basis
points, which exceeded the peak during the financial crisis in
March 2009, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts wrote in a report. 
&#8216;Irrational&#8217; Valuations 
Valuations are becoming &#8220;irrational,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts
Kabir Caprihan and Matthew Hughart based in New York wrote in
the report. They changed their view on the debt to &#8220;neutral&#8221;
from &#8220;underweight.&#8221; 
Bank of America credit swaps have more than doubled from
178 basis points at the end of July as concern mounts that the
lender may face larger losses tied to mortgages and will need to
raise additional capital. 
Henry Blodget, the former Internet stock analyst turned
blogger, wrote on Business Insider that charges and loan costs
may force the bank to raise as much as $200 billion. 
The bank has &#8220;no reason&#8221; to raise capital, Rochdale
Securities analyst Richard Bove said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.&#8221; 
&#8220;Bank of America has so much cash on its balance sheet
that it could pay back all of its short-term debt and a big
chunk of its long-term debt,&#8221; Bove said. 
Goldman Swaps 
Contracts on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, fell 10 basis points to 245, according to
data provider CMA. The swaps earlier rose to 283, the highest
level since April 2009. The contracts rose 40 basis points
yesterday, after Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
others hired attorneys in relation to a U.S. probe of matters
raised by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
U.S. bank bonds are &#8220;very attractive&#8221; investments after
declining this month, according to Pacific Investment Management
Co.&#8217;s Mark Kiesel. 
&#8220;This is a sector that makes money, has improved
capital,&#8221; Kiesel, Pimco&#8217;s global head of corporate bond
portfolios, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. 
Pimco, the Newport Beach, California-based manager of the
world&#8217;s largest bond fund, has been wagering on U.S. bank debt
since at least April 2008, when Kiesel said that big banks would
&#8220;slim down&#8221; by raising capital and cutting leverage. Lenders
have improved their balance sheets, making them a safe bet,
Kiesel told Scarlet Fu on the network&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop&#8221; program. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), leader of a
group of lenders owed $381.7 million on a bankrupt homebuilding
project in Henderson, Nevada, sued Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH) to
recover the builder&#8217;s share of a guarantee. 
JPMorgan and other lenders agreed in 2004 to advance as
much as $535 million to builders including Meritage and Beazer
Homes USA Inc. (BZH), taking repayment guarantees from each builder,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in Las Vegas. The share
of Meritage for the loans advanced to date is $13.3 million,
JPMorgan said in the filing as it asked a judge to compel
payment. 
&#8220;JPMorgan has made due demand under the repayment
guaranty, and the defendants have failed and refused to pay
their liabilities,&#8221; the bank said. 
South Edge LLC, which is owned by the builders, is in
bankruptcy court in Nevada. The bankruptcy triggered the
repayment guarantee, JPMorgan said. 
Meritage sued the bank Aug. 19 in state court in Ohio,
where the JPMorgan unit that is the trustee for the lenders is
based. Meritage asked a judge to rule the homebuilder doesn&#8217;t
have any obligations to the lenders and seeks $8 million in
damages. 
Meritage claims that it tried to pay the lenders in April
2008 but JPMorgan refused to accept the payment. 
Meritage&#8217;s claim for damages is based on losses related to
the drop in value of the property and legal fees, company Chief
Financial Officer Larry W. Seay said today in a telephone
interview. 
The case is JPMorgan v. Meritage Homes, 11-cv-01364, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas).

General Motors Co. (GM), the maker of the
plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt, and LG Group have agreed to form
a partnership to design and engineer future electric cars, a
high priority of Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson. 
GM, 32 percent owned by the U.S., brings expertise in
vehicles and Seoul-based LG knows how to develop and build
lithium-ion batteries. Closely held LG supplies batteries for
the Volt and the mechanically identical Opel Ampera sold in
Europe. The deal does not involve an exchange of equity, the
companies said today in a statement. 
The agreement should help Detroit-based GM stay current on
battery technology and ensure that the company has close
relations with a supplier that can help engineer electric-power
systems, said Michael Robinet, a Northville, Michigan-based vice
president of research firm IHS Automotive. 
&#8220;In tomorrow&#8217;s vehicles, customers will look at technology
as a differentiator,&#8221; Robinet said. &#8220;Vehicle manufacturers
will be looking to link up with major battery players to ensure
that they have new technology. There will be an interesting
round of musical chairs.&#8221; 
Akerson boosted Volt production plans for next year to
60,000 from 45,000 after exploring an increase to 120,000 of the
plug-in hybrids. This partnership will not make batteries for
the next-generation Volt, Kevin Kelly, a GM spokesman, said in a
telephone interview. 
GM slipped 11 cents to $22.26 at 12:02 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 33
percent since a $33 initial public offering in November.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) are among banks that made final bids to buy portions of
Anglo Irish Bank Corp.&#8217;s $9.65 billion of U.S. property loans,
according to three people with knowledge of the sales. 
The lenders are looking to acquire pieces of the $4.52
billion of performing loans the Dublin-based bank is shedding,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Investor groups led by private-equity firms
Blackstone Group LP (BX), working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), and Lone
Star Funds also submitted offers for parts of the portfolio,
which include $5.13 billion of subperforming and non-performing
debt, the people said. 
&#8220;Banks like Wells and JPMorgan can afford to pay more than
a nonbank for the performing loans,&#8221; said Ben Thypin, director
of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics Inc., a property-
research firm in New York. &#8220;Private-equity firms like
Blackstone and Lone Star can bid aggressively on the
nonperforming pieces because they have a large workout
infrastructure in place.&#8221; 
Anglo Irish is seeking to unload loans after being seized
by the Irish government in January 2009 amid a surge in souring
debt. The offering includes loans backed buildings from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills, California. The competition
underscores the appetite for real estate loans by private-equity
firms and banks looking to grow their assets even amid signs
that the global economic recovery is stalling. 
Martha Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Anglo Irish, declined to
comment on the bids, as did spokesmen for New York-based
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. 
Board to Discuss 
Final bids were submitted this week and a winner is
expected to be chosen by early next week, according to the
people. Anglo Irish&#8217;s board of directors is likely to discuss
the final bids at a meeting today in advance of tomorrow&#8217;s
release of first-half results, according to a person familiar
with the matter, who asked not be identified because the
information is private. 
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may hold the loans for their own
books or package them for sale as bonds if investor demand for
commercial-mortgage backed securities, or CMBS, is sufficient,
said one of the people. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo bought a
$1.4 billion portfolio of 25 loans from Bank of Ireland Plc on
properties in Boston, New York and Washington, according to Alan Elias, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based bank. The lender
also bought part of Allied Irish Banks LLC&#8217;s $1 billion loan
portfolio, Elias said. Blackstone purchased the other piece. 
Financing Possible 
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may finance the purchase of the
some pools, the people said. A syndicate of lenders including
Bank of America Corp., RBC Capital Markets, Citigroup Inc. and
Macquarie Bank Ltd. are also vying for the assignment, the
people said. 
Eastdil Secured LLC and FTI Consulting Inc. (FCN) are advising
Anglo Irish on the sale, the people said. The portfolio has been
divided into eight pools, according to an offering document from
Eastdil. 
Representatives of Blackstone, Lone Star, Deutsche Bank,
Citigroup, Bank of America, RBC Capital and Macquarie declined
to comment on the deal. Calls to Eastdil weren&#8217;t returned.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) and Lone Star Funds won the bidding for Anglo Irish Bank
Corp.&#8217;s $9.65 billion portfolio of U.S. real estate loans,
according to three people briefed on the auction&#8217;s results. 
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo each won pools of mainly
performing loans, said one of the people, who asked not to be
named because the results haven&#8217;t been made public. Lone Star,
the Dallas-based investor in distressed mortgages, will buy
subperforming and nonperforming loans that account for about
half of the portfolio, the person said. 
The auction, which included loans backed by buildings from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills, California, underscores the appetite
for property in higher-quality locations by private-equity firms
and banks seeking to expand their assets. The winning bids for
the loans averaged about 80 cents on the dollar, said two of the
people who were told of the results. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re looking at quality assets in good, strong
markets, I&#8217;d say 80 cents on the dollar sounds pretty
reasonable,&#8221; said Tom Craig, founder of TSC Realty Partners, a
commercial-property broker in Seattle who wasn&#8217;t involved in the
sale. &#8220;One of the barriers to entry on a big deal like this is
how many people can put the capital together to buy this and
close quickly.&#8221; 
Blackstone Bid 
Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, and
Alan Elias, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo,
declined to comment, as did Andy Brimmer, a spokesman for Lone
Star. Martha Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Anglo Irish in Dublin,
also declined to comment. 
A message for Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil
Secured LLC, the Wells Fargo unit that conducted the auction,
wasn&#8217;t returned. 
Blackstone Group LP (BX) was a final bidder for at least a
portion of the loans, according to people with knowledge of the
situation. Peter Rose, a spokesman for the New York-based
private-equity firm, declined to comment. 
Anglo Irish is seeking to unload loans after being seized
by the Irish government in January 2009 amid a surge in souring
debt. The U.S. loans are backed by properties including the
Apthorp apartments in Manhattan, Chicago&#8217;s Palmer House Hilton
hotel and the Two Rodeo Drive shopping center in Beverly Hills. 
Anglo Irish expects to complete the U.S. portfolio sale by
year&#8217;s end, Tom Hunersen, the bank&#8217;s head of corporate
development, said at a press briefing yesterday. 
&#8220;We had a large group of interested parties,&#8221; Hunersen
said, declining to disclose details of the auction. The bank
achieved &#8220;the best possible value,&#8221; he said.

Morgan Stanley is advising on the
sale of Portugal&#8217;s 1.65 billion euro ($2.4 billion) stake in
utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA, two people with knowledge
of the matter said. 
The sale is one of the measures that the government pledged
in exchange for a 78 billion-euro bailout from the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund. With the country&#8217;s
borrowing costs surging, Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in
April in seeking a rescue. 
Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said on June 30 he
planned to sell the stake in EDP in the third quarter. Portugal
holds 25 percent of EDP, although only 20.9 percent of the
utility will be up for sale, as 4.14 percent has been exchanged
for bonds that mature in 2014, Joaquim Reis, chairman of
Portuguese state holding company Parpublica, said in a July 22
interview. The utility was valued at 7.9 billion euros at the
close of trading today. 
The utility&#8217;s shareholders in a meeting yesterday ended the
state&#8217;s &#8220;golden share&#8221; veto rights and changed the limits on
voting rights to 20 percent of the company&#8217;s stock. EDP&#8217;s rules
previously prevented any one investor from voting with more than
5 percent of shares. 
Newspaper Expresso reported in July that State Grid Corp.
of China, another Chinese company and Centrais Electricas
Brasileiras SA, a Brazilian electricity company known as
Electrobras, were interested in buying a stake in EDP. 
Eletrobras on March 31 had said it was in the technical and
economic analysis stage of a possible investment in EDP. 
Newspaper Diario Economico also reported in May that China
Power was interested in EDP. On Aug. 10, China Power
International Development Ltd. said its parent company currently
had no plan to acquire shares in the utility.

The U.S. Treasury Department
announced an $88.3 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
for apparent violations of international sanctions programs,
including Cuban assets control and anti-terrorism regulations. 
The Treasury said that JPMorgan through its correspondent
banks maintained prohibited financial transactions with
sanctioned entities in countries including Cuba and Iran. 
The JPMorgan payment agreed upon by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, known as OFAC, involves &#8220;egregious&#8221; violations
for five years, according to a Treasury Department statement. 
&#8220;The civil settlement resolves a number of OFAC
allegations dating back to 2005, none of which involved any
intent to violate OFAC regulations,&#8221; Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;These
rare incidents were unrelated and isolated from each other. The
firm screens hundreds of millions of transactions and customer
records per day and annual error rates are a tiny fraction of a
percent.&#8221; 
The OFAC enforcement action covers actions from December
2005 to March 2011 involving multiple violations of sanctions
programs, the Treasury said. The violations include processing
1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million from December 2005
to March 2006 involving Cuban persons and a trade loan of $2.9
million with a blocked affiliate to the Islamic Republic of Iran
Shipping Lines. 
OFAC said the $88.3 million payment from JPMorgan is based
on the bank&#8217;s cooperation, transaction review and the absence of
an OFAC notice or finding of violation during the five years of
the transactions. 
Compliance Policy 
EPA Delays Mandate to Report Products Leading to Carbon Releases 
The Environmental Protection Agency said it would put off
reporting requirements for manufacturers and power plants on the
products they use that lead to greenhouse-gas emissions. 
In a Federal Register notice yesterday, the EPA said that
companies would have until at least 2013 to submit information
about the raw materials. Representatives of chemical makers, oil
refiners and other manufacturers have tried to scuttle the EPA&#8217;s
proposal, saying it would force them to disclose confidential
information. 
The rules were set to take effect this year. The EPA
proposed in December that they be deferred and yesterday&#8217;s
notice makes that decision final. The rules will be delayed
until March 31, 2013, for some substances and two years later
for others. 
Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more a year of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are required to submit
annual reports to the EPA on those releases. On Aug. 22, the EPA
started a new program that lets 7,000 power plants, refiners and
other manufacturers file their emissions data electronically.
The information must be submitted by the end of September. 
Employers Must Tell Workers of Right to Unionize, NLRB Says 
U.S. employers must post notices informing workers about
their legal rights to form a union and bargain on contracts, the
National Labor Relations Board said in a rule that may help
efforts to organize employees. 
Companies that use posters to tell employees about
personnel rules or policies must add a notice about their
collective bargaining rights, according to a statement yesterday
from the NLRB. The posting must be completed Nov. 14. 
&#8220;The notice does make it easier for labor to make
inroads,&#8221; Doreen Davis, a partner in the labor and employment
practice at Morgan, Lewis  Bockius LLP in New York and
Philadelphia, said in an interview. 
The board proposed the rule to spell out for employees
their rights under federal laws that let workers choose to form
and join a labor union. Business groups protested the proposal
and said the rule shows that the agency favors unions. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s arbitrary, it&#8217;s capricious,&#8221; Peter Schaumber, a
former NLRB chairman appointed by Republican President George W.
Bush, said in an interview. &#8220;It shows just how activist they&#8217;re
prepared to be.&#8221; 
&#8220;The NLRB rule simply brings the National Labor Relations
Act in line with other workplace laws that require employers to
post a notice in the workplace of their employees&#8217; rights,&#8221;
Peter Colavito, director of government relations at the 2.2
million-member Service Employees International Union, said in a
statement.

U.S. Banks Said to Seek Relief From Regulators as Deposits Swell 
U.S. regulators have asked some banks to take more deposits
from large investors even if it&#8217;s unprofitable, and lenders in
return are seeking relief on insurance premiums and leverage
ratios, according to six people with knowledge of the talks. 
Deposits are flooding into the biggest U.S. banks as
customers seek shelter from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and falling
stock prices. That forces lenders to raise capital for a growing
balance sheet and saddles them with the higher deposit insurance
payments. With short-term interest rates so low, it&#8217;s hard for
financial firms to reinvest the new money profitably. 
Regulators have asked banks to take the deposits anyway,
three people said, with one lender accepting $100 billion. The
regulators want lenders to take the deposits because it improves
the stability of the financial system, according to one of the
people, who said U.S. banks are viewed as places of strength. 
Some of the largest ones have talked with regulators about
softening rules for ratios that measure capital and assets,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
talks are private. At least one asked for a waiver on paying
higher premiums to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is
less likely to be granted, one of the people said. 
&#8220;If the helicopter comes raining money on your bank and
it&#8217;s only temporarily there, it could be excessively costly and
disruptive,&#8221; said Robert Litan, a vice president of research
and policy at the Kansas City, Missouri-based Kauffman
Foundation, which promotes entrepreneurial business practices. 
The extra deposits are problematic because they&#8217;re subject
to withdrawal, so banks have to park the money in low-yielding
short-term investments, Litan said. With few other choices
available, banks have stashed their excess deposits at the Fed,
which means the cash gets counted as assets. 
This expands their balance sheets and thus pushes down
their leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital divided by
adjusted average total assets; the lower the ratio, the weaker
the bank, at least in theory. In reality, regulators regard U.S.
lenders as relatively strong with sufficient capital cushions,
the people said. 
Lenders have held discussions with officials at the Fed,
FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Treasury
Department, according to four of the people. Spokesmen for the
four agencies declined to comment. 
Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, Howard Opinsky at
JPMorgan, Ancel Martinez at Wells Fargo and Bank of America&#8217;s
Jerry Dubrowski declined to comment. 
Relaxing the rules or enforcement could be a slippery
slope, said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC,
a Jersey City, New Jersey-based unit of London-based ICAP Plc,
the world&#8217;s largest inter-dealer broker. 
&#8220;Asking for a free pass on the leverage ratio for bank
deposits by itself isn&#8217;t something that regulators would
consider,&#8221; Crandall said. &#8220;The question is whether banks
should be able to exclude reserve balances since they are a
risk-free asset.&#8221;

Facebook Faces Confusion From Multiple Privacy Agencies, EU Says 
Facebook Inc. and other Internet companies face legal
confusion from local and national European regulators with
different approaches to data protection, the European Commission
said. 
These differences &#8220;show the risk that the same company and
services will be treated in an inconsistent manner by different
authorities,&#8221; said Matthew Newman, a spokesman for the European
Commission, in an e-mail. The Brussels-based regulator will
propose draft rules later this year for all data protection
agencies across the 27-nation bloc to follow. 
Facebook&#8217;s like button and facial-recognition features were
criticized by two German regional regulators this month, with
officials in Schleswig-Holstein saying the like button may
violate European Union and German data protection law while
Hamburg&#8217;s data protection agency said the company may break
privacy rules by recording biometric data. 
Facebook is among U.S. companies that have faced scrutiny
in the EU for possible privacy breaches. Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and Yahoo! Inc. have been pushed by European data-
protection officials to limit the amount of time they store
online users&#8217; search records. The group of regulators, known as
the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, has also
criticized Facebook for policy changes that could harm users&#8217;
privacy. 
Compliance Action 
National Century&#8217;s Poulsen Conviction, 30-Year Term Upheld 
A federal appeals court upheld the 30-year prison term of
Lance Poulsen, founder of National Century Financial Enterprises
Inc., as well as his convictions at separate trials on
obstruction of justice and fraud charges. 
Poulsen was found guilty by jurors in federal court in
Columbus, Ohio, in October 2008 of fraud, conspiracy and money
laundering for defrauding investors of $2.9 billion. Seven
months earlier, a separate jury convicted him of trying to bribe
the main witness against him. U.S. District Judge Algenon
Marbley sentenced him to 30 years in the fraud case. 
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
yesterday rejected Poulsen&#8217;s claims that Marbley made several
improper rulings at each trial and that his prison term was too
long. Poulsen had said he shouldn&#8217;t get a longer sentence than
the chief executive officers of WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp.,
who got 25 and 24 years, respectively. 
&#8220;Poulsen cites a number of sentences given to those whom
he refers to as &#8216;the most notorious financial fraudsters in
corporate America,&#8217;&#8221; according to the opinion by a three-judge
panel of the appeals court. &#8220;Poulsen presents no coherent
argument as to why his sentence is substantively unreasonable.&#8221; 
Poulsen, 68, is incarcerated at the Williamsburg Federal
Correctional Institution in South Carolina, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons website. His release date is listed on
the site as Dec. 4, 2033. 
The appeals panel ruled that Marbley properly determined
the loss to investors as $2.89 billion, even though prosecutors
had said once to jurors that the loss was only &#8220;over $2
billion.&#8221; 
Poulsen&#8217;s attorneys William Terpening and Peter Anderson
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment on the ruling. 
Poulsen&#8217;s 30-year term for the fraud case is concurrent
with his earlier 10-year term for the obstruction case. 
The appeals are U.S. v. Poulsen, 08-4218 and 09-3658, 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Cincinnati).

Drimal Should Get 70- to 80-Month Prison Term, U.S. Says 
Craig Drimal, the former Galleon Group LLC trader who
pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges, should get a prison
term of 70 to 80 months, which is within federal sentencing
guidelines, the U.S. said in a memo. 
Drimal pleaded guilty last month in federal court in New
York charges of conspiracy and securities fraud. Drimal admitted
that he and others at Galleon traded on inside information
obtained from lawyers working on transactions involving 3Com
Corp. and Axcan Pharma Inc. in 2007. Drimal said the information
was obtained from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, lawyers at
Boston-based Ropes  Gray LLP. 
Drimal has suggested that the court impose community
service or home confinement in lieu of a &#8220;substantial&#8221; prison
term, prosecutors said. The request should be denied in order to
send a &#8220;strong message of deterrence to others in the hedge
fund community&#8221; and because the &#8220;nature and extent of his
criminal conduct doesn&#8217;t warrant community service,&#8221;
prosecutors said. 
Drimal is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan on Aug. 31. Drimal&#8217;s attorney, Jane Anne
Murray, said she filed a memorandum last week asking the judge
to impose a sentence below the federal guidelines. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not surprised by their position; it&#8217;s been
consistent,&#8221; Murray said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We
disagree with the government on a number of issues including the
applicable guidelines. And we&#8217;re seeking a sentence that is
substantially lower than the one the government is seeking.&#8221; 
Prosecutors also asked the court to obtain a judgment
against Drimal to recover the amount of the proceeds of his
crimes, which they said are at least $7 million. 
The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Courts 
Fuld, Lehman Executives to Settle Lawsuit for $90 Million 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) executives including former
Chairman Richard Fuld will settle an investor lawsuit using a
$90 million payment from the defunct firm&#8217;s insurers, according
to a court filing. 
The investors blamed Lehman officers and directors for
losses on Lehman stock and options from June 12, 2007, to Sept.
15, 2008, according to the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. Fuld, 65, was chief executive officer of New York-
based Lehman, once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank,
before its 2008 bankruptcy. 
A bankruptcy examiner said Lehman foundered because of too
much debt, which it tried to hide from investors, and risky real
estate investments. 
Patricia Hynes, a lawyer for Fuld, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. 
Lehman said in November that Fuld would get $10 million
from insurers as part of an officers-and-directors program
paying for the costs of lawsuits. It also said insurers would be
asked to pay as much as $90 million in costs for unidentified
defendants in civil, criminal and regulatory proceedings. 
Lehman has asked the judge to modify bankruptcy law on nine
previous occasions to tap its directors-and-officers insurance,
according to the Aug. 24 filing. 
The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
New Suits 
Bank of America Depressed Libor Rates, Schwab Says in Suit 
Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), the largest independent brokerage by
client assets, sued Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
other banks claiming they manipulated the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, starting in 2007 in violation of U.S.
antitrust law. 
The lawsuit filed Aug. 23 in federal court in San
Francisco, where Schwab is based, claims the banks conspired to
depress Libor rates by understating their borrowing costs,
thereby lowering their interest expenses on products tied to the
rates. The banks &#8220;reaped hundreds of millions, if not billions,
of dollars in ill-gotten gains,&#8221; Schwab wrote. 
In separate suits in April, three European asset-management
firms and the Carpenters Pension Fund of West Virginia sued the
banks claiming they manipulated Libor. U.S. and U.K. officials
are cooperating in a probe of possible Libor manipulation, a
person close to the investigation said in March. 
The Schwab suit seeks unspecified damages, which may be
tripled under antitrust law. It also includes claims for
racketeering and securities fraud. 
Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls for comment. 
The case is Schwab Money Market Fund v. Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-4186, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). 
Guaranty Financial Trustee Suit Accuses KBW of Short Sales 
The liquidation trustee for Guaranty Financial Group Inc. (GFGFQ)
sued KBW Inc. (KBW), claiming that the investment bank used inside
information about the Texas lender to short its stock before KBW
collapsed. 
Kenneth Tepper, the trustee, is seeking to recover $20
million in fees KBW obtained as Guaranty Financial&#8217;s investment
banker, profit it received from betting against the company&#8217;s
shares and other damages, according to a suit filed Aug. 24 in
New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
&#8220;KBW&#8217;s disregard of its contractual obligations and
illegal and improper use of GFG&#8217;s and the bank&#8217;s material, non-
public, confidential, inside information undermined GFG&#8217;s
efforts to raise capital, one of the very purposes for which KBW
had been engaged,&#8221; Tepper alleged. 
Guaranty Financial, based in Austin, Texas, filed for
bankruptcy protection in 2009. 
Krista Eccleston, a spokeswoman for New York-based KBW,
declined to comment. 
The trustee on Aug. 22 sued cardboard-box maker Temple-
Inland Inc., which spun off Guaranty Financial in 2007. 
The case is Tepper v. Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc.,
652349-2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is waiving some late fees for
customers affected by Hurricane Irene. 
JPMorgan won&#8217;t charge people in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut for late payments of credit cards, business and
consumer loans, or overdraft-related fees from today through
Sept. 4, according to an e-mail sent to customers by the New
York-based bank. The message was sent to millions of people this
morning, said spokesman Thomas Kelly. 
The bank also will waive early withdrawal fees on
certificates of deposit &#8220;to help customers with their cash
flow&#8221; if needed, according to the e-mail. It won&#8217;t charge
consumers for using another bank&#8217;s automated teller machine and
will extend hours at branches in affected areas this week, the
e-mail said. 
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the largest U.S. bank, will help
customers facing financial hardship on a case-by-case basis,
Kelli Raulerson, a spokeswoman for the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based company, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Mobile ATM units
are being deployed to support customers where most significant
needs exist due to storm impacts,&#8221; Raulerson said. 
Citigroup Inc. (C) offers different financial recovery
assistance options and the bank will work with customers
depending on individual circumstances, said Sean Kevelighan, a
spokesman for the New York-based bank.

Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) will waive fees for customers in New

use another bank&#8217;s ATM, according to an e-mail from Kevin
Friedlander, a spokesman. Customers of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan
may incur fees from the other banks operating the ATMs. Wells
Fargo, based in San Francisco, also won&#8217;t charge early
withdrawal fees on CDs, Friedlander said. 
The average ATM fee charged by a bank for going outside its
network is $1.41, according to Greg McBride, senior financial

surcharge assessed by the bank operating the ATM on non-
accountholders is $2.33, McBride said in an e-mail. 
Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) is encouraging its customers
affected by the hurricane to reach out in person at a branch,

McLean, Virginia-based lender, said in an e-mail. 
&#8220;We have policies in place to assist those customers on a

Rouse Properties Inc., the mall
owner that will be spun off from General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP),
plans to spend $230 million on improvements to its malls through
2015 as rents and occupancies fall. 
Rouse expects the investment will lift its occupancy rate
to 93 percent and annual net operating income to more than $200
million, the Chicago-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. The occupancy rate was 87.7 percent at the end of June,
down from 88.2 percent at the end of 2010. Average rent fell to
$39.09 a square foot from $39.74. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, said Aug. 1 it planned a spinoff of 30 malls to
shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse. General Growth
spent $11.3 billion to buy commercial-property developer Rouse
Co. in 2004. 
&#8220;Our mission is to own and manage dominant Class B
regional malls in secondary and tertiary markets, and to
reposition Class B regional malls in primary markets,&#8221; Rouse
said in the filing. &#8220;We plan to increase the value of our
properties by executing tailored business plans designed to
improve their operating performance.&#8221; 
Some of the malls that will be included in the Rouse
portfolio need to be redeveloped to attract tenants, according
to the filing. Some are in one-mall markets in smaller U.S.
cities.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG are among 13 financial institutions
that submitted bids to advise Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial
Bank for Industry  Trade on its planned $500 million overseas
bond sale, according to Deputy General Director Le Duc Tho. 
Others that sent in bids include HSBC Holdings Plc,
Standard Chartered Plc, Australia  New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. and BNP Paribas SA, Tho said in a telephone interview
today. 
The sale would be the first international offering of
Vietnamese notes this year and will test investor confidence in
the country, which has struggled to damp Asia&#8217;s fastest
inflation as its currency slid to the worst-performing in Asia. 
&#8220;They need a good, recognizable name to help them with the
bond sale,&#8221; said Francois Chavasseau, Ho Chi Minh City-based
head of fixed income research at Sacombank Securities Joint
Stock Co. &#8220;Vietnam is still viewed as quite a risky place at
the moment by foreign investors. Whether a big name will be
enough to win more confidence, I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221; 
The country&#8217;s second-largest listed lender by market value,
commonly known as VietinBank, has sought approval from the
country&#8217;s central bank to sell $500 million of bonds overseas
later this year, Tho said earlier this month. The sale would be
the first of dollar-denominated notes for the bank, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Non-Performing Loans 
Vietnam&#8217;s banking system is weak and non-performing loans
are &#8220;heavily understated&#8221; in official data, Fitch Ratings said
in an Aug. 8 note. The extra yield investors demand to own
dollar debt sold by Vietnam instead of similar-maturity
Treasuries has risen 110 basis points this quarter to 445 basis
points, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Asia Credit Index. 
VietinBank is rated at B by Fitch, the fifth-highest non-
investment grade rating, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Tho said in May the lender planned to sell between
$500 million and $1 billion of bonds late in the third quarter
or early in the fourth quarter of the year. It opted for a lower
amount after reassessing its financial needs and due to global
market conditions, Tho said Aug. 22. 
The lender&#8217;s shares gained 2 percent to 25,900 dong at
close on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange today. The dong,
has slid 6.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was devalued by about 7 percent in February, the
most since at least 1993. 
Vietnam&#8217;s inflation accelerated to 23 percent this month,
the highest rate among 17 Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg. 
VietinBank has the equivalent of $374 million of bonds and
loans outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has replaced BP
Plc in a partnership with Russia&#8217;s OAO Rosneft to drill in the
Arctic, one of the last untapped oil frontiers in the world. 
In exchange for access to potentially billions of barrels
of crude in the Arctic Ocean, Exxon will grant Rosneft stakes in
Texas shale fields and deep-water projects in the Gulf of
Mexico, the companies said today in a statement. 
Exxon and Rosneft plan to spend an initial $3.2 billion
exploring Russia&#8217;s Arctic offshore and the Black Sea. In turn,
Rosneft may become the first major Russian oil producer to
develop U.S. deposits, gaining experience in deep-water and
shale oil. 
Russia is seeking access to more international technology
to help it exploit complex crude deposits in increasingly harsh
environments as traditional resources, such as western Siberian
fields, are declining. The Exxon agreement will help Rosneft
meet Putin&#8217;s challenge that Russian producers maintain the
country&#8217;s world-leading output of 10 million barrels a day for
at least a decade. 
Russia&#8217;s government will support the Exxon-Rosneft alliance
&#8220;in every way,&#8221; said Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who
presided over the deal today in Sochi on Russia&#8217;s Black Sea
coast. 
&#8216;Life Blood&#8217; 
Exxon beat out its biggest international oil rivals to win
a piece of the Russian Arctic. Exxon replaces BP Plc (BP/) as
Rosneft&#8217;s partner in the Arctic Kara Sea after the U.K.
explorer&#8217;s billionaire partners in the TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) venture
blocked the agreement this year. 
&#8220;Access to new resources is the life blood of oil
companies,&#8221; said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.
in New York. &#8220;Russia is one of the largest resources that&#8217;s
still available. It&#8217;s like Exxon is now dating the girlfriend BP
had a few months ago.&#8221; 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. also have said they
wanted to explore partnerships with Rosneft in the Arctic. 
The world&#8217;s biggest oil companies are competing for new
reserves as crude-rich countries shut out foreign operators and
the easiest-to-reach hydrocarbons are exhausted. 
Mark Salt, spokesman for London-based BP, declined to
comment on the agreement. 
100 Billion Barrels 
The three blocks in the Kara Sea fields that are part of
this agreement are about the size of the U.K. North Sea and may
hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according
to BP. 
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson attended the
signing with Neil Duffin, the company&#8217;s president for
development, and Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov. Duffin oversaw
Exxon&#8217;s deepwater Angolan projects, such as Kizomba, which have
been big some of the company&#8217;s biggest producers in the past
decade. 
&#8220;I take it as a strong statement of Russian intentions to
create competitive conditions to attract investments,&#8221;
Tillerson told reporters. 
The agreement allows Rosneft a chance to participate in
Exxon&#8217;s unconventional fields in the U.S., where oil and gas are
extracted by cracking open rocks with sand, water and chemicals.
The two companies said they&#8217;ll study the potential for similar
fields in western Siberia. 
Deep Pockets 
As one of the largest oil companies in the world, Exxon
brings experience and deep pockets to the alliance, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis who has a
&#8220;hold&#8221; on Exxon shares and owns none. 
&#8220;To partner up with a AAA-rated energy company makes sense
for Rosneft as they seek to diversify outside of Russia,&#8221;
Youngberg said. Credit agencies rate Exxon AAA, their highest
grade. 
Putin said the investment needed to develop all the fields
involved and associated infrastructure may reach as much as $500
billion. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s scary to utter such huge figures,&#8221; he said. Exxon,
based in Irving, Texas, will be a &#8220;reliable, strategic and good
partner,&#8221; he said. 
Exxon and Rosneft on Jan. 27 signed a preliminary accord
for a $1 billion exploration project in the Black Sea&#8217;s

Shell, Chevron 
Shell, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, was described by Putin
in May as a potential &#8220;comfortable partner&#8221; to replace BP in
the Kara Sea. Shell, which works with state-controlled OAO
Gazprom in Siberia and Sakhalin Island, agreed to further expand
cooperation with the gas producer in June. 
Chevron pulled out as Rosneft&#8217;s partner in the Val
Shatskogo exploration project in Russia&#8217;s Black Sea this year.
Chevron is &#8220;looking to partner with Rosneft on other
opportunities in the Arctic or elsewhere in Russia,&#8221; said Kurt
Glaubitz, a company spokesman.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, will spend as much as $76.3 million to explore and
develop shale oil and natural gas in Argentina with Americas
Petrogas Inc. (BOE) 
Exxon will gain a 45 percent stake in Americas Petrogas&#8217;s
Los Toldos blocks, which cover 163,500 acres in the Neuquen
Basin, Calgary-based Americas Petrogas said in a statement
today. 
Americas Petrogas plans to drill a well in the fourth
quarter at its blocks, targeting the unconventional Vaca Muerta
formation, which may hold as much as 240 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. 
&#8220;We believe the next major shale development outside of
North America will be in the Neuquen Basin,&#8221; Guimar Vaca Coca,
managing director for Americas Petrogas in Argentina, said in
the statement. 
Vaca Muerta has characteristics similar to reservoirs such
as the Eagle Ford and Haynesville formations in North America,
the company said. YPF SA, Argentina&#8217;s largest crude producer,
announced in May it discovered the nation&#8217;s biggest oil find in
two decades at Vaca Muerta. 
&#8220;From a geological resource point of view, I think
Argentina&#8217;s future is positive,&#8221; Jorge Pinon, a research fellow
at Florida International University in Miami, said in a
telephone interview. 
Regulatory uncertainty and a lack of continuity in fiscal
terms and conditions are larger concerns for foreign oil
companies working in Argentina, said Pinon. 
Looking For Niches 
&#8220;I think some of the major oil companies are looking for
niche areas in which they can position themselves to take
advantage of future opportunities,&#8221; he said. 
Exxon will have more than 310,000 net acres in the Neuquen
Basin following its deal with Americas Petrogas, Patrick McGinn,
a spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an
interview. 
Americas Petrogas climbed 40 cents, or 24 percent, to
C$2.10 on the TSX Venture Exchange, Canada&#8217;s junior stock
exchange, at 3:59 p.m. Exxon fell 21 cents to $73.91 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m.

develop a wind turbine that generates as much as six times more
power than its largest land-based model. 
GE Global Research plans to spend $3 million from the U.S.

will generate as much as 15 megawatts using superconducting
magnets and lightweight materials, Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE said today in a statement.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it would

video-game system. 
Datel redesigned its controllers and stopped importing
versions known as TurboFire2 Xbox 360 Wireless that were at the

Commission in Washington, Microsoft said in a filing yesterday
that sought to withdraw the case. The software maker said it
still will pursue cash compensation for past infringement
through a civil lawsuit lodged against Datel last year. 
&#8220;Datel&#8217;s voluntary exclusion of the accused products from

claiming the company seeks to monopolize the markets for

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) formed an alliance
with OAO Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil producer, to drill from
the Texas plains and Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. 
Exxon and Rosneft plan to spend an initial $3.2 billion
exploring Russia&#8217;s Arctic offshore and the Black Sea, the
companies said today in a statement. In turn, Rosneft may become
the first major Russian oil producer to develop U.S. deposits,
gaining experience in deep-water and shale oil. 
Exxon replaces BP Plc (BP/) as Rosneft&#8217;s partner at three blocks
in the arctic Kara Sea after the U.K. explorer&#8217;s billionaire
partners in the TNK-BP venture blocked that agreement this year.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who presided over the Exxon deal
today in Sochi on Russia&#8217;s Black Sea coast, said it may generate
as much as $500 billion of investments. 
&#8220;Access to new resources is the life blood of oil
companies,&#8221; said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.
in New York. &#8220;Russia is one of the largest resources that&#8217;s
still available. It&#8217;s like Exxon is now dating the girlfriend BP
had a few months ago.&#8221; 
The world&#8217;s biggest oil companies are competing for new oil
and gas reserves as countries such as Saudi Arabia shut out
foreign operators and the easiest-to-reach hydrocarbons are
exhausted. The Kara Sea fields are about the size of the U.K.
North Sea and may hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil
equivalent, according to BP. 
London-based BP spokesman Mark Salt declined to comment on
the deal. 
Reliable Partner 
Russia&#8217;s government will support the Exxon-Rosneft alliance
&#8220;in every way,&#8221; Putin said. The Texas-based company will be
a &#8220;reliable, strategic and good partner.&#8221; 
The agreement allows Rosneft a chance to participate in
Exxon&#8217;s unconventional fields in the U.S., where oil and gas are
extracted by grinding rocks with sand, water and chemicals. The
two companies said they&#8217;ll study similar fields in western
Siberia. 
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson attended the
signing between Neil Duffin, the company&#8217;s president for
development, and Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov. 
&#8220;I take it as a strong statement of Russian intentions to
create competitive conditions to attract investments,&#8221;
Tillerson told reporters. 
&#8216;Scary&#8217; $500 Billion 
Putin said the investment need to develop all the fields
involved may reach as much as $500 billion once all the
associated infrastructure is built. &#8220;It&#8217;s scary to utter such
huge figures,&#8221; he said. 
Exxon and Rosneft on Jan. 27 signed a preliminary accord
for a $1 billion exploration project in the Black Sea&#8217;s
deepwater Tuapse Trough. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, may
have let the opportunity slide, after Putin said in May that it
would be a &#8220;comfortable partner&#8221; to replace BP in the Kara
Sea. Shell, which works with state-controlled OAO Gazprom in
Siberia and Sakhalin Island, agreed to further expand
cooperation with the gas producer in June.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stands to lose
its top spot among takeover advisers this year if ATT Inc. (T)
isn&#8217;t able to complete its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., the biggest deal of 2011. 
A collapse would move Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) into the No.
1 ranking with $346.8 billion in deals this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan has $341.5 billion,
excluding the ATT transaction, the data show. 
ATT said today it will &#8220;vigorously contest&#8221; the U.S.
government&#8217;s lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition of T-
Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom AG. If those efforts fail,
ATT&#8217;s advisers, JPMorgan, Greenhill  Co. and Evercore Partners
Inc. (EVR), aren&#8217;t likely to get any significant fees for their work,
according to estimates by New York-based research firm Freeman 
Co. 
Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s advisers, Morgan Stanley (MS), Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Citigroup Inc., may have to share
as little as $7 million to $9 million, or about one-tenth of an
original $70 million to $90 million in estimated fees, said Lam Nguyen, a Freeman vice president. It&#8217;s also possible, though
unlikely, that the Deutsche Telekom advisers could collect as
much as $60 million, or 1 percent of the estimated value of a $6
billion reverse breakup fee, Nguyen said. 
JPMorgan, Greenhill and Evercore would get $60 million to
$80 million in fees only if ATT is able to proceed with the
purchase, according to Nguyen. JPMorgan and other lenders are
still getting $20 million from committing to provide ATT a $20
billion loan to finance the purchase, Nguyen said. 
Spokesmen for the banks advising Dallas-based ATT and
Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom declined to comment. 
Greenhill Falls 
Greenhill, which draws most of its revenue from providing
advice, fell 3.5 percent to $35.53 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the day&#8217;s worst performance in
the 75-company Standard and Poor&#8217;s Midcap Financials Index.
Evercore gained 1.6 percent to $26.23. 
Goldman Sachs had been an adviser to Sprint Nextel Corp.,
which had been in talks to buy T-Mobile USA before ATT agreed
to a takeover, people familiar with the matter said in March.
The New York-based bank held the top spot in global MA advisory
every year from 2001 to 2008, Bloomberg data show. 
Excluding transfers of government assets, the ATT deal is
the largest takeover proposed anywhere in the world since BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company, offered $40
billion for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan last August. BHP&#8217;s bid
was blocked by the Canadian government.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said it won a $96 million judgment against
Ecuador in an international arbitration case stemming from a
1990s oil-export dispute with the Latin American nation. 
The ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The
Hague resolved seven commercial claims over crude sales by the
Ecuadorian government from 1991 to 1993 from wells operated by
Texaco Inc., Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said today in a telephone interview. 
Ecuador overstated domestic crude demand to boost its share
of production from the Texaco-operated wells, and then sold the
oil on the international market, depriving Texaco of profits,
Robertson said. Texaco was acquired by Chevron in 2001. 
&#8220;Ecuador rejects the final sentence given by the
arbitration court and considers that it has no legal validity
and represents a grave injustice,&#8221; Diego Garcia, Ecuador&#8217;s
attorney general, said today to reporters in Quito. 
Garcia said the panel didn&#8217;t have jurisdiction to decide
the case because a bilateral investment treaty between the U.S.
and Ecuador wasn&#8217;t in effect when Texaco quit the country. 
Ecuador plans to ask a district court in the Netherlands
within 90 days to invalidate the arbitration ruling, Garcia said.
Ecuador is prepared to appeal the case all the way to the
Netherlands&#8217;s highest court, he said. 
In a separate case, Chevron is awaiting a ruling from the
Permanent Court of Arbitration on whether it&#8217;s liable for
environmental damage in Ecuador&#8217;s Amazon River basin. The
company was ordered in February by an Ecuadorian court to pay
$18 billion in damages and penalties for chemical-laden
wastewater dumped in the river when Texaco operated there from
1964 to 1992.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s

from its XTO Energy unit for $182.5 million to Dynamic Offshore
Resources LLC. 
The XTO assets, located in the Gulf of Mexico, will add the

Dynamic said in an e-mailed statement today. Dynamic, a closely
held oil explorer backed by Riverstone Holdings LLC, filed a
prospectus last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for an initial share sale. 
The properties produce the equivalent of 7,000 barrels of

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, settled a patent-infringement lawsuit with the Indian
generic-drug maker Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd. over the
cholesterol treatment Lipitor. The terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
Pfizer, based in New York, sued Dr. Reddy&#8217;s in December
2009 to block generic copies of Lipitor from coming out before
Pfizer&#8217;s patent for the tablets expires in 2017. The companies
settled on Aug. 19, and U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark in
Wilmington, Delaware, dismissed the case Aug. 29, according to
court records. 
&#8220;We have closed our litigation with Pfizer, but the date
of entry into the market is not yet confirmed,&#8221; Kedar Upadhye,
a spokesman for Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, said in a statement. 
Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, of Hyderabad, India, announced the settlement
today in a statement. The agreement is subject to review by the
U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, the
company said. 
&#8220;We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with Dr.
Reddy&#8217;s regarding a patent case involving Lipitor,&#8221; Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Terms
of the agreement are confidential.&#8221; 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Mylan Inc. also
have reached settlements with Pfizer to sell generic forms of
Lipitor, known chemically as atorvastatin. 
Ranbaxy Plans 
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY), the first company to seek
regulatory approval for its version, had planned to enter the
market on Nov. 30 -- with Teva, Mylan and other generic makers
beginning sales six months later as part of its deal with
Pfizer. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigation into
quality standards at two Ranbaxy plans and a federal probe of
its testing practices have delayed approval. 
Analysts including Edward J. Kelly of Credit Suisse AG have
said that Ranbaxy may have to sell its rights to be the only
approved generic on the market if it can&#8217;t pass regulatory
muster by November. 
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) has a separate agreement with
Pfizer that would let it sell Lipitor without the brand label as
a so-called authorized generic beginning Nov. 30. The Watson-
sold drug doesn&#8217;t require FDA approval and wouldn&#8217;t be affected
by the Ranbaxy deal.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OAO Rosneft,
Russia&#8217;s biggest oil producer, will announce joint international
projects by early next year, an official for the Moscow-based
company said today during a conference call. 
&#8220;We will be entering on friendly terms, on a non-
discriminatory basis,&#8221; Ruslan Svirshchevsky, Rosneft&#8217;s head of
business development, said on a conference call with investors
today. &#8220;We will complement our reserve base by quite
significant number.&#8221; 
Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest company by market value, and
state-run Rosneft yesterday agreed on an alliance that would
give the U.S. company access to Russia&#8217;s Arctic resources by
exploring three blocks in the Kara Sea, while allowing Rosneft
to gain experience in deep-water and tight oil deposits in the
U.S. and other areas. 
Rosneft and Exxon agreed to get access to &#8220;several select
high-quality exploration and production opportunities&#8221; in the
U.S., Canada and other countries, Svirshchevsky said, declining
to identify any projects. These include areas in the Gulf of
Mexico and onshore Texas, deep-water and tight oil fields, and
some projects are in the development stage, he said. 
&#8220;It was one of the aspects why the proposals from Exxon
Mobil was especially attractive to us,&#8221; Svirshchevsky said.
Exxon&#8217;s Hibernia project was listed in a presentation on
Rosneft&#8217;s website today. The Kommersant newspaper reported
earlier today that Rosneft may enter that development. 
BP Deal Collapsed 
Rosneft&#8217;s original plan to develop its Kara Sea blocks in
the Arctic with BP Plc collapsed after the British oil
producer&#8217;s local billionaire partners blocked the deal, which
also involved a $7.8 billion share swap. 
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland described
the deal, which she valued at $3.2 billion, as &#8220;another example
of the expanding relationship&#8221; between the U.S. and Russia.
Nuland said that President Barack Obama and President Dmitri Medvedev have been working on broadening economic and trade
ties. 
She declined to comment on whether the deal would draw
scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States, the inter-agency government group that reviews
transactions that may affect U.S. national security.

Human behavior is increasing the
frequency and severity of natural disasters, according to
Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying Hurricane Irene is an example of that, but
I am saying that when you look around the planet, every month
you are seeing more shocks, more frequently, more severe than at
any time in modern history,&#8221; Sachs said in a &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; radio interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.
&#8220;We are definitely in the midst of human-made natural
disasters.&#8221; 
Hurricane Irene killed at least 40 people as it moved from
the Caribbean through New England, left an estimated $2.6
billion in damage and cut power to almost 8 million homes and
businesses along the U.S. East Coast. Tropical Storm Katia,
about 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) from the southernmost Cape
Verde Islands, may be declared a hurricane later today,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. 
&#8220;Can one say that Katrina, or Irene or the massive floods
in Pakistan or drought in the horn of Africa are examples in
that instance of the long-term human induced change?&#8221; Sachs
said. &#8220;That is extremely difficult but on occasion it can be
done because the event is so extreme that one can say with a
very high assurance that that is human induced -- like the
massive heat waves that hit Europe a few years ago.&#8221; 
Prices of raw materials will not spur investors to finding
alternatives to commodities that cause climate change, said
Sachs, the director of Columbia&#8217;s Earth Institute and the
Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development at the New York-
based university. 
&#8216;Odd Reality&#8217; 
&#8220;We have the odd reality that we can dig up enough coal or
shale gas to wreck the planet before price scarcity itself is
going to choke this off,&#8221; Sachs said. &#8220;So we&#8217;re going to have
to make real, conscience choices rather than letting the market
itself decide.&#8221; 
The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm
of the U.S. Energy Department, estimates global coal reserves at
909 billion tons, a 129 year supply. Benchmark European coal
prices rose 50 cents or 0.4 percent, to $129.50 a metric ton
today in London. The five-year average price is $100.48 per
metric ton. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve transitioned globally into a human-led environment
where human&#8217;s effects on carbon flows, energy flows, water flows
are so dominant now that we have changed the probability
distribution of when extreme droughts or hurricanes or heat
waves are hitting the planet,&#8221; he said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), federal
regulators and investors are seeking more information about Bank
of America Corp.&#8217;s effort to resolve mortgage liabilities with
an $8.5 billion settlement. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Housing
Finance Agency, Goldman Sachs and pension funds are among those
who have objected to the agreement, saying they don&#8217;t have
sufficient information to evaluate the deal. 
Goldman Sachs can&#8217;t determine whether &#8220;all investors who
are similarly situated will be treated equally&#8221; under the
settlement, the company said in a court filing late yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. A group of homeowners separately
sued Bank of America in federal court, seeking to block the
accord, claiming terms related to the servicing of mortgage
loans will accelerate home foreclosures. 
The objections create more obstacles for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America as it seeks court approval for
the settlement to resolve claims from investors in Countrywide
Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. It acquired Countrywide in 2008. 
The deal was negotiated with a group of institutional
investors, including BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment
Management Co., and would apply to investors outside that group. 
The Trustee 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the trustee for the
mortgage-securitization trusts covered by the agreement, asked a
New York state judge to approve the settlement. A hearing on the
matter was initially scheduled for November. New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman asked the judge to reject the accord
and said in court papers that he has potential claims against
Bank of America. An investor group is seeking to move the case
to federal court. 
&#8220;We believe that the trustee acted reasonably in entering
into the settlement, and that there are compelling reasons why
the agreement should receive judicial approval.&#8221; Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said in an e-mail. He
declined to comment on the homeowner lawsuit. BNY Mellon
spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment on the objections. 
The agreement, which must be approved by a judge, is
important for Bank of America to put its mortgage liabilities
behind it, Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said
in an interview. 
&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a possibility it gets thrown out,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know to handicap that.&#8221; 
Filed Objections 
Those filing objections include American International
Group Inc. (AIG), the Federal Home Loan Banks of Boston, Chicago and
San Francisco, the Maine State Retirement System, and the
National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency that is
the liquidating agent for five corporate credit unions. 
&#8220;Investors are unable to evaluate the fairness of the
allocation of the settlement proceeds,&#8221; the Maine retirement
system said. 
The FDIC, the receiver for failed banks, said it owns
securities covered by the settlement. Andrew Gray, an FDIC
spokesman, said in an e-mail that the filing is a notice to
preserve its right to make claims as a part of the settlement
and seeks additional information. 
&#8220;It is not an evaluation or opinion on the settlement
itself,&#8221; he said. 
The FHFA, which regulates mortgage finance companies Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, said in a statement that it was also
seeking more information and &#8220;is aware of no basis upon which
it would raise a substantive objection to the proposed
settlement at this time.&#8221; 
Federal Judge 
Yesterday, Nevada asked a federal judge in Reno to
terminate an earlier settlement with Bank of America which
involved home-loan modifications tied to its Countrywide unit,
saying the company hasn&#8217;t complied with terms of the accord. 
Bank of America increased consumer interest rates and
monthly payments in violation of a consent decree and required
homeowners to provide extensive documentation to qualify for
modifications even though the settlement calls for a
&#8220;streamlined&#8221; approach, the state said yesterday in a
statement. 
The state is seeking to file an amended complaint against
the bank with additional claims. 
&#8220;After two and a half years of lost implementation -- of
borrowers denied modifications, discouraged by repeated and
futile efforts to obtain help, or already subject to foreclosure
-- the state no longer can get the benefit of its original
settlement with defendants,&#8221; Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said yesterday. 
The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The homeowner lawsuit is Iesu v. Bank of New York
Mellon, 11-6078, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The Nevada case is State of Nevada v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-00135, U.S. District Court, District of
Nevada (Reno).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay future Federal Reserve penalties and write down $53 million
of mortgage loans in New York to gain approval for its sale of
Litton Loan Servicing LP. 
The Fed ordered Goldman Sachs to conduct an independent
review of Litton&#8217;s foreclosures in 2009 and 2010 to address a
&#8220;pattern of misconduct and negligence,&#8221; the regulator said
today in a statement. Litton&#8217;s sale to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) was
completed today after reaching accords with the Fed and New York
state regulators, according to a Goldman Sachs statement. 
Goldman Sachs leaves mortgage servicing after Litton was
accused of robo-signing, in which foreclosure documents are
signed by company officials who vouch for their accuracy without
personally verifying the contents. The practice raised concern
that some borrowers may have been wrongfully evicted and
triggered calls for more staffing and oversight. 
&#8220;Our agreement sets a new higher standard for the
residential mortgage-servicing industry, whose troubling
foreclosure and servicing practices we have been investigating
along with other regulators across the country,&#8221; Benjamin Lawsky, superintendant at the New York State Department of
Financial Services, said in a statement. 
Mortgage servicers send out bills, collect payments and
handle foreclosures. New York-based Goldman Sachs acquired
Houston-based Litton with 1,000 employees in 2007, took a
writedown of about $200 million earlier this year and agreed in
June to sell the unit to Ocwen for $263.7 million. The value of
mortgage servicing companies has been eroded as record U.S.
foreclosures and delinquencies drove up costs. 
Review Findings 
Ocwen, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, will also pay
about $337.4 million to retire some of Litton&#8217;s debt. 
Goldman Sachs agreed to provide the Fed with findings of
the independent review as well as its plans to reimburse
customers for fees or losses stemming from improper
foreclosures, according to the settlement. The firm also agreed
to improve compliance and borrower communications should it re-
enter the business. 
&#8220;The review is intended to provide remediation to
borrowers who suffered financial injury as a result of wrongful
foreclosures or other deficiencies identified in a review of the
foreclosure process,&#8221; according to the Fed&#8217;s statement. 
Future Penalties 
Goldman Sachs also agreed to pay any penalty the Fed
imposes on Litton based on today&#8217;s enforcement action. The
regulator said it plans penalties for Litton as well as other
large servicers, including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), which received enforcement actions in April. 
Attorneys general from all 50 states last year announced
their investigation into bank foreclosure practices after
reports that faulty or manufactured documents were being used to
seize homes. Since then, a group of attorneys general and
officials from federal agencies, including the Justice
Department, have been negotiating a settlement with the nation&#8217;s
five largest mortgage servicers. 
The New York agreement requires the companies to withdraw
pending foreclosures with robo-signed affidavits and compensate
borrowers whose homes were wrongfully foreclosed, according to
the statement. The $53 million represents 25 percent of unpaid
principal for all 60-day delinquent home loans serviced by
Litton. 
Ocwen is getting a portfolio of loans with about $41.2
billion in unpaid principal balance as of March 31, most of them
non-prime home mortgages, according to a June filing. 
Possible Pattern 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s agreement to reduce unpaid principal in the
New York accord is &#8220;the most specific we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; said Guy
Cecala, publisher of Bethesda, Maryland-based trade publication
Inside Mortgage Finance. While the need for sale approval and
small size of Litton may limit the comparability with other
potential settlements, the deal may give some insight to how
future deals could be structured, he said. 
&#8220;In Goldman&#8217;s case, this is a cost of doing business in
terms of getting this deal done,&#8221; Cecala said. &#8220;This is a
blueprint for what the states are looking for: potentially some
lump sum that they can use to help out borrowers who are in
trouble, regardless of whether or not they&#8217;ve suffered any
foreclosure abuse.&#8221;

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said its Windows
Phone operating system may capture more than 20 percent of the
smartphone market over the next two to three years with the help
of hardware manufacturers and increased marketing efforts. 
Forecasts by researchers Gartner and IDC, which expects a
market share of about 20 percent in 2015, are conservative, said
Achim Berg, head of Windows Phone marketing, in Berlin today. 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, is betting
that Windows Phone will retake market share lost to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iPhone and handsets running Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software. The
company will start offering the enhanced &#8220;Mango&#8221; version of
its operating system, with functions including better social-
media offerings, for the first time in Europe on two HTC Corp.
phones, set to go on sale by Oct. 1. 
HTC and other partners will run advertisement campaigns for
the Titan and Radar phones, and the company has joined Microsoft
in training &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of salesmen worldwide to better
demonstrate the product, Berg said at the IFA consumer
electronics fair. Microsoft plans to build on Windows Phone&#8217;s
initial success with female consumers as well as with young and
first-time users to win market share, he said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing an extremely positive response&#8221; to the
Windows Mobile system, HTC&#8217;s President for Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, Florian Seiche, said in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re
now thinking that this year is a great time to get that momentum
accelerated, to reach out to a broader group of customers.&#8221; 
The Titan, which has an 8-megapixel camera with dual-led
flash and a wide-angle lens, will sell for 599 euros ($855),
while the Radar costs 399 euros. HTC is in talks with retailer
and operators, Seiche said, adding that the phones will be
broadly available in Europe. 
New Functions 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, announced Windows
Phone in February 2010, jettisoning an earlier system called
Windows Mobile. The newest version, announced in May, adds more
functions such as face detection in photos, extended voice
recognition for writing, and support for 15 additional European
and Asian languages. Mango also lets users synchronize Microsoft
Office documents with cloud versions in Microsoft&#8217;s Office 365
and SkyDrive, and improves integration with corporate
directories and e-mail systems. 
Nokia Oyj, the world&#8217;s biggest mobile-phone maker by
volume, adopted Windows Phone 7 as its primary smartphone
platform in February, saying that it will give the Finnish phone
company and its developers more opportunities to produce
distinctive products than Google&#8217;s Android, which was also
considered. Microsoft on May 24 announced handset agreements
with Acer Inc., Fujitsu Ltd. and ZTE Corp., as well as 500
features to be added in the fall release of Windows Phone 7. 
&#8216;It Takes Times&#8217; 
&#8220;This is a completely new platform, it takes time,&#8221; said
Berg. &#8220;It took time with Android, it took time with Apple. We
have to show that we&#8217;re very capable and that we have the
fastest and easiest phone.&#8221; 
In April, Gartner forecast that the Android operating
system will have the largest smartphone market share during the
next four years, rising from 23 percent in 2010 to 49 percent in
2015. Apple&#8217;s iOS is predicted to grow from 16 percent to 17
percent, while Microsoft&#8217;s share will go from 4.2 percent in
2010 to 19.5 percent in 2015. IDC in June predicted that
Microsoft may hold a 20.3 percent market share in 2015. 
Windows Phone&#8217;s base of application developers will also
increase following Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)&#8217;s decision to stop
selling devices with its WebOS software, Berg said. Hewlett-
Packard said last month that it&#8217;s considering licensing or
selling off WebOS, which it acquired in its purchase of Palm
Inc. last year. 
Third-party applications helped make Apple&#8217;s iPhone the
most profitable smartphone as users flocked to a handset with a
slick touch screen and an online store that has grown to more
than 425,000 games and other programs. Google&#8217;s Android system,
supported by dozens of manufacturers, also lured developers and
became the best-selling smartphone system this year.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was sued by a mobile
phone user claiming the company illegally tracks location
information from mobile devices in violation of state and
federal privacy laws. 
The company has designed its mobile operating software
Windows Phone 7 to track users&#8217; location deceptively even after
users choose to disable the feature, according to a complaint
filed in federal court in Seattle today. The software is in
mobile devices made by Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp. (2498) and LG
Electronics Inc. (066570), and transfers the location data to company
server computers, the complaint shows. 
Michigan resident Rebecca Cousineau filed the lawsuit on
behalf of tens of thousands of consumers who use phones with the
Microsoft software and had their location data tracked after
they disabled the feature. The complaint seeks a court order
barring the company from tracking users&#8217; phone locations, $1,000
for each violation, and unspecified punitive damages. 
Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment about the lawsuit. 
The case is Cousineau v. Microsoft, 11-1438, U.S. District
Court, District of Washington (Seattle).

Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said the slow pace of hiring recently in the U.S. led them
to cut their August payroll forecast to a 25,000 gain. 
The new estimate is down from a prior projection of a
50,000 increase, the economists said. Their forecast for the
unemployment rate was unchanged at 9.1 percent. 
&#8220;The main reason is the accumulation of evidence of weak
hiring in late July and August,&#8221; the economists, led by Jan Hatzius, wrote in a note to clients today. &#8220;The recent pickup
in layoff announcements is a concern.&#8221; 
Among the reports citing weak employment figures are the
Conference Board&#8217;s consumer confidence survey and its separate
gauge of online help-wanted advertising for August, yesterday&#8217;s
ADP Employer Services report that measures private payroll data
and today&#8217;s employment component in the Institute for Supply
Management&#8217;s factory index, the New York-based economists wrote. 
The cut in the payrolls forecast contrasts with Moody&#8217;s
Analytics Inc. economists, who raised their estimate today to an
increase of 50,000 from a previous projection of a 30,000 gain.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has agreed to buy Algorithmics, a supplier of risk
analytics software, for $387 million. 
The purchase will add 900 employees to IBM&#8217;s team of more
than 8,000 consultants in the business analytics unit, Armonk,
New York-based IBM said in a statement today. Algorithmics,
based in Toronto, is a member of Fitch Group, which is majority
owned by Paris-based holding company Fimalac (FIM) SA. 
IBM said its analytics offerings are backed by more than
$14 billion spent on acquisitions in the past five years,
including OpenPages Inc., a maker of compliance and risk
management systems. IBM has forecast its business analytics and
optimization activities will reach $16 billion in revenue by
2015 as companies sift their data for insights. Chief Executive
Officer Sam Palmisano last year said he would spend $20 billion
on acquisitions within five years. 
&#8220;Combining Algorithmics&#8217; expertise with IBM&#8217;s deep
analytics portfolio will allow clients to take a more holistic
approach to managing risk and responding to economic change
across their enterprises,&#8221; said Rob Ashe, IBM&#8217;s general manager
of business analytics.

Executives from Morgan Stanley and
Catalyst Capital Investors are among new members of an advisory
panel for the Climate Bonds Initiative, formed to help put
together a new $300-million bond by an unspecified issuer. 
The new bond, issued in Australian dollars, will probably
be a refinancing of a group of wind-energy loans and will use a
standard being established by the London-based Climate Bonds
Initiative, said Sean Kidney, chairman of the initiative. He
declined to be more specific because the bond was not yet public
knowledge. 
The initiative is seeking to encourage investors to use the
new standard to help encourage projects that curb emissions
blamed for climate change, Kidney said today by phone. 
The four new advisory panel members are Imtiaz Ahmad,
carbon trader and executive director at Morgan Stanley in
London, Jonathan C. Bianco, Houston-based managing director of
Catalyst Capital Investors, Henry Derwent, chief executive
officer of the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading
Association, and Anthony Hobley, Sydney-based global head of
climate change at lawfirm Norton Rose LLP, Kidney said. 
&#8220;Public and private sector partnerships for climate
finance initiatives will be of growing importance as we
approach&#8221; United Nations climate talks in Durban, South Africa,
in November, Ahmad said today by e-mail. 
Leveraging private-sector finance in an environment of
&#8220;scarce public-sector resources&#8221; is crucial in order to
achieve the large-scale of investment needed to protect the
climate, he said. 
Morgan Stanley in May last year urged developing nations to
consider selling green bonds to spur investment in climate-
protection policies and projects. 
A lack of certainty on regulation of greenhouse-gas
emissions worldwide may otherwise result in a &#8220;massive scaling
down&#8221; of spending, Ahmad said at the time.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) may get a reprieve from
generic competition to its $11 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill
as Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) fights regulatory breaches that 
threaten to derail its push to produce the first U.S. copies. 
Ranbaxy, India&#8217;s third-largest drugmaker by revenue, plans
to introduce its copy of Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling
medicine, on Nov. 30. It must first persuade the Food and Drug
Administration that its copy is equivalent to the original and
that approval shouldn&#8217;t be thwarted by violations cited in 2009
at a plant identified in Ranbaxy&#8217;s drug application. 
Failure to resolve the issue could prevent the FDA from
clearing Ranbaxy&#8217;s Lipitor version by that date, said Ira Loss,
an analyst with Washington Analysis. A delay also may stall
plans by other generic-drug companies to introduce their
versions of the $11 billion-a-year medicine, he said. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember another case where timely approval of
the first generic on a big drug appears dependent upon cleaning
up a mess in their manufacturing situation,&#8221; said Loss, who has
followed the FDA for more than three decades. &#8220;Ranbaxy has
repeatedly expressed confidence that this will all get resolved
in time, but I&#8217;m not sure I believe them.&#8221;

General Motors Co. (GM) retained former
Vice Chairman Bob Lutz, who helped lead each U.S. automaker
during the past 48 years, as a part-time consultant. 
Lutz, 79, will be available to senior executives effective
immediately, the Detroit-based company said today in a statement
on its website. 
The former U.S. Marine fighter pilot worked two stints at
the largest U.S. automaker, the first ending in 1970. In the
second, he led GM&#8217;s global product development and held other
management roles during a nine-year stretch until May 2010. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll ever retire until he&#8217;s in a coffin,&#8221;
Dave Sullivan, a product analyst at Tustin, California-based
AutoPacific Inc., said in a phone interview. &#8220;He&#8217;s a true car
guy and he was born to do this. It&#8217;s hard for him to cut the
cord.&#8221; 
Lutz already has informally consulted with senior leaders
including Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson and Mary Barra,
who was named head of global product development in January,
said Jay Cooney, a GM spokesman. 
&#8220;This simply formalizes those discussions,&#8221; Cooney said
in a phone interview. &#8220;He would be available to speak with any
senior leader at General Motors about any topic. His knowledge
and experience runs the gamut.&#8221; 
Cooney declined to comment on Lutz&#8217;s compensation. 
Lutz&#8217;s Models 
Lutz rejoined GM in September 2001 and later championed the
Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car, which began selling late last
year. He previously held executive posts at Ford Motor Co. (F),
where he helped develop the Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle,
and the former Chrysler Corp., where he oversaw the Dodge Viper
sports car and Ram pickup, and PT Cruiser wagon. 
He also worked at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) starting in
1972, after his first GM stint. Lutz&#8217;s GM career began in 1963. 
&#8220;His impact at GM is probably bigger than maybe any other
automaker he&#8217;s been at,&#8221; said Sullivan, who is based in Troy,
Michigan. &#8220;Their product line right now is probably the best
it&#8217;s ever been. Everything that GM&#8217;s coming out with that&#8217;s new
seems to be doing very well.&#8221; 
Lutz has said he delayed his retirement from GM in 2009
when he was asked to stay as head of sales and marketing. Then-
Chairman Ed Whitacre changed his role to adviser for global
design and product development in December 2009, and GM
announced three months later that Lutz would leave the company. 
Akerson, 62, picked Barra to lead product development
earlier this year after she spent about 19 months as vice
president of global human resources. Before leading human
resources, Barra worked with Lutz as vice president of global
manufacturing engineering. 
&#8220;She has a lot of people that are still upset with GM over
getting bailed out by the government,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a lot riding on her shoulders to prove people wrong. It&#8217;s going
to be up to her to continue what has brought about GM&#8217;s recent
success with the next generation of vehicles.&#8221; 
GM fell 96 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $22.07 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) were among 17 banks sued by the U.S. to recoup $196
billion spent on mortgage-backed securities bought by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency, on behalf of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, filed 17 lawsuits yesterday in New York state
and federal courts and in federal court in Connecticut. The FHFA
accuses the banks of misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about
the soundness of the mortgages underlying the securities. 
&#8220;The loans had different and more risky characteristics
than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales
materials provided to the enterprises for those securities,&#8221;
the FHFA said in a statement. 
FHFA is seeking to rescind the transactions plus other
damages, including civil penalties and punitive damages in cases
alleging misconduct. 
In addition to JPMorgan and Bank of America, the agency
filed complaints in federal court in Manhattan yesterday against
Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Merrill Lynch  Co.,
Barclays Plc (BARC), Nomura Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Societe
Generale SA, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and First
Horizon National Corp. (FHN) 
The FHFA sued Ally Financial Inc., Countrywide Financial
Corp., General Electric Co. (GE) and Morgan Stanley in state court in
Manhattan, according to the agency. It sued Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) in federal court in Connecticut. 
Fannie and Freddie 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under U.S.
conservatorship since 2008, when they were seized amid subprime
mortgage losses that pushed them toward insolvency. 
The FHFA said in its filings that Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac bought $6 billion in mortgage-backed securities from Bank of
America; $24.8 billion from Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America
took over in 2008, and $26.6 billion from Countrywide, which
Bank of America acquired the same year. 
The FHFA claims Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought $33
billion in securities from JPMorgan and $30.4 billion from Royal
Bank of Scotland. According to the complaints, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac also bought $14.2 billion from Deutsche Bank, $14.1
billion from Credit Suisse, $11.1 billion from Goldman Sachs,
$10.6 billion from Morgan Stanley, $6.2 billion from HSBC, $6
billion from Ally, $4.9 billion from Barclays, $3.5 billion from
Citigroup, $2 billion from Nomura, $1.3 billion from Societe
Generale (GLE), $883 million from First Horizon and $549 million from
GE. 
UBS Suit 
The FHFA sued UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, in July
over $4.5 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities sold
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming the bank misstated the
risks of the investments. 
&#8220;The claims brought by the FHFA are unfounded,&#8221; said
Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank.
&#8220;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated
investor.&#8221; 
Ally, based in Detroit, said in a statement that it
believes FHFA&#8217;s claims are meritless and the company intends to
defend its position. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac &#8220;acknowledged that their losses
in the mortgaged-backed securities market were due to the
unprecedented downturn in housing prices and other economic
factors,&#8221; said Larry DiRita, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America. 
Kim Cherry of Memphis, Tennessee-based First Horizon said
the company would defend itself. 
Knew the Risks 
The firms claimed to understand the risks, and continued
buying, even after their regulator said they lacked adequate
risk-management capabilities to do so, DiRita said. 
Company representatives who declined to comment on the
suits yesterday included Danielle Romero-Apsilos of New York-
based Citigroup, Kerrie Cohen of London-based Barclays, Kristin Lemkau of JPMorgan in New York and Russell Wilkerson of
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE. 
Mark Lake of New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), Jonathan Hodgkinson of Tokyo-based Nomura, Michael DuVally, of Goldman
Sachs in New York, Steven Vames, of Zurich-based Credit Suisse,
Neil Brazil of London-based HSBC, and Jim Galvin of Paris-based
Societe Generale, also declined to comment. 
Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will defend the
claims. &#8220;We believe we have substantial and credible legal and
factual defences to these claims and will defend them
vigorously,&#8221; the bank said in an e-mailed statement. 
Some of the complaints described mortgages that were
already performing worse than investors were told at the time
securitizations were sold. Disclosures by some firms overstated
home values or misrepresented the number of homes occupied by
borrowers, according to the FHFA. 
&#8216;Under Water&#8217; 
An instrument underwritten by an affiliate of Merrill Lynch
was reported to have no loans larger than the value of the
house, known as the loan-to-value ratio. In reality, about 20.7
percent of the mortgages had an LTV ratio above 100 percent,
meaning they were already under-secured or &#8220;under water&#8221; from
the start, according to the FHFA&#8217;s complaint. Some pools
packaged by GE or its affiliates were said to have no loans with
an LTV over 100 percent, when about 13 percent did, according to
another suit. 
In the complaint against Goldman Sachs, the FHFA claimed
the bank securitized many mortgages that failed to meet
underwriting standards even after outside firms it hired
reported &#8220;high percentages of defective or at least
questionable loans.&#8221; 
&#8220;Goldman simply ignored and did not disclose the red
flags,&#8221; the FHFA claimed. 
The cases are Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 11-CV-6195; FHFA v. Barclays Bank Plc., 11-CV-
6190; FHFA v. Citigroup, 11-CV-6196; FHFA v. Credit Suisse

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) returned workers to some oil and natural gas platforms
as Tropical Storm Lee accelerated to the east-northeast, out of
the Gulf of Mexico. 
Crews are resuming production in the western Gulf after
inspecting equipment for damage, David Eglinton, a spokesman for
Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas-based said today in an e-
mail. Exxon moved about 140 employees to shore from
approximately 20 structures ahead of Lee. Shell, based in The
Hague, confirmed it began returning staff after evacuating as
many as 858 workers. 
About 60 percent of oil production from the Gulf,
equivalent to 843,223 barrels per day, remained shut as of 11:30
a.m. New York time, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Gas curtailments totaled
2.35 billion cubic feet, or 44 percent, down from 2.9 billion
cubic feet, or 55 percent, yesterday. The bureau said 239 of the
617 platforms in the Gulf were evacuated and 25 of the 70 rigs
currently drilling in the ocean. 
The interruptions will be brief, said James Williams, an
economist at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. &#8220;We&#8217;re not
talking about Hurricane Gustav here, moving pipelines up and
down Louisiana like it was spaghetti,&#8221; Williams said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;This one isn&#8217;t a big story. It&#8217;s a wet
story.&#8221; Gustav struck in 2008. 
Production Resumes 
Production resumed at Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)&#8217;s Nansen,
Boomvang and Gunnison platforms, the operator said today on its
website. Its Constitution, Marco Polo, Independence Hub, Neptune
and Red Hawk installations will be staffed and started as soon
as possible, The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko said. 
Platforms become accessible as weather clears west to east,
Mike Hurst, chief pilot of PHI Inc. in Lafayette, Louisiana.
It&#8217;s the largest provider of helicopters to Gulf of Mexico oil

Normal flights may resume tomorrow over western and central
platforms with service to eastern platforms Tuesday, he said. 
Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, is
operating normally, Katherine W. Swetman, a spokeswman, said
today in an e-mail. The unit can process as much as 360,000
barrels per day. More than 10 inches of rain fell in the area
the past four days, the National Weather Service said. 
All Exxon Mobil refineries were operating normally today,
spokeswoman Claire Hassett said in an e-mail.

Opel spokesman Stefan Weinmann said, confirming comments by GM&#8217;s

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
theme-park operator, said consumer products Chairman Andrew P. Mooney resigned to seek a leadership role at another company
after running the division for 12 years. 
&#8220;I believe this is the perfect time to take that
experience into a leadership role with another organization and
corporate boards,&#8221; Mooney, 56, said today in a statement from
Burbank, California-based Disney. He wasn&#8217;t more specific. 
The unit Mooney leaves, Disney&#8217;s second smallest ahead of
interactive media, has been a steady source of sales and profit
growth with toys and merchandise from Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Cars&#8221; movies
and Marvel films. Earnings in the division jumped 32 percent in
the June quarter on a 13 percent revenue gain. 
A native of Scotland, Mooney is credited with
reinvigorating the Disney chain of stores and leading the
division that introduced the Disney Princesses and Disney
Fairies brands. He has led the unit since 1999 and has been
chairman since 2003. 
Disney fell 68 cents to $31.78 at 2:06 p.m. in New York

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Credit Suisse Group AG landed lead roles managing the
initial share sale for Carlyle Group LP, taking one of the last
major private-equity firms public in a faltering market. 
The mandate may give the banks a boost among underwriters
as companies and their bankers struggle to complete deals.
JPMorgan currently ranks third for U.S. IPOs, while Citigroup
ranks fourth and Credit Suisse is eighth, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
U.S. listings have slowed almost to a halt because of
investors&#8217; concerns about the economy, eroding fee income at
investment banks. U.S. IPOs have been shelved or scrapped at a
faster rate in the past three months than the comparable period
of any year since 2004, Bloomberg data show. Only five offerings
were completed last month. 
&#8220;They should be doing cartwheels and jumping in the air to
get any kind of revenue in the door right now,&#8221; said Tom Jalics, a senior investment analyst at the private-banking unit
of KeyCorp in Cleveland, which oversees $22 billion. &#8220;From what
we&#8217;re hearing anecdotally, this quarter is going to be
extraordinarily weak, and estimates across the board are coming
down for investment banks.&#8221; 
The three banks all have a track record for taking private-
equity firms public. Citigroup helped lead the February 2007 IPO
of Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), as well as Blackstone Group
LP (BX)&#8217;s in June 2007 along with Credit Suisse. JPMorgan, Credit
Suisse and Citigroup all helped lead Apollo Global Management
LLC&#8217;s share sale in March. Washington-based Carlyle is the
second-biggest private-equity firm after Blackstone. 
Average Fees 
Absent from Carlyle&#8217;s filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission was Morgan Stanley (MS), which shared the lead
role with Citigroup on Blackstone&#8217;s offering. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), which helped manage both Apollo&#8217;s share sale and the
Fortress IPO, also wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the filing. 
Barclays Plc is the top-ranked underwriter for U.S. IPOs
this year, and Morgan Stanley is ranked second, according to
Bloomberg data. Banks have earned underwriting fees averaging
5.4 percent of the total IPO size for U.S. deals this year, the
data show.

The increase in pricing of corporate
credit risk is unjustified even by &#8220;lower growth expectations and
higher recession risks,&#8221; according to Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;Although a U.S. recession or Eurozone sovereign shocks
are risks, we think risk premiums are too elevated and unlike
&#8216;normal&#8217; cycles we have not seen a deterioration in balance
sheet quality,&#8221; analysts Viktor Hjort, Kelvin Pang and Nishant
Sood wrote in a report today. &#8220;We are constructive on global
credit,&#8221; the analysts wrote. 
The cost to protect U.S. company debt jumped today on
concern that the European debt crisis is worsening. The Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, rose 9.6 basis points from Sept. 2 to a mid-
price of 129.6 as of 8:06 a.m. in New York, according
to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. That&#8217;s the biggest
increase since Aug. 8. 
The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has climbed
from 96.3 since the end of July.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest
software maker, is adding features to its Internet display-
advertising products to keep from losing customers to Google
Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. in the $12.3 billion U.S. market. 
Microsoft is unveiling tools and partnerships with AppNexus
Inc. and MediaMath this month designed to help customers more
effectively tailor ads and measure their impact. Sales of
graphical display ads, including banners and videos, are poised
to climb 25 percent in the U.S. this year. 
The company aims to reassure customers such as Publicis
Groupe SA that have questioned its commitment to display ads and
the Atlas software it acquired with the $6 billion AQuantive
Inc. deal. As Microsoft shifted its focus to search-related ads,
some marketers have devoted more display-ad dollars to Facebook
and Google. 
&#8220;We have continued to invest behind Microsoft and behind
Atlas,&#8221; said Curt Hecht, chief executive officer of VivaKi
Nerve Center, the unit that oversees technology for Publicis
Groupe SA (PUB)&#8217;s digital ad agencies. &#8220;We need a partner that&#8217;s as
committed as we are. Microsoft is at a point where they need to
show it&#8217;s important to them.&#8221; 
Microsoft is adding personnel and dollars to bolster
display and Atlas, which is used to place ads on websites and
help advertisers measure performance of ad campaigns. Atlas vies
with DoubleClick, acquired by Google in a $3.1 billion purchase
announced a month before the AQuantive deal.

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a producer of
steelmaking coal in southern Appalachia, jumped as much as 30
percent after the London-based Times said Anglo American Plc (AAL) may
be considering a takeover bid. 
Anglo is said to be weighing a $120-a-share offer, the
Times said in its market report without citing anyone. BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) is also interested in Walter, the Times said. 
Walter rose $15.99, or 21 percent, to $90.98 as of 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
pared gains after Walter said in a statement it isn&#8217;t aware of
any &#8220;corporate developments&#8221; to account for the price
increase. The stock earlier touched $97.30, the biggest intraday
gain since March 8, 1995. 
Walter, based in Birmingham, Alabama, hasn&#8217;t hired a
permanent chief executive officer since Keith Calder resigned
June 30. He stepped down about two months after he was appointed
to the position, following Walter&#8217;s takeover of Canada&#8217;s Western
Coal Corp., where he was the CEO. Investor Audley Capital
Advisors LLP said in July that the company should explore a
sale. 
&#8220;Met coal assets are still in high demand,&#8221; Jeremy Sussman, an analyst with Brean Murray Carret  Co., wrote in a
research note today. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking
coal, is used to produce steel while utilities use thermal coal
to generate electricity. 
Takeover Bids 
Walter said it issued the statement in response to a
request from the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of
Canada on behalf of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company said
it doesn&#8217;t intend to comment further. 
Surging demand from steelmakers in China and flood-related
supply disruptions in Queensland, Australia, have driven prices
for coking coal to record highs. Low-volatility metallurgical
coal rose to $291 a ton, Energy Publishing Inc. said in its
latest weekly report, published Sept. 2. It touched $330 a ton
in February. 
There were $20.15 billion of takeover bids for coal-mining
companies valued at $100 million or more in the first nine
months of this year, compared with $7.06 billion in the year-
earlier period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU), the biggest U.S. coal producer, and
ArcelorMittal, the world&#8217;s largest steelmaker, in August agreed
to buy Macarthur Coal Ltd., a Brisbane, Australia coking-coal
producer, for A$3.64 billion ($3.88 billion). Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) became the world&#8217;s third-largest producer of
coking coal with a $7.1 billion takeover of Massey Energy Co. in
January. 
Offer Unlikely 
Anglo isn&#8217;t likely to make an offer for Walter, mainly
because the U.S. company&#8217;s coal reserves aren&#8217;t in a suitable
location for export by sea, London-based investment bank Liberum
Capital said today in a note. 
Citigroup Inc. also saw an offer as unlikely, &#8220;due to
limited potential synergies,&#8221; and because the multiple of 5.5
times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is low compared with recent deals in the sector,
Brian Yu, a San Francisco-based analyst wrote in a note today. 
Anglo, which is based in London, also declined to comment
in an e-mail. Kelly Quirke, a spokeswoman for Melbourne-based
BHP, also declined to comment.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
compensation plan, which almost doubled top executive Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s pay last year, unfairly rewards the investment
bank&#8217;s employees at shareholders&#8217; expense, a lawyer for
investors said. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
lost $50 billion in market value since 1999 while the company
has paid out billions in compensation to the firm&#8217;s 31,000
employees, including Blankfein, its chairman and chief executive
officer, John Harnes, an attorney for investors who have sued
over the pay plan, argued today. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, &#8220;is being run for the
benefit of employees rather than shareholders,&#8221; Harness told
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock III. The judge heard
arguments on whether shareholders&#8217; suits seeking to recoup
executive compensation should be thrown out and said he&#8217;d rule
later. 
The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis. In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year, according to its website. That was 9 percent less
than in the same period in 2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent. 
$19 Million Compensation 
Blankfein&#8217;s $19 million compensation for 2010, which
included a $5.4 million cash bonus, was almost double the prior
year&#8217;s award even as Goldman Sach&#8217;s profits fell. Blankfein and
other firm executives agreed to forgo cash bonuses in 2009 and
take restricted stock grants as compensation to mute criticism
of the firm&#8217;s pay practices. 
Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argue the firm&#8217;s
lucrative compensation system is wasteful and rewards employees
for taking risks that hurt the firm&#8217;s stock price. 
Harness noted Goldman officials received billions in pay
and bonuses last year while the firm settled claims by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that executives misled
investors in collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime
mortgages. 
The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators&#8217; claims that marketing materials about the
investments had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; 
CDOs in 2007 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing a hedge fund
helped pick the underlying securities and then bet against the
investment vehicles, the SEC said in the suit Goldman settled.
The bank didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing as part of the accord. 
Such &#8220;wrongful conduct has cost shareholders billions to
date and is likely to cost billions more,&#8221; Harnes argued on
behalf of Septa. Philadelphia-based Septa is the nation&#8217;s fifth-
largest public transportation system, according to its website. 
Investors should be permitted to move forward with their
suit, which seeks to hold Goldman Sachs directors responsible
for the firm&#8217;s flawed pay plan and for not properly overseeing
the company&#8217;s employees, he added. 
Any recovery as a result of Septa&#8217;s so-called derivative
suit will be returned to the company&#8217;s coffers rather than given
to the transportation authority. 
Risk-Taking 
Gregory Varallo, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s lawyer, countered
investors haven&#8217;t provided any evidence that directors engaged
in wrongdoing by creating the pay plan or encouraged excessive
risk-taking by the firm&#8217;s traders and bankers. 
Shareholder court filings seek to paint the investment bank
as some kind of &#8220;vast criminal enterprise,&#8221; Varallo told
Glasscock. Yet, investors can&#8217;t point to one illegal act
committed by a Goldman Sachs director or employee, he said. 
The investors want the judge to decide &#8220;how much risk&#8221; an
investment bank should take and &#8220;how much is too much&#8221;
compensation for taking those risks on behalf of shareholders,
Varallo added. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s a judge&#8217;s job,&#8221; the lawyer
added. Delaware Chancery Court judges decide cases without a
jury. 
The case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Shareholder
Litigation, 5215, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chief Executive
Officer John Watson urged President Barack Obama to cut
regulations and expand offshore oil drilling rather than use
subsidies to create jobs. 
The administration should abandon efforts to repeal about
$4 billion a year in oil and gas tax breaks and reconsider an
Environmental Protection Agency rule on greenhouse-gas emissions
to control climate change, Watson said today at a conference in
Washington. The EPA regulation will raise energy costs and
hinder growth, he said at the meeting sponsored by The Hill
newspaper and American Petroleum Institute industry group. 
&#8220;I would be delighted to invest more in the oil and gas
industry,&#8221; Watson said. The industry responds to the &#8220;fiscal
and regulatory environment we are given,&#8221; he said. 
Obama is set to outline his proposals to help lower
unemployment from 9.1 percent in an address to Congress tomorrow
night. Payroll growth stalled last month, the Labor Department
reported Sept. 2.

Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), one of
Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s largest franchise bottlers, said it made a
mistake in threatening to reconsider a 17 million-euro ($24
million) manufacturing investment in southern France because of
a sugar-related tax proposal. 
&#8220;I would like to set the record straight,&#8221; Hubert Patricot, president of the Atlanta-based company&#8217;s European
group, said today in a statement. &#8220;We are re-confirming our 17
million euro investment to our Les Pennes-Mirabeau facility.&#8221; 
The company had said in a statement hours earlier that it
was re-evaluating the planned investment and had canceled a
Sept. 19 ceremony with Chief Executive Officer John Brock. The
threat was in protest of a government plan to tax sugared
beverages as part of an austerity measure. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises declined to comment beyond the
follow-up statement. Patricot in his statement stood by the
company&#8217;s opposition to the tax proposal. 
&#8220;We remain strongly opposed to a tax that unjustly targets
the purchasing power of the French people and one category of
beverages under the pretext of addressing public health
concerns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consumer information and education around
increased exercise and balanced diets, not discriminatory taxes,
must be part of any comprehensive proposal.&#8221; 
France&#8217;s government announced last month a plan to raise 12
billion euros in 2011 and 2012 to fight mounting deficits.
Parliament is voting through tomorrow on 2011 measures that
include raising taxes on alcohol and cigarettes and creating a
new levy on sodas. 
Euro Disney Protest 
Coca-Cola Enterprises is the latest company to challenge
elements of the government&#8217;s plan. Euro Disney SCA (EDL)&#8217;s Disneyland
Paris and French theme parks opposed a planned increase in the
value-added tax on its business to 19.6 percent from 5.5
percent. The tax was scrapped yesterday after the parks won
support from former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
When he presented the plan, Prime Minister Francois Fillon
justified the new levy on sugared drinks, saying it was aimed at
reining in &#8220;the development of obesity that eventually will
represent a health cost.&#8221; The levy would yield about 100
million euros a year, according to the government. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises protested earlier today saying there
are &#8220;no studies in France&#8221; linking sodas and higher obesity
rates. The company said then that its investment in the factory
in Pennes-Mirabeau was on hold pending the vote.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s experimental pill for
rheumatoid arthritis was as effective as Humira from Abbott
Laboratories (ABT) and showed no new side effects in study results the
company plans to submit for U.S. approval this year. 
Nine study summaries were released today and will be
presented at the American College of Rheumatology conference in
Chicago in November. In one trial, both doses of Pfizer&#8217;s drug,
called tofacitinib, were slightly more effective than Humira
across six categories of improvement in symptoms and patient
mobility, though the study wasn&#8217;t big enough to establish the
pill&#8217;s superiority. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, designed tofacitinib
to compete with injectable drugs that dominate the market, led
by Humira from Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott, Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Remicade and Amgen Inc. (AMGN)&#8217;s Enbrel, which New York-based
Pfizer shares. The new drug may bring in more than $2.6 billion
a year, said Catherine Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG in New York. 
&#8220;This is a game-changing drug,&#8221; Arnold said. &#8220;Our peak
sales of $2.6 billion are likely conservative.&#8221; 
Humira will reach peak sales of about $8.5 billion in 2013
before sales decline as doctors grow comfortable with
tofacitinib and other new drugs, said Arnold, who has an
&#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Pfizer&#8217;s stock and a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating
for Abbott. 
Pfizer fell 19 cents, or 1 percent, to $18.82 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Abbott declined 86
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.44. 
Helps Application 
&#8220;Pfizer believes the risk-benefit profile supports
regulatory submission for both the 5- and 10-milligram dose,&#8221;
Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;We are looking forward to filing in the U.S., EU and Japan by
the end of the year.&#8221; 
Tofacitinib is the most-advanced pill in a family of
experimental drugs to target a protein, called JAK, which leads
to joint destruction in 1.3 million Americans with rheumatoid
arthritis. Three biotechnology companies are trying to catch up
to Pfizer with similar treatments: Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RIGL),
Incyte Corp. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) Pfizer&#8217;s pill is
the only one to complete the third and final stage of tests
generally needed for U.S. regulatory approval. 
Unexpected Results 
Humira performed unexpectedly poorly in the study, which
may not represent the true effectiveness of the drug, said
Elizabeth Hoff, a spokeswoman for Abbott. The proportion of
Humira patients showing a 20 percent improvement after six
months was 47 percent, compared with a typical proportion of 65
percent of patients with such improvement. Patients with 50
improvement only accounted for 28 percent of those studied,
compared with past studies showing 52 percent of patients. 
&#8220;Looking at the scores, this isn&#8217;t what we typically
see,&#8221; Hoff said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;These are
very similar patient populations. You see a pretty significant
difference.&#8221; 
The safety of tofacitinib was similar to what was seen in
previous studies, and deaths and side effects were toward the
lower end of a range of results from similar drugs, the company
reported. Much of the data from the individual studies was
reported previously. 
Twelve deaths were reported among 3,030 patients who took
the drug, compared with 1 death among 681 taking a placebo and 1
death among 204 patients on Humira across the Phase 3 studies
completed by Pfizer. Patients spent more time on tofacitinib
than Humira or placebo and deaths per amount of time spent on
the drugs were statistically similar. 
Serious Infections 
Patients taking tofacitinib were more likely to have
serious infections compared with Humira or placebo. There were
0.029 infectious for every year a patient was taking the Pfizer
pill, compared with 0.015 infections for placebo and 0.017 on
Humira. In at least one trial, infection rates were greater for
those taking the higher of two possible doses of tofacitinib. 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease in which the
immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing
inflammation in and around joints. Treatments suppress the
immune system and can increase vulnerability to infection. 
Shots known as anti-TNF therapy are standard care for the
80 percent of patients who don&#8217;t respond to methotrexate, a
generic drug that can block cell growth in people with certain
cancers and immune disorders. 
Tofacitinib would add to Pfizer&#8217;s recently expanded
offerings in pain and inflammation. The company gained the
arthritis remedy Enbrel in the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in
2009. The medicine was Pfizer&#8217;s second-best seller last year
with $3.3 billion in revenue. The drugmaker bought King
Pharmaceuticals Inc. last year for about $3.3 billion to add
additional painkillers to its range of products. 
Pfizer is counting on revenue from its arthritis pill to
help offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol
drug, with $10.7 billion in annual sales, faces competition
beginning in November from cheaper copies in the U.S.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. said selling
Italian and Spanish bonds along with bank stocks and debt, and
buying dollars and gold may provide the best protection against
the &#8220;very unlikely&#8221; risk of a euro-area collapse. 
&#8220;There are formidable barriers to break-up, which make it
less likely, but also mean it would be more disruptive if it did
occur,&#8221; Seamus Mac Gorain, a strategist in London, wrote in an
investor report yesterday. &#8220;The financial turmoil and economic
impact would be most pronounced in the euro area, arguing for
broad underweight euro-area equity and credit.&#8221; 
Yields on U.S. and German 10-year bonds fell to records
this week and gold reached a fresh high as investors sought the
safest assets amid concern policy makers aren&#8217;t doing enough to
prevent the spread of financial-market tension from the euro
area. That&#8217;s prompting economists to study worst-case scenarios,
with UBS AG saying two days ago that the euro doesn&#8217;t work under
its current structure. 
Sales of Italian and Spanish bonds versus benchmark German
bunds may provide an &#8220;efficient hedge,&#8221; along with betting the
euro will fall against the dollar and buying gold, JPMorgan&#8217;s
Mac Gorain wrote. Owning less euro-area bank equities and credit
securities than benchmarks used to track performance would also
offer protection, he said. 
Italian 10-year bonds rose a third day, pushing the yield
down five basis points to 5.21 percent as of 11:03 a.m. in
London. The rate fell to as low as 4.87 percent on Aug. 18 as
the European Central Bank was said to begin purchasing the debt
last month. 
&#8220;The only way to hedge against a euro break-up scenario is
to own no euro assets at all,&#8221; UBS economists including
Stephane Deo wrote in their Sept. 6 report. The cost of a
potential collapse makes it &#8220;close to zero probability,&#8221; and
&#8220;the growth consequences are awful in any break-up scenario,&#8221;
they wrote.

The European Central Bank, the
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan may take concerted action
to tackle weak growth and falling equity prices as soon as this
week&#8217;s Group of Seven meeting, according to Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;The negative feedback loop between weak growth and soggy
asset markets makes a coordinated monetary-policy easing move
more likely,&#8221; London-based economists Manoj Pradhan and Joachim Fels said yesterday in a note to investors. &#8220;The burden of
propping up markets and the economy&#8221; falls on central banks. 
Central banks are facing calls to loosen monetary policy as
threats from Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis and a weakening U.S.
recovery intensify and roil financial markets. The Fed, the ECB
and the Bank of England took concerted steps along with four
others in 2008 to slash interest rates as the fallout from the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. became evident. 
Morgan Stanley said central banks can now reprise joint
action and roll out a mix of rate cuts and quantitative easing. 
&#8220;Strategic complementarity -- the willingness and ability
to ease if others are doing the same -- makes it easier for
banks to act jointly rather than unilaterally,&#8221; the two
economists said in the e-mailed note. 
The ECB and the Bank of England, which meet today, are
expected to keep their main policy rates on hold. At the same
time, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet faces calls for a rate
cut and the BOE may consider additional stimulus. 
Policy makers from the Group of Seven nations will convene
for talks in the French city of Marseilles tomorrow, providing a
forum where joint action may be approved. 
The Fed, the ECB, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England
will all participate in any coordinated move, according to
Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;The Fed could lower its interest rate on excess reserves
to zero and announce some balance sheet measures,&#8221; the
economists said. &#8220;The ECB could cut its deposit rate and/or the
refi rate and announce additional term funding for banks. The
Bank of Japan and the Bank of England could both respond with
additional quantitative-easing measures.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley (MS), the top global
merger adviser last year, named three new heads of its media and
communications investment-banking group to replace Stuart J. Epstein, who left to become chief financial officer of NBC
Universal. 
Jean Abergel, Max Herrnstein and Adam Shepard will serve as
global co-heads of the group, according to a internal memo
obtained today by Bloomberg News. Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for
the New York-based firm, confirmed the contents of the memo. 
NBC Universal, the entertainment company controlled by
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), announced Epstein&#8217;s hire on Sept. 7. Epstein
played a key role in creating the venture that gave Comcast, the
largest U.S. cable service, a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal,
owner of the broadcast network, movie studio and cable channels
Bravo and USA, according to a statement. 
&#8220;Stuart&#8217;s contributions to the division and the firm have
been tremendous and he will be greatly missed,&#8221; Paul J.
Taubman, co-president of the Institutional Securities Group, and
Franck Petitgas, global co-head of investment banking, said in
the memo. &#8220;We are confident that Jean, Max and Adam will
provide the strong leadership necessary to continue to build on
the strength and positive momentum in our Global Media 
Communications business.&#8221; 
Abergel, a 12-year veteran of the firm, is currently head
of the media and communications team in Europe, while Herrnstein
is head of media in North America and Shepard runs the telecom
group in that region, according to the memo. Herrnstein has been
with the firm for 13 years, and Shepard is an 11-year veteran,
according to the memo. 
The New York Times reported the promotions earlier.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) were among four banks chosen to manage Nikko Asset
Management Co.&#8217;s initial public offering, said three people with
knowledge of the proposed sale. 
Nikko Asset and its largest shareholder, Sumitomo Trust 
Banking Co., may sell about 50 billion yen ($645 million) of
shares in the IPO, said the people, declining to be identified
before a public announcement. The asset manager plans to list on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange as early as this year and targets a
market value of about 200 billion yen, they said. 
The share offer may be the biggest IPO in Japan this year,
and would be the country&#8217;s first by a major asset manager in a
decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The nation&#8217;s
equity capital market has begun to recover, with nine initial
share offers from the end of May following an 11-week hiatus in
the aftermath of a record earthquake and tsunami on March 11. 
&#8220;Overseas investors will be interested because a Japanese
asset manager&#8217;s sale is a rarity and gives them access to the
country&#8217;s 1,500 trillion yen worth of household financial
assets,&#8221; said Kazumi Tanaka, an IPO analyst at TC Financial
Research Inc. in Tokyo. &#8220;The IPO market will be more aggressive
next year as Japanese firms improve performance and recover from
the earthquake.&#8221; 
Megumi Yoshizawa, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Nikko
Asset, declined to comment. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Hiroko Matsumoto,
Nomura&#8217;s Keiko Sugai, UBS&#8217;s Eiko Noda and SMBC Nikko&#8217;s Tadataka
Ishida also declined to comment. All are based in Tokyo. 
Four-Bank Management 
New York-based Goldman Sachs will be the global coordinator
for the IPO, while UBS AG (UBSN) and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. will
help manage the sale, the people said. 
Nikko Asset began choosing managers for the offering in
July. The firm hasn&#8217;t decided the terms of the sale or details
for the underwriters&#8217; roles, the people said. 
Citigroup Inc. (C), which acquired Nikko Asset from Nikko
Cordial Corp. in 2008, sold the company to Sumitomo Trust as
part of a transaction valued at 120 billion yen in October 2009. 
Nikko Asset, founded in 1959, employs more than 500 staff
including 72 fund managers, and has 12.8 trillion yen under
management, according to its website. The investment management
firm, run by Chief Executive Officer Timothy McCarthy, has
subsidiaries in London, New York, Singapore and Sydney. 
Sumitomo Trust and Nikko Asset agreed to buy DBS Asset
Management from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS), Southeast Asia&#8217;s
biggest bank, for S$137 million ($113 million) to tap business
from the expanding ranks of wealthy Asians, the companies said
in December.

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) promoted Walter J. Scheller III to chief executive officer two months after

Scheller, 50, was president of the company&#8217;s U.S.

in a statement. He joined the company in June 2010 from Peabody
Energy Corp., where he worked for four years. He has also worked

replaces interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard. 
Calder, who resigned as CEO on June 30, assumed the
position in April. He told the board of directors in a letter

&#8220;management philosophy.&#8221; Calder was the CEO of Western Coal

A unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
was fined by the Central Bank of Ireland for breaching rules on
counterparty risk assessment. 
Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) Plc was fined 160,000 euros
($218,000), the Dublin-based central bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company incorrectly calculated its
regulatory capital requirements between July 16, 2008 and Dec.
17, 2010, the central bank said. 
&#8220;The reliance on automated systems should be tempered by
adequate oversight to ensure that systems and controls are, and
continue to be, comprehensive and proportionate,&#8221; Peter Oakes,
director of enforcement at the central bank, said in an e-mail. 
The error in working out the counterparty risk capital
requirement didn&#8217;t result in any breach of the capital adequacy
ratios, the central bank said. No counterparties were impacted.
Goldman Sachs has taken remedial action to fix the breaches and
the matter is closed, the central bank said. 
The firm disclosed the errors in calculations to the
central bank on Dec. 13, according to today&#8217;s statement. 
&#8220;We are pleased this matter has been resolved,&#8221; Joanna Carss, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, in London, said today.

Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam said the punishment sought by the government for his
insider-trading convictions is &#8220;grotesquely severe&#8221; and should
be rejected by the court. The U.S. said a long prison sentence
is warranted. 
Rajaratnam, 54, on Sept. 9 asked U.S. District Judge
Richard Holwell in Manhattan for a sentence &#8220;substantially
below&#8221; what is called for by federal guidelines. The
government&#8217;s requested sentence of 19 1/2 to 24 1/2 years
&#8220;would guarantee Mr. Rajaratnam&#8217;s death in prison,&#8221; he said in
a court filing. 
&#8220;This court&#8217;s role is not to validate a prosecutorial
public relations effort, nor is it to single out one man to
serve as the whipping boy for Wall Street misdeeds,&#8221; Rajaratnam
argued. 
Rajaratnam was convicted in May of all 14 criminal counts
of conspiracy and securities fraud he was charged with. He&#8217;s
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 27. Rajaratnam argued that the
government&#8217;s requested sentence is more than the average
sentence imposed for kidnapping and hostage-taking, sexual
abuse, robbery, arson and child pornography. 
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Reed Brodsky and Jonathan
Streeter, who prosecuted the case, asked Holwell in a filing
Sept. 9 to reject Rajaratnam&#8217;s pleas for leniency based on his
poor health and charitable contributions. 
&#8220;In arguing for leniency because of his health, Rajaratnam
overlooks that he committed his crimes for years after he knew
about his medical problems and thus he is in no position to seek
leniency now based on them,&#8221; they said. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
ATT Fights U.S. Suit, Calls T-Mobile Deal Good for Public 
ATT Inc. (T) said its proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-
Mobile USA Inc. is good for mobile-phone customers and that the
U.S. lawsuit seeking to block the deal &#8220;fails to come to
grips&#8221; with its benefits. 
ATT filed its response Sept. 9 to the U.S. Justice
Department&#8217;s complaint in federal court in Washington. The
company said the merger would lead to better service, fewer
dropped calls and lower prices for consumers. ATT cited fierce
competition from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S), MetroPCS Communications Inc., Leap Wireless International
Inc., U.S. Cellular Corp. and Cellular South Inc. 
&#8220;The Department does not and cannot explain how, in the
face of all these aggressive rivals, the combined ATT/T-Mobile
will have any ability or incentive to restrict output, raise
prices, or slow innovation,&#8221; ATT said in the filing. 
ATT described T-Mobile as &#8220;the only major carrier to have
actually lost subscribers in a robustly growing market&#8221; with a
business model that has it trapped between large providers and
lower-priced competitors. 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. 
Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman in Washington, said in an
e-mail that the company remains &#8220;interested in a solution that
addresses the DOJ&#8217;s issues with the T-Mobile merger.&#8221; 
Hernan Daguerre, a T-Mobile spokesman, declined to comment
on the filing. 
&#8220;This transaction as currently proposed is anticompetitive
and harmful to consumers,&#8221; Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the
antitrust division of the Justice Department, said in an
interview. &#8220;We will respond further in our court filings.&#8221; 
Sprint, which has filed its own lawsuit opposing the
merger, said ATT&#8217;s filing doesn&#8217;t change its position on the
deal. 
&#8220;The proposed takeover would create a clear wireless
duopoly that could raise prices, stifle innovation and cost
American jobs,&#8221; Sprint spokesman John Taylor said in an e-mail. 
U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 and told the parties to be prepared to discuss
settlement options. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
Banks May Fight Banks as Investors Pursue Class Status 
Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) may pay more to resolve claims over their alleged roles in
the collapse of a $2.3 trillion mortgage-backed securities
market if sophisticated investors are allowed to sue as a group
along with less savvy ones, Thom Weidlich of Bloomberg News
reports. 
Class-action status allows investors to pool financial and
legal resources, giving them greater leverage to win larger
settlements or verdicts. The banks, however, have a court ruling
on their side that may help fend off such blockbuster cases. It
says class status is barred because some investors are too
sophisticated -- in fact, because some of them are other banks,
including JPMorgan. 
&#8220;It is possible to be both an alleged perpetrator and
victim at the same time,&#8221; said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer now in private
practice in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;It&#8217;s unprecedented that you
have the most sophisticated institutions as victims, to be in a
position where their losses are so great that they have sued.&#8221; 
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. in
Manhattan, favoring defendants Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)
and Ally Financial Inc., held that investors may not sue as a
class in part because some of them are being sued over the same
claims. Last month, that ruling was countered by two judges in
Baer&#8217;s courthouse, both of whom ruled that investors in home-
loan backed securities may sue as a class. 
Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that, once burst, helped push the
U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. Investors have
filed class-action, or group, lawsuits against at least 16
private issuers of securities backed by mortgages.

KKR, Blackstone Deal-Rigging Antitrust Suit Expanded by Judge 
Plaintiffs in a case accusing 11 firms, including KKR  Co.
and Blackstone Group LP (BX), of conspiring to rig the market for
leveraged buyout deals can expand their investigation, a federal
judge ruled. 
The plaintiffs, including a Detroit police and fire pension
fund, can seek information on 10 additional deals, U.S. District
Judge Edward F. Harrington said in a ruling Sept. 7. He didn&#8217;t
identify the transactions, which are described in a fifth
amended complaint filed under seal. The firms argued that adding
the deals would be &#8220;unduly burdensome and prejudicial,&#8221;
according to court papers. 
The lawsuit, initially filed in 2007, claims the firms
conspired to drive down prices in the largest leveraged buyout
deals in violation of federal antitrust laws. The case
previously was limited to 17 transactions. Harrington gave the
plaintiffs until April 17 to seek the information. 
Among the deals in question is Neiman Marcus Group Inc.&#8217;s
$5.1 billion buyout by Warburg Pincus LLC and TPG Capital Inc.,
SunGard Data Systems Inc.&#8217;s $11.3 billion takeover by seven
private-equity firms and Aramark Corp.&#8217;s roughly $8.3 billion
purchase in January 2007. Three plaintiffs are also shareholders
of Freescale Semiconductor Inc., which was taken private by a
group including Blackstone and Carlyle Group. TPG and Carlyle
are also defendants in the suit. 
The firms allegedly formed &#8220;bidding clubs,&#8221; referred to
in the private-equity industry as &#8220;consortia&#8221; or &#8220;teams&#8221; to
rig the bidding, according to a redacted fourth amended
complaint made public Sept 9. Use of the clubs limited the
number of bidders, depressing prices at target companies, the
plaintiffs said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to have any comment on that,&#8221; Owen
Blicksilver, a spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG, said
in a telephone interview Sept. 9. 
Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for New York-based KKR, said
the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. Blackstone
spokeswoman Christine Anderson and Chris Ullman of Carlyle Group
didn&#8217;t return phone messages seeking comment on the ruling. 
The case is Dahl v. Bain Capital Partners LLC, 07-12388,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). 
Madoff Trustee Sets $272 Million Payout, Sept. 15 Record Date 
The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm is planning an
initial distribution of $272 million to investors holding
allowed claims as of Sept. 15, according to a court filing. 
The trustee, Irving Picard, intends to issue payments by
the end of the third quarter, after reviewing allowed claims
against the jailed confidence man, he said in July. The average
check, arriving almost three years after the Ponzi scheme
collapsed, will be $222,551, he said. 
Holders of claims against Madoff that were sold or
transferred will only receive distributions from Picard if the
21-day notice-and-objection period on the transfer has expired
by Sept. 15, according to the filing. 
Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 lawsuits seeking
money for Madoff investors, in May allotted $2.6 billion to a
fund for victims of the Ponzi scheme. Because of court
challenges, most of the $8.6 billion he has raised isn&#8217;t
currently available to put in the customer fund or distribute to
claimholders who lost an estimated $17.3 billion in principal,
he has said. 
Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in North Carolina,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. Picard and his law
firm, Baker  Hostetler LLP, have made about $179 million in
fees since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. 
The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Dow Chemical, Sasol Win Dismissal of Greenpeace Lawsuit 
Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and Sasol North America Inc. won the
dismissal of a lawsuit alleging the chemical companies illegally
spied on an affiliate of Greenpeace International, the
environmental advocacy group. 
Greenpeace Inc. sued under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act. A federal judge in Washington
ruled Sept. 9 that the nonprofit organization failed to
establish a direct connection between corporate espionage and
civil racketeering allegations and any injury the group
suffered. 
&#8220;The direct victim of this alleged wire fraud was not
Greenpeace, but a third party, and, therefore, the link between
Greenpeace&#8217;s injuries and defendants&#8217; alleged racketeering
activity is too attenuated to be actionable under RICO,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer wrote in her ruling. 
Greenpeace claimed that Dow, closely held Sasol and two
public relations firms from 1998 to 2000 conspired to infiltrate
and steal confidential information to thwart its environmental
campaigns. 
Greenpeace said the spying included breaking into locked
trash bins outside its Washington headquarters and infiltrating
meetings and electronic communications. 
The injured third party the judge referred to was Calcasieu
League for Environmental Action Now, described in the ruling as
an ally of Greenpeace. 
Molly Dorozenski, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, declined to
comment immediately, saying the group&#8217;s lawyers were reviewing
the ruling. 
&#8220;As we have said from the beginning, the case totally
lacked merit and should have never been filed by Greenpeace,&#8221;
said Gregory Baldwin, a spokesman for Midland, Michigan-based
Dow, the largest U.S. chemical maker, in an e-mail. &#8220;No Dow
employee did anything improper.&#8221; 
Matthew Kirtland, a Washington lawyer representing Houston-
based Sasol North America Inc., said his client is pleased with
the court&#8217;s decision. 
The case is Greenpeace Inc. v. Dow Chemical Co., 10-cv-
02037, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
Lorillard Label Challenge Should Be Rejected, U.S. Says 
The U.S. asked a judge to reject a bid by Lorillard Inc. (LO),
the maker of Newport cigarettes, and three other tobacco
companies to stop the government from putting new warnings on
cigarette packs. 
The U.S. Justice Department, in a filing Sept. 9 in federal
court in Washington, said the Food and Drug Administration has
the authority to require labels warning of the health risks of
smoking. The companies are seeking a preliminary injunction
delaying the rule, scheduled to take effect Sept. 22, 2012. 
The FDA regulation mandates that cigarette packs, cartons
and advertising display graphic warning labels. The warnings
will be accompanied by pictures of rotting teeth or damaged
lungs to deter smokers. 
&#8220;The public interest strongly mitigates against delaying
health warnings that more effectively convey the extraordinary,
undisputed health risks created by the use of plaintiffs&#8217;
products,&#8221; the Justice Department said. 
Lorillard, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Commonwealth Brands
Inc. and Liggett Group LLC sued last month saying the regulation
violates the First Amendment. 
Ronald Milstein, Greensboro, North Carolina-based
Lorillard&#8217;s senior vice president and general counsel, didn&#8217;t
return a telephone message after normal business hours seeking
comment on the filing. 
Representatives in the public relations department of
Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), R.J. Reynolds&#8217;s parent, didn&#8217;t reply to
a phone message seeking comment. 
The case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 11-cv-1482, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington).

Trials/Appeals 
Ford Asks Court to Reverse $2 Billion Award to Truck Dealers 
Ford Motor Co. (F) asked an Ohio appeals court to reverse a $2
billion judgment awarded in June to a class of commercial truck
dealers who claimed the company overcharged them for 11 years. 
The dealers sued Ford in 2002, claiming the company broke
an agreement to sell trucks at published prices, which forced
them to pay more from 1987 through 1998 and cut into profits.
Cuyahoga County Judge Peter J. Corrigan in June upheld a $4.5
million verdict awarded to one Ohio dealer in February by a
Cleveland jury. The Cleveland judge also said Ford had to pay
similar damages and interest to a class of about 3,000 other
dealers. 
The judge improperly found Ford liable before trial for
breach of franchise agreements and prevented the company from
defending itself on damages, the automaker said in a Sept. 2
filing with the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County in
Cleveland. Ford also said Corrigan shouldn&#8217;t have applied his
findings on one dispute across hundreds of thousands of
transactions involving other dealers. 
&#8220;The trial court&#8217;s grant of summary judgment on liability
exemplifies the court&#8217;s repeated and erroneous election to take
away from the jury key questions on liability and damages,&#8221;
Ford said in court papers. &#8220;The trial court deprived Ford of
its rights to due process and a trial by jury.&#8221; 
The total $2 billion award is five times higher than the
amount of the largest-ever jury award against Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford in a lawsuit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. 
The court&#8217;s judgment was the largest of any type in Ohio
history, Ford said in its appeal. &#8220;That staggering judgment was
as unwarranted as it was unprecedented,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;It
resulted from a series of serious errors by the trial court, any
one of which compels reversal.&#8221; 
Ford wasn&#8217;t denied any rights, James Lowe, the dealers&#8217;
lawyer, said in an interview Sept. 9. Corrigan&#8217;s treatment of
the suit by awarding damages to the class was &#8220;perfectly
appropriate,&#8221; he said. 
The case is Westgate Ford Truck Sales Inc. v. Ford Motor
Co., CV 02-483526, Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio
(Cleveland).

Health-Care Ruling May Delay Final Answer From U.S. High Court 
A federal appeals court decision cast doubt on the prospect
that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality
of President Barack Obama&#8217;s health-care overhaul before the 2012
elections. 
The three-judge panel said Sept 8 that it didn&#8217;t yet have
the power to consider a challenge to the law&#8217;s requirement that
Americans, by 2014, either acquire health insurance or pay a
penalty. The court ruled that judicial review must wait for the
assessment of a fine -- something that wouldn&#8217;t occur until the
following year. 
The health-care law, which has divided courts around the
country, was already in line for possible Supreme Court review
early next year, with a ruling likely in June. The Sept. 8
ruling adds a new legal wrinkle, raising a procedural issue that
might delay the ultimate outcome. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still the case that we will get some decision from
the United States Supreme Court the last week of this coming
June,&#8221; said Walter Dellinger, the former U.S. solicitor general
who filed a brief backing the law on behalf of congressional
Democrats. &#8220;But it is possible that ruling could be that no one
has the right to challenge this law until they&#8217;ve declined to
pay the penalty or sought a refund.&#8221; 
Three federal appeals courts have now considered the law,
each reaching a different conclusion. A Cincinnati-based appeals
court upheld the law in June, calling it a valid use of
Congress&#8217;s power to regulate interstate commerce. An appeal in
that case is now before the Supreme Court. 
An Atlanta-based court disagreed, upholding arguments by 26
states that Congress had exceeded its power under the commerce
clause. The U.S. Justice Department is scheduled to say by the
end of the month whether it will seek Supreme Court review of
that ruling or instead ask a larger panel of appellate judges to
reconsider. 
The latest ruling, from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, took a third approach. The panel
focused on a law, known as the Anti-Injunction Act, barring
lawsuits that seek to block the collection of federal taxes. The
measure says that &#8220;no suit for the purpose of restraining the
assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any
court by any person.&#8221; 
Writing for herself and one other panel member, Judge Diana
Gribbon Motz, said the law meant the court couldn&#8217;t hear a suit
filed by Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg,
Virginia, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. 
The cases are Liberty University v. Geithner, 10-02347, and
Commonwealth of Virginia v. Sebelius, 11-01057, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Richmond).

Verdicts/Settlement 
Ex-Industrial Enterprises CEO Gets Up to 21 Years for Fraud 
Former Industrial Enterprises of America Inc. (IEAM) Chief
Executive Officer James W. Margulies was sentenced to seven to
21 years in prison for his role in a $110 million securities
fraud. 
New York State Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro handed
down the sentence in Manhattan Sept. 9. Margulies, of Cleveland,
was convicted in July of grand larceny, scheming to defraud,
conspiracy, violation of general business law and falsifying
business records in what prosecutors called a &#8220;massive&#8221; pump-
and-dump scheme. 
&#8220;This is basically a case of greed,&#8221; Carro said. He said
he wanted the sentence to serve as &#8220;a general deterrent that
will scream out from this courtroom that people like you are
going to be treated harshly.&#8221; 
Margulies and another former Industrial Enterprises CEO,
John D. Mazzuto, were indicted in May 2010. Mazzuto pleaded
guilty and testified against Margulies, a lawyer, at trial.
Mazzuto hasn&#8217;t been sentenced. 
&#8220;My actions were well-intended at the time,&#8221; Margulies
told Carro Sept. 9. &#8220;By the time I recognized the potential
harm of my actions, it was too late.&#8221; 
He asked for probation, telling the judge that he needed to
be at home with his family, including a child who has special
needs. Carro rejected that request. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not my sentence that&#8217;s going to devastate these
children,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;It is your actions.&#8221; 
The case is People v. Margulies, 2503-2010, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan.) 
Former Taiwan Semiconductor Manager Seeks 12-Month Sentence 
A former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. manager who
pleaded guilty to being part of an insider-trading scheme
involving Primary Global Research LLC is seeking a 12-month
sentence. 
Manosha Karunatilaka, who pleaded guilty in May to taking
about $35,000 to pass inside tips about the company&#8217;s orders
while working as a Primary Global consultant, asked the
sentencing judge Sept. 9 to give him a split term of six months
in jail and six months of home confinement. 
&#8220;I am a good person that made a terrible mistake and fell
from grace,&#8221; Karunatilaka said in a letter to U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff, which was attached to the sentencing request
filed in Manhattan federal court Sept. 9. 
Prosecutors argued in a court filing that Karunatilaka
should get from 37 to 46 months in prison. 
An analyst at an unnamed New York-based hedge fund which
used Primary Global&#8217;s services spoke to Karunatilaka frequently
from 2008 to 2010, prosecutors said in court papers. In May
2009, acting on Karunatilaka&#8217;s recommendation to bet that Taiwan
Semiconductor shares would fall, the fund made a profit of about
$1.7 million, the U.S. said. 
The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-CR-32, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Alliance One, Deltafina Lose EU Appeals of Antitrust Fine 
Universal Corp.&#8217;s Italian unit Deltafina and Alliance One
International Inc. (AOI) lost European Union court appeals against
antitrust fines totaling 54 million euros ($75 million) for
colluding on prices they paid tobacco growers. 
The EU General Court, the 27-nation region&#8217;s second-highest
tribunal, ruled Sept. 9 that the penalties were valid. 
The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
fined four companies, including two Alliance One units, 56
million euros for unlawfully rigging prices for more than six
years in a cartel that ended in 2002. Deltafina was fined 30
million euros while Alliance One was held jointly liable with
its two units for a 24 million-euro penalty. 
The ruling follows decisions by the court in a similar case
concerning the Spanish market last year in which Deltafina won a
reduction in an 11.9 million-euro antitrust fine for fixing the
prices it paid Spanish growers for tobacco. Alliance One last
October lost an appeal over its fine in the cartel. 
Representatives of the companies in the U.S. didn&#8217;t respond
to calls outside normal office hours. 
The cases are: T-12/06, Deltafina v. European Commission;
T-25/06, Alliance One v. European Commission.

On The Docket 
Ex-Bear Stearns Fund Managers&#8217; SEC Trial Set for February 
Former Bear Stearns Cos. hedge-fund managers Ralph Cioffi
and Matthew Tannin, acquitted in 2009 of criminal charges they
misled investors who lost $1.6 billion, are set to face trial in
February in a related civil case brought by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. 
U.S. District Judge Frederic Block in Brooklyn, New York,
set the trial date for Feb. 13 at a conference Sept. 9. 
A federal jury in November 2009 found Cioffi and Tannin not
guilty of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud in the first
criminal trial stemming from a federal probe of the collapse of
the subprime-mortgage market. Cioffi, 55, was portfolio manager
for the hedge funds and Tannin was their chief operating
officer. 
&#8220;We have had no discussions of substance,&#8221; John D.
Worland, a lawyer for the SEC, told Block when the judge asked
about the possibility of a settlement, which would make a trial
unnecessary. 
Kevin Callahan, an SEC spokesman, and Marc Weinstein, a
lawyer for Cioffi at Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP in Manhattan,
declined to comment on the case. Nina Beattie, a lawyer for
Tannin at Brune  Richards LLP in Manhattan, also declined to
comment. 
Cioffi and Tannin were indicted in June 2008, a year after
their hedge funds failed. Bear Stearns collapsed less than a
year after the funds failed, and was purchased by New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) 
The SEC claims the two men misled investors about the
funds&#8217; deepening financial troubles and their own holdings in
the investment pools. The regulator&#8217;s case requires a lower
standard of proof than a criminal conviction. 
The civil case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Cioffi, 08-cv-2457, and the criminal case is U.S. v. Cioffi, 08-
CR-00415, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn).

Morgan Stanley said it may lower
its year-end forecast for the euro after the currency declined
to less than the bank&#8217;s $1.36 prediction, as the European
Central Bank damped the outlook for interest rate increases. 
The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to suffer from
&#8220;reputational issues&#8221; after Juergen Stark quit its executive
board last week and this will likely be &#8220;unhelpful&#8221; for the
single currency, analysts including Hans Redeker, head of
foreign-exchange strategy, wrote in a client note today. 
Europe&#8217;s common currency may slump to about $1.3055 if it
weakens to less than a &#8220;support level&#8221; at $1.3440, the
analysts wrote. A support level is a price where bids may be
clustered.  
The euro lost 0.4 percent to $1.3603 as of 10:12 a.m. in
London, after falling to $1.3495, the weakest since Feb. 16. It
slumped 3.9 percent last week, the biggest drop since the five
days through Aug. 13, 2010.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled an
upcoming version of its Windows operating system that can run
handheld touch-screen computers, aimed at narrowing the lead of
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad in the market for tablets. 
Software developers will be able to download a preview of
the program, called Windows 8, tonight, the company said. The
product lets users display favorite applications, people and
information in tiles on the main screen. It will allow ultra-
thin personal computers and tablets to turn on instantly and run
all day on a single charge. 
Microsoft is under pressure to put out a new version of
Windows capable of running smaller, thinner tablet computers
with battery life to rival that of the iPad. In the meantime,
Windows sales have missed analysts&#8217; estimates for three straight
quarters and personal-computer sales have stalled as consumers
favor tablets over notebook computers running the software. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s very important for them to get this right,&#8221; said
Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen, who suggests
buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;They can&#8217;t compete with what&#8217;s out
there today in tablets.&#8221; 
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft took the wraps off
Windows 8 today at a conference for developers in Anaheim,
California, without saying when it will go on sale. The product,
previewed in June, is an attempt to vault Microsoft into a fast-
growing market controlled by Apple and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
software. 
Tablet Market 
Sixty million media tablets will ship in 2011, and 74
percent of those will be Apple&#8217;s iPads, according to an August
forecast by IHS Inc. The global market is expected to rise to
275.3 million units in 2015, with Apple forecast to claim 43.6
percent of the market at that point. 
In the quarter that ended in June, Apple sold 9.3 million
iPads. About 20 percent of them went to customers who would have
otherwise bought a Windows PC, estimated Colin Gillis, an
analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. 
The need to compete has led Microsoft for the first time to
offer a Windows computer operating system that runs on chip
technology from ARM Holdings Plc. (ARM) The program is the biggest
operating-system change Microsoft has made since Windows 95,
Microsoft Vice President Julie Larson-Green said in June. 
Windows 8&#8217;s design resembles Microsoft&#8217;s software for
mobile phones in its use of digital tiles instead of icons to
help users move between programs. 
&#8216;Re-imagined Windows&#8217; 
&#8220;From the chipset to the experience, Windows 8 re-imagines
what Windows can be,&#8221; Sinofsky said in a keynote address today.
Developers at the conference will get a prototype tablet
computer with the Windows 8 preview software. The machine was
made by Samsung Electronics Co. and runs an Intel Corp. (INTC) chip. 
Like Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 7, the new software has touch-
controlled tiles that can be automatically updated to display
information from applications on the computer&#8217;s start screen.
For example, a weather application can tell users that the
forecast is sunny without requiring them to open the app. 
The software also will run on desktop and laptop computers
via a touch screen, mouse or keyboard. Windows 8 will run
&#8220;virtually all&#8221; of the existing Windows applications, the
company said in today&#8217;s statment. 
Besides the new design, called Metro, the software also
offers the option of switching to the regular desktop look
available in Windows now. By switching to that mode, users can
employ Windows 7 apps and devices. 
Windows Store 
The software will have a Windows Store for selling apps,
and apps can work together and share information. 
Microsoft first released a version of Windows for tablet
computers in 2002, though the devices used a stylus and had few
programs tailored to the new form. Many were as large as regular
notebooks and had similar battery life. 
Tablets caught on in 2010 when Apple released the iPad,
promising 10 hours of battery life. Since then, companies
including Samsung Electronics Co. and Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc. have started selling touch-screen tablets running Google&#8217;s
Android software. 
Microsoft also said it&#8217;s approaching 450 million copies
sold of its current operating system, Windows 7.

named a new chief executive officer as it announced a new 850
million-euro ($1.16 billion) financing package.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said trading
revenue will drop about 30 percent this quarter from the prior
three months as the economy weakened and volume declined. 
Corporations pulled back from the market, particularly in
August, James Staley chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, said today at a Barclays financial-services
conference in New York. Debt and equity sales were down across
the board as were mergers and acquisitions, Staley said. 
The company earned $5.5 billion in equity and fixed-income
trading during the second quarter. Third-quarter fees from
investment banking will fall by about half, Staley said,
projecting about $1 billion in total fees compared with $1.92
billion in the second quarter. 
JPMorgan will report a &#8220;modest loss&#8221; in its private-
equity unit of about $100 million, Staley said. 
The bank&#8217;s exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and
Spain is about $14 billion, a figure that includes loans and
derivatives contracts and is mostly a mix of sovereign and bank
debt, Staley said. 
&#8220;The issue really is if there is an uncontrolled default
in Europe, to define the contagion of that is very difficult,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;What we learned in 2008 is that we are
interconnected. I don&#8217;t think any of us have been able to figure
out what the ultimate impact would be of a default in Greece.&#8221;

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, is likely to raise its dividend 19
percent as early as this week, frustrating investors who are
clamoring for a bigger payout from its $52.8 billion cash hoard. 
The projected increase -- to 19 cents a share per quarter,
from 16 cents, based on data compiled by Bloomberg -- would be
similar to last year&#8217;s rise. While Microsoft&#8217;s board is aware of
the shareholder demands, it will probably stick with the usual
increase, a person familiar with the board&#8217;s thinking said. 
Microsoft&#8217;s cash and short-term investments swelled 43
percent in the past fiscal year. With the shares losing more
than 7 percent of their value in 2011, more investors want the
company to boost its payout. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has said that Microsoft&#8217;s dividend policy is to raise
payments in line with annual gains in operating income, which
climbed 13 percent in the year that ended in June. 
&#8220;That cash is better in our hands than theirs,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker
Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.2 billion in assets,
including Microsoft shares. &#8220;I&#8217;d hope they&#8217;d raise it more.&#8221; 
In light of investor sentiment, Microsoft is considering a
larger increase, said the person familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be named because the decision is private. Still,
the board is more likely to retain its policy of raising the
payout in line with operating income, the person said. 
Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. 
Smaller Than Average? 
Microsoft has paid out about 25 percent of earnings as
dividends since starting the payments in 2003, according to
Bloomberg data. Dividend-paying companies with similar market
valuations to Microsoft are paying closer to 40 percent to 50
percent, the data show. 
Returning more cash to investors also may be hindered by
Microsoft&#8217;s overseas holdings. About $45 billion, or 85 percent,
of Microsoft&#8217;s cash and short-term investments is outside the
U.S., the company said a July 28 regulatory filing. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft would have to pay taxes if the
company brings it into the U.S. to use for dividends. 
About half of the company&#8217;s annual cash flow from
operations is generated outside the U.S., Heather Bellini, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York, said in a Sept.
6 report. That leaves about $15 billion to $17 billion available
for dividends and share repurchases in the current fiscal year,
she said. Bellini anticipates that the dividend will rise to 18
cents to 20 cents. 
Microsoft shares rose 15 cents to $25.89 yesterday on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has declined 7.2 percent this
year. 
Technology Peers 
Among technology company peers, Microsoft&#8217;s payout falls in
the middle. Intel Corp. (INTC), Sage Group Plc and SAP AG are paying a
larger portion of earnings, while Oracle Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and CA Inc. pay less, Bloomberg data show. 
Bloomberg dividend forecasts look at seven criteria,
including dividend history and public estimates. A payout
increase to 19 cents would boost the yield to 2.9 percent from
2.5 percent currently, according to Bloomberg data. 
&#8220;If Microsoft were to match its peers on payout ratios, it
would equate to a dividend yield increase to 6 percent from the
current 2.6 percent, and include an approximate doubling of the
company&#8217;s dividend,&#8221; said Neil Herman, an analyst at
Ticonderoga Securities, in a research report last month. 
The shares might surge past $35 if the board decided to
&#8220;majorly boost the company&#8217;s dividend,&#8221; Herman said.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said developers
have downloaded 500,000 copies of the preview version of Windows
8 since its debut yesterday, evidence of interest in an
operating system that will vie with Apple Inc. (AAPL) software. 
&#8220;While it&#8217;s clear we have a long way to go still with
Windows 8, we&#8217;ve been gratified by the reactions and the
interest,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today at
a conference for developers in Anaheim, California. One area
needing more work: a Windows 8 version that runs on chips with
technology from ARM Holdings Plc, which is &#8220;very, very
important to us,&#8221; Ballmer said. 
Microsoft is rushing to complete Windows 8 because the
company wants an operating system capable of running thinner,
lighter tablet machines with battery power that can rival
Apple&#8217;s iPad. That need has led the world&#8217;s largest software
maker to make its Windows personal-computer operating system
compatible with ARM-based chips for the first time. ARM
processors typically run smartphones and other mobile gadgets. 
At the conference, Microsoft gave attendees a prototype
machine running an Intel Corp. (INTC) chip rather than an ARM model, a
sign that version is farther along. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t said when
Windows 8 devices will go on sale. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 46 cents to
$26.50 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have lost 5.1 percent of their value this year. 
&#8216;Re-Imagining&#8217; Company 
While Microsoft Windows President Steven Sinofsky yesterday
said that Windows 8 &#8220;re-imagines&#8221; what Windows can do, Ballmer
today said that the effort -- as well as Microsoft&#8217;s push into
Internet-based cloud services and new types of hardware --
represent a &#8220;re-imagining&#8221; of the entire company. 
Even as it focuses on tablets, phones and cloud computing,
the company will keep Windows at the heart of its strategy,
Ballmer said. 
&#8220;Windows is at the center,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People question
whether that is a good idea. I think it&#8217;s an exceptionally good
idea.&#8221; 
Windows Phone, the mobile-phone software that Microsoft
released last year, hasn&#8217;t performed as well as Ballmer would
have liked, he said. Still, positive reception from those who
have bought the devices, as well as the support from handset
makers, gives him hope for the future, he said. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying I love where we are, but I am very
optimistic on where we can be,&#8221; Ballmer said. 
When asked if Microsoft&#8217;s Internet-search partnership with
Yahoo was at risk, given the company&#8217;s ouster of CEO Carol Bartz, Ballmer said he&#8217;s not worried. 
&#8220;The partnership will remain strong no matter where they
want to take their business or whoever they happen to install
next as CEO,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;Windows is at the center,&#8221; Ballmer said at Microsoft&#8217;s

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it
lowered forecasts for the euro versus the dollar as fiscal
tensions in the region increase. 
The shared currency will trade at $.140 at the end of the
year, down from $.145, the New York-based firm said in note to
clients today. It also reduced its six- and 12-month outlooks to
$1.45 and $1.50, from $1.50 and $1.55 respectively. Analysts led
by Thomas Stolper, chief foreign exchange strategist in London,
&#8220;continue to expect euro-dollar to rise again, albeit from a
slightly lower starting point.&#8221; 
Failure of euro area governments to calm market concern
over Greek default and contagion, relatively little additional
fiscal tightening in the U.S. and weaker-than-expected global
economic data contributed to the revisions, according to the
report. 
&#8220;The extent of the friction and the relative weakness of
the policy response was not our core scenario,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. 
The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.3754 at 4:55 p.m. in New
York from $1.3678 yesterday.

Producers of electric-car batteries
such as LG Chem Ltd. (051910) and Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) are building new
plants at such a pace that capacity will grow to almost double
automakers&#8217; demand, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report shows. 
While manufacturers will have capacity to make 35 gigawatt
hours of batteries by 2013, carmakers have committed to produce
as many as 839,000 plug-in electric vehicles needing a total of
18 gigawatt-hours of storage, the London-based researcher said. 
&#8220;The larger, mainly Asian, conglomerates can cope with
limited demand and compete by lowering prices but smaller pure-
play battery makers will be left vying for an increasingly
limited number of supply contracts,&#8221; said Ali Izadi-Najafabadi,
an energy technologies analyst at New Energy Finance. 
The glut of factories may push smaller manufacturers out of
the running for orders and into areas such as energy storage for
surplus power from electricity grids, according to today&#8217;s
report. Battery prices may also decline to $350 per kilowatt-
hour in 2020 from $800 to $1,000 now, New Energy Finance said. 
Among Asian companies best able to cope with the surplus
are LG Chem, South Korea&#8217;s biggest chemicals maker, Seoul-based
SK Innovation Co., Toshiba Corp. (6502) in Tokyo and SB LiMotive, a
joint venture between Samsung Electronics Co. and Robert Bosch
GmbH, said Shu Sun, another analyst at the research group. 
Nissan, GM 
LG Chem in April said it aims to spend 2 trillion won ($1.8
billion) by 2013 to expand its battery capacity for electric
cars. Nissan Motor Co. plans to make 500,000 batteries a year by
2015 through its Automotive Energy Supply Corp. venture. 
Nissan, based in Yokohama, Japan, and Detroit-based General
Motors Co. (GM) both began selling new electric cars in December.
Battery making has surged in the U.S., where spending under the
government&#8217;s Recovery Act has channeled about $2.4 billion into
the products, their components and charging infrastructure for
vehicles, according to U.S. Department of Energy figures. 
The U.S. is set to hold as much as 40 percent of capacity
by 2015, up from 2 percent before the stimulus, according to the
energy department. Of companies receiving funding, Ener1 Inc. (HEV)&#8217;s
EnerDel unit is expected to struggle the most, Sun said. It
received a grant of $118.5 million for a plant in Indianapolis. 
Brian Sinderson, a spokesman for Ener1, didn&#8217;t immediately
reply to an e-mail and voicemail seeking comment. 
The department also provided $299.2 million for a Johnson
Controls factory in Holland, Michigan, the largest grant under
the program. Waltham, Massachusetts-based A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) got
$249.1 million for plant at Romulus and Brownstown in the state.

fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will shut its Global Alpha
fund after clients pulled money from the quantitative trading
pool that was once the firm&#8217;s largest hedge fund. 
Global Alpha will stop charging fees at the end of this
month and aims to finish liquidating most assets by mid-October,
according to a letter that Goldman Sachs Asset Management sent
to clients Sept. 14. The fund, which managed $11 billion of
assets in 2007, had less than $1.7 billion at the end of June,
according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the numbers aren&#8217;t public. 
Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, has been shrinking Global Alpha since
2007 when it lost 40 percent because of bad bets on currencies,
equities and bonds worldwide. The fund&#8217;s co-managers Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski quit in March 2009, and Katinka Domotorffy took charge of the quantitative investment strategies
unit, which uses computers to pick securities and oversees $56
billion. 
Reuters reported yesterday that the Global Alpha fund was
down 12 percent through the end of August, and the Wall Street
Journal reported that it was being shut. Ed Canaday, a spokesman
for the New York-based bank, confirmed the letter&#8217;s contents and
said he couldn&#8217;t comment on the performance. 
Lehman Claims 
Domotorffy is leaving at year-end and being replaced by new
managers, including Armen Avanessians, a partner who has served
on the securities division&#8217;s executive committee since 2003,
according to a separate letter to investors Sept. 14. Ron Hua,
who oversaw $12 billion of equity assets at PanAgora Asset
Management Inc., was hired as chief investment officer and head
of the quantitative equity alpha business. 
Goldman Sachs wrote in the letter that it aims to
distribute 85 percent to 90 percent of the total proceeds from
the fund&#8217;s assets to clients by the end of October. The fund&#8217;s
claims against Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which declared
bankruptcy three years ago, may take longer and the fund may
have liabilities to Lehman as well, according to the letter. 
&#8220;We have extensively reviewed the fund&#8217;s claims against,
and potential liabilities to, Lehman Brothers and intend to
vigorously pursue a resolution with Lehman Brothers that is in
the best interests of investors in the fund,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
wrote. &#8220;We cannot predict when the fund will be able to make
final distributions, if any, to investors in the fund.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs is aiming to build the fund-management unit
and improve its performance. The overall business had $844
billion under management at the end of June and generated 13
percent of the firm&#8217;s revenue in this year&#8217;s first six months. 
Asset Management Moves 
Avanessians, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and became a
partner in 1994, is the latest executive to move into asset
management from other parts of the bank. Jim O&#8217;Neill, the chief
economist, was appointed chairman of asset management last year.
The investment unit&#8217;s co-heads, Timothy J. O&#8217;Neill and Edward C. Forst, came from other divisions. 
Bill Fallon, who became chief investment officer and head
of alpha strategies when Domotorffy took over, will cede the
equity business to Hua and focus on quantitative macro funds,
according to the letter. Don Mulvihill will remain chief
investment officer and head of customized beta strategies,
Goldman Sachs said. Both will report to Avanessians, who will be
based in New York. He will report to O&#8217;Neill and Forst, who
signed the letter. 
Domotorffy joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 as a portfolio
manager and researcher with the quantitative global macro and
fixed-income teams, according to the letter. She became head of
strategy for the quantitative investment strategies group in
2007 before taking the leadership role two years later. 
Carhart is now running Kepos Capital Management LP, which
has $150 million under management and has made a 9 percent
return so far this year, before fees, according to a person
familiar with the matter.

John Mack will cede his chairman
role at Morgan Stanley to Chief Executive Officer James Gorman
on Jan. 1, capping a 35-year career at the firm that included
record losses and a government bailout. 
Mack, 66, is completing the two years he promised to serve
in the job when he ceded the CEO title to Gorman, 53, at the end
of 2009. He will leave the board to become a senior adviser, the
New York-based company said yesterday in a statement. 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, more
than tripled net income last year, boosted by gains in both the
investment bank where Mack spent most of his career and the
retail brokerage that Gorman ran when he joined in 2006. 
&#8220;From the board&#8217;s point of view, Gorman has proved himself
as an executive,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. who recommends buying Morgan Stanley (MS) stock and
once served as its treasurer. &#8220;He&#8217;s embraced both sides of the
firm, and the firm doesn&#8217;t have the internal dissension issues
that existed before.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley was the world&#8217;s largest securities firm when
Mack returned after a four-year absence in June 2005 to replace
CEO Philip J. Purcell, who left under pressure from investors
and employees. Mack&#8217;s efforts to boost trading revenue as well
as businesses including private equity and mortgage-bond
underwriting backfired when the company posted its first
quarterly loss in 2007 and the global credit crunch toppled
smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
Taxpayer Bailout 
The company sold stakes to China Investment Corp. and
Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to raise capital
and converted to a bank in 2008. Morgan Stanley also took $107
billion of Federal Reserve emergency loans, more than any other
company, during the financial crisis. 
&#8220;His contributions to the firm are innumerable, but none
was more critical than the leadership he provided in guiding
Morgan Stanley through a financial crisis that claimed many of
our peers,&#8221; Gorman said in the statement. &#8220;For more than 30
years, he has helped to define the firm&#8217;s distinctive culture
and build our franchise across the globe.&#8221; 
Mack said in 2009 that he considers his own greatest
accomplishment to be leading the firm through the 2008 crisis,
which wiped out Lehman Brothers and led Bear Stearns Cos. and
Merrill Lynch  Co. to be sold to larger companies. 
&#8220;I said to my wife, when things were really crazy, &#8216;You
know, there&#8217;s a chance I will lose this firm,&#8217;&#8221; Mack said in a
2009 interview. &#8220;But I would rather be doing this than sitting
on a beach reading a book.&#8221; 
Strategy Shift 
Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz,
Florida, said that Mack changed strategy too many times at
Morgan Stanley as he reacted to circumstances. 
&#8220;It created a company which had no clear vision of where
it was going,&#8221; Bove said. &#8220;Overall, I would have to say his
tutelage of the company was not effective.&#8221; 
In giving Gorman the chairman job, Morgan Stanley is ending
a two-year experiment in separating the two positions. Bank of
America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the biggest- and third-biggest
U.S. banks by assets, have separated the two jobs. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the second- and fifth-
largest U.S. banks, have a single executive serving both roles. 
The company gained $1.11, or 7.2 percent, to $16.59 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. and was the
second biggest gainer in the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Financials Index after Lincoln National Corp. Morgan Stanley
stock is still down more than 40 percent this year. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what his legacy will be,&#8221; said Kenneth Crawford, a senior portfolio manager at Argent Capital
Management LLC in St. Louis, which oversees about $1.2 billion
and doesn&#8217;t own Morgan Stanley stock. Mack &#8220;came back and then
allegedly resurrected Morgan Stanley and then took enough risk
that his company was on the brink.&#8221;

Carolina Lightcap resigned
unexpectedly as president of Disney Channels Worldwide after
less than two years on the job. 
Gary Marsh was named president and chief creative officer
of the unit, Burbank, California-based Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said
today in an e-mailed statement. 
The move puts children&#8217;s networks including Disney Channel
and Disney XD into the hands of the creator of some of its
biggest shows, including &#8220;Hannah Montana&#8221; and &#8220;High School
Musical.&#8221; Lightcap, plucked from Disney Channels&#8217; Latin
American operations in November 2009, said she was leaving with
some Disney cable channels&#8217; ratings at their highest ever. 
&#8220;I readily embrace change as a good thing, and really look
forward to the next chapter of my career,&#8221; Lightcap said in a
letter to her staff. 
The departure by Lightcap, an 11-year Disney veteran who
had headed marketing in Latin America, is the second high-level
resignation at Disney this month. 
On Sept. 6, Andrew P. Mooney resigned as chairman of the
consumer products unit to seek a larger executive role. 
The Disney Channel&#8217;s ratings were up by 10 percent in the
company&#8217;s most recent quarter, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said in a Aug. 9 earnings conference call. Ratings at XD
channel, which is targeted at boys, increased by 24 percent. 
For the period ended July 2, the worldwide Disney Channel
operation contributed to the company&#8217;s 11 percent increase in
operating earnings for its media networks unit, which includes
the ESPN sports channel, Disney said on Aug. 9. 
&#8216;Phineas and Ferb&#8217; 
Marsh, who was president of entertainment and chief
creative officer at Disney Channels, most recently developed the
&#8220;Phineas and Ferb&#8221; franchise. A movie based on the characters,
&#8220;Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension,&#8221; was cable TV&#8217;s
most-watched movie this past summer, Disney said on Aug. 6. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s largest theme-park company and the
owner of Pixar and Marvel movie studios, rose 65 cents to $32.94
today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have declined 12 percent this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s David Kostin slashed his year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index by 11 percent to 1,250, citing continued uncertainty
in the global markets due to Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. 
Kostin, the equity strategist at the firm, previously
predicted the benchmark equity index would climb to 1,400. This
was Kostin&#8217;s second SP 500 forecast reduction in the past two
months, following his shift from 1,450 on Aug. 5. 
&#8220;The unstable macro environment is likely to persist for
the foreseeable future because Europe currently lacks both the
institutional structure and policy tools to solve the festering
sovereign debt crisis,&#8221; the New York-based strategist wrote in
a report dated yesterday. &#8220;Investors believe a nontrivial
probability exists that the crisis will trigger a global
financial dislocation similar to 2008.&#8221; 
Investors have fled risky assets since July amid concern
European officials may fail to contain the region&#8217;s debt crisis
and the U.S. economy will slip into a recession, sending yields
on 10-year Treasuries to a record low and pushing the SP 500
down as much as 18 percent from its April high. Goldman Sachs is
the third Wall Street firm to cut its forecast for stocks this
week, following Wells Fargo  Co. and Barclays Plc. 
Kostin kept his estimates on earnings by companies in the
SP 500 at $96 a share this year and $102 in 2012. The index
rose 1.7 percent to 1,209.11 at 4 p.m. New York time, the fourth
straight day of gains amid optimism Europe is working to tame
the credit crisis. The European Central Bank said today it will
lend dollars to euro-area banks in a series of three-month loans
to ensure they have enough of the U.S. currency through the end
of the year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMC Mortgage
unit was sued by Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the trustee for a mortgage
portfolio, for refusing to buy back more than 800 defective home
loans. 
EMC rejected &#8220;repeated repurchase demands&#8221; for the loans
in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in a public version of the
complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. The case was initially filed under seal. 
&#8220;The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of
defaults and foreclosures,&#8221; Wells Fargo said in the complaint.
&#8220;Approximately three-quarters of the loans in the trust have
been modified or liquidated, or are now seriously delinquent.&#8221; 
The complaint is the second Wells Fargo has filed as
trustee against EMC. The trustee settled a suit brought in
January after EMC agreed to turn over files for more than 2,000
underlying mortgages in the trust. 
Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. 
A review of 948 loan files revealed that at least 840, or
about 89 percent, failed to comply with EMC&#8217;s representations
and warranties, according to the complaint. As many as 1,503
mortgage loans are subject to repurchase, Wells Fargo said. 
Of those 1,503 loans, 49 percent already have been
liquidated, according to a letter filed as an exhibit to the
complaint. Principal losses on those loans, including accrued
interest, total about $214.4 million, according to the letter. 
About 51 percent of the loans are still held by the trust,
with an outstanding balance of about $344.5 million, according
to the letter. 
The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage LLC, CA6861,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said new managers will run
the quantitative funds unit and that Katinka Domotorffy is
retiring after 13 years at the firm. 
Armen Avanessians, a partner who has served on the
securities division&#8217;s executive committee since 2003, will head
the global quantitative business within asset management, the
New York-based company said in a letter to clients yesterday.
Ron Hua, who oversaw $12 billion of equity assets at PanAgora
Asset Management Inc., was hired as chief investment officer and
head of the quantitative equity alpha business. 
Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is aiming to build the firm&#8217;s fund-management
unit and improve its performance. The business had $844 billion
under management at the end of June and generated 13 percent of
the firm&#8217;s revenue in the first six months of this year. 
Avanessians, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and became a
partner in 1994, is the latest executive to move into asset
management from other parts of the bank. Jim O&#8217;Neill, the chief
economist, was appointed chairman of asset management last year.
The investment unit&#8217;s co-heads, Timothy J. O&#8217;Neill and Edward C. Forst, came from other divisions. 
Domotorffy took charge of the quant-funds unit, which uses
computer models to pick securities to trade, after co-heads Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski quit in March 2009. Carhart and
Iwanowski had managed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Global Alpha fund, which
was the firm&#8217;s largest hedge fund before sustaining losses and
client redemptions in 2007 and 2008. 
Beta Strategies 
Bill Fallon, who became chief investment officer and head
of alpha strategies when Domotorffy took over, will cede the
equity business to Hua and focus on quantitative macro funds,
according to the letter. Don Mulvihill will remain chief
investment officer and head of customized beta strategies,
Goldman Sachs said. Both will report to Avanessians, who will be
based in New York. 
Avanessians will report to O&#8217;Neill and Forst, who signed
the letter. Its contents were confirmed by Ed Canaday, a company
spokesman. The moves were reported yesterday by Reuters. 
Domotorffy joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 as a portfolio
manager and researcher with the quantitative global macro and
fixed-income teams, according to the letter. She became head of
strategy for the quantitative investment strategies group in
2007 before taking the leadership role two years later. 
Goldman Sachs gained $3.25, or 3.1 percent, to $107.79 at
1:18 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock had fallen 38 percent this year through yesterday.

Wall Street banks seeking to unload
commercial mortgages amassed before Europe&#8217;s sovereign crisis
deepened and a slowing economy rattled markets are getting a
reprieve from rising yields after Morgan Stanley sold bonds
yesterday that demonstrated demand for the debt. 
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. sold the top-
ranked 10-year portion of a $1.5 billion bond offering at 185
basis points more than the benchmark swap rate yesterday after
marketing the debt earlier at as much as 215, a person familiar
with the offering said. Similar debt that Deutsche Bank AG and
UBS AG sold last month paid a spread of 200. 
Relative yields on securities tied to offices, hotels and
shopping centers have been hovering at about the highest levels
since June 2010 as investors shun riskier assets amid concern a
Greek default may infect European lenders and as economists
lower U.S. growth forecasts. Banks have pulled back from making
new loans to package into bonds as price swings erode profit
margins on the deals. 
&#8220;This momentum certainly would encourage banks, but it
takes a few more pricings to demonstrate a trend,&#8221; said Jeffrey Berenbaum, a commercial-mortgage debt analyst at Citigroup Inc.
in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of taking a step back to see how
things settle before looking to continue lending.&#8221; 
Barren Pipeline 
While lenders are poised to sell as much as $6 billion of
stockpiled debt through October, the rest of the year may have
no offerings, Bank of America analysts said in a Sept. 9 report.
More than $24 billion of the debt has been raised in 2011,
following $11.5 billion last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. 
JPMorgan is marketing a $1 billion issue, according to
people familiar with the sale. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo  Co., Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc and Deutsche Bank AG are also arranging transactions, the
people said. 
Elsewhere in credit markets, a benchmark gauge of U.S.
corporate credit risk fell for a third day from a two-year high.
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 2.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 126.4 basis points as of 12:03 p.m. in New York,
according to Markit Group Ltd. 
The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has decreased from 135.9
basis points on Sept. 12, its highest level since July 2009.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt. 
Commercial Paper 
U.S. commercial paper outstanding declined $22.6 billion
to $1.043 trillion in the week ended Sept. 14, the Federal
Reserve said today on its website. That&#8217;s the lowest level since
the market, which has fallen for nine straight weeks, reached
$1.042 trillion in the period ended Feb. 16, according to Fed
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The commercial-mortgage bond offering from Morgan Stanley
and Bank of America is composed of 63 loans on 76 properties,
the person said. Retail property debt accounts for 46.3 percent
of the offering and office debt is about 30 percent. Loans in
Texas and California account for 31.2 percent of the pool. 
Wider Spreads 
The securities were priced as German and French leaders
expressed support for Greece remaining in the euro monetary
union and speculation that China may help the region&#8217;s most-
indebted nations. 
Political and economic turmoil drove relative yields on
top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds to 303 basis points more
than Treasuries on Aug. 25, the most since June 2010, before
narrowing to 291 yesterday, according to Barclays Plc index
data. 
Spreads climbed from this year&#8217;s low of 178 on April 26 as
Fed auctions of mortgage securities assumed in the rescue of
American International Group Inc. weighed on credit markets. The
selloff was exacerbated in July as the sovereign-debt crisis
engulfed Italy and lawmakers in Washington clashed over raising
the U.S. debt ceiling, leading SP to cut America&#8217;s top credit
grade on Aug. 5. 
Economists are lowering their growth forecasts for the U.S.
Gross domestic product will expand 1.7 percent this year, less
than the May forecast of 2.8 percent, according to a survey by
the National Association for Business Economics issued Sept. 12
in Washington. 
Delinquencies Fall 
Commercial-mortgage bond sales have tumbled from a record
$234 billion in 2007. A dropoff in new lending may make it
harder for some borrowers to refinance maturing loans, according
to the Bank of America analysts led by Alan Todd. 
&#8220;Borrowers with less capital or less attractive properties
will obviously have fewer options,&#8221; the New York-based analysts
wrote. &#8220;It is likely that the trend of liquidating smaller
loans and modifying and extending larger loans will persist.&#8221; 
Delinquencies, which climbed to a record 9.01 percent in
July, fell 36 basis points last month, according to Fitch
Ratings. 
Banks have increased the so-called credit enhancement,
which protects AAA bondholders from losses, to 30 percent on
deals offered since last month as investors pushed back on terms
and demanded higher yields. That compares with 16.875 percent on
a $1.48 billion transaction from Wells Fargo and Royal Bank of
Scotland in July. 
&#8216;Nice Pickup&#8217; 
The additional investor protection coupled with property
valuations in recent deals compares favorably with bonds sold in
2005, while offering a &#8220;nice pickup&#8221; in spread and yield, said
James Grady, a managing director at Deutsche Asset Management in
New York, including commercial-mortgage debt. 
&#8220;This is a trade that makes sense and you will see
investors take advantage of this opportunity while it lasts,&#8221;
Grady said. 
The slide in the safest classes of commercial-mortgage
bonds has made the debt attractive relative to other fixed-
income investments, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Timothy J. Sloan said in a Sept. 12 conference call with analysts. 
&#8220;Spreads blew out pretty significantly over the past few
months,&#8221; Sloan said, referring to the most senior portions of
commercial-mortgage securities. &#8220;That&#8217;s not the only class that
we think is attractive, but we definitely want to be able to
take advantage of opportunities.&#8221;

Brent crude and copper may rally as
global economic growth led by emerging markets remains adequate
to drive an expansion in raw-materials demand, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) said, sticking with forecasts for price gains. 
&#8220;We remain constructive on commodities,&#8221; Allison Nathan,
an analyst at Goldman for more than a decade, said in an
interview today. Still, &#8220;risks to our bullish views have
risen,&#8221; said Nathan, citing Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt problems
and a &#8220;mixed bag&#8221; of economic data from the United States. 
Goldman&#8217;s position contrasts with the outlook from Societe
Generale SA&#8217;s global asset-allocation team, which said
commodities are in a &#8220;danger zone&#8221; as growth slows, according
to a report distributed yesterday. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
Spot Index of 24 commodities has shed 14 percent since April 11
on speculation that the global recovery is faltering. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen emerging-markets demand for key commodities,
including oil, holding up well,&#8221; Nathan said in Singapore.
There haven&#8217;t yet been signs that the economic woes in developed
markets are spreading to emerging economies, she said. 
Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April, then turned bullish in May before prices rebounded.
Last month, the bank forecast gains for Brent crude, zinc, and
other commodities over the next 12 months, analysts led by
Jeffrey Currie said in an Aug. 8 report. 
Copper may climb to $11,000 per metric ton, while Brent
gains to $130 a barrel, the report said. Three-month copper on
the London Metal Exchange, which reached a record $10,190 per
ton in February, traded at $8,660 per ton at 4:10 p.m. in
Singapore, while Brent was at $112.60 per barrel. 
Greek Rescue 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said yesterday that they are &#8220;convinced&#8221; Greece
will stay in the euro area, boosting equity and metals prices.
European governments are aiming to ratify a July 21 accord to
bolster a bailout fund and extend a second rescue to Greece. 
Investor skittishness over the spread of Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis combined with signs that U.S. growth may be slowing have
roiled markets worldwide. Recent data have shown U.S. retail
sales were unchanged in August, while the economy generated no
jobs and earnings fell. 
&#8220;If we see weakness spreading on a global basis, that
would be a catalyst to expect a weaker demand environment and
potentially weaker prices relative to our forecast,&#8221; Nathan
said in the interview. &#8216;If there was a crisis in the European
banking sector, a crisis akin to 2008 could occur and that would
have a large impact on commodity prices.&#8221; 
China Forecasts 
Still, Goldman economists forecast that China&#8217;s economic
growth may be 9.2 percent next year, compared with an estimate
of 9.3 percent for this year, according to Nathan. The nation is
the world&#8217;s largest user of metals and energy. 
Low inventories of aluminum, copper and steel in China are
an indicator that demand in the country &#8220;isn&#8217;t that bad,&#8221;
Julian Zhu, a Goldman analyst, said at a media briefing in
Singapore today. Traders and investors have been concerned that
rising interest rates and a credit-tightening policy in the
nation may lead to slower consumption of raw materials. 
&#8220;The Chinese government is very flexible and if they need,
they can reverse the tightening policy very fast,&#8221; said Zhu.
&#8220;This could be very supportive to demand for commodities
because investment by local governments at all levels will see a
Rebound,&#8221; said Zhu. 
Societe Generale&#8217;s report said that there may be a
&#8220;meaningful drop&#8221; in prices of so-called cyclical commodities
such as oil and copper. Gold may rally from an increase in risk
aversion, according to the report.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) was hired to advise Huawei Technologies Co. on branding
strategy as the Chinese telecommunications gear supplier expands
into tablet computers, smartphones and cloud computing. 
The project involves 25 consultants from the world&#8217;s
biggest computer-services provider and is expected to be
completed by the end of November, Ross Gan, a Huawei spokesman,
said in an interview today. Harriet Ip, a spokeswoman for
Armonk, New York-based IBM in Singapore, confirmed the
arrangement by phone today. Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not a traditional branding project where they tell
us how the brand should be positioned,&#8221; Gan said in a phone
interview from Huawei&#8217;s headquarters in Shenzhen, southern
China. &#8220;It&#8217;s more from the management-of-the-process point of
view: How do I manage the brand function within the
organization? Who is responsible for what?&#8221; 
Huawei is expanding its 13-year relationship with IBM as it
seeks to more than triple sales to $100 billion in the next 10
years by expanding into consumer digital devices and enterprise
computing. The thrust requires closely held Huawei to promote to
consumers, businesses and government agencies, including those
in the U.S., where efforts to buy rivals have been rebuffed amid
allegations the company threatens national security. 
The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.
in February told Huawei, founded in 1988 by former Chinese army
officer Ren Zhengfei, to divest its purchase of 3Leaf Systems
after lawmakers said the deal threatened national security. 
Bids Thwarted 
3Leaf, founded in 2004, developed technology for cloud
computing that lets businesses and government agencies move
applications and programs such as e-mail to remote networks
owned and operated by a third party. Huawei was also thwarted in
bids to buy 2Wire and Motorola Inc.&#8217;s wireless business last
year, and 3Com Corp. in 2008. 
Huawei has said its employees own the company and China&#8217;s
government and military don&#8217;t hold any shares. Ren has had no
connection to the military since he retired from service more
than two decades ago, according to Huawei. 
Huawei in April unveiled plans for the thrust into consumer
devices, including tablets, smartphones and &#8220;enterprise
computing,&#8221; setting up computer and communication networks for
businesses and government agencies. 
Enterprise Computing 
The company said at the time it expects enterprise
computing revenue to grow to as much as $20 billion within five
years, from $2 billion last year. Sales of mobile devices may
rise to $20 billion in the same period from $5 billion last
year. 
Huawei&#8217;s relationship with IBM started in 1998 when Ren
began traveling to the U.S., Europe and Japan to learn
international best practices as his company expanded globally. 
In 1999, the Chinese company added collaboration on
research and development and supply chain management to IBM&#8217;s
roles. Human resources management was added in 2005 and
financial management in 2007. The new contract is the first for
work on brand strategy from Huawei, Ip of IBM said. 
&#8220;IBM has a very strong branding strategy,&#8221; Ip said.
&#8220;After several rounds of doing this ourselves, we have the
expertise to help clients as well. That&#8217;s something we can share
with Huawei and our other clients.&#8221; 
Huawei won its first contract outside China in 1997. It
achieved international sales of more than $100 million by 2000,
and overseas business exceeded contracts in China for the first
time in 2005, according to data supplied by the company.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
exited a money losing bet that the dollar would weaken against a
basket of currencies after turmoil in European markets and
broader risk aversion added to the greenback&#8217;s refuge appeal.  
The trade was &#8220;stopped out&#8221; after a loss of 2.3 percent,
the New York-based securities firm said in a note today. On Aug.
10, Goldman recommended betting against the dollar with a basket
of currencies comprised of the New Zealand dollar, Russian
ruble, Swedish krona, South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit and
Chilean peso.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) plan to offer $1.7 billion in securities tied to
commercial mortgages, resuscitating a deal that was withdrawn
after Standard  Poor&#8217;s withdrew its ratings. 
The debt will be marketed to investors next week, according
to people familiar with the offering who declined to be
identified because the deal hasn&#8217;t been announced. The issue was
originally $1.5 billion. 
The transaction was pulled after it was placed with buyers
in July, rankling investors and bankers in the $600 billion
market. The banks canceled the issue on July 28 after SP said
it was halting its ratings of commercial-mortgage bonds because
of potential flaws in its models. The New York-based rating
company resumed grading the securities on Aug. 5, saying the
impact on ratings of the inconsistencies would be &#8220;generally
modest.&#8221; 
The offering adds to more than $24 billion of the debt
issued in 2011, following $11.5 billion last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its
forecasts for the euro versus the dollar amid signs the European
Central Bank&#8217;s focus on inflation has faded and as leaders
disagree over approaches to the region&#8217;s debt crisis. 
The 17-nation currency will trade at $1.38 at year-end,
compared with an earlier forecast of $1.45, strategists John Normand and Thomas Anthonj wrote today in a client note. The
euro will fetch $1.40 in June 2012, compared with the previous
estimate of $1.48, they wrote. 
JPMorgan lowered its projections &#8220;to reflect ECB&#8217;s
dovishness and internal dissent over bond purchases,&#8221; the
London-based strategists wrote. 
The euro weakened 0.6 percent to $1.3792 today in New York,
paring a weekly advance to 1 percent. 
The New York-based financial firm joined banks including
BNP Paribas SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and
Nomura Holdings Inc. in lowering year-end targets for the euro
this month. 
JPMorgan disagrees &#8220;with the emerging consensus that the
euro will trend lower over the next year,&#8221; Normand and Anthonj
wrote in their note. 
While Europe faces an &#8220;enormous&#8221; funding challenge next
year, authorities also have put programs in place to manage the
debt crisis in peripheral countries, they wrote. There is
potential for the Federal Reserve to buy more Treasuries, and
the U.S. fiscal position will likely deteriorate if even parts
of President Barack Obama jobs program are approved, they wrote. 
Inflation Risks Eased 
The ECB said yesterday in its monthly bulletin that threats
to euro-area growth have intensified and inflation risks have
eased, signaling policy makers may take further action should
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis worsen. They raised they benchmark rate to
1.5 percent in July. 
The central bank has purchased 143 billion euros ($197
billion) of bonds to curb the euro region&#8217;s debt crisis,
starting with Greece, Portugal and Ireland last year and
widening to Italy and Spain in August. Germany&#8217;s Juergen Stark
resigned from the ECB&#8217;s board last week in protest of the bond
program, which he said blurs the line between monetary and
fiscal policy.

Kweku Adoboli, the UBS AG (UBSN) trader
arrested in London yesterday, admitted to causing losses while
the bank&#8217;s risk-control officers were examining his trades, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. 
UBS said yesterday it suffered a loss of about $2 billion
from &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; trading. 
Adoboli hired lawyers at Kingsley Napley in London to
represent him, a spokeswoman said today in a phone interview. 
The firm previously advised Nick Leeson, who caused the
collapse of Barings Plc with $1.4 billion in losses in 1995.
Leeson, a former derivatives trader, caused the demise of
Britain&#8217;s oldest merchant bank after losses on the futures and
options markets in Singapore and Osaka, Japan, were uncovered. 
UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, asked British police at 1
a.m. to arrest Adoboli before notifying the U.K. financial
regulator or prosecutors, according to two people familiar with
the matter. 
The Financial Services Authority was notified shortly after
police. Prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office, which also
handles white-collar crime, weren&#8217;t contacted at all, according
to the people, who declined to be identified because the
investigations are private. 
The investigation highlights the fragmented financial crime
enforcement agencies in the U.K. with jurisdictions that often
overlap. That UBS went straight to police after learning about a
$2 billion loss on trades indicates that the 31-year-old Adoboli
may have been a flight risk, or that the bank wanted to distance
itself from any crime, said Lindsay Thomas, a financial
regulation adviser at Sustainable Risks. 
UBS wants &#8220;to suggest that it was a terrible criminal act,
and that they were a victim,&#8221; Thomas said in a phone interview
in London. 
The City of London police arrested Adoboli at a business
address in London at 3:30 a.m. on suspicion of fraud and abuse
of position in connection with unauthorized trading at UBS&#8217;s
investment bank. Police declined to identify the address.
Adoboli remains in custody during the probe, Commander Ian Dyson
said yesterday. 
UBS is still investigating the matter, the Zurich-based
bank said in a statement. No client positions were affected, and
it may be unprofitable in the third quarter because of the loss,
UBS said, declining to comment further.

New Suits 
ETF Securities Sued by Former Executive in U.K. Over Bonus 
ETF Securities Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest provider of
exchange-traded commodity funds, was sued in London by a former
employee who says he is owed a stake in the company tied to a
2006 bonus award. 
Stefan Garcia, now an executive at another ETF firm, said
the bonus gave him options to buy 1,000 shares of the company at
49.99 pounds ($79) with no time limit, according to U.K. court
documents filed in July. 
ETF Securities, based in Jersey, is considering selling as
much as $1 billion in shares through an initial public offering
amid growing investor demand for exchange-traded products,
according to a May report in the Wall Street Journal that cited
unidentified bankers familiar with the matter. 
Graham Tuckwell, chairman and chief executive officer of
ETF Securities, said in a phone interview the case was
&#8220;absolutely without merit.&#8221; He said the claim was based on a
&#8220;small administrative error&#8221; and the options had expired. 
Garcia was awarded the options because at that early stage
the company had &#8220;limited cash to fund its growth,&#8221; according
to documents filed by his lawyers. Tuckwell sent Garcia an e-
mail in May refusing to allow him to exercise the options. 
Mark Levine, a partner at London law firm Mishcon de Reya
who is representing Garcia, said his client had a multimillion-
pound claim and declined to comment further. 
The case is Cherrin v. ETF Security Ltd., HQ11X02645, High
Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division. 
JPMorgan Unit Must Buy Back $558 Million in Loans, Suit Says 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMC Mortgage unit was sued by Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), the trustee for a mortgage portfolio, for refusing
to buy back more than 800 defective home loans. 
EMC rejected &#8220;repeated repurchase demands&#8221; for the loans
in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in a public version of the
complaint filed Sept. 14 in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. The case was initially filed under seal. 
&#8220;The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of
defaults and foreclosures,&#8221; Wells Fargo said in the complaint.
&#8220;Approximately three-quarters of the loans in the trust have
been modified or liquidated, or are now seriously delinquent.&#8221; 
The complaint is the second Wells Fargo has filed as
trustee against EMC. The trustee settled a suit brought in
January after EMC agreed to turn over files for more than 2,000
underlying mortgages in the trust. 
A review of 948 loan files revealed that at least 840, or
about 89 percent, failed to comply with EMC&#8217;s representations
and warranties, according to the complaint. 
Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. 
The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage LLC, CA6861,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). 
U.K. to Sue ECB Over Planned Restrictions on Clearing Houses 
Britain will sue the European Central Bank over plans to
prevent some euro-denominated securities from being cleared
outside the 17 countries that share the currency, in the first
such move by a government. 
The U.K. planned to present a legal challenge against the
ECB over its location policy for clearing houses at the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the Treasury in London said in
an e-mailed statement Sept. 14. 
&#8220;It does seem to indicate a possible change in the
approach that the U.K. is taking to Europe,&#8221; Darren Fox, a
financial services lawyer at Simmons  Simmons LLP, said in a
telephone interview in London. &#8220;There has been a perception in
the City that the U.K. hasn&#8217;t been doing as much in Europe as it
could have done to protect the interests of the U.K. financial-
services industry. Perhaps this is a sign that the worm is
turning.&#8221; 
It&#8217;s the first time any European government has sought to
sue the ECB, the Treasury said. The U.K. is accusing the central
bank of going against principles of the European Union single
market and contravening European law amid wider international
efforts to regulate derivatives markets. 
A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based ECB declined to
comment.

Express Scripts Sues Walgreen Over Medicare Patients 
Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) sued Walgreen Co. for what it called a
&#8220;campaign to disparage&#8221; the pharmacy-benefits manager in an
illegal attempt to wrest away customers. 
Walgreen, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, is using false
advertising to encourage Medicare patients to leave Express
Scripts in violation of a contract that expires Dec. 31, St.
Louis-based Express Scripts said in a Sept. 7 complaint filed in
federal court in Chicago. Express Scripts said it will suffer
&#8220;irreparable damage&#8221; unless the court issues an injunction
stopping Walgreen&#8217;s action. 
Walgreen, of Deerfield, Illinois, said in June that it will
not participate in Express Scripts&#8217; pharmacy network next year
because negotiations collapsed on renewing the contract worth
more than $5 billion in annual drug sales. A website sponsored
by Walgreen says Medicare recipients who remain with Express
Scripts won&#8217;t be able to fill Part D prescriptions after Dec.
31. 
&#8220;This is false and highly misleading because nothing will
prohibit Walgreen from continuing to fill valid prescriptions
for such members after Dec. 31, 2011, even if Walgreen is not a
part of Express Scripts&#8217; pharmacy network,&#8221; Express Scripts
said in the complaint. 
Walgreen has asked the court to stay the proceedings,
saying in a Sept. 12 motion that Express Scripts brought its
claims in the wrong forum because the contract requires the
parties to resolve such disputes through binding arbitration. 
&#8220;We think that it is important to inform our patients and
the public how this may impact their ability to fill
prescriptions at Walgreen next year if Express Scripts serves as
the pharmacy-benefit manager for their particular health care
plans, and we regret that Express Scripts has resorted to
litigation in an effort to stop us,&#8221; Michael Polzin, a
spokesman for Walgreen, said Sept. 14 in an e-mail. &#8220;We
obviously intend to vigorously defend against their suit.&#8221; 
The case is Express Scripts Inc. v. Walgreen Co. (WAG), 11-cv-
06223, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
BP Investors&#8217; Derivative Spill Suits Dismissed by U.S. Judge 
BP Plc (BP/) won&#8217;t have to face some lawsuits in the U.S. brought
by institutional investors on behalf of the company over last
year&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico drilling-rig explosion and oil spill, a
federal judge ruled. 
U.S. District Judge Keith P. Ellison in Houston agreed with
BP&#8217;s arguments that the claims should be filed in U.K. courts
because the company is based in London. Ellison said he may
reverse this dismissal if English courts &#8220;refuse to accept
jurisdiction&#8221; for reasons other than the plaintiffs&#8217; failure to
comply with procedural requirements. 
&#8220;Because this derivative lawsuit involves the internal
governance of an English corporation, the convenience of the
parties and the interests of justice favor England as a more
convenient forum,&#8221; Ellison said yesterday in a 31-page
decision. 
Investors sued BP claiming that the company&#8217;s management
and board caused the spill by knowingly putting profits ahead of
safety. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April 2010 while
drilling a BP well off the Louisiana coast, killing 11 and
spilling more than 4.1 million barrels of oil. 
The investors&#8217; suits, so-called derivative claims brought
on behalf of the company, are combined with other shareholder
actions before Ellison in Houston. Lawsuits seeking money for
economic and personal injuries from the spill are consolidated
before a different U.S. judge in New Orleans. 
&#8220;The primary concern of this derivative litigation is the
internal affairs of an English corporation, and the suit seeks
to recover damages for the benefit of BP only,&#8221; Ellison said in
his ruling. &#8220;English law governs this dispute and will
determine whether the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary duties and harmed BP in the process.&#8221; 
BP spokesmen Scott Dean and Daren Beaudo didn&#8217;t immediately
return phone or e-mail messages seeking comment on the ruling
after regular business hours. Mark Lebovitch and Lewis Kahn,
investor attorneys, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking
comment. 
The case is In re BP Shareholder Derivative Litigation,
4:10-cv-03447, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). 
Lions Gate Suit Against Carl Icahn Voluntarily Dismissed 
Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)&#8217;s lawsuit against
billionaire investor Carl Icahn in Manhattan federal court was
voluntarily dismissed by both sides. 
Lions Gate, an independent producer of films including
&#8220;Precious&#8221; and &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; and the &#8220;Mad Men&#8221;
television series, sued Icahn in October, claiming he tried to
interfere with the studio&#8217;s plan to merge with Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer Inc. 
In papers filed with the court yesterday, both sides said
the case is being dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can&#8217;t be
reinstituted. The papers didn&#8217;t say whether the dismissal is
part of any settlement in the case. 
In March, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer dismissed most of
Lions Gate&#8217;s allegations, permitting it to go forward with a
claim that Icahn paid a special price for Dallas Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban&#8217;s 5.4 percent stake in Lions Gate, which the studio
said wasn&#8217;t fair to other investors. 
William Savitt, a lawyer for Lions Gate, and Joseph
DiBenedetto, who represents Icahn, didn&#8217;t return messages
seeking comment on the court filing. 
The case is Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. V. Icahn, 1:10-
cv-08169, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
ATT, U.S. Offer Plan for Confidential Data in T-Mobile Case 
ATT Inc. (T) and the U.S. Justice Department agreed on a plan
for handling confidential data in the government&#8217;s antitrust
lawsuit seeking to block the company&#8217;s purchase of wireless
carrier T-Mobile USA Inc. 
A filing by the department yesterday in federal court in
Washington sets definitions for what will be deemed confidential
and how that information will be disclosed in the case. ATT
didn&#8217;t oppose the department&#8217;s proposed order, the government
said. 
The two sides haven&#8217;t addressed the issue of how much
access ATT&#8217;s in-house lawyers will have to confidential
materials submitted by &#8220;non-parties&#8221; in the case, according to
the filing. The non-parties should have a chance to be heard in
court regarding how their confidential information will be
handled, the department said. 
&#8220;Defendants wish to designate up to 10 (total) in-house
lawyers to have access to confidential information,&#8221; the
department said in the filing. 
Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman in Washington, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a telephone message and an e-mail message
seeking comment on the filing. 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. 
ATT, in a filing last week, said the T-Mobile deal is good
for mobile-phone customers because it would lead to better
service, fewer dropped calls and lower prices for consumers. 
U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 and told the parties to be prepared to discuss
settlement options. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington).

Trials/Appeals 
Fleishman Doesn&#8217;t Take Stand as U.S. Rests in Insider Trial 
James Fleishman, the former Primary Global Research LLC
executive on trial over charges he participated in an insider-
trading scheme, didn&#8217;t take the stand in his own defense after
prosecutors finished their case. 
Fleishman, of Santa Clara, California, is charged with two
counts of conspiracy for his role in what prosecutors said was a
scheme in which technology-company employees, working as
consultants for the company passed secret tips to hedge fund
managers. 
&#8220;The government has rested and the defense has rested,&#8221;
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan told jurors
yesterday. &#8220;On Monday, we will have closing arguments and you
will get the case then.&#8221; 
Rakoff said Fleishman&#8217;s lawyers may submit some written
evidence without calling witnesses to testify. After court,
Ethan Balogh, Fleishman&#8217;s lawyer, said his client wouldn&#8217;t
testify. If convicted, Fleishman faces as long as 25 years in
prison. 
The Mountain View, California-based firm, also known as
PGR, matches employees of public companies with fund managers
for a fee. Of the 15 people charged in the probe, 12 have
pleaded guilty. Fleishman and Winifred Jiau, a former PGR
consultant convicted in June, were the only ones who have gone
to trial. 
Also yesterday, former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. manager Manosha Karunatilaka was sentenced to 18 months in
prison for his role in the scheme involving PGR. 
Balogh yesterday cross-examined Suk-Joo Hwang, a former
Samsung Electronics Co. manager who said he worked as a
consultant for PGR for seven years. Hwang said he sometimes
passed confidential information to PGR clients. 
The case is U.S. v. Fleishman, 11-cr-00032, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Blame for 2010 Gulf Spill Will Be Decided by Trial Judge 
Which companies share the blame for the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill and will have to pay for it will be decided in a non-jury
trial set to begin Feb. 27, a federal judge in New Orleans said. 
BP Plc (BP), which owned the subsea well that exploded off
Louisiana in April 2010, claims Transocean Ltd. (RIG), Halliburton
Co. (HAL), Cameron International Corp. (CAM) and other contractors involved
in the offshore drilling operation share responsibility for
mistakes that caused the disaster. 
&#8220;The trial will address all allocation of fault issues
that may properly be tried to the bench without a jury,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Carl Barbier said Sept. 14 in a written order.
This includes &#8220;the negligence, gross negligence, or other bases
of liability of, and the proportion of liability allocable to
the various defendants, third parties, and non-parties,&#8221; he
said. 
The Macondo blowout and the explosion that followed killed
11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
history. The accident and spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against London-based BP and its partners and contractors. The
lawsuits over economic losses and personal injuries have been
combined before Barbier in New Orleans. 
The lawsuits also name as defendants Transocean, the
Switzerland-based owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that exploded; Houston-based Halliburton, which
provided cementing services to the well; and Cameron
International, which provided blowout-prevention equipment. BP&#8217;s
minority partners in the well, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) and
Mitsui  Co.&#8217;s Moex Offshore LLC unit, were also sued. 
The first test trial on damages is scheduled for July. 
The case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).

Verdicts/Settlement 
Bridgestone to Pay $28 Million Fine Over Bribes, U.S. Says 
Bridgestone Corp. (5108), the world&#8217;s biggest tire maker, agreed
to pay $28 million to settle criminal allegations it conspired
to bribe government officials in Latin America, the U.S. Justice
Department said. 
Bridgestone will plead guilty to charges of plotting to rig
bids and make corrupt payments related to the sale of products
including marine hose, used to transfer oil between tankers and
storage facilities, Sharis A. Pozen, acting chief of the Justice
Department&#8217;s antitrust division, said yesterday in a statement.
The company said it will withdraw from the marine hose business. 
From as early as January 1999 until late May 2007, Tokyo-
based Bridgestone conspired to fix prices and allocate market
shares of marine hose in the U.S. and elsewhere, Pozen said. The
company allegedly conspired to make payments to Latin American
government officials to obtain and retain business. 
As part of the agreement, Bridgestone will cooperate with
the department&#8217;s investigation, according to the statement. The
agreement requires court approval. 
Bridgestone has dismantled its international engineered
products department, closed its Houston office and terminated
many of its third-party agents, the company said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement. 
&#8220;We are committed to the efforts to further enhance and
expand our remediation measures, and to conduct business in
compliance with the competition and anticorruption laws around
the world,&#8221; Bridgestone said. 
Hermes Executive Says Takeover Win Locks in Independence 
Hermes International (RMS) SCA&#8217;s founding family&#8217;s ability to set
up a holding company is &#8220;a decisive step&#8221; in the fight to
defend against a takeover, the luxury-goods maker&#8217;s deputy
managing director said. 
A Paris court yesterday rejected an appeal by minority
investors who opposed a decision by the French market authority
waiving rules to allow the family to set up a holding company.
The family sought the structure to protect the Birkin-bag maker
after LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC), the world&#8217;s largest
luxury-goods maker, began building what is now a 21.4 percent
stake. 
&#8220;When the holding company is in place, it will become
completely obvious that the claims of unity that have taken
place for months and have been questioned will be impossible to
challenge anymore,&#8221; Deputy Managing Director Patrick Albaladejo
said in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;This is a decisive
step.&#8221; 
The Autorite des Marches Financiers was right to grant the
family permission to pool a 50.2 percent Hermes stake into a
holding company without bidding for the rest of the business, as
the regulator would normally require for a group with that large
a stake joining together, the Paris appeals court said. 
The court rejected the objections of minority investors
represented by a shareholder advocacy group Adam, which had
sought to have AMF force the family to make an offer for all
outstanding shares. 
While LVMH has said it isn&#8217;t seeking control or a board
seat, its stake has prompted takeover talk. LVMH won&#8217;t be a
passive shareholder in Hermes and can provide its Paris-based
rival with strategic and operational help, LVMH Chairman Bernard
Arnault has said. 
&#8220;All the statements from the family have been very precise
and decisive on this, that they don&#8217;t want to engage in
discussions,&#8221; Albaladejo said, adding that he isn&#8217;t aware of
any contact with Arnault. 
Hermes wants LVMH to reduce its stake by more than half to
free shares on the open market, according to Bertrand Puech, who
heads the bag maker&#8217;s founding family. Even if LVMH doesn&#8217;t
reduce the holding, Hermes will run the company as it sees fit,
Puech has said.

Watson, Sandoz Pay $145 Million to Settle Drug-Price Case 
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI), the generic-drug maker, will
pay $79 million and Novartis AG (NOVN)&#8217;s Sandoz unit will pay $66
million to resolve claims they defrauded U.S. and state
governments by causing Medicaid to overpay for drugs. 
Both lawsuits were filed under the U.S. False Claims Act by
Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys Inc., a specialty pharmacy. The
settlements resolved portions of the U.S. false claims cases and
similar claims by various states. The law allows whistle-blowers
to file on behalf of the government and share in any recovery. 
Ven-A-Care has settled at least 18 lawsuits since 2000 that
have allowed state and federal governments to collect at least
$2.2 billion. Ven-A-Care has reaped more than $380 million in
whistle-blower fees during that period. James Breen, an attorney
for Ven-A-Care, declined to comment on the latest settlements. 
The settlements by Watson and Sandoz were filed Sept. 14 in
federal court in Boston, where U.S. District Judge Patti Saris
is overseeing the so-called Average Wholesale Price litigation
against drugmakers. 
Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson, declined to comment on the settlement. He referred to
the company&#8217;s last annual report, filed in February, that said
the company reached a settlement with Ven-A-Care for $79 million
in December. 
The claims were &#8220;unfounded,&#8221; and Sandoz settled &#8220;to end
the uncertainty of protracted litigation,&#8221; Eric Althoff, a
spokesman for Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;Sandoz is committed to conducting business in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as our own
high ethical standards,&#8221; he said. 
The case is In Re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale
Price Litigation, MDL No. 1456, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). 
SABMiller&#8217;s Grolsch Wins EU Court Appeal of Antitrust Fine 
Grolsch, a unit of SABMiller Plc (SAB), the world&#8217;s second-
largest brewer by volume, won a European Union court appeal of a
31.7 million-euro ($43.8 million) fine levied for colluding on
beer prices in the Netherlands. 
Antitrust officials didn&#8217;t give sufficient proof to
&#8220;establish the direct participation of Grolsch&#8221; in the cartel
and &#8220;failed to explain&#8221; why the company should be held liable
for the conduct of a Dutch subsidiary, the EU General Court, the
region&#8217;s second-highest tribunal, said in a ruling yesterday. 
The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
fined Royal Grolsch NV, Heineken NV (HEIA) and Bavaria NV in 2007 for
fixing prices in the Netherlands from at least 1996 to 1999.
InBev NV, which has since merged with Anheuser-Busch Cos. to
become the world&#8217;s largest brewer, escaped a fine after tipping
off EU officials. Grolsch was bought by SABMiller in a takeover
completed in 2008. 
Heineken won a cut to its fine to 198 million euros from
219.3 million euros in a ruling by the EU court in June. Bavaria
had its penalty trimmed to 20.7 million euros from 22.8 million
euros, after the court said the European Commission failed to
prove the extent of the cartel. 
The commission will &#8220;analyze the ruling carefully&#8221; and
will then consider whether to appeal the judgment or readopt the
cartel decision, Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the EU
regulator, said in an e-mail. 
The case is: T-234/07, Koninklijke Grolsch v. Commission. 
New York &#8216;Boiler-Room&#8217; Salesman Anderson Gets Two Years 
Baldwin Anderson was sentenced to two years in prison for
taking part in a &#8220;boiler-room&#8221; investment-fraud scheme on New
York&#8217;s Staten Island. 
Anderson, 57, a former salesman for Gryphon Holdings Inc.,
was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in
Brooklyn, New York. He&#8217;s been in custody since June 14, when he
admitted to participating in the crime during the second day of
his trial. He was the last of 18 defendants in the Gryphon case
to plead guilty and the only one to go to trial. 
Gryphon misled investors into paying for phony stock tips
and investment advice, defrauding them of $20 million,
prosecutors charged. Gryphon told victims its office was on Wall
Street or even in the New York Stock Exchange when it was in a
strip mall on Staten Island, according to prosecutors in the
office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch. 
&#8220;I lost sight of the truth, I lost sight of what was good
and I lost sight of the laws that govern this great country,&#8221;
Anderson told Weinstein at a Sept. 13 hearing. 
Anderson&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Padden, declined to comment
after the sentencing. 
Kenneth Marsh, 44, who ran Gryphon, was the last defendant
before Anderson to plead guilty, on April 14. He hasn&#8217;t received
his prison sentence yet. 
The criminal case is U.S. v. Marsh, 10-cr-00480, and the
SEC case is SEC v. Gryphon Holdings Inc., 10-cv-01742, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

General Motors Co. (GM) and the United
Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement on a four-year labor
contract that improves profit sharing and will create jobs, the
company and the union said in separate statements. 
The accord goes to 48,500 GM hourly workers for a
ratification vote in the next seven to 10 days, GM said. The
union typically uses the first accord to set a pattern for pay
and benefits for the other two U.S. automakers. UAW negotiators
will seek a deal with Chrysler Group LLC next and then go to
Ford Motor Co. (F), three people familiar with the talks have said. 
The UAW, while declining to provide details, said the
agreement includes improved health care and enhanced profit
sharing with &#8220;far greater transparency.&#8221; GM will also invest
in its plants, hire back laid-off members and return work to the
U.S. from overseas, UAW President Bob King said in a statement. 
&#8220;This is a contract negotiated in tough times, when the
economy is uncertain and a battered industry is still in
recovery,&#8221; said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the
University of California at Berkeley. &#8220;The union is saying,
&#8216;Look, we&#8217;ve addressed job security when that is vital to our
members and to the whole economy.&#8217;&#8221; 
The union said it rebuffed efforts to weaken health-care
coverage and won &#8220;significant improvements.&#8221; 
&#8216;New Strategies&#8217; 
&#8220;The UAW approached these negotiations with new strategies
and fought for and achieved some of our major goals for our
members, including significant investments and products for our
plants,&#8221; King said. &#8220;This contract will get our members who
have been laid off back to work and will create new jobs in our
communities.&#8221; 
The agreement positions GM for long-term success, Cathy Clegg, GM vice president for labor relations, said in a
statement. 
&#8220;We worked hard for a contract that recognizes the
realities of today&#8217;s marketplace, enabling GM to continue to
invest in U.S. manufacturing and provide good jobs to thousands
of Americans,&#8221; she said. 
The UAW will probably turn its attention next to Chrysler,
majority-owned by Fiat SpA (F), said Shaiken. The GM accord, he said
&#8220;defines competitiveness for Detroit going forward.&#8221; 
&#8220;The details will be critical because the union&#8217;s goals of
job security and sharing in the success of the company can be in
conflict,&#8221; he said in a telephone interview, noting that he
hasn&#8217;t been briefed on those details. &#8220;The results will not
make everyone happy.&#8221; 
Non-Union Competition 
King, 65, has pledged to organize a foreign automaker this
year to expand the UAW&#8217;s bargaining power beyond GM, Ford and
Chrysler. He said the union has &#8220;recommitted to that goal.&#8221; 
&#8220;As long as unionized workers are being forced to compete
with nonunion workers who in most cases receive lower pay and
benefits -- many in temporary jobs -- there will continue to be
a downward pressure on the wages and benefits of all
autoworkers,&#8221; he said in the statement. 
Contracts covering 113,000 workers at GM, Ford and Fiat
SpA-controlled Chrysler were set to expire Sept. 14 and have
been extended while negotiations continued. 
The UAW proposed a signing bonus of $8,000 to $10,000 for
each member, five people familiar with discussions said last
week. A large bonus may help sell the deal to union members
looking to be repaid for what King has estimated as $7,000 to
$30,000 in concessions they each gave since 2005. 
Workers at Detroit-based GM, Ford and Chrysler received
signing bonuses of $3,000 after they ratified the current
contract in 2007. Prior to that, signing bonuses had been around
$1,000, Shaiken said last week. 
Past Concessions 
Previous concessions included surrendering raises, bonuses
and cost-of-living adjustments as well as agreeing to a two-tier
wage system, where new hires are paid about half as much as
senior employees. With GM and Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford
profitable, workers have said they want to recover what they
gave up. 
Workers at Ford have filed an &#8220;equality of sacrifice&#8221;
grievance against the automaker for restoring raises and bonuses
to salaried workers last year. An arbitration hearing on that
dispute started Sept. 15. 
UAW members agreed to a no-strike pledge at GM and Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler as part of their U.S.-backed
bankruptcies in 2009. Unsettled disputes at the automakers are
to be decided through binding arbitration. Ford didn&#8217;t receive a
U.S. bailout and UAW members there went against the wishes of
union leaders and rejected a strike ban and arbitration.

Klaus Doerrzapf, who has solar
panels on his home, has no plans for an emission-free car in his
garage. He&#8217;s one of the reasons why automakers like Nissan Motor
Co. won&#8217;t recoup investments in electric vehicles anytime soon. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s too early,&#8221; the 50-year-old manager at an electrics
company said at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt.
&#8220;Range and price are a problem. Battery life and charging times
are also concerns,&#8221; Doerrzapf said, while looking at an
electric-powered Focus from Ford Motor Co. (F) 
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), Volkswagen AG (VOW) and Nissan
partner Renault SA (RNO) talked up their electric vehicles at the
Frankfurt motor show as they rolled out a record number of
models and began the search for a return on their development
spending. Nissan, the maker of the all-electric Leaf, is
investing 4 billion euros ($5.5 billion) together with Renault
to build electric cars. 
Following the introduction last year of the Leaf,
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)&#8217;s i MiEV, and General Motors Co. (GM)&#8217;s
Chevrolet Volt, the new models will test consumer appetite for
electric vehicles, which cost more than double the price of
conventional models. Consumers are balking at paying up,
concerned that their own investment will be wiped out in a few
years because the batteries may not last. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re about to find out what happens when several big
manufacturers try to sell electric vehicles to real people,&#8221;
said Ian Fletcher, a London-based analyst with IHS Automotive.
&#8220;The signs aren&#8217;t all good.&#8221; 
Sales Targets 
Nissan has delivered 12,000 of the Leaf model since its
introduction in December, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn
said in Frankfurt. PSA Peugeot Citroen, which beat Renault to
the market with two electric city cars last December, targeted
7,000 combined deliveries of the iOn and C-Zero models for 2011.
It has sold 3,000 since Jan. 1. 
Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan said last November it planned
to sell as many as 25,000 units of the $32,780 Leaf in the U.S.
during the model&#8217;s first year. Through August, U.S. sales of the
model totaled just 6,168. 
The Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles per charge,
costs 25,990 pounds ($40,776) in the U.K., even after the
deduction of a 5,000-pound government incentive, while the
brand&#8217;s similarly sized Note starts at 11,200 pounds. In France,
the 5,000-euro government contribution lowers the starting price
of Peugeot&#8217;s iOn to 35,350 euros, compared with 9,700 euros for
the gasoline-burning Peugeot 107. 
Battery Barrier 
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t buy one just yet,&#8221; said Jean-Pierre Ahtuam,
38, who runs a juice bar in central Paris. &#8220;I&#8217;d be worried
about where I&#8217;d plug it in and whether it will be worth anything
in a couple of years -- that&#8217;s got to be a concern with any new
technology the first time around.&#8221; 
Costly batteries and limited driving range remain the key
sticking points for the technology. Public charging stations are
also conspicuously absent in most markets. Even the technology&#8217;s
strongest advocates recognize that success hinges on years of
generous subsidies from increasingly cash-strapped governments. 
&#8220;As things stand, it&#8217;s only with this support that we can
make the cars affordable for consumers,&#8221; said Thomas Orsini,
electric-vehicle business development director at Renault, which
is predicting a 10 percent global market share for battery cars
by 2020. &#8220;If the subsidies disappear too soon, the market won&#8217;t
get off the ground.&#8221; 
Subsidies help to absorb the 7,000-euro cost of a battery
that will propel a compact car about 100 miles on flat terrain
between charges -- providing that heating and other energy-
draining functions are used sparingly or not at all. 
&#8216;Sudden Death&#8217; 
The batteries&#8217; price and limited lifespan will combine to
make electric vehicles depreciate faster than combustion-engine
models in the used-car market, according to research by the
University of Greenwich in London. 
&#8220;Electric cars suffer from the certainty, not just risk,
of a large fixed cost a few years down the line,&#8221; said Michael Wynn-Williams, a business professor and author of the study.
&#8220;This is sudden death, the point where an otherwise attractive
vehicle is worth nothing.&#8221; 
To get around this problem, Daimler AG (DAI) plans to follow
Renault&#8217;s lead by initially leasing the batteries with its cars.
The electric-powered Smart city car will start at less than
16,000 euros, with the battery costing an additional 60 euros a
month. 
Ghosn, chief executive officer of both Renault and Nissan,
remains bullish. Demand for Nissan&#8217;s Leaf has outstripped
expectations, he said Sept. 12. 
&#8220;When we first predicted a 10 percent market share, people
said we were being extremely optimistic,&#8221; the CEO said. &#8220;Since
then, it&#8217;s the experts who have increased their forecasts.&#8221; 
&#8216;Nice to Drive&#8217; 
Not all industry analysts got Ghosn&#8217;s memo. Fletcher at IHS
expects battery-powered cars to claim about 1 percent of global
production in 2020, while rival research firm J.D. Power and
Associates puts their market share below 2 percent. The
forecasts exclude cars with range extenders, like GM&#8217;s Volt,
which use a small on-board gasoline generator to recharge the
battery on the move. 
Even some of the auto executives showing pure electric
models in Frankfurt sounded skeptical about their future. 
Peugeot Citroen sees three times more global demand for hybrids,
which combine electric propulsion with a combustion engine. 
&#8220;Everything we&#8217;re seeing today confirms that vision,&#8221;
said CEO Philippe Varin. 
Consumers like Doerrzapf, who owns a VW Passat and works
for a company supplying the type of electronics equipment needed
to recharge the vehicles, may yet change their minds. 
&#8220;They are nice to drive,&#8221; he said.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) paid over 1 million
pounds ($1.57 million) to buy the silence of a female executive
unfairly passed over for the job of managing director for the
software company&#8217;s U.K. operations, the Daily Telegraph
reported, citing unidentified people at Microsoft. 
Natalie Ayres worked at Microsoft for 15 years and was
widely tipped to become U.K. managing director in 2006; her
interview process was still under way when Microsft named Gordon
Frazer, general manager of Microsoft South Africa, to the post,
the newspaper said. 
Ayres received a seven-figure payoff when she left at the
end of 2006; Microsoft said it didn&#8217;t comment on individual
employees and placed great importance on the core values of
diversity, the Telegraph reported.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, raised its quarterly dividend 25 percent
to 20 cents, providing investors with a payout at the upper end
of forecasts. 
The new dividend is a penny more the 19 cents a share
projected by Bloomberg data and compares with the 18 cents to 20
cents estimated by Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in New York. The change, announced in a statement
today, boosts the yield to 2.97 percent from 2.37 percent. 
Microsoft generally has a policy of boosting the dividend
in line with operating income. While the increase exceeded the
13 percent growth in operating income in the past fiscal year,
investors were seeking more, Bellini said. The company&#8217;s cash
and short-term investments surged 43 percent last year, and
shareholders wanted a bigger piece of that hoard. 
Microsoft&#8217;s ability to return cash to shareholders is
hampered by the fact that much of that money is held
internationally and would require the company to pay taxes to
bring it back into the country for the purpose of paying a
larger dividend. 
About $45 billion, or 85 percent of the company&#8217;s cash and
short-term investments, is held outside the U.S., the company
said in a July 28 regulatory filing. Around half of annual cash
flow from operations is generated abroad, Bellini estimated,
which gives the company about $15 billion to $17 billion to
spend on dividends and share repurchases this year. 
Double It 
Even so, Neil Herman, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities
LLC, suggested in an August report that the company should
double its dividend in order to boost its share price. The
shares, which have declined 3.3 percent this year, might surge
past $35 with an increase of that magnitude, he wrote. 
Shares of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 23
cents to $26.98 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They rose to
$27.10 in late trading after the increase was announced. 
Before today, Microsoft has paid out about 25 percent of
earnings as dividends since starting the payments in 2003,
according to Bloomberg data. Dividend-paying companies with
similar market valuations to Microsoft are paying closer to 40
percent to 50 percent, the data show. 
The company also said today it will continue its $40
billion stock buyback plan begun in 2008. The program, which
expires in 2013, had about $12.2 billion remaining as of June
30, Microsoft said.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
biggest theme-park operator, unveiled plans for attractions
based on the top-grossing 3-D movie &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; starting at its
Animal Kingdom in Florida. 
James Cameron, who directed Fox&#8217;s 2009 science-fiction
thriller, will serve as a creative consultant in development of
&#8220;Avatar&#8221; lands at the parks, officials of Burbank, California-
based Disney said today at a press conference. 
The company has increased spending in its resorts division,
including a new theme park in Shanghai, a vacation project on
the Hawaiian island of Oahu and an expansion of California
Adventure in Anaheim. Investments in parks, resorts and other
properties totaled $2.56 billion through nine months of the
fiscal 2011, almost double the year earlier tally. 
&#8220;With this agreement, we have the extraordinary
opportunity to combine James&#8217;s talent and vision with the
imagination and expertise of Disney,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger said in a statement. 
Construction is scheduled to begin by 2013 and take five
years, said Disney, which licensed worldwide theme park rights
to &#8220;Avatar&#8221; from Cameron&#8217;s Lightstorm Entertainment and News
Corp.&#8217;s Twentieth Century Fox studio. 
The project is expected to cost about $400 million,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation who wasn&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. Cameron&#8217;s first &#8220;Avatar&#8221; film
sequel is scheduled for release in 2014. 
Disney fell 20 cents to $32.31 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 14 percent
this year. 
Box-Office Sales 
&#8220;Avatar&#8221; has collected $2.78 billion in worldwide
theatrical sales, the most of any film, according to Box Office
Mojo, an industry researcher. That eclipsed the previous record
of $1.84 billion for &#8220;Titanic,&#8221; also directed by Cameron. 
The film took place on a moon called Pandora, where humans
leading a mining effort were pitted against the native Na&#8217;vi
people. 
Theme parks accounted for 28 percent of Disney&#8217;s $38.1
billion in sales in the year ended in September 2010 and
contributed $1.32 billion in operating income, or 17 percent of
the total. 
Locations for other &#8220;Avatar&#8221; themed lands will be
determined by Disney and its international theme park partners,
the company said.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, is
offering a new software product that automates marketing and
speeds up sales to entice businesses to use its servers. 
If all of a company&#8217;s product and customer data is on IBM&#8217;s
servers, IBM&#8217;s analytics can help it sell more efficiently to
other businesses and consumers, the company said in a statement.
For example, sales campaigns could be based on where products
are geographically located and marketing campaigns could be
automatically generated based on the tone of a customer&#8217;s
Twitter post about a product. 
The new product, which is the next step in IBM&#8217;s Smarter
Commerce initiative, is part of a push to make $7 billion by
2015 from cloud computing, which allows a company to store and
access data from IBM&#8217;s servers, the company said. IBM, based in
Armonk, New York, has made &#8220;heavy investments&#8221; in the area,
including $2.5 billion in acquisitions and hundreds of millions
of dollars in research, said Craig Hayman, who oversees Smarter
Commerce as general manager of IBM Industry Solutions. 
The product &#8220;clarifies what these acquisitions in the fall
were about, and gives a clear example of one of the ways IBM
plans to pursue the cloud,&#8221; said Josh Olson, a Des Peres,
Missouri-based analyst for Edward Jones  Co. 
Acquisitions, Competitors 
Last year, IBM acquired Unica Corp. and Coremetrics, which
use analytics for online marketing, and Sterling Commerce, which
helps companies manage their relationships with partners and
suppliers. The company has said it plans to spend about $20
billion on acquisitions through 2015, after ending last year
with $10.7 billion in cash. 
Competitors Oracle Corp. (ORCL), SAP AG (SAP) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) have
not gone as far as IBM in using cloud technology for business
services, Gene Alvarez, a Stamford, Connecticut-based analyst
for Gartner Inc., said. IBM&#8217;s technology could attract
industries like health care and telecommunications by doing for
business-to-business transactions what Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) does on
its website, providing individualized marketing, he said. 
&#8220;We now have organizations that you never would have
thought of as e-commerce organizations, wanting a system like
that,&#8221; Alvarez said.

Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin
America&#8217;s largest Coke bottler, said it will account for half of
Mexico&#8217;s Coca-Cola sales after completing an agreement to buy
the bottling operations of Grupo Cimsa with new shares. 
The transaction, valued at 11 billion pesos ($837 million)
in stock and assumed debt, tops the acquisition of Mexican
bottler Grupo Tampico for 6.55 billion pesos of shares and 2.75
billion pesos of debt announced by the Mexico-City based company
in June. Tampico was Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s largest purchase since it
bought Panamerican Beverages Inc. for $3.6 billion in 2003. 
The acquisition announced yesterday of Cimsa, a closely
held company that sells Coca-Cola products mostly in the central
states of Morelos and Mexico, marks the second transaction this
year in which Coca-Cola Femsa offered shares instead of cash.
That&#8217;s designed to reduce resistance by family-owned companies
to sell out and exit the soft-drink business completely. 
The consolidation of Coke bottlers in Mexico &#8220;is likely to
continue as third-generation owners of smaller Coke bottling
operations swap their controlling equity stakes for minority
positions in a larger bottler,&#8221; Alan Alanis, a New York-based
analyst with JPMorgan Chase  Co., said in a report today. 
Coca-Cola Femsa rose 1.89 pesos, or 1.5 percent, to
124.87 pesos in Mexico City trading at 12:05 p.m. New York time.
The shares gained 20 percent this year before today. 
The agreement with Cuernavaca, Mexico-based Cimsa
&#8220;confirms that our company represents an attractive,
transparent and diversified investment vehicle for families that
have been in the beverage industry for a long time,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said in a statement. 
Mexico Consolidation 
The Cimsa and Tampico transactions follow the merger,
completed in June, of Mexico&#8217;s second-largest and third-largest
Coke bottlers to form Arca Continental SAB. There are now eight
family-owned Coca-Cola bottlers left in Mexico that may be
targets for Coca-Cola Femsa or Arca Continental, said Alanis,
the JPMorgan analyst. He rates Coca-Cola Femsa &#8220;neutral.&#8221; 
Shareholders of Cimsa, whose bottling operations are called
Corporacion de los Angeles SA, will receive 75.4 million newly
issued Coca-Cola Femsa shares valued at 118 pesos each, the
companies said yesterday. Coca-Cola Femsa will absorb net debt
of 2.1 billion pesos. 
Cost Savings 
Cimsa, which also has operations in the states of Guerrero
and Michoacan, is forecast to sell 159 million unit cases this
year, Coca-Cola Femsa said. A 13.2 percent stake in Promotora
Industrial Azucarera SA, a Mexican sugar company, is included in
the acquisition. Cimsa&#8217;s bottling unit is forecast to have 2011
revenue of 4.79 billion pesos and earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow
known as Ebitda -- of 1.1 billion pesos, Coca-Cola Femsa said. 
The 2011 estimated Ebitda margin for Cimsa is 23 percent,
higher than 20 percent for Coca-Cola Femsa in this year&#8217;s first
half, Luis Miranda, an analyst at the Mexican unit of Banco
Santander SA, wrote in a report today. He recommends buying
Coca-Cola Femsa shares. 
&#8220;We view this news as positive,&#8221; Miranda wrote. &#8220;The
operation is accretive from the operating side.&#8221; 
The company expects to achieve annual cost savings of more
than 260 million pesos from Cimsa&#8217;s bottling unit because it
touches Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s territories on three sides, Hector Trevino, the company&#8217;s chief financial officer, said in a
telephone interview. The amount of &#8220;synergies&#8221; allowed the
company to pay 10 times annual Ebitda, compared with 9.6 times
for Tampico, he said. Cost savings with Tampico will be in a
range of 180 million pesos to 270 million pesos, Trevino said. 
&#8216;Very Achievable&#8217; 
&#8220;We&#8217;re very sure that the 260 million pesos of annual
synergies is very achievable and perhaps a bit conservative
because of the proximity,&#8221; he said. 
After the issue of new shares for the acquisition, Cimsa
will own 3.8 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa. Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s stake
in the company will drop to 29.4 percent from 30.6 percent and
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB will have about 50 percent, down
from 51.9 percent. Tampico will hold 3.2 percent, and the
remaining 13.6 percent of the shares trade publicly. 
Cimsa operates three bottling plants and 18 distribution
centers and has 4,600 employees. 
Coca-Cola Femsa and Cimsa will seek shareholder approval in
special meetings. The transaction also requires approval from
Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency and Coca-Cola Co., according to Coca-
Cola Femsa&#8217;s statement. Coca-Cola Femsa will hold a conference
call tomorrow at 11 a.m. New York time to discuss the deal.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) offered to resolve a European Union investigation into
claims the company blocked competition from rival providers of
maintenance services for mainframe computers. 
The European Commission, the Brussels-based EU antitrust
regulator, today asked for comments on IBM&#8217;s commitments to
ensure the availability of spare parts and technical data. The
commission also closed a separate probe over IBM&#8217;s mainframe
computers after three competitors dropped complaints. 
The commission in 2010 opened investigations into Armonk,
New York-based IBM over possible conduct that may have blocked
competitors in mainframe software and maintenance contracts by
restricting access to parts. While IBM has shifted its focus
away from hardware toward its more profitable software and
services businesses, the mainframe operations have high gross
margins and help pull in revenue for other divisions. 
&#8220;It seems that IBM has taken a pragmatic approach and
determined that these commitments do not constitute a
significant issue for them and that it&#8217;s preferable to get a
settlement and put this probe behind them instead of fighting
till the end,&#8221; Christian Riis-Madsen, an antitrust partner in
Brussels at law firm O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, said by telephone. 
Non-Discriminatory Terms 
IBM offered commitments to resolve concerns it may have
imposed unreasonable conditions for supplying competing
mainframe maintenance-service providers in breach of EU
antitrust rules. IBM will ensure that third-party providers
receive technical information &#8220;under reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms,&#8221; the regulator said. 
The company said in an e-mailed statement that it
&#8220;welcomes&#8221; the commission&#8217;s decision &#8220;to close the
investigation of IBM&#8217;s mainframe and associated intellectual
property rights.&#8221; The company said it also looked forward to
providing the basis for the final resolution of the probe into
maintenance practices. 
IBM rose 1.8 percent to $176.30 in New York Stock Exchange
trading at 4:32 p.m. London time. 
&#8220;IBM does not agree with the commission&#8217;s preliminary
assessment&#8221; that the company may have abused &#8220;a dominant
position on the market for certain inputs necessarily required
for the maintenance of IBM mainframe hardware and software,&#8221;
the commission said in an EU document published today. 
Comments on IBM&#8217;s practices can be submitted to the
commission within a month. After that, the agency will either
make the commitments legally binding, without saying whether
there was an infringement, or start another round of market
testing if there are substantial changes to the remedies. 
Google Probe 
Google Inc. (GOOG) is another U.S. technology company under EU
scrutiny, with a focus on whether the world&#8217;s largest Web search
company has a dominant position that allows it to influence the
behavior of Internet users. 
EU Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week
that he is investigating whether Mountain View, California-based
Google is a gate keeper and able to influence the behavior of
Internet users. A string of antitrust probes against technology
companies by Almunia&#8217;s predecessor, Neelie Kroes, resulted in
1.68 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in fines against Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and a record 1.06 billion-euro penalty against Intel Corp. (INTC)
Intel has an appeal pending. 
IBM began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and
1950s and is now among the few companies selling the systems. 
&#8220;I commend IBM&#8217;s readiness to address our concerns about
fair competition in the market for large computers,&#8221; Almunia

A U.S. senator known on Wall Street
for taking on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has a new target -- a tax
benefit for derivatives traders that has also been derided by
Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and tax-code critic. 
The special congressional committee set up to cut $1.5
trillion from the federal deficit should consider taxing futures
and other derivatives at ordinary income rates, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, wrote in a letter to the panel.
The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that a similar
administration proposal could raise about $2.8 billion in
revenue. 
Futures, non-equity options and other types of derivatives
transactions are currently taxed at a top rate of 23 percent;
ordinary income is taxed up to 35 percent. 
The tax system &#8220;encourages bets on derivatives over direct
capital investments that are key to economic growth,&#8221; Levin
said in a Sept. 15 letter. &#8220;Closing this tax loophole would put
a stop to that market distortion.&#8221; 
Levin&#8217;s reputation for expertise in financial matters was
enhanced by his committee&#8217;s investigation of the 2008 credit
collapse, which was released in April and criticized Goldman
Sachs for its role.

Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the
state oil company, and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) are negotiating an
arbitration settlement of about $6 billion for assets seized by
President Hugo Chavez in 2007. 
Venezuela will pay any ruling issued by the World Bank&#8217;s
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or
ICSID, that is in Exxon&#8217;s favor, Carlos Escarra, the country&#8217;s
prosecutor general, told reporters today in Caracas. 
&#8220;They started asking for $20 billion,&#8221; Escarra said,
referring to Exxon&#8217;s original demands for compensation. &#8220;Talks
dropped to around $12 billion, and now they are around $6
billion. Venezuela has to pay -- we are clear on that. The
problem now is how much we will pay.&#8221; 
Chavez, since coming to power in 1999, has nationalized
parts of the oil, metals, cement and utilities industries. In
2007, he forced foreign oil producers into joint ventures as
minority partners. Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil and
ConocoPhillips (COP) rejected the revised terms and instead entered
into international arbitration. 
&#8220;Exxon Mobil does not comment on media reports,&#8221; said
Patrick McGinn, a Houston-based spokesman. Exxon, the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, reduced the amount it&#8217;s seeking for the
takeover of its Cerro Negro venture in the Orinoco heavy crude
belt to $7 billion from $12 billion last year, PDVSA said in a
bond prospectus at the time. 
&#8220;Venezuela is evaluating the amount that we would consider
to be a triumph,&#8221; Escarra said. 
Venezuela Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said the country
proposed paying Exxon $1 billion in compensation, Reuters
reported. Phone calls after business hours to PDVSA, as the
state oil company is known, were not returned. 
Arbitration Results 
&#8220;As the figure for the settlement has been coming down
with the passage of time, that is good news for the sovereign
and PDVSA,&#8221; Boris Segura, a Latin America strategist with
Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York, said today in
an interview from New York. &#8220;But most importantly, Mr. Escarra
was unequivocal in saying that Venezuela will abide by the
results of the arbitration.&#8221; 
The Washington-based ICSID ruled on June 10 that it has
jurisdiction over any disputes after Feb. 21, 2006, for the
Cerro Negro project, according to documents posted on the
agency&#8217;s website. PDVSA previously argued that the matter should
be resolved in Venezuelan courts. 
The Cerro Negro joint venture refined tar-like crude into
synthetic oil from wells in the Orinoco belt. 
Regional Arbitration 
Exxon initially won an order in the U.K. blocking PDVSA
from selling $12 billion of assets anywhere in the world. The
order was overturned by a U.K. court in March 2009. 
Escarra, who was sworn into office as state prosecutor on
Aug. 30, said he previously advised Chavez to withdraw Venezuela
from the World Bank investment dispute unit when he was a
lawmaker in Venezuela&#8217;s National Assembly. 
&#8220;In my opinion, we should leave. Ecuador and Bolivia have
already pulled out, and Argentina is pushing for a Latin
American arbitration court,&#8221; Escarra said. &#8220;But as the
prosecutor, I follow instructions from Chavez.&#8221; 
Exxon fell 2.8 percent to close at $71.97 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. 
The extra yield investors demand to own Venezuelan
government bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 17 basis
points, 0.17 percentage point, to 1,315 basis points today at
5:21 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan  Chase Co.&#8217;s
EMBI+. 
Yields on the government&#8217;s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds
maturing in 2027 rose 31 basis points to 14.84 percent. The
price fell 1.4 cents on the dollar to 66.17 cents. 
&#8220;As risky assets worldwide were under pressure today,
don&#8217;t expect a positive day for Venezuelan assets, not even with
this news,&#8221; Segura said.

Morgan Stanley plans to alter the
way it brings orders together in dark pools, trying to encourage
bigger trades for institutional customers after a three-year
decline in the number of shares per transaction industrywide. 
The bank, which operates venues in the U.S., Europe, Hong
Kong, Japan and Australia that match buyers and sellers without
showing bids and offers, will give priority to larger orders at
a specified price instead of those that arrived first, Bill Neuberger, co-head of Morgan Stanley Electronic Trading, said in
a phone interview. MS POOL, which is adopting a model similar to
one used by a Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) exchange, is among the first
dark pools to offer the protocol in the U.S. 
&#8220;We want to reward size and de-emphasize speed,&#8221;
Neuberger said. MS POOL had the second-smallest average trade
size in July among venues tracked by Rosenblatt Securities Inc.
They averaged 209 shares in August, Neuberger said. &#8220;Fewer 100-
share prints in dark pools may be a good thing,&#8221; he said. 
Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s changes are part of an effort to portray
its venues as places where sophisticated users employing high-
frequency strategies have less influence. Larger trade sizes may
connote less interaction with proprietary trading firms, whose
ability to sniff out and exploit the intentions of investors was
one of the reasons dark pools gained popularity in the latter
half of the last decade. 
Getting Smaller 
Trades in most dark pools average 200 shares to 300 shares,
down from 300 shares to 400 shares in 2008 and 2009, Justin Schack, managing director for market structure analysis at
Rosenblatt Securities, a New York-based broker that analyzes
dark pool volume and trends, said in a phone interview. The
decline may have resulted from more high-frequency penetration
in venues that don&#8217;t display quotes, increased stock volatility,
or algorithms reacting to trades they receive, he said. 
U.S. dark pools followed by Rosenblatt accounted for 12.3
percent of U.S. volume in July, compared with 10.9 percent a
year earlier. There are about 40 U.S. pools, with data from the
largest included in Rosenblatt&#8217;s tally. A category of hidden
orders on equity exchanges such as Nasdaq Stock Market and the
New York Stock Exchange totaled 3.4 percent. More than 9 percent
of volume on the main exchange run by Lenexa, Kansas-based Bats
Global Markets was in dark or hidden orders, Rosenblatt said. 
Market Share 
MS POOL traded 61 million shares daily on average last
month, or 0.6 percent of U.S. equity volume, according to data
compiled by Morgan Stanley and Bloomberg. The broker had 0.7
percent of volume in July, Rosenblatt data showed. Credit Suisse
Group AG&#8217;s Crossfinder, the largest dark pool, had 2.2 percent
of U.S. volume, followed by New York-based Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Sigma X with 1.5 percent. Zurich-based Credit Suisse&#8217;s
venue had the smallest average trade size in July, with 188
shares, according to Rosenblatt data. 
U.S. stock exchanges match orders submitted to them against
incoming buy and sell requests based on when they were received,
a system called price-time priority. Among markets run by larger
exchange operators, only the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE
Amex allow certain firms -- brokers working on the exchange&#8217;s
floor and so-called designated market makers -- to jump ahead
and execute alongside those next in line to trade. Nasdaq OMX
PSX, which relies on price-size priority, began last year. 
Order Size 
Existing orders at a given price in MS POOL will trade
based on the number of shares they initially represented. If a
firm wants to buy 1,000 shares and another subsequently bid for
5,000 shares, the second one would move ahead of the 1,000-share
order. Even if smaller orders trade against the 5,000 shares and
500 shares remained, the order retains its priority because it
initially was bigger, Neuberger said from New York. 
Nasdaq OMX PSX has a different version of price-size
priority. Existing orders trade based on the number of shares
they represent, with incoming orders distributed proportionally.
In the last example, an incoming order for 600 shares would
trade 500 shares against the 5,000-share bid and 100 against the
smaller one. Nasdaq OMX chose this method to avoid hurting the
senders of smaller orders that are publicly displayed who might
otherwise not send bids or offers. 
Sapna Patel, head of market structure and liquidity
strategy for the Americas for Morgan Stanley, said a customer in
a dark pool isn&#8217;t revealing his intentions because bids and
offers aren&#8217;t public. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s a different model,&#8221; the
trader may opt to supply larger orders, she said. 
The new rules are expected to become effective in MS POOL
in the U.S. and Europe next week and in Asia later this year,
she said. 
Customer Curiosity 
Investment Technology Group Inc.&#8217;s Posit dark pool uses
price-size priority to match buy and sell orders, according to
J.T. Farley, a spokesman. Other dark pools employ versions of
the protocol. Bids Trading LP gives users a choice about how to
execute their trade requests, Tim Mahoney, chief executive
officer of the dark pool operator, wrote in an e-mail. Both
companies are in New York. 
Whit Conary, chief executive officer of Level ATS, a
Boston-based dark pool operator, said investors have asked
venues that don&#8217;t display quotes for more information about what
kind of traders are on their system, what kind of orders are
available and how rules on the platforms work. The information
helps users make better decisions about where they want to send
orders, he said. More brokers are also reporting trading volume
to Rosenblatt to increase transparency in the market. Level
traded almost 49 million shares in July, Rosenblatt data showed. 
&#8216;Electronic Way&#8217; 
&#8220;More broker-dealers are finding it&#8217;s efficient to have an
electronic way to match internal sources of order flow,&#8221; Conary
said in a phone interview. The result is that more dark pools
are finding customers, he said. 
Morgan Stanley introduced MS POOL in the U.S. in 2006 and
in Europe in 2008. It runs another network called MS Trajectory
Cross in countries where MS POOL operates. That system matches
pieces of bigger algorithmic orders according to the stock&#8217;s
average price weighted by volume over a period of time. 
Morgan Stanley hasn&#8217;t allowed some types of trading that
other dark pools encourage to attract orders. The firm doesn&#8217;t
let traders to submit orders that must be executed immediately
or canceled. It doesn&#8217;t send messages called indications of
interest to other pools or venues to solicit orders. Users must
also keep orders in MS POOL for at least a second before
withdrawing them -- a long time for many high-frequency traders.
That discourages short-term players, Neuberger said. 
Minimum-Share Requirements 
Some customers are asking whether dark pools aggregate
orders from users to get around minimum-share size requirements
that some investors place on orders. Such a restriction might be
sought to avoid trading against automated firms that prefer 100-
share transactions. 
Schack said he asked dark pools several months ago to count
orders aggregated to meet a minimum-share size imposed by the
counterparty as separate trades in their reporting. &#8220;Bulking&#8221;
inflates the average trade size, which some investors use to
assess the type of liquidity in a venue, he said. 
Conary said Level, which is used by about 185 broker-dealer
customers, lets members choose whether to allow minimum-share
sizes they impose to be met by multiple orders. 
Changes at MS POOL come as regulators in Canada and Europe
are considering rules to limit trading in dark pools that don&#8217;t
give investors better prices or larger executions than what&#8217;s
publicly available. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has raised the prospect of a similar restriction,
called a trade-at rule, many institutional investors and retail
brokers have said they wouldn&#8217;t support that since it would hurt
their transactions. 
Trade Transparency 
Separately, the SEC in October 2009 proposed rules that
would increase transparency for trades in dark pools and reduce
the amount of daily volume in a company&#8217;s shares that can be
executed on the systems before prices must be made public. The
agency hasn&#8217;t acted on that proposal, in part because of dozens
of new rules it has had to write related to the Dodd-Frank Act,
the financial overhaul enacted in July 2010. 
&#8220;The SEC may be more likely to address the October 2009
proposal first,&#8221; Schack said. &#8220;The trade-at rule is incredibly
controversial. It has many organized, vocal opponents and very
few organized and vocal supporters.&#8221;

     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, closed below $100 for the
first time since March 2009 as financial stocks fell amid
concerns about the European debt crisis. 
The shares fell $4.75, or 4.6 percent, to $97.86 at 4:03
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest
closing price since March 20, 2009. The stock dropped briefly
below $100 earlier this month before climbing back above $100 by
the end of the trading session. Goldman Sachs has declined 42
percent this year. 
Goldman Sachs fell amid an overall decline in U.S.
financial stocks, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index dropping 4.9 percent. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service lowered
credit ratings on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
and reduced Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s short-term rating today. 
&#8220;Most of it is still Europe and the uncertainty about what
the resolution of the sovereign debt problems will be,&#8221; said
David Hilder, an analyst at New York-based Susquehanna Financial
Group. &#8220;The Moody&#8217;s downgrades certainly didn&#8217;t help.&#8221; Hilder
has a &#8220;positive&#8221; rating on Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and
Wells Fargo and a &#8220;neutral&#8221; on Citigroup. 
Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
sustained the biggest decline in the SP 500 Financials Index as
the stock fell $1.30, or 8.6 percent, to $13.82.

Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) and
Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), two U.S. producers of coal used in
steelmaking, tumbled after they respectively cut output and
sales forecasts because of mining disruptions. 
Shares of Alpha fell $4.62, or 17 percent, to $22.30 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Walter
declined $8.75, or 12 percent, to $66.25. 
Alpha&#8217;s full-year production will be 102.5 million to 109.5
million tons, compared with a previous prediction of 104 million
to 112 million tons, the Abingdon, Virginia-based company said
today in a statement. Alpha cited &#8220;unexpectedly curtailed
customer activity&#8221; in Asia and lower-than-expected output from
some mines. 
Walter&#8217;s second-half sales will be &#8220;similar&#8221; to the 5.2
million metric tons recorded for the first half, the Birmingham,
Alabama-based company said in a statement. Its previous forecast
for second-half sales was 5.9 million tons. 
Alpha and Walter are both trying to integrate mines bought
earlier this year in separate acquisitions. Alpha bought Massey
Energy Co. for $7.1 billion in June and said today output from
some Central Appalachian Massey mines has disappointed. Walter
purchased Western Coal Corp. for C$5.3 billion ($5.31 billion)
in April, giving it production in British Columbia. Rainfall in
the Canadian province has curbed output, Walter said today. 
&#8216;Difficult&#8217; Geology 
Walter said third-quarter earnings will be $1 to $1.16 a
share. The average of 15 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for $3.24. Walter forecast fourth-quarter earnings
of $2.63 to $2.95 a share. The average from the analysts&#8217;
estimates was for $3.17. 
The company said it&#8217;s dealing with &#8220;difficult&#8221; geology at
its Mine Number 7 in Alabama. 
&#8220;It is possible these challenges could tempt a large
company to look to buy Walter&#8217;s world-class assets &#8216;&#8216;on the
cheap,&#8217;&#8217; Jeremy Sussman and Lucas Pipes, analysts at Brean
Murray Carret  Co. in New York, said in a note today. They
maintained their &#8216;&#8216;hold&#8217;&#8217; rating for Walter and &#8216;&#8216;buy&#8217;&#8217;
recommendation for &#8216;&#8216;Alpha.&#8217;&#8217; 
Walter jumped 21 percent on Sept. 7 after the London-based
Times said Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. may be
considering takeover bids. Walter investor Audley Capital
Advisors LLP said in July that the company should explore a
sale. 
The company said Sept. 12 it appointed Walter J. Scheller
III as chief executive. Keith Calder resigned as CEO on June 30,

When Carol Perkins arrives at the
office, she checks e-mails, organizes files, and calls
corporations as part of a fund-raising effort. 
Perkins, 60, works at the Urban League of Essex County in
New Jersey through a U.S. senior-citizen jobs program that used
to pay for an average of 20 hours a week of training and work.
In April, Congress sliced tens of millions of dollars in
funding, and Perkins&#8217; schedule was cut by at least half --
forcing her to turn to welfare to pay the rent after her monthly
take home fell more than $100. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m devastated,&#8221; said Perkins, of Montclair, New Jersey,
who said her previous administrative support jobs at New York-
based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bear Stearns Cos. were
eliminated. &#8220;We need jobs. It&#8217;s as if they have forgotten about
us seniors and we&#8217;ll wind up out on the street. I just want to
work.&#8221; 
The funding cut illustrates the conflict between the need
to put people back to work and the mandate of a 12-member
congressional supercommittee to cut $1.5 trillion from the
deficit. Scaling back the job training for U.S. seniors will
mean fewer work opportunities as President Barack Obama pushes a
job stimulus plan, unveiled Sept. 8, aimed at easing
unemployment that has been 9 percent or higher for five straight
months. 
It also shows how cuts to federal spending can exacerbate
the jobless situation and shift seniors into other public
assistance programs, negating some of the savings, according to
groups that help run the training. Organizations said they&#8217;ve
reduced paid training, work hours, and in some cases are turning
away seniors seeking the job-based training. 
Homeless Seniors 
Many in the program, which is aimed at unemployed, low-
income people who are 55 or older, need the paid training and
work: Almost 40 percent were homeless or at risk of being
homeless in 2009, according to the Labor Department. 
The unemployment rate for people age 55 and older is at
levels not seen since at least 1948, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. It peaked at 7.3 percent in 2010 and was at
6.6 percent in August. 
In 2000, the seniors&#8217; rate was below 3 percent. 
Older Americans are more likely than any other age group to
remain out of work for 99 weeks or more, according to a December
2010 report by the Congressional Research Service, which
provides policy and legal analysis to lawmakers. 
45% Funding Cut 
Funding for the Senior Community Service Employment Program
was cut 45 percent, to about $450 million for the year that ends
June 2012, from $825 million approved in 2010, under an April
budget deal forged by Congress and Obama. The previous year
included $225 million from federal Recovery Act money, and
excluding that appropriation the drop was 25 percent, according
to the Labor Department. 
The Obama administration in proposing the cut found
&#8220;little evidence&#8221; that spending on seniors&#8217; job training
&#8220;successfully promotes unsubsidized employment or provides
cost-effective community service.&#8221; 
Cutting the program is necessary as the government seeks to
close the deficit, Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against
Government Waste, a Washington-based advocacy group, said in an
interview. 
&#8220;There are ways to help people find work without spending
a lot of money,&#8221; Schatz said. &#8220;The objective has to be to help
as many as possible with the least cost.&#8221; 
Program Merits 
Shrinking the seniors jobs program shows how efforts to
curb the deficit by slashing spending can exacerbate the jobless
situation, said Lita Levine Kleger, a spokeswoman for Arlington,
Virginia-based Experience Works Inc., which helps low-income
seniors with employment. 
&#8220;I understand there&#8217;s this conversation in Congress about
making tough choices, but there has to be some discussion on the
merits of what actually works,&#8221; Levine Kleger said in an
interview. &#8220;This program gets people jobs.&#8221; 
Experience Works cut about 140 staff positions and closed a
customer-service center in Waco, Texas, Levine Kleger said.
They&#8217;re turning away interested applicants, she said. 
Participants in the U.S. program generally earn minimum
wage and work an average of 20 hours a week. The goal is to help
participants get paying jobs, according to the Labor Department. 
&#8216;Unnecessary Spending&#8217; 
Cutting the training and work effort makes little fiscal
sense, according to lawmakers such as U.S. Representative
Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat. 
&#8220;If you take away this, what other problems are you
creating?&#8221; Rangel said in an interview. &#8220;What are seniors
supposed to do if they can&#8217;t find a job and are on a limited
income? When you talk about taking away money from seniors who
are fragile economically, that has an effect. I wish when people
talked about spending, they&#8217;d talk about cutting unnecessary
spending.&#8221; 
Republican Representative Michael Simpson of Idaho, a House
Appropriations committee member who sits on three panels, said
the senior training service is an employment initiative that
simply fell victim to the deficit-reduction drive. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody is going to be pleased,&#8221; Simpson
said in an interview. &#8220;The reality is that as we try to reduce
spending, it&#8217;s taken a larger budget reduction.&#8221; 
To qualify, a seniors&#8217; income must be 125 percent of
federal poverty guidelines, or $13,613 a year for a family of
one, in most states. 
Participation is expected to fall to 70,537 people in the
year ending June 30, 2012, according to an agency report. That&#8217;s
down almost half from 130,223 the agency estimated for 2010. 
&#8216;It&#8217;s Absurd&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s absurd,&#8221; Marc Morial, chief executive officer of
the National Urban League Inc., a New York-based civil rights
group that focuses on economic issues, said in an interview.
&#8220;Obama is talking about jobs, and this is a jobs program. The
best deficit reduction program is a jobs program.&#8221; 
Cutting the funds also worsens the U.S. deficit as seniors
have less disposable income to spend, pay less in taxes, and
rely more on government aid such as food stamps, he said. 
Valerie Farrer, 77, of Verona, Wisconsin, in September 2009
qualified for the aid, working in the town library and
eventually teaching jobs skills at Experience Works. 
Her schedule has been scaled back to 22 hours a week from
28 hours following the budget cuts, she said, and her income has
dropped $200 a month. Farrer said she doesn&#8217;t turn on the air
conditioner, has cut back on groceries and limits herself to
necessities to help save money. 
She gets some help from Social Security. That income is
drained on such expenses as supplemental Medicare insurance and
car insurance, she said. 
&#8216;It&#8217;s Devastating&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s devastating when the hours are cut,&#8221; Farrer said in
an interview. &#8220;You feel as though you&#8217;re trapped. With the
program, there&#8217;s a reason to get up every day. Then the hours
are cut and it turns back into depression.&#8221; 
Fallout is being felt at the Urban League of Essex County
in Newark, New Jersey, which lost about $1.2 million in funding
on June 30, Vann Holland, director of workforce operations, said
in an interview. That left enough money to help 132
participants, said Holland, not enough for the 500 seniors
currently being aided. To help stretch dollars, training hours
were reduced to 10 hours from 20 hours a week, he said. 
&#8220;We may run out of money end of December or January,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We may have to end the program.&#8221; 
The National Caucus and Center on Black Aged Inc. in
Washington, which assists low-income seniors, fired nine full-
time staffers, and the 1,800 participants in D.C. and eight
states now train 15 hours a week, down from 20 hours, Karyne
Jones, chief executive officer, said in an interview. 
Food Stamps 
&#8220;Some participants have lost their apartments or have gone
to agencies to get food stamps,&#8221; Adrienne Wiggins, the
program&#8217;s coordinator for the group, said an interview. 
Barbara Oliphant, 65, of Washington, earned about $660 a
month for 20 hours of training as a job counselor through the
program. With a reduction in hours, she said in an interview
that she now gets about $500 for 15 hours. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s had a big impact,&#8221; said Oliphant, who lives with
her son and pays for utilities and her groceries. &#8220;With the
cutbacks, it&#8217;s just enough to get by. It&#8217;s very stressful.&#8221; 
For Perkins, the reduced training hours have left her
worried about paying her rent, she said. She no longer buys
vision contacts and she scrimps on groceries. Some weeks she
skips doing her laundry, she said. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what Congress is doing,&#8221; Perkins said
in an interview. &#8220;You&#8217;re older now but you still have skills.
This program gives you hope.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said
investors should keep buying commodities because &#8220;supply
disappointments&#8221; will support prices even as the sovereign-debt
crisis and slowing economies threaten demand. 
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index of 24
raw materials will climb 20 percent in the next 12 months, said
Jeffrey Currie, Goldman&#8217;s London-based head of commodity
research. Copper will jump 43 percent to a record $11,000 a
metric ton, while crude oil in New York surges 62 percent to
$131 a barrel, he forecast. The bank correctly advised investors
to sell oil and copper in April and turned more bullish the
following month as metals and energy rebounded. 
Commodities erased their gains for the year today, leaving
the SP GSCI spot index down 3.9 percent in 2011, after the
Federal Reserve said there are &#8220;significant downside risks&#8221; to
the economic outlook. The gauge has still jumped 31 percent in
the past two years, outperforming global equities and
Treasuries, as adverse weather threatened global crops and
China&#8217;s demand for copper, cotton and soybeans surged. 
&#8220;Despite the recent macroeconomic uncertainty, commodity
prices have been remarkably resilient,&#8221; Currie said in a report
today. &#8220;Driving this resiliency and substantially less
volatility has been continued evidence of a relatively stronger
fundamental picture due to a combination of supply
disappointments and significant demand&#8221; from emerging markets. 
The SP GSCI spot index fell 4.9 percent to 607.49 at 3:57
p.m. in New York, bringing the gauge down more than 20 percent
from this year&#8217;s high and heading for a so-called bear market. 
Hedge Funds 
In the week ended Sept. 13, hedge funds and other money
managers cut their bullish bets on raw materials for the time in
five weeks, U.S. government data show. Investors placed 29
percent less cash in commodity exchange-traded products in the
first seven months of the year, Barclays Capital said on Sept.
14. Societe Generale SA&#8217;s global asset-allocation team went
&#8220;underweight&#8221; on commodities last week, saying that the asset
class is in the &#8220;danger zone.&#8221; 
&#8220;We believe that a global recession and/or financial
crisis would be required to derail our constructive commodity
views,&#8221; Currie said. &#8220;We continue to recommend an overweight
positioning in commodities.&#8221; 
Copper Shortage 
In the six months ended in June, copper supplies trailed
demand by 130,000 tons, the International Copper Study Group
said yesterday. The most-expensive drought in Texas history has
parched pastures, prompting ranchers to cull the most breeding
cows ever and driving livestock prices to a record. The hottest
July since 1955 in the U.S. Midwest eroded corn yields and will
leave inventories before next year&#8217;s harvest at the lowest level
since 1996 as a percentage of consumption, government data show. 
Energy commodities in the GSCI Enhanced Index will advance
almost 26 percent in the next 12 months, and industrial metals
will jump 23 percent, Goldman said. Agriculture will climb 4.8
percent and precious metals by 4 percent, according to the
report. The bank lowered its three-month forecast for New York
oil by 15 percent to $97.50 a barrel. 
&#8220;We believe that the recent sell-off presents a relatively
good opportunity for longer-dated purchases,&#8221; Currie said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued mutual
fund firm American Century Cos. over claims it was shortchanged
in an $848 million optioned-share sale to Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce. 
American Century failed to disclose material information
regarding the sale and the shares weren&#8217;t purchased at their
fair market value, lawyers for JPMorgan said in a public version
of the complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court. The
complaint was initially filed under seal. 
&#8220;The allegation that American Century breached an option
agreement is without merit and the edited complaint filed in
Delaware yesterday is an inaccurate and incomplete
representation of the facts,&#8221; American Century said in a
statement e-mailed by Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the firm. 
CIBC, Canada&#8217;s fifth-largest bank, announced in July that
it agreed to buy a 41 percent stake in American Century from
JPMorgan. The cash acquisition is the third-largest purchase by
the Toronto-based bank. 
JPMorgan purchased a roughly 45 percent interest in Kansas
City, Missouri-based American Century for about $900 million in
January 1998, according to the complaint. Under a 2009 option
agreement between American and JPMorgan, American could buy all
of the shares JPMorgan owned in the firm and resell them to a
third party. 
JPMorgan, based in New York, said in its complaint that it
learned of the share sale through a public announcement. The
transaction was completed on Aug. 31. 
Withheld Information 
&#8220;American Century improperly withheld information
regarding the CIBC stock sale from JPMorgan&#8217;s director designee
on American Century&#8217;s board,&#8221; lawyers for the bank said in the
redacted complaint. 
American Century &#8220;understated its financial position&#8221; to
an independent adviser, causing a report that served as the
basis for the share repurchase to understate the firm&#8217;s fair
market value, according to the complaint. 
JPMorgan is seeking a trial to determine unspecified
damages. 
American Century accused JPMorgan of filing the complaint
as a &#8220;tactical reaction to an adverse result&#8221; in another
matter recently concluded in favor of the firm. Doyle declined
to identify that matter. 
&#8220;The heavily edited complaint removes information that
reflects negatively on JPMorgan&#8217;s conduct in the other matter,&#8221;
American Century said in the statement. &#8220;We believe that the
information JPM removed from the complaint is not confidential
and we will soon be taking appropriate action to have the
redacted information unsealed.&#8221; 
The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. American Century
Companies Inc., CA6875, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the

Gregg Lemkau to become head of mergers and acquisitions in
Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, a newly created position. 
Lemkau, 42, who has been co-head of technology, media, and
telecommunications since 2008, will keep responsibilities for
many of his current clients, the New York-based bank said in an
internal memorandum to employees obtained by Bloomberg News.
Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
confirmed the contents of the memo. 
Lemkau, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1992, became a partner
in 2002. He previously worked as chief operating officer of the
investment banking division. He will join a global mergers team
overseen by co-heads Yoel Zaoui and Gene T. Sykes, with Richard Campbell-Breeden as head of mergers for Asia outside Japan and
Dusty Philip and Michael Carr as co-heads for the Americas. 
Goldman Sachs has advised on 208 announced transactions for
a total value of $405 billion so far this year, second only to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $428 billion, according to data compiled

     Sept. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will
probably report a third-quarter loss as market tumult prevents
the bank from generating a profit for only the second time in 12
years as a public company, Barclays Capital analysts estimated. 
Goldman Sachs may lose 35 cents a share in the three months
ended Sept. 30, down from a prior estimate of $2.40 in earnings
per share, the analysts, led by Roger Freeman, said in a note to
clients today. They cut their earnings-per-share estimate for
Morgan Stanley to 12 cents from 43 cents. 
Declines in asset prices will cause losses on some of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s principal investments, which include stakes in
companies and real estate, the analysts wrote. Trading revenue
and investment banking fees have also been reduced amid falling
equity and credit markets and concerns that the European
sovereign debt crisis is worsening. 
&#8220;Nearly every line is being marked down from our prior
forecasts, which were not particularly optimistic to begin
with,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Some revenue lines are being
reduced by more than half and, due to the equity- and debt-
market decline, we are now incorporating large principal
investment losses.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs was the most profitable U.S. securities firm
in Wall Street history before converting to a bank in September
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. The fourth quarter of 2008 was the only time since
Goldman Sachs went public in 1999 that the firm has reported a
quarterly loss. Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second-biggest
securities firm after Goldman Sachs, also converted to a bank in
2008 and has expanded its retail brokerage business. 
Stocks Fall 
Goldman Sachs fell $5.28, or 5.4 percent, to $92.58, at
12:08 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
lowest level since March 2009. Morgan Stanley fell $1.16, or 8.4
percent, to $12.66, the lowest level since December 2008. 
The two companies are dropping amid an overall decline in
U.S. financial stocks, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index declining 3.4 percent. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service yesterday
lowered long-term credit ratings on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and reduced Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s short-term
rating. 
Barclays Capital is the investment-banking unit of Barclays
Plc (BARC), Britain&#8217;s second-largest bank by assets.

An ex-Galleon Group LLC trader and
expert-networking consultant were sentenced yesterday to 10
years and four years in prison for their roles in a nationwide
insider-trading scandal, just three weeks before Raj Rajaratnam,
the man at the center of the investigation, is to learn his
fate. 
Zvi Goffer, the trader, and Winifred Jiau, who worked for
Primary Global Research LLC, were convicted in June in separate
Manhattan federal court trials. Jiau was sentenced yesterday to
four years after the government asked for as long as 10 years.
Goffer received a 10-year term following a U.S. request that he
serve almost 13 years. 
Rajaratnam, 54, co-founder of Galleon, was found guilty in
May of directing the largest hedge-fund insider-trading ring. He
should be given a prison term of as long as 24 1/2 years when
sentenced, prosecutors said. His sentence was postponed
yesterday from Sept. 27 to Oct. 13. 
The sentences for Goffer and Jiau are more severe than in
typical insider-trading cases where a defendant gets and trades
on information only once, said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor
at Columbia Law School in New York. 
&#8220;These were professionals engaging in this as their
regular course of business,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;They went about it
systematically.&#8221; 
Dozens of people have been charged with participating in
overlapping insider-trading rings by the office of U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The Goffer and Rajaratnam trials
featured phone conversations secretly recorded by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The two, along with Jiau, were
convicted based partly on the testimony of co-conspirators
cooperating with prosecutors. 
Jurors at Jiau&#8217;s trial saw instant electronic messages that
a hedge fund analyst sent his boss while they were on the phone
with her. The analyst also recorded the calls. 
Goffer, who co-founded Incremental Capital LLC after he was
fired from Galleon in 2008, was convicted of all 14 criminal
counts against him. Goffer&#8217;s brother, Emanuel, and Michael
Kimelman were convicted at the same trial. Prosecutors said Zvi
Goffer headed a ring that made more than $10 million trading in
3Com Corp., Axcan Pharma Inc., Kronos Inc. and Hilton Hotels
Corp. based on information misappropriated by two lawyers. 
Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan
to send Goffer to prison for as long as 12 years and seven
months. 
Goffer, 34, claimed he&#8217;s a changed man who deserves a
lesser sentence. 
Jiau, 43, of Fremont, California, was convicted of one
count each of conspiracy and securities fraud. A jury found her
guilty of passing earnings and other information about Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to Noah Freeman, a
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager, and Samir
Barai, founder of New York-based Barai Capital Management LP. 
Prosecutors argued Jiau should get eight to 10 years in
prison in papers filed with U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff.
Jiau&#8217;s lawyers downplayed her role in the chain of inside-traders and called the government&#8217;s suggested sentence
&#8220;draconian.&#8221; 
&#8220;If Ms. Jiau was at the &#8216;heart&#8217; of anything in this case,
it was of the gang that couldn&#8217;t shoot straight,&#8221; they said. 
The cases are U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, and U.S. v.
Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
ATT Says It Wants Trial of U.S. Suit to Block T-Mobile Deal 
ATT Inc. (T) is eager for a trial of the U.S. Justice
Department&#8217;s lawsuit challenging its proposed acquisition of
wireless carrier T-Mobile USA Inc., a lawyer for the company
said. 
There was no talk of settlement yesterday in federal court
in Washington as Mark Hansen, an attorney for ATT, told U.S.
District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle that the company wants to get
to trial as quickly as possible. Huvelle, who had earlier told
the parties to come prepared to discuss settlement prospects,
set a trial date for Feb. 13. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re seeking a prompt trial because we&#8217;re very
interested in closing this transaction,&#8221; Hansen, of Kellogg,
Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans  Figel PLLC in Washington, said
during the hour-long hearing. &#8220;We need to have the cloud of
uncertainty removed. We&#8217;re already a month beyond where we want
to be.&#8221; 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. Last week, seven states joined the government&#8217;s
case seeking to stop the $39 billion deal. 
ATT is still &#8220;hopeful&#8221; it can address the Justice
Department&#8217;s antitrust concerns and reach a settlement, Michael
Balmoris, an ATT spokesman, said in an e-mail after the
hearing. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington).

Servier Founder Charged in Deaths Granted 4 Million-Euro Bail 
Jacques Servier, chairman of France&#8217;s second-largest
drugmaker, must post bail of 4 million euros ($5.51 million) and
his freedom may be restricted as he faces charges that he helped
hide the risks of a drug suspected of causing the deaths of as
many as 2,000 people. 
Servier and five affiliated companies of Laboratoires
Servier, which he founded, were charged yesterday by French
magistrates, the company said in a statement. Servier must
provide a financial guarantee of 6 million euros by Dec. 15,
according to the release. 
Servier, 89, was charged with involuntary manslaughter,
aggravated deception and fraud, the newspaper Le Monde reported,
citing his lawyer. The company remains innocent until proven
guilty and will &#8220;finally be able to defend itself in a judicial
setting,&#8221; it said in the statement. 
Mediator, the diabetes drug at the root of the case, was
sold in France for 33 years until it was withdrawn in November
2009 on safety concerns. It was widely used as an appetite
suppressant. 
JPMorgan, Citigroup Seek Dismissal of Thornburg Lawsuit 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C) and other banks asked
a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by defunct Thornburg Mortgage Inc.,
saying the complaint didn&#8217;t adequately show that fraud occurred. 
Trustee Joel Sher sued the banks for $2 billion in April,
alleging they helped push Thornburg, now called TMST Inc., into
a &#8220;free-fall&#8221; bankruptcy. Making &#8220;unjustified&#8221; margin calls,
the banks extracted more than $700 million of margin and
interest payments from Thornburg, then sold their collateral and
left the company to file for Chapter 11 protection during the
credit crisis in May 2009, Sher claimed. 
The banks, including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc and UBS AG (UBSN), or their affiliates, were trading
partners of Thornburg&#8217;s in repurchase and swap transactions used
to finance its mortgage business, the banks said in a Sept. 20
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore. Under the repo
agreements, they could make margin calls at any time if the
counterparty had a margin deficit, they said. 
Sher didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call seeking comment
on the banks&#8217; filing. He has updated the suit since it was
initially filed. 
JPMorgan was named in the TMST suit because it bought
assets from Bear Stearns Cos., a lender to Thornburg. Sher filed
at least eight lawsuits from April 28 to April 30, seeking money
from Barclays Plc (BARC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and other companies. 
The bankruptcy case is Thornburg Mortgage Inc., 09-17787,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore). 
UBS Moved Executive in FSA Risk-Management Case to Zurich 
A UBS AG executive accused of risk-management failures and
facing a potential fine by the U.K. finance regulator was moved
as early as 2008 from London to Zurich by Switzerland&#8217;s biggest
bank. 
John Pottage, the former chief executive officer of UBS&#8217;s
wealth-management division in London, will challenge the
Financial Services Authority at a court hearing in November over
its attempt to fine him for not ensuring the unit had controls
to prevent unauthorized trades that began in 2006, according to
three people familiar with the case. He now works in risk
management, two people with knowledge of his role said. 
The FSA fined UBS 8 million pounds ($12.5 million) in 2009,
at the time the third-largest penalty imposed by the regulator,
for failing to prevent employees in the international wealth-management business from making as many as 50 unauthorized
trades a day with funds from at least 39 customer accounts. The
case is an example of UBS failing to police errant trading in
London years before the bank said this week it lost $2.3 billion
from unauthorized trades. 
&#8220;Now that the machine has got going, every single bad
thing is going to come out,&#8221; said Fred Ponzo, a capital markets
adviser at Greyspark Partners in London. 
Pottage was authorized by the FSA until Dec. 15, 2008,
according to the watchdog&#8217;s website. He had authorization for
roles including chief executive, significant management,
director, apportionment and oversight, investment adviser and
insurance mediator. 
Pottage declined to comment when reached at a UBS number in
Zurich. Yves Kaufmann, a UBS spokesman in Zurich, also declined
to comment. 
Chris Hamilton, an FSA spokesman, declined to comment.
Tobias Lux, a spokesman at the Swiss regulator, declined to
comment on the case. Pottage&#8217;s lawyer, John Fordham, also
declined to comment.

Madoff Trustee Loses Bid to Quash Request for Rehearing 
The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm lost a bid to quash
investors&#8217; request for a new hearing on how he calculates who
gets compensated for losses in Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York said Aug. 16 that
trustee Irving Picard can ignore fictitious profits on money
Madoff never invested when calculating losses and who is
entitled to be repaid. Some investors who wouldn&#8217;t get paid
under the formula asked for a &#8220;rehearing,&#8221; saying the appeals
court ruled differently in a previous case. 
Picard&#8217;s move to strike the request was denied, according
to a court filing Sept. 20. 
A group of Madoff investors had urged the court to require
Picard to use their final account statements, which included
fictitious profits on money Madoff never invested, to determine
losses. Picard&#8217;s formula limits the number of investors who can
claim money, and cuts the size of many claims. 
Asking the court earlier this month to refuse to rehear the
issue, Picard said in a filing the investors failed to follow
the court&#8217;s rules. Some investors filed a 24-page petition
without asking for permission to file an oversized brief, he
said. Told by the court to shorten it, &#8220;the petitioners seek to
dodge the court&#8217;s order,&#8221; Picard said. 
&#8220;They split the arguments into two 15-page petitions, put
some of the appellants on one petition and the rest on the
other, and ask the court to consider the petitions as one,&#8221;
Picard said. &#8220;The court should strike the newly filed
petitions.&#8221; 
Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in North Carolina,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. 
The case is In re Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC, 10-2378, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan). 
Google Says Oracle Seeking $2 Billion in Android Dispute 
Google Inc. (GOOG) said Oracle Corp. (ORCL) lowered its damages request
to at least $2 billion in a patent and copyright dispute over
Android software, according to a court filing. 
Google, which said the estimate includes $1.2 billion in
damages for unjust enrichment in 2012 alone, asked a federal
judge to exclude parts of the calculation that it says aren&#8217;t
supported by the evidence. 
In July, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco
threw out Oracle&#8217;s earlier estimate that it&#8217;s entitled to as
much as $6.1 billion in damages in a lawsuit claiming Google
infringed its Java patents when it created the Android operating
system, now running on more than 150 million mobile devices. 
Oracle&#8217;s new damages report &#8220;ignores governing law and the
guidelines of this court&#8217;s July 22, 2011, order,&#8221; Google lawyer
Robert Van Nest said in a letter to Alsup Sept. 20. 
Alsup ruled in July that a new estimate should start as low
as $100 million, a figure that Mountain View, California-based
Google was offered in 2006 to license Java from Sun Microsystems
Inc. Google rejected that offer by Sun, which Oracle later
acquired. 
Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Redwood City,
California-based Oracle, the largest maker of database software,
declined to comment on the Google filing. 
The two companies have made little headway this week in
negotiations aimed at resolving the lawsuit, a person briefed on
the talks said. Google Chief Executive Larry Page and Oracle CEO
Larry Ellison participated in a settlement conference that
lasted as long as 10 hours on Sept. 19 and returned to federal
court in San Jose, California, yesterday for further meetings
with a magistrate judge. 
The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 10-03561,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco)

Trials 
Rambus Was &#8216;Dethroned&#8217; by Intel, Micron Attorney Tells Jury 
Rambus Inc. (RMBS)&#8217;s computer memory failed to become an industry
standard because it was &#8220;dethroned&#8221; by Intel Corp. (INTC), not as a
result of collusion by rivals, a lawyer for Micron Technology
Inc. (MU) told a jury. 
In closing arguments at a state-court trial in San
Francisco, William Price, a lawyer for Micron, said yesterday
that Rambus was aware of technical problems with its version of
dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, when it signed a 1996
contract to work with Santa Clara, California-based Intel Corp.,
the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker. The jury began deliberating
yesterday. 
The relationship was &#8220;conceived in fraud,&#8221; Price told
jurors. &#8220;Intel lived with Rambus&#8221; in an attempt to develop
Rambus-designed memory, or RDRAM, into a product, he said. 
&#8220;What Intel concluded at the end was RDRAM was not the
product they thought it was, and that Rambus was not the company
they thought it was,&#8221; Price said. Intel &#8220;selected Rambus to
become king, and Intel dethroned Rambus.&#8221; 
Rambus contends that Boise, Idaho-based Micron and Ichon,
South Korea-based Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) colluded to cut the
prices of their own DDR, or double data rate, memory chips and
deserted their commitment to produce RDRAM, relegating it to a
niche role. 
Rambus, which doesn&#8217;t make the chips it designs, said it
would have made $3.95 billion in royalties without the alleged
conspiracy. Under California law, a jury finding of damages in
that amount would be automatically tripled to $11.9 billion. 
The case is Rambus Inc. v. Micron Technology Inc., 04-0431105, California Superior Court (San Francisco).

Banks Don&#8217;t Provide Swap Costs, JPMorgan Executive Tells Court 
Banks don&#8217;t typically disclose what they&#8217;re charging
municipalities to arrange derivatives, a practice that isn&#8217;t
required, Antonia Creanza, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker on
trial for fraud, told a Milan court. 
&#8220;Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, &#8216;How does the bank make money?&#8217;&#8221; Creanza
told the court yesterday under questioning by her lawyer. &#8220;I
would explain that we would retain a margin. Never has a legal
adviser told me, &#8216;Look you need to detail the gross margin,&#8217;&#8221;
she said. 
JPMorgan, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa Bank Plc are
on trial on charges of mis-selling swaps to Milan, derivatives
that adjusted payments on a 1.7 billion-euro ($2.4 billion) bond
offering from 2005. Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo said the banks
misled Milan by telling the city it could save about 55 million
euros with the bond sale and a series of swaps. Robledo says the
banks earned 101 million euros in hidden fees. The banks deny
the charges. 
After selling swaps to municipalities for UniCredit SpA and
a unit of Dexia SA, Creanza told the court she joined JPMorgan&#8217;s
interest-rate derivatives team in 2004, then headed by Antonio
Polverino. JPMorgan was one many banks that courted Milan, she
said. 
From December 2004 to March 2005, before Milan&#8217;s public
tender for the financing, JPMorgan discussed various financing
scenarios with the city, Creanza told the court.

Lehman to Drop Appeal of Ruling in $11 Billion Barclays Suit 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which is gathering creditor
support for a $65 billion liquidation plan before a November
vote, said it will drop its attempt to collect $11 billion from
Barclays Plc in a dispute over the sale of Lehman operations in
2008. 
Lehman also won&#8217;t appeal a Sept. 14 ruling by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in Manhattan rejecting its claim
that Barclays owed about $500 million for allegedly unpaid
bonuses. Peck previously ruled against Lehman in the larger suit
against London-based Barclays. 
&#8220;While there are aspects of the decisions with which we do
not agree, we are also cognizant of the burdens that continued
litigation of these issues would place on the court and the
assets of the estate,&#8221; the defunct firm said in a statement
yesterday. 
After appealing Peck&#8217;s ruling in the bigger suit, Lehman
said yesterday it &#8220;respects the time and effort the court has
devoted to the serious issues raised by the estate.&#8221; Because of
the cost of continuing the litigation, Lehman said, &#8220;we have
determined that we will not pursue these issues through appeals,
believing that the resources of the court and the estate will be
better employed at this point to move the bankruptcy toward a
conclusion.&#8221; 
Lehman, once the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest investment bank,
has spent about $1.4 billion on lawyers and managers since its
2008 bankruptcy filing, the largest in U.S. history, with assets
of $639 billion. 
The New York-based firm&#8217;s bankruptcy became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the $757
million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.&#8217;s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by Lynn LoPucki, a
bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California, Los
Angeles. 
Lehman&#8217;s creditors range from banks and hedge funds to the
New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Lehman filed for bankruptcy
on Sept. 15, 2008. 
The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Verdicts/Settlements 
BofA&#8217;s $8.5 Billion Mortgage-Bond Deal Defended by Investors 
A lawyer for a group of investors that includes BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) defended their $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement with
Bank of America Corp., saying a delay in getting court approval
costs them money. 
&#8220;They believe this is a very positive settlement,&#8221; Robert
Madden, who represents 22 institutional investors, told a
federal judge in Manhattan at a court hearing yesterday. 
U.S. District Judge William Pauley heard arguments about
whether the settlement should be considered for approval in
federal court or returned to state court in New York, where it
was originally filed. 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the mortgage-bond trustee
that sought approval for the settlement, opposes moving the case
to federal court. The removal by an investor group -- Walnut
Place LLC and related entities -- threatens to &#8220;significantly
delay&#8221; the state-court proceeding, the bank said in a court
filing. 
&#8220;Delay hurts investors,&#8221; Madden said in an interview
after the hearing. When Bank of New York filed the proceeding in
state court, a judge set a November hearing to consider
approval. 
The proposed settlement resolves a fight with the
institutional investors, which wanted Bank of America to buy
back home loans that were packaged into bonds by Countrywide
Financial Corp. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North
Carolina, acquired Countrywide in 2008. 
The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Liberty Media Fends Off Bank of New York Challenge to Spinoff 
Liberty Media Corp. (LINTA) fended off Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Co.&#8217;s legal challenge to its splitoffs of the Liberty
Capital and Liberty Starz tracking stocks. 
The Delaware Supreme Court yesterday upheld a ruling that
clears the way for Liberty, controlled by billionaire John
Malone, to transfer assets of the two tracking stocks to
shareholders. 
The splitoffs are part of Malone&#8217;s efforts to simplify
Liberty&#8217;s financial structure and make it more attractive to
investors, Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets
Ltd. in New York, said last year. 
Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman, declined to
comment on the court ruling in an e-mailed statement. Liberty
Media executives plan to complete the splitoff of the units
tomorrow, Courtnee Ulrich, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. 
As part of the deals, officials of Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty want to redeem outstanding shares of the units in
exchange for shares in a newly formed company. 
Liberty Starz holds Liberty Media&#8217;s interest in television
company Starz Entertainment, according to the parent company&#8217;s
website. Liberty Capital holds assets, including production and
distribution company Starz Media LLC, and investments in Time
Warner Inc. (TWX), Time Warner Cable Inc. and Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)

Litigation Departments 
AIG Hires Ex-IRS Deputy Counsel Potter to Protect Tax Assets 
American International Group Inc. (AIG), the bailed-out insurer,
hired Clarissa Potter, former deputy chief counsel of the
Internal Revenue Service, to help protect tax assets accumulated
by the firm. 
Potter will be deputy tax director, reporting to Tal
Kaissar, director of tax, the insurer said yesterday in a
statement. 
Losses at New York-based AIG and its subsidiaries helped
rack up more than $25 billion of so-called deferred tax assets
as of Dec. 31 that may lower obligations to governments. Chief
Executive Officer Robert Benmosche, 67, said last month the
insurer is assembling a &#8220;world-class team&#8221; to manage the
assets and that they may be used for buybacks when AIG is
prepared to repurchase stock. 
&#8220;The complexity of AIG&#8217;s global structure requires a
holistic approach to compliance with domestic and international
tax law,&#8221; Kaissar said in the statement. Potter&#8217;s &#8220;first-hand
understanding of tax policy makes her uniquely positioned to
help AIG in this regard.&#8221;

Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) won U.S. approval
for an expanded use of Remicade to treat children with a chronic
inflammatory bowel disease who don&#8217;t respond to traditional
therapy. 
The Food and Drug Administration cleared the medicine
chemically known as infliximab for pediatric ulcerative colitis,
the company said today in a statement. 
Remicade was approved in 1998 as the first anti-tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatment in the U.S. It is used in
Crohn&#8217;s disease in adults and children, and ulcerative colitis,
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis in adults. Most children with
ulcerative colitis are first treated with anti-inflammatory
drugs and with steroids, according to the Pediatric IBD
Foundation. 
&#8220;Ulcerative colitis can be a devastating disease and
previously, there had been no approved therapeutic options for
pediatric patients who had an inadequate response to
conventional therapy,&#8221; Jeffrey Hyams, head of digestive
diseases and nutrition at Connecticut Children&#8217;s Medical Center,
said in the statement from New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ. 
Hyams, also a professor of pediatrics at the University of
Connecticut School of Medicine, was the lead investigator in a
company-sponsored study that showed 73 percent of children with
ulcerative colitis responded to the drug within eight weeks. 
About 150,000 children younger than age 17 are living with
the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, JJ said. Ulcerative
colitis can slow growth in children and delay sexual maturation,
according to the Mayo Clinic based in Rochester, Minnesota. 
Serious Risks 
While the drug&#8217;s approval provides a new treatment option
for children with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, there
are &#8220;serious risks&#8221; associated with its use because it
suppresses the immune system, Donna Griebel, director of the
FDA&#8217;s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products,
said in a statement. 
The drug carries a boxed warning, the FDA&#8217;s strongest
caution, for increased risks of cancer and viral, fungal or
bacterial infections. 
A rare, often fatal type of cancer called Hepatosplenic T-
cell Lymphoma is among malignancies that have been reported in
adolescent and young adult patients using TNF blockers, the
agency said in the statement. 
An FDA advisory panel on July 21 backed Remicade for
pediatric ulcerative colitis to induce and maintain clinical
remission and induce mucosal healing. The panel didn&#8217;t recommend
the therapy to maintain mucosal healing or eliminate
corticosteroid use. The medicine generated $4.6 billion in
revenue last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Credit-default swaps on Morgan
Stanley (MS) surged to the highest level in more than two years amid
concern the global economic recovery is fading. 
The cost to protect the New York-based bank&#8217;s debt for five
years climbed 30.1 basis points to 435 basis points, the highest
level since March 10, 2009, according to data provider CMA. One-
year contracts jumped 55.5 basis points to 505.8, signaling that
traders are pricing in a greater probability of credit
deterioration in the short term. 
&#8220;An inverted curve for a financial services firm is never
a good thing,&#8221; said Bonnie Baha, head of global developed
credit group at DoubleLine Capital LP, which has $16 billion in
assets under management. &#8220;I&#8217;m still pretty concerned about the
banks.&#8221; Morgan Stanley lacks the deposit bases of many of its
peers, she said. 
Five-year credit-default swaps on New York-based Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) increased for a sixth day, adding 9 basis
points to 297, the data show. 
Contracts on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) eased 2.3 basis points to
150.4, those on Citigroup Inc. (C) were little changed at 280.5, and
those on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) fell 2.8 basis points to 153.2,
the data show. Contracts on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) dropped from
the highest level since March 2009, declining 9.4 basis points
to 390.6, the data show. 
&#8216;Very Volatile&#8217; 
Swaps on Morgan Stanley pared an earlier jump to as high as
a mid-price of 470 basis points, according to broker Phoenix
Partners Group, on signs policy makers will act to prevent the
debt crisis from worsening. The swaps typically rise as investor
confidence deteriorates and fall as it improves. 
&#8220;Today the market in general is just very, very volatile,
and we&#8217;ve seen some as much as 50 wider and back to unchanged,&#8221;
John Guarnera, a financial analyst at Societe Generale SA in New
York, said in a telephone interview. 
The Markit Group Ltd. CDX North America High Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence deteriorates, climbed 0.2
percentage points to 91.8 percent of face value as of 5:20 p.m.
in New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.
Earlier it fell as much as 0.8 percentage points. It&#8217;s decreased
for four of six days, and it fell to 91.3 on Sept. 12, which was
the least since September 2009. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s credit rankings were
cut by Fitch Ratings for failing to pay off more of its debt
since the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker acquired Wyeth in 2009. 
The London-based rating service reduced Pfizer to an A+
from AA- saying its leverage level &#8220;is still not commensurate
with&#8221; the higher rating. Fitch expected the New York-based
company to reduce its debt to 1.3 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, said Michael Zbinovec, a Fitch analyst based in Chicago. Instead, the New
York-based company cut its debt to 1.5 times Ebitda, he said. 
Zbinovec said Pfizer had tripled its debt load after the
$68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. A combination of the
debt and a reduction in revenue growth prevented the drugmaker
from reaching the target, he said. 
&#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s ability to pay its debt obligation is somewhat
constrained,&#8221; Zbinovec said. &#8220;But the new rating should be
good for the next year and a half even with the acceleration in
patent expirations that will affect Pfizer.&#8221; 
The patent on Pfizer&#8217;s best-selling drug Lipitor expires in
November. The cholesterol medicine generated $10.7 billion in
2010. 
Fitch also revised its outlook to stable from negative.

Morgan Stanley (MS), gained the most
among the biggest U.S. banks in New York trading as concern
eased that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would expose the firm to losses
from French lenders. 
Morgan Stanley climbed 66 cents, or 5 percent, to $13.72 at
4:15 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
It was the biggest increase among the 81 companies on the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index. 
Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst, wrote in
a note to clients that the New York-based lender faces less than
$2 billion of risks linked to France. Potential losses connected
to French banks wouldn&#8217;t exceed 65 cents a share, according to
Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC. 
Having $2 billion at risk &#8220;is not good, but it&#8217;s not
threatening in any fashion,&#8221; Bove, who expects Morgan Stanley
to rise to $31 over the next 12 to 18 months, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s no certainty that the French
banks are going to fail, and No. 2, if they do fail, there&#8217;s no
certainty that all $2 billion will go down with the French
banks.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
in a filing last year that it had about $39 billion at risk with
French lenders, which are falling on concern that the sovereign-
debt crisis will spur losses. The figure exaggerates actual
risks because it includes all funds in French accounts, such as
client holdings, and excludes collateral posted to Morgan
Stanley, Bove and Hintz said. 
Morgan Stanley has declined about 50 percent this year. The
MSCI All-Country World Index of 45 nations fell into a bear
market this week for the first time in more than two years. 
Management at Morgan Stanley has increased capital to
contend with Europe&#8217;s crisis, Hintz wrote. Mark Lake, a company
spokesman, declined to comment on analysts&#8217; estimates of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s foreign risks.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Priceline.com
Inc. (PCLN) are among 26 stocks JPMorgan Chase  Co. says may return
more than the market if U.S. equities drop like they did after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
The list includes companies with high price-to-book and
price-to-earnings ratios that are also liked by analysts and are
considered growth stocks, Thomas Lee, the New York-based firm&#8217;s
chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note today. Stocks that
meet the criteria may perform better than benchmark gauges in
two scenarios: if the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index plunges like
it did in 2008 after Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy, or if it rallies,
which is what happened following the Asian crisis, he said. 
The benchmark gauge for American equities is down 17
percent from its high in April after the U.S. lost its AAA
credit rating from SP and concern about the European debt
crisis grew. Since the beginning of August, the index has traded
between about 1,100 and 1,300. While U.S. equities reacted in
opposite directions after the two previous crises, Lee said the
valuation levels and fundamentals of the 26 stocks may mean
they&#8217;re poised to outperform no matter which direction the SP
500 moves. 
&#8220;What worked both post-Asia &#8217;98 and post-Lehman failure
&#8217;08?&#8221; Lee wrote in the note. &#8220;It is not entirely a surprise
that &#8216;growth&#8217; outperformed, but the fact these other style
attributes outperformed is less obvious.&#8221; 
Lee considered companies in the SP 500 Pure Growth Index
and corporations with an enterprise value at least 8.8 times 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
He looked for price-to-book values higher than 2.89 and price-
to-earnings ratios above 13.9. 
The following is the list of 26 stocks that met the
criteria, according to Lee.

AppNexus Inc., the online
advertising company backed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), has turned
profitable and may go public late next year, founder and Chief
Executive Officer Brian O&#8217;Kelley said. 
The New York-based company has raised $65.5 million since
it was founded in 2007, with the last round of $50 million led
by Microsoft in October. AppNexus had its first profitable month
in August, O&#8217;Kelley said in an interview. 
&#8220;The financials, the revenue, the profit and the growth
are all strong enough that we could be going public as soon as
late next year,&#8221; said O&#8217;Kelley, 34. &#8220;That&#8217;s really the path.&#8221; 
AppNexus provides technology, data and analytics that
companies such as Microsoft and EBay Inc. use to buy and sell
online display-advertising. The market for graphical display ads
is set to climb 25 percent in the U.S. in 2011, and will almost
double to $22 billion in 2015 from this year&#8217;s level, according
New York-based EMarketer Inc., which tracks digital marketing. 
&#8220;The idea of real-time bidding is going to become
increasingly important,&#8221; said David Hallerman, an analyst with
EMarketer in New York. &#8220;There is sheer growth of display-ad
inventory as people spend more time online.&#8221; 
AppNexus said its revenue has grown fourfold this year
compared with 2010. The company hasn&#8217;t hired investment banks
and the IPO timing depends on market conditions, O&#8217;Kelley said.
Newly issued stocks during their first publicly traded year are
performing the worst since July 2009, according to the Bloomberg
IPO Index. 
Right Media, DoubleClick 
O&#8217;Kelley said he prefers an IPO to a sale as the management
team wants to be in charge of building AppNexus into a global
company. 
&#8220;It would be hard to see a sale as the right outcome,&#8221;
O&#8217;Kelley said. &#8220;I feel immense loyalty to the team we&#8217;ve built.
As a public company we can control our destiny.&#8221; 
Many of O&#8217;Kelley&#8217;s top employees came from companies that
were bought. He and co-founder Mike Nolet worked at online
advertising company Right Media Inc., and left when Yahoo! Inc.
purchased it in 2007. Michael Rubenstein, now AppNexus
president, was at DoubleClick Inc. when Google Inc. (GOOG) purchased it
in 2008 for about $3.1 billion. AppNexus began with 20 employees
and projects to be at 200 at end of this year. 
For the next few months, O&#8217;Kelley will build the business
through acquisitions in Europe. His management team has talked
to more than 80 European companies on a trip this week,
including customers and potential takeover targets, he said. 
The company, which opened an office in London this summer,
was drawn to Europe through partnerships with Hi-Media SA (HIM), a
Paris-based electronic payments company, and Microsoft, the
world&#8217;s largest software maker, O&#8217;Kelley said. 
Microsoft, the fourth-biggest seller of display ads in the
U.S., unveiled partnerships this month with AppNexus and
MediaMath. Microsoft&#8217;s share is less than one-third of
Facebook&#8217;s and about half of Google&#8217;s, according to EMarketer. 
AppNexus&#8217;s investors also include Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway, First Round Capital, Venrock Associates, Kodiak Venture
Partners and Khosla Ventures. Bloomberg LP, the parent company
of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen&#8217;s venture-
capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz.

Morgan Stanley (MS), whose shares
dropped yesterday on concern French losses will mount, faces
less than $2 billion of risks linked to the country, according
to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst. 
&#8220;There is solid evidence that shows Morgan Stanley has
been taking action to limit risk in preparation for potentially
difficult market conditions ahead,&#8221; Hintz, who is based in New
York, wrote in a note to clients today. &#8220;We estimate that total
risk to France and its banks is less than $2 billion net of
collateral and hedges.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley said in a filing last year that its exposure
was about $39 billion to French lenders, which are falling on
concern Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis will spur losses. That
figure exaggerates the value of the New York-based bank&#8217;s actual
risks because it includes all funds in French accounts, such as
client holdings, and excludes collateral posted to Morgan
Stanley, Hintz wrote. 
Morgan Stanley management has increased capital and boosted
its liquidity pool to contend with Europe&#8217;s crisis, Hintz wrote. 
Shares of the company dropped 52 percent this year through
yesterday as global equities fell into a bear market this week
for the first time in more than two years. Morgan Stanley
climbed 33 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $13.39 in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange at 9:39 a.m.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said the global financial system risks
repeating the crisis of 2008 if Europe&#8217;s debt crisis escalates
and spreads to the U.S. banking industry. 
&#8220;This is where the parallels with 2008 are relevant, even
though I think they are being over exaggerated,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said
in an interview on CNBC today. &#8220;It was when the financial
system really imploded that financial firms stopped extending
credit to anybody that the corporate world had to destock and we
know what happened after that. We are not far off the same sort
of thing.&#8221; 
More than $3.4 trillion has been erased from equity values
this week, driving global stocks into a bear market, as the
Federal Reserve&#8217;s new stimulus and a pledge by Group of 20
nations fails to ease concern the global economy is on the brink
of another recession. O&#8217;Neill said the Fed&#8217;s plan to shift $400
billion of short-term debt into longer term Treasuries hasn&#8217;t
convinced investors it will strengthen growth. 
&#8220;The fear that it&#8217;s all dependent on the Fed, together
with this mess in Europe, is really getting people more and more
worried as this week comes to an end,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;The
markets have taken the latest FOMC move rather badly, which adds
a whole new angle to it. It&#8217;s the first time since the global
rally started in early 2009 that the markets have rejected a Fed
easing.&#8221; 
Stocks Decline 
The decline in U.S. stocks after the announcement on Sept.
21 of the Fed&#8217;s announcement contrasts with the reaction to the
second round of quantitative easing. The SP 500 Index rose 24
percent from the day Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first signaled the
policy in August 2010 to its conclusion in June. 
European stocks fell for a third day today, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slipping 1.5 percent as of 1:52 p.m. in London.
The FTSE 100 Index declined 1.2 percent. U.S. stock futures also
fell. 
&#8220;The solution for the U.S. is not more tinkering by the
Fed, but doing things like micro-policies to get U.S. companies
to spend more money on investment and jobs,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. 
Group of 20 finance chiefs late yesterday promised to
address rising risks to the global economy and pushed Europe to
contain its debt crisis. The European Central Bank may act to
tackle risks to growth as soon as next month should economic
data disappoint, Governing Council member Luc Coene said. 
&#8220;As the problem in Europe spreads from Greece to more and
more other countries and in particular Italy, the exposure that
so many people bank-wise have to Italian debt means the systems
can&#8217;t cope easily with that and it would spread way beyond
Europe&#8217;s borders,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;This is why the policy
makers need to stop being so sleepy and get on and lead.&#8221;

Bank of America Corp. (BAC) is among a
group of lenders that may face a wave of new lawsuits claiming
cash-strapped counties were cheated out of millions of dollars
by a system used for more than a decade to register mortgages. 
Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said state
attorneys general and county officials across the U.S. have
expressed interest in his lawsuit against Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems Inc. and Bank of America, filed in Texas
state court on Sept. 21. Dallas County could be owed as much as
$100 million in filing fees, he said. 
&#8220;This is a big new front,&#8221; said Christopher L. Peterson,
associate dean and professor at the University of Utah S.J.
Quinney College of Law. &#8220;This case is scary because if Dallas
wins then there are a lot of other counties around the country
that are going to follow.&#8221; 
MERS, a unit of Reston, Virginia-based Merscorp Inc., says
on its website that its aim is to place every mortgage in the
country on an electronic, rather than a paper, system that
allows members to buy and sell mortgages. 
MERS acts as the lender&#8217;s nominee and remains the mortgagee
of record as long as the note promising repayment is owned by a
MERS member. Dallas County claims this allows banks to buy and
sell loans without properly recording transfers with counties
and paying the fee. 
&#8220;The MERS business model and practices are legal and
comply with the recording statutes and regulations of Texas,&#8221;
Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Merscorp, said in an e-mail. The
claims in the lawsuit &#8220;are without legal or factual merit.&#8221; 
Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender by
assets, declined to comment on the suit. 
Liability in the Dallas case could exceed $1 billion, based
on the number of mortgages in the county, Peterson said. Local
laws impose substantial penalties, as well as back payments of
fees and taxes, if false documents were filed in land
transactions, said Peterson, who has advised private plaintiffs
making similar claims. 
Faulty mortgages and foreclosures have already cost the
five biggest home lenders $66 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America&#8217;s credit rating was cut
on Sept. 21 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in part because the
bill for mortgage disputes may climb past the $39 billion
committed since 2007. County clerks in Kentucky have also sued
MERS, while officials in Massachusetts and Michigan say they are
exploring the possibility. 
The Texas case is Dallas County v. Merscorp Inc., CC-11-
06571-E, County Court at Law, Dallas County, Texas. The Kentucky
case is Christian County Clerk v. Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems Inc., 5:11-cv-00072, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Kentucky (Louisville).

New Suits 
JPMorgan Sues American Century Over $848 Million Share Sale 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued mutual fund firm American Century
Cos. over claims it was shortchanged in a $848 million optioned
share sale to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 
American Century failed to disclose material information
regarding the sale and the shares were not purchased at their
fair market value, lawyers for JPMorgan said in a public version
of the complaint filed Sept. 21 in Delaware Chancery Court. The
complaint was initially filed under seal. 
&#8220;The allegation that American Century breached an option
agreement is without merit and the edited complaint filed in
Delaware yesterday is an inaccurate and incomplete
representation of the facts,&#8221; American Century said in a
statement e-mailed by Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the firm. 
CIBC, Canada&#8217;s fifth-largest bank, announced in July that
it agreed to buy a 41 percent stake in American Century from
JPMorgan. The cash acquisition is the third-largest purchase by
the Toronto-based bank. 
JPMorgan purchased a roughly 45 percent interest in Kansas
City, Missouri-based American Century for about $900 million in
January 1998, according to the complaint. Under a 2009 option
agreement between American and JPMorgan, American could purchase
all of the shares JPMorgan owned in the firm and resell them to
a third party. 
JPMorgan, based in New York, said in its complaint that it
learned of the share sale through a public announcement. The
transaction was completed on Aug. 31. 
&#8220;American Century improperly withheld information
regarding the CIBC stock sale from JPMorgan&#8217;s director designee
on American Century&#8217;s board,&#8221; lawyers for the bank said in the
redacted complaint. 
The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. American Century
Companies Inc., CA6875, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington.)

Madoff Trustee Sues Atlantic Security Bank for $120 Million 
The trustee overseeing the liquidation of Bernard L.
Madoff&#8217;s firm sued Atlantic Security Bank for $120 million. 
The lawsuit is one of several filed by Irving Picard to
recoup what he said is &#8220;customer property&#8221; from companies that
invested with Fairfield Sentry Ltd., a so-called feeder fund
that placed money in the con man&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. Atlantic
Security Bank is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and has
offices in Panama, according to Picard&#8217;s suit filed yesterday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. A phone number for the bank
couldn&#8217;t be immediately located. 
The case is Picard v. Atlantic Security Bank, 11-02730,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Madoff Family Wins Partial Dismissal of $198 Million Suit 
Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s family won dismissal of part of a $198
million lawsuit by the liquidator of the con man&#8217;s firm, while
the judge left Irving Picard free to pursue most of his claims. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland struck Picard&#8217;s
claims for some transfers of money out of the jailed Ponzi
scheme operator&#8217;s firm. Picard, who sued Madoff&#8217;s brother, two
sons and niece, is free to amend his suit, the judge said in a
court filing yesterday. 
Picard&#8217;s 2009 lawsuit against the brother, Peter Madoff,
sons Andrew and Mark Madoff and niece Shana Madoff Swanson, all
of whom held senior positions at the defunct money-management
firm, claimed they spent more than $198 million of investors&#8217;
money and treated the con man&#8217;s investment firm as their
&#8220;family piggy bank.&#8221; 
Peter Madoff was chief compliance officer at Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Madoff&#8217;s sons, Andrew and
Mark, were co-directors of trading at the investment firm, and
Shana Madoff was compliance director, according to Picard. 
Mark Madoff committed suicide in December. 
&#8220;Mark and Andrew Madoff had no prior knowledge of Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s crimes and contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and
the SEC immediately after their father told them he had
defrauded his investment advisory clients,&#8221; Martin Flumenbaum,
a lawyer for Andrew Madoff and Mark Madoff&#8217;s estate, said in an
e-mail yesterday. &#8220;Whether or not the trustee amends his
complaint to reassert some or all of the claims that were
dismissed today, we fully expect to prevail on the merits.&#8221; 
Charles Spada, who has been representing Peter Madoff, had
no comment on the ruling. 
Mark Smith, a lawyer for Shana Madoff, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment yesterday. 
Refusing to dismiss the entire suit, Lifland said the
family&#8217;s failure to stop Madoff&#8217;s fraud was &#8220;unsurprising given
their close familial relationship with Madoff and proximity&#8221; to
his firm. However, Picard&#8217;s suit contains &#8220;some correctable
pleading deficiencies&#8221; that need to be amended, he said. 
The case is Picard v. Peter Madoff, 09-1503, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

UBS Trader Adoboli Faces Added Fraud Charge, Prosecutor Says 
Kweku Adoboli, the UBS AG (UBSN) trader charged with fraud and
false accounting that may have resulted in a $2.3 billion loss,
said through his lawyer that he was &#8220;sorry beyond words&#8221; after
facing an additional fraud charge at a court hearing yesterday. 
The 31-year-old, who holds a Ghanaian passport, didn&#8217;t
apply for bail when he appeared at a magistrate&#8217;s court in
London. Prosecutor David Levy said the alleged loss may exceed
$2.3 billion. Adoboli wasn&#8217;t required to enter a plea yesterday
and another hearing was scheduled for Oct. 20. 
The trader is &#8220;sorry beyond words for what happened
here,&#8221; said Patrick Gibbs, Adoboli&#8217;s lawyer. He apologized for
his &#8220;disastrous miscalculations,&#8221; Gibbs said. 
Adoboli, who appeared yesterday wearing a dark grey suit,
white shirt and navy tie, has been in police custody since he
was arrested Sept. 15 on suspicion of making the unauthorized
trades. 
Prosecutors charged him Sept. 17 with fraud and false
accounting dating back to 2008. The prosecution yesterday added
a charge to extend the fraud allegations to 2008 as well. 
If convicted, he faces as many as 10 years in prison,
according to sentencing guidelines. Time spent in custody
beforehand would be deducted from any sentence. 
Louise Hodges, another of Adoboli&#8217;s lawyers, declined to
comment after the hearing. Yves Kaufmann, a spokesman for UBS in
Zurich said &#8220;the loss arising from the unauthorized trades is
$2.3 billion, as we have stated&#8221; previously.

Smith Barney Lead Plaintiff Thrown Out, Never Owned Shares 
Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s Smith Barney unit can&#8217;t be sued by the
lead plaintiff in a six-year-old shareholder fraud class action
because the fund never owned any shares that are the basis of
the lawsuit, a judge said. 
U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III, citing &#8220;epic
failures&#8221; by the lawyers on both sides of the case, yesterday
dismissed the lead plaintiff, Operating Local 649 Annuity Trust
Fund. The fund&#8217;s attorneys told the judge that their client
owned more than 75,000 shares of a similarly named security and
not those involved in the case. 
Pauley called the effect of the error &#8220;seismic,&#8221; and said
it has caused &#8220;considerable waste of time and resources.&#8221; 
&#8220;After six years of litigation, including extensive motion
practice, an appeal to the Second Circuit, remand, more motion
practice, and discovery, lead counsel learned that the lead
plaintiff never purchased any of the securities at issue in this
action,&#8221; Pauley, in Manhattan, wrote in yesterday&#8217;s decision. 
Bernstein Liebhard partner Stanley Bernstein said the
lawyers relied on the union&#8217;s certification that it had bought
the mutual fund shares and brokerage statements that mistakenly
reflected the mutual fund shares along with their ticker symbol. 
&#8220;We did not just rely on somebody&#8217;s word,&#8221; Bernstein said
in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;We had the underlying core
documentation from the broker. And it was wrong.&#8221; 
Charles Platt, a partner in the New York office of Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, which represents Citigroup,
declined to comment on Pauley&#8217;s opinion yesterday. 
The mistake will require several motions to be rebriefed, 
The case is In re Smith Barney Transfer Agent Litigation,

(Manhattan).

Deutsche Bank Swap Ruling May Apply to Other Cases, Judge Says 
A German top court ruling on swaps that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
lost in March may also apply in cases involving other
derivatives, a judge said. 
The Frankfurt Regional Court will review to what extent the
top court ruling governs currency options as well, Presiding
Judge Bruno Menhofer said yesterday at a hearing in a lawsuit
against the lender seeking 30 million euros ($40 million) in
damages. The court&#8217;s assessment is preliminary, he said. The
case was brought by travel company Schauinsland-Reisen GmbH. 
The Federal Court of Justice, Germany&#8217;s highest civil
court, ruled in March that Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank must
cover losses caused by a derivative it branded a &#8220;CMS Spread
Ladder Swap,&#8221; because the bank didn&#8217;t disclose the product had
a initial negative market value. Deutsche Bank is arguing that
ruling only applies to the same kind of product. Former
customers are hoping to capitalize on the ruling to collect
damages for other bets that went sour. 
&#8220;The top court has used very, very strong language as
regards disclosure duties the bank has,&#8221; said Menhofer. &#8220;The
ruling is a leading precedent setting clear standards and we
have to see how they apply to the product at issue here.&#8221; 
Yesterday&#8217;s case is LG Frankfurt, 3-04 O 50/10.

Saad Group&#8217;s Al-Sanea Wins End to $9.2 Billion Asset Freeze 
Maan al-Sanea, founder of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Saad Group, won
dismissal of a $9.2 billion asset freeze in the Cayman Islands
after Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi  Brothers Co. admitted failing to
disclose evidence. 
Algosaibi agreed it &#8220;breached its duty of full and frank
disclosure&#8221; when it won the asset freeze against al-Sanea in
2009, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands ruled Sept. 21.
Algosaibi applied last month to voluntarily dismiss the freeze
after it found new evidence that should have been revealed
earlier. Al-Sanea still faces a fraud lawsuit filed by Algosaibi
in New York and probes in Bahrain and Switzerland. 
&#8220;Since AHAB started its litigation scheme over two years
ago, I have been resolute in my complete rejection of its
desperate claims that I somehow defrauded the Algosaibis,&#8221; al-
Sanea said yesterday in a statement, using Algosaibi&#8217;s initials. 
The asset freeze was part of a global legal dispute between
the companies after they defaulted in 2009 on a total of about
$15.7 billion in loans from more than 100 banks. Al-Sanea, one
of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s richest men who married into the Algosaibi
family before founding Saad Group, faces claims he forged
signatures to take out as much as $10 billion in fake loans
through Algosaibi&#8217;s Money Exchange unit, which he ran. 
The dismissal of the asset freeze doesn&#8217;t prove al-Sanea&#8217;s
innocence or reduce his legal troubles, said Eric Lewis, a legal
coordinator for the Algosaibi family. Al-Sanea has refused to
appear in court in the Cayman Islands, Lewis said. 
Algosaibi &#8220;voluntarily withdrew the freezing order and did
not seek a new one, despite all the essential allegations of
fraud and forgery having been proven correct,&#8221; Lewis said.
&#8220;Maan al-Sanea has spent two years in procedural maneuvers to
avoid a court from considering his vast fraud.&#8221;

Boeing, General Dynamics Seek End to $3 Billion Claims Case 
Boeing Co. (BA) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) urged a federal
claims court judge to end the companies&#8217; 20-year-old dispute
with the U.S. in which the government sought $3 billion over a
canceled Navy aircraft contract. 
Lawyers for the companies asked U.S. Federal Claims Judge
Robert Hodges during a hearing yesterday to find that the case
over the A-12 bomber can no longer be litigated because of
classified data, noting that the parties, with their cross
claims, &#8220;have fought to a draw&#8221; after two decades. 
&#8220;We have come the conclusion that it&#8217;s time for the Boeing
Company to lay down its sword,&#8221; said Boeing&#8217;s lawyer, Charles
Cooper of Cooper  Kirk in Washington. 
The fight has moved back and forth among courts since it
began in 1991, reaching the U.S. Supreme Court in September
2010. In May, the high court set aside a ruling that put the
U.S. in line to recover $3 billion from the companies. The case
was sent back to a lower court to determine whether the
government had a responsibility to disclose classified
information vital to the performance of the contract. 
The Justice Department said yesterday that it will continue
to pursue the claim, arguing that the justices had an
opportunity to dismiss the case and didn&#8217;t. 
&#8220;If the Supreme Court had wanted that outcome, it could
have ordered that outcome,&#8221; Justice Department lawyer Bryant
Snee said. 
In August, lawyers for Boeing, which also filed claims
against the government, sent a letter to the department urging
it to drop the case. 
&#8220;The time has come for all parties to step back, to
reflect on where we are after two decades of contesting this
matter, and to finally do what we should have done years ago:
agree to bring this litigation to an end,&#8221; the Boeing lawyers
wrote, submitting the letter to U.S. Court of Federal Claims in
a Sept. 20 filing. 
The case is Boeing Co. v. U.S., 91-cv-1204, U.S. Court of
Federal Claims (Washington).

Trials 
Galleon Sentencing Scorecard: Average Prison Term Is 3 Years 
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam will be
sentenced on Oct. 13 for insider trading after being convicted
by a jury in Manhattan federal court. 
Prosecutors say Rajaratnam, who was convicted in May,
should serve as long as 24 1/2 years in prison, calling him the
&#8220;modern face of insider trading.&#8221; On Sept. 21, judges in
Manhattan sentenced two other convicted insider traders -- Zvi
Goffer and Winifred Jiau -- to prison terms of 10 years and four
years, respectively. 
Since Rajaratnam&#8217;s arrest in October 2009, judges in
Manhattan federal court have sentenced 12 defendants in cases
linked to Galleon. All but two pleaded guilty. The average
prison term has been 35.75 months, or almost three years behind
bars. 
Typically, those convicted at a trial get longer prison
terms than those pleading guilty. In addition to the two Galleon
defendants who took their cases to a jury, Manhattan judges
since 2003 have imposed sentences in three other cases where the
main charge was insider trading and a jury returned a guilty
verdict. The average sentence has been six years and two months. 
About two dozen others are waiting to be sentenced in the
Galleon cases. They include Emanuel Goffer, a former trader and
brother of Zvi Goffer, who was convicted at a trial, and Anil
Kumar, a former McKinsey  Co. executive who pleaded guilty and
testified against Rajaratnam in a bid for leniency. 
The Rajaratnam case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184,

Verdicts/Settlements 
Judge Approves Madoff Trustee Settlement With Tremont Funds 
A judge approved a $1 billion settlement of a lawsuit by
liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm and hedge-fund firm Tremont
Group Holdings Inc. 
In the deal approved yesterday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland, trustee Irving Picard will accept a cash payment
of more than $1 billion from funds associated with Tremont. In
exchange, the Tremont funds will be allowed to make claims on
the Madoff estate of about $3 billion, according to court
filings. 
The settlement is &#8220;fair and reasonable,&#8221; Lifland said. 
Among the parties settling were Oppenheimer Acquisition
Corp., an affiliate of the Oppenheimer mutual funds that bought
Tremont, and Oppenheimer&#8217;s parents, MassMutual Holding LLC and
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
Earlier this month, New York Life Insurance Co. and six
other insurance companies assailed the settlement. As limited
partners of the hedge-fund firm&#8217;s Opportunity III fund, they
said they would lose if a court rules that the Ponzi scheme&#8217;s
so-called net winners should be compensated, because they
wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to recalculate their claims. A U.S. appeals
court yesterday denied Picard&#8217;s move to strike a request by
Madoff investors for a second hearing on the issue. 
Picard sued Tremont and related entities for $2.1 billion,
saying they ignored warnings that Madoff could be running a
Ponzi scheme and profited from it, according to a complaint
unsealed in March. The payment from Tremont, the second-biggest
so-called feeder into Madoff&#8217;s multibillion-dollar fraud, will
add to the $2.6 billion in the fund for Madoff customers, Picard
has said. 
The case is Picard v. Tremont Group Holdings Inc., 10-5310,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan.)

PharmAthene Wins Rights to Profit From Siga Smallpox Drug 
Siga Technologies Inc. (SIGA) must share with PharmAthene Inc. (PIP)
profit from sales of a smallpox drug that may total more than
$400 million, a judge ruled. Trading in shares of both companies
was halted. 
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr. in
Wilmington said yesterday New York-based Siga breached its
obligation to negotiate in good faith on ST-246, an antiviral
drug for use in case of a biological attack. Parsons rejected
PharmAthene&#8217;s claim that Siga breached a binding license
agreement. He also denied claims for a lump sum award and
instead ordered the companies to share the profits. 
&#8220;The plaintiff is entitled to share in any profits
realized from the sale of the drug in question,&#8221; Parsons said
yesterday in a 118-page opinion. 
Lewis Goldberg, a Siga spokesman, said the company couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment on the ruling. Siga was preparing a
statement, he said. 
Stacey Jurchison, a spokeswoman for Annapolis, Maryland-
based PharmAthene, said the ruling appears to have granted the
company a &#8220;50 percent profit split.&#8221; 
&#8220;We think it is a very good outcome,&#8221; Jurchison said in a
phone interview. 
The case is PharmAthene Inc. v. Siga Technologies Inc.,
CA2627, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Ford Wins Reversal of $43 Million Award in Fatal Crash Case 
Ford Motor Co. (F) won reversal of an Illinois jury&#8217;s $43
million damage award in a lawsuit filed after a 2003 crash
killed a 73-year-old man and severely burned his wife. 
The Illinois Supreme Court yesterday threw out the verdict
rendered after a 2005 trial concluding that Dora Jablonski and
the estate of her husband, John, failed to prove the gas tank of
their 1993 Lincoln Town Car had been defectively designed. 
Their car burst into flames after being hit in the rear by
another vehicle traveling at an estimated 55 to 65 miles per
hour while they were stopped at a highway construction zone in
southwest Illinois, causing an item in the trunk to pierce the
tank. 
&#8220;Plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence from which a
jury could conclude that Ford breached its duty of reasonable
care&#8221; on three negligent design theories, the court said. It
rejected a fourth argument as not viable under state law. 
Bradley M. Lakin, the Wood River, Illinois, attorney who
took the case to trial, didn&#8217;t immediately reply to telephone
messages seeking comment on yesterday&#8217;s ruling. 
&#8220;Ford is gratified by the court&#8217;s decision,&#8221; Marcey
Evans, a spokeswoman for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker,
said in an e-mail. 
&#8220;The 1993 Town Car exceeded all federal crash safety
standards,&#8221; she said. &#8220;While the Jablonskis were victims of a
tragic accident caused by a distracted driver who rear-ended
them at 60 miles per hour, it was unfair to blame Ford for their
injuries.&#8221;

Litigation Departments 
Richard Zabel Said to Get Deputy U.S. Attorney Post in N.Y. 
Richard Zabel, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, was
promoted to deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Zabel served as co-head of litigation at Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer  Feld LLP from 1999 until 2009, when he rejoined the
prosecutor&#8217;s office in Manhattan. He replaces Boyd Johnson III,
who is leaving to join the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale
 Dorr LLP, according to the firm. 
A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School,
Zabel worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan from
1991 to 1999, holding positions including chief of the office&#8217;s
narcotics unit. He co-wrote two reports published in 2008 and
2009 by the group Human Rights First, &#8220;In Pursuit of Justice,
Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in the Federal Courts.&#8221; 
He twice won the Attorney General&#8217;s Award for Distinguished
Service for his role in the prosecutions of a violent criminal
organization known as the Latin Kings and members of the Gambino
organized crime family. 
Johnson, a graduate of Hamilton College and Cornell Law
School, has been a prosecutor in the office since 1999, holding
positions including chief of the public corruption unit and head
of the international narcotics trafficking unit. 
He is scheduled to start work with Washington-based Wilmer
Hale&#8217;s litigation and white-collar practices on Oct. 1. 
Under the supervision of both men, prosecutors in the

The trade was stopped at a &#8220;theoretical loss&#8221; of 4.2
percent including interest, the New York-based company said in a
note today. 
&#8220;The recent sharp increase in risk aversion, much of this
originating in Europe, and upward pressure on the dollar across
a wide range of currencies lately, has pushed the cross below
our 1.35 closing stop,&#8221; Goldman said in the note written by
analysts including chief strategist Thomas Stolper. 
The euro rose 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.3551 at
9:42 a.m. in London. The single European currency has weakened
1.8 percent against the dollar from last week.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) chief
Economist Bruce Kasman said Greece is insolvent and headed
toward a depression that will cause catastrophic damage across
Europe. 
&#8220;We have a social contract that&#8217;s been broken between
Greece and the rest of the region,&#8221; Kasman said today during a
panel discussion at the Institute of International Finance
annual meeting in Washington. &#8220;Greece is insolvent and the
European Union needs to deal with that. It hasn&#8217;t yet come to
terms with that.&#8221; 
Kasman said the uncoordinated and sporadic response from
the region&#8217;s political leaders has &#8220;fed fears&#8221; in the markets
that they don&#8217;t have the wherewithal to deal with the region&#8217;s
fiscal problems. The lack of clarity in solving Greece&#8217;s credit
problems has exacerbated the problem. 
&#8220;Damage is done,&#8221; Kasman said. &#8220;Europe in our mind is
entering recession.&#8221; Greece is heading toward a depression, he
said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said poor risk-management, not sophisticated products,
is to blame for financial-company losses and failures. 
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t invest in risk-management, it doesn&#8217;t matter
what business you&#8217;re in, it&#8217;s a risky business,&#8221; Cohn said
today at a panel discussion in Washington sponsored by the
Institute of International Finance. 
The cause of financial-company collapses dating back to
Barings Plc or Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has &#8220;never been
sophisticated products, it&#8217;s been a risk-management issue or a
separation of duties problem&#8221; in which a trader was able to
manipulate operational controls in the back office, Cohn said. 
Goldman Sachs has a &#8220;robust separation of duties in our
organization&#8221; between traders and back-office administrators so
that traders can&#8217;t manipulate operational controls, he said.
&#8220;We have just continuously reiterated a farther divide in how
those people interact to make sure we&#8217;re protecting the assets
of the firm.&#8221; 
While Goldman Sachs allows employees to change jobs and
move into the trading business from the back office, Cohn said
the New York-based company ensures that those traders lose
access to administrative processes they had in the back office.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
dismissal of suits over employee bonuses filed in New York by
shareholders who called the awards a waste of assets. 
Security Police  Fire Professionals of America Retirement
Fund and Judith A. Miller sued the investment bank in December
2009, accusing directors and executives of breaching their
fiduciary duties by reserving half of the company&#8217;s net revenue
for employee compensation. Shareholders Ken Brown and Central
Laborers Pension Fund filed similar suits the following month. 
New York State Supreme Judge Bernard J. Fried ordered the
lawsuits dismissed on Sept. 21, according to court documents
filed today. The plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal in January
2010, after New York-based Goldman Sachs said its ratio of
compensation and benefits to net revenue for 2009 was its
&#8220;lowest as a public company,&#8221; Fried said in his ruling. 
Fried denied the plaintiffs&#8217; request for attorney fees and
expenses, and rejected a request from Brown -- who died in
December 2010 -- for an incentive fee award of $25,000. Brown&#8217;s
attorney, Lynda J. Grant, didn&#8217;t immediately return a voice-mail
message seeking comment on Fried&#8217;s ruling. 
Pay Record 
The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis. 
Goldman had a 2007 compensation and benefits expense of
$20.2 billion, or 43.9 percent of revenue, that came to an
average of $661,490 per employee, according to company reports.
The pay expense dropped to $10.9 billion, or 48 percent of
revenue, in 2008 and was $16.2 billion, or 36 percent of
revenue, in 2009. 
In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year. That was 9 percent less than in the same period in
2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent. 
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s
$19 million compensation for 2010, which included a $5.4 million
cash bonus, was almost double the prior year&#8217;s award even as
Goldman Sach&#8217;s profits fell. 
Blankfein and other firm executives agreed to forgo cash
bonuses in 2009 and take restricted stock grants as compensation
to mute criticism of the firm&#8217;s pay practices. Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year while the firm settled claims by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. 
The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators&#8217; claims that marketing materials about the
investments had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; 
Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. 
The cases are Brown v. Blankfein, 650003/2010, and Central
Laborers&#8217; Pension Fund v. Goldman Sachs, 600036/2010, both in
New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).

Chevron Corp. (CVX) expects to make a
final decision in 2013 about how much more to invest in an
effort to add as many as 6 billion barrels of crude reserves to
an oil field shared by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
The second-largest U.S. energy company is moving ahead with
a pilot project by injecting steam into the Wafra field in a
border area between the neighboring countries after early work
showed &#8220;very promising&#8221; results, Kenneth Sniffen, a spokesman
for Saudi Arabian Chevron, said today in an interview in Manama,
Bahrain. Saudi Arabian Chevron is a fully owned subsidiary of
California-based Chevron Corp. 
&#8220;The Wafra field is mature, and it&#8217;s producing at a
declining rate,&#8221; Sniffen said. &#8220;We want to add 500,000 barrels
a day to whatever amount the field will be producing once
injecting steam is applied on a large scale.&#8221; 
Wafra will be the world&#8217;s largest project for recovering
oil through steam injection once Chevron applies the technique
to the entire field. The company hopes to be injecting steam
into most, if not all, of the deposit by 2017, Sniffen said. 
Chevron has injected steam to help produce crude at a field
in Bakersfield, California, for almost 50 years and at a deposit
in Indonesia for almost 30 years. Wafra yields about 240,000
barrels a day of light and heavy crudes, he said. 
Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, has 264.5
billion barrels of total proved crude reserves, according to the
BP Statistical Review of World Energy, published in June. Kuwait
has 101.5 billion barrels in reserves, according to the same
review.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drinks maker, plans to spend $3 billion to expand in Russia
in the next five years, doubling its investment in the country,
said Ahmet Bozer, president of the company&#8217;s business in Eurasia
and Africa. 
Coca-Cola will expand production and sales capacity
countrywide after first-half volume rose 16 percent in Russia,
Bozer said today by phone from the southern Rostov region, where
the company opened a plant today. Bozer is Coca-Cola&#8217;s president
for its Eurasia and Africa unit. 
Russians drink about 69 eight-ounce servings of Coca-Cola
products a year, compared with an average 89 worldwide. The
company has sought sales growth from Russia since the collapse
of the Soviet Union in 1991. U.S. consumers each guzzled 394
servings last year on average. 
&#8220;Russia has a long time to go before reaching any
ceiling,&#8221; Bozer said. He is visiting the carbonated-beverage
factory with Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. 
The Atlanta-based company, which acquired Russian juice
makers Nidan and Multon in the past six years, doesn&#8217;t have
acquisitions targeted in Russia now, Bozer said. 
PepsiCo Inc. bought Wimm-Bill-Dann, Russia&#8217;s biggest food
and beverage company, this year, taking the lead in Russia&#8217;s
juice and dairy market over Coca-Cola.

Hedge fund Oasis Management LLC
sued Morgan Stanley for C$9.5 million ($9.3 million) over
options in Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) bought before the Toronto-listed
timber company&#8217;s stock plunged 71 percent in two days in June. 
Morgan Stanley failed to settle the options contracts in an
effort to &#8220;limit its liability,&#8221; Oasis said in a lawsuit filed
in London in July. Hong Kong-based Oasis bought options to sell
Sino-Forest at C$19 on May 12, three weeks before shares fell to
C$5.22 on allegations it had overstated forestry holdings. 
Shares in Sino-Forest have fallen 74 percent since June 1,
the day before short-seller Carson Block&#8217;s Muddy Waters LLC
research firm said the company had overstated its holdings.
While investors including hedge fund manager John Paulson and
billionaire Richard Chandler took losses when Sino-Forest shares
sank, holders of put contracts could reap returns from selling
stock at prices far above the present value. 
The Oasis deal will cost Morgan Stanley (MS) C$7.5 million to
settle, the hedge fund said in its court filing. The put options
are valued at C$9.5 million, compared with C$2 million for the
equivalent shares, it said in the lawsuit. Oasis paid Morgan
Stanley a premium of C$770,000 for the options in May. 
New York-based Morgan Stanley claimed the options were
terminated because trading in Sino-Forest&#8217;s shares was
suspended, Oasis lawyers said in the filing. The bank offered
Oasis C$3.8 million to cancel the deal, the hedge fund said in
the lawsuit. 
Morgan Stanley spokesman Michael Wang declined to comment
Sept. 23. Katie Bolton, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Oasis,
declined to comment.

Citigroup Sued by IKB Over $4.2 Million in Mortgage Notes 
Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. bank, was sued for
fraud by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG over a sale of $4.2
million in residential mortgage-backed securities. 
An IKB unit took part in the purchase of million of notes
in a transaction underwritten and sold by New York-based
Citigroup, according to court papers filed Sept. 22 in New York
State Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
IKB, based in Dusseldorf, accused Citigroup of fraud,
negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment and breach of
contract in the one-page filing. The German lender asked a judge
to rescind the sale and award unspecified punitive damages. 
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup,
declined to comment on the complaint. 
The case is IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) v. Citigroup
Inc., 652609/2011, Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York (Manhattan). 
Ex-NBA Player Tate George Charged in $2 Million Ponzi Scheme 
Tate George, a former player with the National Basketball
Association&#8217;s New Jersey Nets and Milwaukee Bucks, was charged
with running a $2 million Ponzi scheme that targeted former
professional athletes. 
George, 43, raised more than $2 million for his company,
The George Group, after telling investors his real-estate
development portfolio was worth $500 million, according to a
Federal Bureau of Investigation complaint charging him with wire
fraud. 
&#8220;In reality, The George Group had virtually no income
generating operations,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a
statement. 
George used the money he raised to pay early investors in
his company and to fund living expenses such as mortgage and
child-support payments, restaurant meals, clothing and gas,
according to the FBI complaint. 
George faces as many as 20 years in prison for the scheme,
which prosecutors said ran from 2005 to March. His attorney,
Thomas Ashley, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment.

Silvercorp Sues Chinastockwatch.com Over Stock Manipulation 
Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM), a Canadian miner of silver in
China, sued two websites and their operators for allegedly
spreading false information in an effort to drive down the
company&#8217;s stock price. 
Chinastockwatch.com, a New York-based website that posts
reports on public companies, and operator Jerry Katz published
&#8220;false, defamatory and fraudulent statements,&#8221; Silvercorp said
in the complaint filed Sept. 22 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan. 
Alfredlittle.com, website operator Alfred Little and an
editor, Simon Moore, also were named as defendants in the
lawsuit. Silvercorp seeks punitive damages of at least $10
million and compensatory damages of more than $1 million. 
The defendants sought &#8220;to artificially drive down the price
of Silvercorp common stock in order to obtain illicit profits on
short sales,&#8221; the Vancouver-based company said in the
complaint. Short investors sell borrowed shares with plans to
buy them back later at a lower price. 
No contact information was listed on Chinastockwatch.com
and Katz couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached to comment on the
lawsuit. The complaint is &#8220;frivolous&#8221; and Alfredlittle.com has
&#8220;nothing to do with&#8221; Chinastockwatch.com, Moore said. 
&#8220;Every statement that was made in every single report that
was published on Silvercorp from Alfredlittle.com is completely
factual,&#8221; Moore said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Absolutely
nothing in any of our previous reports on other companies that
we&#8217;ve published on including Silvercorp has ever been
exaggerated.&#8221;

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
ATT Judge Sets Expert Reports Deadlines in Antitrust Case 
The judge overseeing the U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s
antitrust lawsuit seeking to block ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s $39 billion
takeover of T-Mobile USA Inc. gave both sides until Dec. 28 to
file reports by expert witnesses. 
Responses to those reports must be filed by Jan. 9,
according to the order issued Sept. 23 by U.S. District Judge
Ellen Segal Huvelle. Rebuttal reports must be delivered by Jan.
16, according to the order. 
The judge&#8217;s order resolved a dispute between the government
and ATT over deadlines for the expert reports. On Sept. 23 the
U.S. Justice Department asked Huvelle to give it until Jan. 5 to
prepare its reports, while ATT had pressed for a Nov. 15
deadline. The trial is set to begin Feb. 13. 
The expert reports will likely be central to the case, said
Howard University law professor Andrew Gavil. 
&#8220;The government will have to lay out how the merger will
be anticompetitive and the only way to present those models is
with economists,&#8221; Gavil said in a phone interview. &#8220;To the
extent there is a difference of opinion between the government
and ATT, this is the area that is likely to heat up and be
critical ground for discussion.&#8221; 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. Last week, seven states joined the government&#8217;s
effort to block the deal. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
Madoff Trustee Renews $91 Million Sterling Partner Suit 
The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm filed a revised
lawsuit against money management firm American Securities LP
that demanded $91.9 million dollars of funds taken out of the
con man&#8217;s firm since January 2000. 
American Securities, after meeting Fred Wilpon and Saul
Katz, owners of the New York Mets Major League Baseball team,
joined with their Sterling Equities Inc. in 1991 to create a
$4.5 billion-asset real estate investment company, Sterling
American Property Inc., according to Madoff trustee Irving
Picard. Madoff was among the investors, Picard said in a court
filing Sept. 23. 
Closely held American Securities and its executives had
access to the con man and should have responded to so-called red
flags warning of fraud, Picard said in an amended complaint
filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
Of the money Picard is demanding, about $10 million was
fake profit, he said. 
A call seeking comment on the complaint from Charles Klein,
a founder and managing director of American Securities, wasn&#8217;t
immediately returned. 
Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina. 
The case is Picard v. American Securities, 1:10-ap-05415,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
News Corp. (NWSA) to Be Sued in U.S. by Victims of Phone Hacking 
News Corp. (NWS) directors will be sued in the U.S. by victims of
phone hacking by reporters at the News of the World tabloid, a
lawyer said. 
Legal action will be started in the U.S. within 10 days,
Mark Lewis, a lawyer representing phone-hacking victims in
London, said in an interview broadcast on Sky News Sept.23. 
Lewis represents phone-hacking victims including the family
of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Revelations that Dowler&#8217;s
mobile-phone messages were deleted while she was missing in 2002
led to the closure of the News of the World and forced News
Corp. to drop a takeover bid for British Sky Broadcasting Group
Plc. (BSY) 
U.S. lawyers will make the final decisions on the
defendants to include in the lawsuit, Lewis said in a separate
interview on BBC News. He said that lawyers are looking at areas
that should have been part of the knowledge of directors of a
large corporation. Lawyers would seek to speak with News Corp.
Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Deputy Chief Operating Officer James
Murdoch, Lewis said. 
Miranda Higham, a spokeswoman for News Corp. in London,
declined to comment on the U.S. lawsuits. Lewis didn&#8217;t return a
call from Bloomberg News seeking comment.

Trials/Appeals 
Obama Health-Care Law Leaves Appeals Court With Questions 
President Barack Obama&#8217;s health-care law got a mixed
reception in its fourth review by a federal appeals court as
three judges grappled with questions about the law&#8217;s
constitutionality and their own authority to rule on it. 
In a two-hour argument Sept. 23 in Washington, two judges
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit said a ruling upholding the law, which requires that
most Americans buy insurance or face a tax penalty, could leave
the government with unprecedented power over its citizens. 
&#8220;In 220 years there has been a whole lot of laws and a lot
of crises, yet Congress has never once mandated a purchase,&#8221;
said Judge Brett Kavanaugh, adding that the &#8220;lurking next
step&#8221; might be a law requiring investment in private retirement
accounts. 
Kavanaugh also questioned whether federal courts could rule
on the law before any taxpayer had been assessed a penalty. 
The Washington appellate panel may be the last to rule on
the law before it reaches U.S. Supreme Court. The Obama
administration must signal next week whether it will seek high
court review of another court&#8217;s opinion declaring the insurance
mandate unconstitutional. 
Two federal appeals courts have ruled on the insurance
mandate. A Cincinnati panel in June decided Congress&#8217;s authority
to regulate interstate commerce extended to enacting the
insurance mandate. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta threw
out the mandate on Aug. 12, concluding Congress can&#8217;t compel
people to buy a product for their entire lives. 
An appeals panel in Richmond, Virginia, decided on Sept. 8
that it was blocked by a statute that generally bars challenging
taxes before they&#8217;re collected or assessed. 
The case argued Sept. 23 was brought in June 2010 by five
individuals who claimed they and their families could face
collective penalties of more than $27,000 for failing to obtain
insurance. 
U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler in February dismissed
their suit, finding the mandate constitutional. 
The U.S. calls the insurance mandate the linchpin of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, claiming that
without expanding the pool of younger, healthier customers the
insurance industry can&#8217;t meet its obligations for coverage under
the law. 
The case is Seven-Sky v. Holder, 11-5047, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington).

A Pennsylvania appeals court ruling has raised questions
about who can claim ownership of natural gas embedded in the
Marcellus shale formation, potentially putting in doubt the
legitimacy of thousands of drilling leases, Bloomberg News&#8217; Jim
Polson and Mike Lee report. 
The state&#8217;s Superior Court said Pennsylvania law governing
ownership of oil and gas rights isn&#8217;t clear and a lower-court
judge should solicit expert opinions in a case pitting current
landowners against the heirs to an 1881 deed. 
&#8220;Dozens of energy companies have invested billions of
dollars in leasing shale gas production rights in
Pennsylvania,&#8221; Larry Nettles, an attorney with the Houston-
based law firm Vinson  Elkins LLP, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;This opinion calls into question whether they have
those rights.&#8221; 
For more than a century, Pennsylvania has required
landowners to consider oil and gas rights separate from more
general &#8220;mineral rights&#8221; when transferring ownership of
resources beneath the surface of their property. The defendants
in the title dispute argued shale gas is different and should be
considered part of the mineral rights because it is contained
inside rock. 
The Superior Court, the second-highest court in the state,
ruled Sept. 7 that current law doesn&#8217;t sufficiently address
whether &#8220;Marcellus shale constitutes a mineral,&#8221; the question
that&#8217;s now to be hashed out by the lower court. 
Until the case is decided, oil and gas companies will face
uncertainty about whether they&#8217;ve signed drilling leases with
the right people, legal experts say. Owners of oil and gas
rights who signed leases with gas producers could find that they
don&#8217;t own the gas after all. 
&#8220;If, somehow, shale gas is different, that would be a sea
change in Pennsylvania law,&#8221; David Fine, a Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania-based attorney for KL Gates LLP, said Sept. 22 in
a telephone interview. &#8220;The issue is whether they&#8217;ve entered
into a lease with someone and somebody else is going to find a
problem with the title.&#8221; 
The case may take as long as two years to wind through the
courts, Fine said. 
The case is John E. and Mary Josephine Butler v. Charles
Powers Estate et al, 1795-mda-2010, Superior Court of
Pennsylvania.

Verdicts/Settlements 
Potash Producer Civil Antitrust Suit Rejected by U.S. Court 
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and six other producers
of the fertilizer chemical won a U.S. appeals court ruling
rejecting purchaser claims they were conspiring to fix prices in
violation of federal antitrust laws. 
The buyers sued in 2008, claiming violations of the U.S.
Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, which can extend the
reach of American antitrust law to foreign anticompetitive
conduct that affects U.S. imports. 
The Chicago-based court ruled that Minn-Chem Inc. and its
co-plaintiffs failed to state a plausible &#8220;direct, substantial
and reasonably foreseeable,&#8221; link between the allegedly anti-
competitive activity of the producers -- all of whose mining
operations are based in Canada, Russia or Belarus -- and the
U.S. market for their product. 
&#8220;All of the anticompetitive conduct identified in the
complaint is alleged to have occurred outside the United
States,&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge Diane Sykes wrote in the court&#8217;s
unanimous 27-page decision. 
Also named as defendants in the case were Calgary-based
Agrium Inc. (AGU), Plymouth, Minnesota-based The Mosaic Co. (MOS), as well
as Russian and Belarussian companies. As of 2008, they accounted
for about 71 percent of the world&#8217;s supply of potash, according
to the Sept. 23 court ruling. 
&#8220;We are evaluating the opinion and making decisions
about what we will be doing,&#8221; San Francisco attorney Bruce
Simon, who argued the case for the purchasers on June 3, said
Sept. 23 in a phone interview. He declined to comment further. 
&#8220;We believe the court made the right ruling,&#8221; Rob Litt, a
spokesman for The Mosaic Co., said in a phone interview. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re certainly very pleased with the decision of the
court,&#8221; said Bill Johnson, a spokesman for Saskatoon-based
Potash Corp. 
The case is Minn-Chem Inc. v. Agrium Inc., 10-1712, U.S.
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Chicago). 
Emanuel Goffer Seeks Prison Term of Less Than 46 Months 
Emanuel Goffer, convicted of insider trading with his
brother Zvi Goffer, is seeking a prison term of less than 46
months, saying he plays a critical role in raising a 3-year-old
son with developmental problems. 
Emanuel Goffer is set to be sentenced Oct. 7 before U.S.
District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan, who imposed a 10-
year prison term on his brother this week. 
In court papers filed Sept. 23, Emanuel Goffer asked for a
&#8220;tempered sentence&#8221; shorter than the 46- to 57-month federal
sentencing guidelines range calculated by U.S. probation
officials. Goffer said in the filings that his son isn&#8217;t meeting
&#8220;age appropriate gross motor milestones.&#8221; 
Goffer also disputes a U.S. finding that he earned more
than $2 million by insider trading. 
Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for the office of U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara, declined to comment. 
The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) and Intel Corp. (INTC) will invest $4.4 billion over five years
to create a hub for next-generation computer chip technology in
New York, the state&#8217;s Governor Andrew Cuomo, said. 
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, will
spend $3.6 billion to develop computer chips using 22-nanometer
and 14-nanometer process technology, said Michael Loughran, a
company spokesman. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter and
measures the size of transistors in a chip. Lower numbers
indicate more advanced technology. 
Intel Corp., IBM, Globalfoundries Inc., Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. will
focus on transforming 300-millimeter wafer technology into 450-
millimeter technology, which will produce twice the number of
chips, according to a statement from Cuomo&#8217;s office. 
&#8220;This is really all about the computing systems IBM and
others will construct using advanced technologies,&#8221; John Kelly,
senior vice president and director of research at Armonk, New
York-based IBM, said at a press conference in Albany. &#8220;This
will create computers that will help doctors diagnose advanced
diseases.&#8221; 
The investment will retain and create 6,900 jobs in the
state, including 2,500 new technology roles, according to the
statement. 
To support the project, the state will make a $400 million
investment in the State University of New York College of
Nanoscale Science and Engineering in Albany, the statement said. 
&#8216;Unprecedented Investment&#8217; 
Research and development facilities located in Canandaigua,
Utica, East Fishkill and Yorktown Heights also will receive
cash, according to the statement. 
&#8220;This unprecedented investment in New York&#8217;s economy will
create thousands of jobs and make the state the epicenter for
the next generation of computer chip technology,&#8221; Cuomo said in
the statement. 
IBM rose $3.20, or 1.8 percent, to $177.71 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are up 21
percent this year. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California,
gained 30 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $22.54 in trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Italian city of Cassino was
ordered by a court to disclose the terms of a settlement it
reached with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to terminate a derivative that
cost taxpayers as much as 2 million euros ($2.7 million). 
An administrative court published a ruling yesterday saying
Bloomberg News should be granted access to the swaps contracts
and settlement after a lawsuit under the country&#8217;s freedom-of-
information laws. The central Italian city and the bank agreed
to end the swaps contract in 2009 without disclosing the terms. 
Faced with shrinking income and growing expenses, cities
throughout Italy bought swaps to cut their short-term interest
expenses, while putting them at the risk of rising interest
costs. About 300 were losing a total of 912 million euros on
derivatives as of March, Bank of Italy data show. 
&#8220;This ruling will create a precedent,&#8221; said Elio Lannutti, a senator and member of the opposition Italian Values
party, who also heads the Adusbef consumer group. &#8220;This ruling
re-establishes the law, which was violated by the obscure
dealings that prohibit taxpayers from choosing and judging their
local administrations and their relations with banks.&#8221; 
The city of 33,000, and site of heavy fighting during World
War II, sought to keep the settlement secret, citing a
confidentiality clause in its agreement with JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. lender by assets. 
The city will comply with the court order once received,
said Enzo Salera, Cassino&#8217;s finance chief. The city can still
appeal to the country&#8217;s highest administrative court, the
Council of State. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. 
&#8216;Greater Transparency&#8217; 
&#8220;The taxpayers of Cassino deserve to understand how the
government managed to lose millions of dollars in their
interest-rate swap with JPMorgan,&#8221; said Matthew Winkler,
editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News. &#8220;We continue to seek greater
transparency, accountability and disclosure of the financial
terms in this case to shed light on how taxpayer money is being
used.&#8221; 
In 2003, Cassino entered a seven-year swap with Bear
Stearns Cos., which JPMorgan bought in 2008, to adjust payments
on about 22 million euros of debt. The swap switched the city&#8217;s
4.7 percent fixed interest rate payment for a variable rate,
according to a June 2009 report by Italy&#8217;s financial police. 
The city paid a floating rate based on the U.S.-dollar
London interbank offered rate, an &#8220;extremely risky&#8221; bet given
that Libor was at a record low, police said in testimony to the
Italian Senate. 
Dollar Libor 
Three-month U.S. dollar Libor was at a 1 percent in June
2003 and by January 2006 had surpassed 4.7 percent, according to
data compiled by the British Bankers&#8217; Association. The measure
climbed as high as 5.7 percent in September 2007 as credit
markets began to seize up, before declining to a record low of
0.25 percent by December 2009 after policy makers cut rates. 
JPMorgan was named an interested party in the lawsuit
because of the potential impact on the firm. The bank is
separately on trial in Italy in the first European criminal case
involving swaps. Together with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Depfa Bank Plc
and UBS AG, JPMorgan faces charges in Milan for fraud for
tricking the municipal government into buying the contracts. The
lenders deny the allegations. 
In a judgment published earlier this month, Italy&#8217;s highest
administrative court ruled that Pisa&#8217;s provincial government has
the right to annul swaps contracts with Dexia Crediop SpA and
Depfa Bank Plc. 
Bloomberg News also sued the European Central Bank in
December to make it release documents showing how Greece used
derivatives to hide its fiscal deficit and helped trigger the
region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. The case is pending.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) says it will be
able to book oil and gas reserves it finds in an Arctic and
Black Sea venture with OAO Rosneft even though its Russian
state-run partner owns the licenses. 
&#8220;We see this as one of the most prospective areas for
exploration in the whole world,&#8221; Glenn Waller, Exxon&#8217;s head of
Russia, told reporters today at the Sakhalin Oil and Gas 2011
conference in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. &#8220;That is what is driving us.
Access to new resources.&#8221; 
Exxon agreed to form a venture with Rosneft on Aug. 30,
pledging to spend $3.2 billion exploring for oil and gas in
Russia&#8217;s Arctic Kara Sea and deep-water Black Sea. Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin is encouraging partnerships with
international explorers to maintain output at a world-leading 10
million barrels a day for the next decade. Putin said the Exxon-
Rosneft alliance may lead to $500 billion in investment. 
The west Siberian basin that&#8217;s the source of more than half
Russia&#8217;s oil output extends north under the Kara Sea, according
to Waller. Rosneft selected Exxon for the Arctic blocks after a
planned venture and share swap with BP Plc collapsed in May. 
Exxon Confident 
&#8220;We are confident that we will be able to book those
reserves that belong to us&#8221; under stock exchange rules,
following the exploration period, Waller said. Rosneft holds the
license, and almost 67 percent of the exploration venture, while
Exxon has 33 percent. 
Exxon and Rosneft aim to drill the first exploration well
in 2015, according to a Rosneft presentation. 
The partners will hold &#8220;step-by-step&#8221; talks with the
state as they seek tax incentives to make the challenging
project profitable, Waller said. The Kara Sea is icebound for
much of the year, and projects in its Arctic waters will need to
contend with nuclear waste from former test sites and dumps,
according to Waller&#8217;s presentation at the conference. 
The government understands it needs to change some taxes to
make the projects effective, Waller said. 
Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil producer, will decide in the
first half on an offer from Exxon to join projects in areas
including Texas, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, he said. Rosneft
and Exxon don&#8217;t plan to bring in other partners for now, he
said.

Morgan Stanley (MS) said Brent oil will

because of increasing supply and a weaker demand outlook. 
Production capacity in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will climb almost 800,000 barrels a day in
2012, led by the return of Libyan fields, Morgan Stanley
analysts led by New York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report
today. Non-OPEC output will rise 225,000 barrels. 
Slowing global economic growth will result in reducing
demand growth, the analysts said. Consumption will advance
600,000 barrels a day in 2012, down from a 950,000 gain this
year and 2.7 million barrel advance in 2010. 
Brent oil for November settlement fell $3.33, or 3.1

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) passed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in market value based on closing
share prices to become the world&#8217;s second-most valuable
technology company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
IBM rose $1.62 to $179.17 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange, giving it a market value of $214 billion. Microsoft
fell 13 cents to $25.45 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, giving it a
market value of $213.2 billion. 
It&#8217;s the first time since 1996 that IBM closed ahead of
Microsoft, though IBM had passed the software company on an
intraday basis in May. Microsoft was worth three times as much
as IBM in 2000. 
IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano divested the
company&#8217;s PC business six years ago, calling it commoditized, to
invest in software and services. Microsoft, whose Windows and
Office software are used primarily on PCs, lost its spot as the
most valuable technology company last year to Apple Inc. (AAPL), as
sales of iPad tablets and iPhones crimped PC demand. Apple is
now the world&#8217;s most valuable company, with a market value of
$422.9 billion. 
IBM&#8217;s stock has gained 22 percent this year, while
Microsoft&#8217;s has dropped 9 percent.

who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. 
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is promoting the Xbox
360 console as a way to switch easily between games, DVDs and
pay TV. He said on Sept. 14 that by Christmas, Microsoft will
add the Bing search engine to the Xbox and use its Kinect
controller&#8217;s voice recognition to sift through shows on the Web. 
&#8220;We all know the frustrations of using guides and menus
and controllers, and we think a better way to do all of this is
simply to bring Bing and voice to Xbox,&#8221; Ballmer said at a
developers conference. &#8220;You say it, Xbox finds it.&#8221; 
Microsoft also expects to sign deals with Time Warner
Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s HBO cable channel, Sony Pictures Entertainment&#8217;s Crackle
streaming service, NBC Universal&#8217;s Bravo and Syfy channels and
Lovefilm UK, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the person said. 
Wayne Hickey, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment, as did Bobbi Henson, a spokeswoman for Verizon, and
Jennifer Khoury of Comcast, which controls NBC. Greg Belloni, a
Sony spokesman, had no immediate comment. Dorothy Jean, a
spokeswoman for Lovefilm, declined to comment. An HBO
spokesperson declined to comment. 
Pay-TV Tether 
The new applications from Philadelphia-based Comcast&#8217;s
Xfinity TV service and New York-based Verizon&#8217;s FiOs would
require users to prove they already are pay-TV customers in
regions where the services operate, two of the people said. 
The Xbox 360 plays DVDs and video games, and owners can pay
$60 a year for the Xbox Live premium service, which allows for
multi-user play over Web. Console owners can also add
subscriptions to Netflix Inc. (NFLX)&#8217;s and Hulu LLC&#8217;s online film and
television services, and pay-TV through ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s U-verse in
its markets. 
The surge in online entertainment has thrust the Xbox 360
and its console rival, Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 3, into
competition with other Web-connected devices in the home, from
DVRs to television sets. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Moves 
Since last year, Microsoft has integrated social networking
features into Xbox Live, letting viewers chat with each other
while watching movies and shows. The company announced in June
that 35 million people used its paid Xbox Live service around
the world, spending an average of 60 hours a month playing games
and watching entertainment. 
Comcast had 22.5 million pay-TV customers as of June 30.
Verizon Fios had 3.8 million. 
Cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast are
looking to stem defections by putting their services on more
devices and making it easier for them watch. 
In June, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts demonstrated a TV
interface called Xcalibur that uses Web-connected servers to
forgo the need for a set-top box at all. 
Microsoft fell 9 cents to $25.58 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. Comcast lost 33 cents to $22. Verizon slid 5
cents to $36.84 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) passed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become the world&#8217;s second-most
valuable technology company, a reflection of industry changes
including the shift away from the personal computer. 
IBM&#8217;s market value rose to $214 billion yesterday, while
Microsoft&#8217;s fell to $213.2 billion. It&#8217;s the first time IBM has
exceeded its software rival based on closing prices since 1996,
according to Bloomberg data. IBM became the fourth-largest
company by market value, based on yesterday&#8217;s closing price,
and, in technology, trails only Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano sold IBM&#8217;s PC
business six years ago to focus on corporate software and
services. Though Microsoft has expanded into online advertising
and games, it gets most of its revenue and earnings from the
Windows and Office software used primarily on PCs. 
&#8220;IBM went beyond technology,&#8221; said Ted Schadler, an
analyst with Forrester Research Inc. &#8220;They were early to
recognize that computing was moving way beyond these boxes on
our desks.&#8221; 
IBM remained ahead of Microsoft for a second day today,
sliding $4.30 to $174.87 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, as Microsoft dropped 56 cents to $24.89 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has
gained 19 percent this year, while Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Washington, has fallen 11 percent. 
Apple, which long competed against IBM and Microsoft in the
PC business, passed Microsoft in market value last year, on
rising sales of iPhones, iPods and iPads. Apple&#8217;s market
capitalization is $353.5 billion based on today&#8217;s close. 
Palmisano&#8217;s Strategy 
Palmisano, who is also chairman, has spent his nine years
at the helm sharpening the company&#8217;s focus on software and
services for corporations and government. Once known as the
world&#8217;s largest computer company, IBM in 2005 sold its PC unit
to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), calling it &#8220;commoditized.&#8221; The company
has spent more than $25 billion investing in its software,
computer-services and consulting businesses. 
The maneuvers have helped increase per-share profit for
more than 30 straight quarters. Palmisano has boosted sales by
20 percent from 2001 through last year, while keeping the costs
of the 426,000-employee company little changed. IBM pulled in
more than half of its $99.9 billion in revenue last year from
services and is now the world&#8217;s largest computer-services
provider. 
The company is betting it can add another $20 billion to
revenue through 2015. Palmisano is investing in emerging markets
and analytics, as well as cloud-computing and an initiative
called Smarter Planet to connect roads, electrical systems and
other infrastructure to the Internet. 
Railways, Waterways 
&#8220;Computing is now found in things that no one thinks of as
&#8216;computers&#8217;,&#8221; said Palmisano at a trade show keynote in
February. &#8220;Today, there are nearly a billion transistors per
human, and each one costs one ten-millionth of a cent. Yes, some
of these transistors are going into servers, PCs, smart phones,
MP3 players and tablets. But an increasing number of them are
going into appliances and automobiles, power grids, roadways,
railways and waterways.&#8221; 
IBM plans to almost double operating earnings to at least
$20 a share in 2015. Investors have taken notice: Shares have
climbed 35 percent since the company first announced the goal in
May 2010. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Slump 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software company, was worth
three times as much as IBM in January 2000 and hit a market
capitalization of more than $430 billion in July 2000, according
to Bloomberg data. Microsoft fell to about $135 billion in March
2009 during the economic downturn, before recovering with the
market. 
Microsoft, which had $69.9 billion in revenue for the
fiscal year ending in June, got about 60 percent of its sales
from the Windows and Office units in the most recent quarter. 
&#8220;They were trapped in the classic innovator&#8217;s dilemma&#8221;
because their software business was so good,&#8221; said Schadler.
&#8220;The bet that Microsoft made in the PC business was to double
down and double down and double down.&#8221; 
CEO Steve Ballmer said investors may not appreciate the
company&#8217;s progress in other businesses, including server
software and online versions of Office, given the higher profile
of its consumer businesses. 
&#8220;People are saying, &#8216;Where do you go next?&#8217;,&#8221; said
Ballmer at the company&#8217;s annual meeting in November. There
probably isn&#8217;t &#8220;as much appreciation for the incredible growth
and success we&#8217;ve had with enterprises since people relate
better to the consumer market. But it&#8217;s great products with
great earnings and particularly in some high-visibility
categories.&#8221; 
Xbox, Bing 
The company&#8217;s server software and Office divisions boosted
sales last quarter, as did the entertainment division, which
includes its Xbox games business. Revenue at the online services
division, including the Bing search engine, climbed to $662
million, while its operating loss widened to $728 million. 
Microsoft also cut a deal with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) this year to make
its Windows Phone the primary operating system for the company&#8217;s
smartphones. The deal is designed to help both companies compete
against Apple and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system, which
is available for free to handset makers such as Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. 
Mobile and Cloud 
IBM briefly passed Microsoft in market value rank on an
intraday basis in May, and the companies may continue to switch
positions, said Joel Achramowicz, an analyst for Blaylock Robert
Van LLC in Oakland, California. While IBM has largely convinced
investors it can execute its stable growth strategy, Microsoft
has to prove it can move beyond PCs to tackle the mobile and
cloud computing markets, he said. 
&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re on the cusp of a major offensive move on
the part of Microsoft to position itself with some significant
leadership, this time in the mobile sector,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Investors are skeptical, so the opportunity here is actually
bigger for Microsoft than it is for IBM.&#8221; 
Still, mobile computing is unlikely to ever be as
profitable for Microsoft as the PC business, said Forrester&#8217;s
Schadler. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re never going to win in that business the way they
did in the PC business,&#8221; he said.

Morgan Stanley (MS), which owns the
world&#8217;s largest retail brokerage, is being priced in the credit-
default swaps market as less creditworthy than most U.S., U.K.
and French banks and as risky as Italy&#8217;s biggest lenders. 
The cost of buying the swaps, or CDS, which offer
protection against a default of New York-based Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
debt for five years, surged to 488 basis points as of 4:20 p.m.
in New York, or $488,000, for every $10 million of debt insured,
from 305 basis points on Sept. 15, according to prices provided
by London-based CMA. Italy&#8217;s Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) had CDS trading
at 422 basis points, and UniCredit SpA (UCG) at 426, the data show. A
basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. 
&#8220;The CDS spreads are making investors and creditors
nervous&#8221; about Morgan Stanley, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York who rates the company&#8217;s
stock &#8220;outperform,&#8221; in an e-mail. 
The price of Morgan Stanley credit-default swaps continued
to climb earlier this week even when the firm&#8217;s shares rose. The
stock, which yesterday jumped 6.6 percent, today dropped $1.58,
or 10 percent, to $13.51 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, the biggest drop in the 81-company SP 500 Financials
Index. Shares are down 50 percent since the start of the year. 
Implied Risk 
Moody&#8217;s Analytics, an arm of Moody&#8217;s Investors Service
that&#8217;s separate from the company&#8217;s credit-rating business, said
in a report yesterday that Morgan Stanley&#8217;s CDS prices imply
that investors see the bank&#8217;s credit rating as having declined
to Ba2 from Ba1 in the last month. The company is actually rated
six grades higher at A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. 
By comparison, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and France&#8217;s Societe
Generale (GLE) SA, which have CDS trading at 421 basis points and 340
basis points respectively, have prices that imply a rating of
Ba1, higher than the implied rating on Morgan Stanley, said
Allerton Smith, a banking-risk analyst at Moody&#8217;s Analytics in
New York. 
Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley in New York,
declined to comment. 
Morgan Stanley was the biggest recipient of emergency loans
from the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis and also
benefited from capital provided by Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., now the biggest shareholder, and the U.S.
Treasury, which it repaid with interest. 
2008 Peak 
While the price of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit-default swaps is
at the highest level since March 2009, it&#8217;s nowhere near the
peak reached in 2008. On Oct. 10 of that year, the annual price
for five-year protection rose to the equivalent of 1,300 basis
points, according to data provided by CMA, a unit of CME Group
Inc. that compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. 
The credit-default swaps market can be thinly traded, and
the recent jump in prices may reflect no more than a single big
counterparty seeking to hedge contracts, said Hintz, a former
Morgan Stanley treasurer. Morgan Stanley, one of the biggest
traders of CDS among U.S. banks, doesn&#8217;t make a market in its
own swaps, according to Smith of Moody&#8217;s Analytics. 
The CDS market has features &#8220;that may not exist in other
markets like the bond market or the equities market,&#8221; Smith
said in a telephone interview. Having fewer participants trading
in the Morgan Stanley name could result in a &#8220;disproportionate
spread movement,&#8221; he said. 
Trading Volume 
The daily average trading volume in Morgan Stanley shares
over the last three months is 27 million shares, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. By contrast, a three-month study
released this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found
that most single-name CDS trade less than once a day, while the
most active trade more than 20 times per day. 
Trading in Morgan Stanley credit-default swaps has risen to
257 contracts last week, compared with 187 for Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), according to the Depository Trust  Clearing Corp.
That compares with a weekly average of 73 trades in Morgan
Stanley and 91 in Goldman Sachs in the six months that ended on
Aug. 26, DTCC data show. 
There was a net $4.6 billion of protection bought and sold
on Morgan Stanley debt as of Sept. 23, according to DTCC. Even
with the higher trading volume, investor skittishness in the
face of Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis may be leaving few market
participants willing to sell CDS protection to meet the demand
for hedges, said Hintz. 
&#8220;With the EU teetering, few other firms are going to jump
in and write CDS on a global capital markets player like MS,&#8221;
Hintz said in his e-mail, referring to the European Union and to
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s stock-market ticker symbol. 
Trading Decline 
The rise in Morgan Stanley&#8217;s CDS prices may also relate to
an expected decline in third-quarter trading revenue or to the
company&#8217;s exposure to French banks, Smith said. 
Ruth Porat, the bank&#8217;s chief financial officer, said at an
investor conference on Sept. 13 that the fixed-income trading
environment in the third-quarter was worse than 2010&#8217;s fourth
quarter, when Morgan Stanley posted its lowest debt-trading
revenue since the 2008 crisis. The company, led by Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, reported second-quarter
revenue from both investment banking and fixed-income trading
that beat rival Goldman Sachs for the first time on record. 
Morgan Stanley had $39 billion of cross-border exposure to
French banks at the end of December before accounting for
offsetting hedges and collateral, according to an annual filing
with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. Cross-border
outstandings include cash deposits, receivables, loans and
securities, as well as short-term collateralized loans of
securities or cash known as repurchase agreements or reverse
repurchase agreements. 
&#8216;Galloping Wider&#8217; 
While Morgan Stanley hasn&#8217;t updated those figures, Hintz
estimated in a Sept. 23 note to investors that the bank&#8217;s total
risk to France and that country&#8217;s lenders is less than $2
billion when collateral and hedges are included. Morgan Stanley
currently has zero exposure to France, including French banks,
after hedges and collateral are factored in, according to a
person close to the firm. 
As of June 30, Morgan Stanley had about $5 billion of
funded exposure to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain,
which was reduced to about $2 billion when offsetting hedges
were accounted for, according to a regulatory filing. The
company also had about $2 billion in overnight deposits in banks
in those countries and about $1.5 billion of unfunded loans to
companies in those countries, the filing shows. 
&#8220;Their spreads just are galloping wider,&#8221; Smith said.
&#8220;Is it rational that Morgan Stanley CDS spreads would be wider
than French bank CDS spreads if the concern is exposure to
French banks? I don&#8217;t think that makes perfect sense.&#8221; 
Bond Yield Climbs 
Goldman Sachs, which like Morgan Stanley converted from a
securities firm to a bank in 2008, had $38.5 billion of gross
cross-border exposure to French banks as of June 30, according
to a regulatory filing. The firm&#8217;s five-year credit-default
swaps traded at 330 basis points as of 4:20 p.m., according to
CMA. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 10-year debt has also shown signs that
investors are growing concerned. The yield on the company&#8217;s $1.5
billion of 5.5 percent senior unsecured notes that comes due in
July 2021 has climbed to 6.57 percent from 5.46 percent on Sept.
15, according to prices reported by Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 
That&#8217;s still lower than the 6.76 percent yield on 4.125
percent bonds issued by Intesa Sanpaolo that come due more than
a year earlier, in April 2020, according to Bloomberg data. 
&#8216;Very Sensitive&#8217; 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s reliance on the debt markets, instead of
depositors, to provide funding for its assets may be one cause
of concern, some analysts said. Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs, which were the second-biggest and biggest U.S. securities
firms before converting to banks, both got less than 10 percent
of their funding from depositors as of June 30, according to
company filings with the SEC. 
By contrast, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
two largest U.S. banks by assets, funded more than half of their
balance sheets with retail deposits at the end of June, filings
show. 
&#8220;The market is just very sensitive to anybody considered
to be wholesale funded,&#8221; John Guarnera, a financial analyst at
Societe Generale in New York, said in a Sept. 23 telephone
interview. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a bank, you can fall back on the fact
that you have a strong retail deposit base. Morgan Stanley has
deposits, but not like you&#8217;d see out of a BofA or a JPMorgan.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley (MS) agreed to pay
$4.8 million to settle a U.S. antitrust case over a 2006
derivative contract with KeySpan Corp. that the Justice
Department said probably led to higher electricity prices in New
York City. 
The proposed settlement was filed today in federal court in
Manhattan, the Justice Department said in a statement. KeySpan
last year agreed to pay $12 million to settle. 
Morgan Stanley entered into agreements with KeySpan and
Astoria Generating Co., KeySpan&#8217;s largest competitor in the
capacity market, that gave KeySpan a financial interest in
Astoria and ensured the company would withhold output from the
market and increase prices, the Justice Department said. 
&#8220;Morgan Stanley is pleased to have settled this matter
with the Department of Justice,&#8221; Mary Claire Delaney, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said in an e-mailed
statement. 
KeySpan, based in Brooklyn, New York, is a unit of London-

in Britain and the U.S. 
The case is U.S. v. Morgan Stanley, 11-6875, U.S. District

The Group of 20 nations may agree
to take coordinated measures to ease monetary policy at their
November meeting as global growth slows, according to Goldman
Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill. 
&#8220;Central banks have to be forward looking,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill
in an interview in London today. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be completely
surprised if we had some kind of coordinated move at the
November meeting and, if there were, Brazil would definitely
play a role in that.&#8221; 
Brazil&#8217;s central bank unexpectedly cut the Selic benchmark
interest rate by half a percentage point to 12 percent on Aug.
31 as the risk of recession in Europe and the U.S. shifted
policy makers&#8217; focus away from the fastest inflation in six
years. Turkey and Israel have also lowered rates to protect
their economies from the impact of Europe&#8217;s debt problems. 
Brazil&#8217;s decision to cut the benchmark rate was &#8220;quite
smart,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. The probability of the country meeting
its inflation target of 4.5 percent next year has &#8220;risen
significantly&#8221; because of the global economic crisis, he said. 
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis led investors to dump emerging market
assets in the past two months, pushing the real down 18 percent
against the dollar since the end of July. The Brazilian currency
had gained 13 percent in the previous 12 months. 
The real needs to weaken a further 10 percent to 15 percent
to make Brazilian stocks more &#8220;interesting,&#8221; according to
O&#8217;Neill, who ranks Brazil in &#8220;rising third&#8221; place for equity
investment among the so-called BRIC nations, behind China and
Russia and ahead of India. China is the &#8220;most compelling&#8221; and
&#8220;very cheap,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill, who coined the term BRIC in 2001. 
&#8220;If we had a further decline in the real, I think the
Brazilian stock market would look more interesting than it has
for a year,&#8221; he said.

Morgan Stanley (MS) won dismissal of a
retirement fund&#8217;s lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation
called the Libertas CDO. 
The Employees&#8217; Retirement System of the Government of the
Virgin Islands claimed in the 2009 suit that New York-based
Morgan Stanley defrauded investors by collaborating with ratings
companies to give the CDO an undeserved AAA rating at the same
time it was short-selling almost all of the assets underlying
the notes. The CDO was backed by $1.2 billion in assets,
according to the complaint. 
U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan today
dismissed the investor complaint, which asserted claims for
fraud and unjust enrichment under New York state law. 
AAA is the highest rating for fixed-income instruments. The
portfolio was 92 percent residential mortgage-backed securities
and included exposure to more than $130 million in loans from
Option One Mortgage Corp. and $100 million from New Century
Mortgage Corp., both lenders to homebuyers with poor credit
scores, according to the complaint. 
The Libertas CDO entered into credit-default swaps that
referenced specific residential mortgage-backed securities.
According to the complaint, the notes collapsed in value after
they were purchased by the Virgin Islands retirement fund. 
The case is Employees&#8217; Retirement System of the Government
of the Virgin Islands v. Morgan Stanley  Co., 09-cv-10532, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Nigerian unit
said gunmen attacked a vessel supplying one of its offshore oil
platforms, wounding one worker and seizing another. 
&#8220;The incident has been reported to security and relevant
government agencies&#8221; after the attack in southern Akwa Ibom
state, Nigel Cookey-Gam, a spokesman in Lagos, said in an e-
mailed statement. Exxon doesn&#8217;t know where the seized worker has
been taken and the injured individual is &#8220;stable,&#8221; he said. 
Violence has risen in the southern Niger River delta, home
to Nigeria&#8217;s oil and gas industry, after a period of relative
quiet that followed a government amnesty in 2009 and the
disarming of thousands of fighters. Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s largest
oil producer and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. 
Armed attacks in the delta cut Nigeria&#8217;s oil output more
than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) said this month it shut 25,000
barrels a day of crude output from its Imo River field in the
country&#8217;s southern Abia state because of the level of theft.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer wasn&#8217;t awarded his full bonus for fiscal
2011, citing lower-than-expected sales of phones based on the
company&#8217;s software and a drop in revenue in its Windows unit. 
Ballmer, 55, received $1.38 million in pay, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That
included a bonus equal to 100 percent of his base salary, half
of the maximum he could have been awarded. Still, the board
noted in the filing that it regards Ballmer as &#8220;underpaid.&#8221; 
While directors praised Ballmer for the company&#8217;s operating
income, progress on the next version of Windows and partnerships
with Facebook Inc. and Nokia Oyj, they voiced concerns about
lower sales of Windows software and the need to be quicker to
adapt the software to work on new devices. Ballmer has come
under fire from some investors, including Greenlight Capital
Inc. President David Einhorn, who used a May speech to call on
Microsoft&#8217;s board to replace him. 
&#8220;He deserves this bonus,&#8221; said Kim Caughey Forrest, an
analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc. She said she&#8217;s
encouraged by the newest version of Windows, unveiled last
month. &#8220;I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it&#8217;s a
pretty big light. They came a huge way for me.&#8221; 
At the same time, Ballmer didn&#8217;t deserve the maximum amount
because he and the board aren&#8217;t returning enough cash to
shareholders, said Caughey Forrest, whose firm manages about
$1.1 billion, including Microsoft shares. 
Windows Revenue 
The popularity of tablets such as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad
contributed to the decline in Windows revenue in fiscal 2011,
which ended June 30. Some shareholders may balk at Ballmer&#8217;s 100
percent bonus because they think the new Windows isn&#8217;t coming
fast enough, Caughey Forrest said. 
&#8220;You could posit Windows 8 and the whole reaction to the
phenomenon of tablets and mobile devices is a few years too
late,&#8221; she said. 
Microsoft&#8217;s board lauded Ballmer for making progress on the
company&#8217;s Bing search engine and Azure cloud software; the
successful release of the Kinect gaming device; the introduction
of the Office 365 Internet-based versions of its productivity
software; work toward the acquisition of Skype Technologies SA;
and a &#8220;strong financial year.&#8221; 
Ballmer, who owns almost 4 percent of the company&#8217;s
outstanding shares, doesn&#8217;t get stock compensation at his own
request, the filing said. 
For fiscal 2010, Ballmer also received 100 percent of a
maximum 200 percent bonus, with the board citing concerns about
new devices and a loss of market share in phone software.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, began extracting crude from a southern
California field using steam produced by a 29-megawatt solar-
thermal power plant. 
BrightSource Energy Inc.&#8217;s system uses mirrors to focus
sunlight on a boiler at Chevron&#8217;s Coalinga, California, enhanced
oil recovery project, the solar company said in a statement
after extraction began today. 
Solar-thermal technology companies such as BrightSource are
targeting industrial users in the oil-recovery and food-
processing industries as customers as well as power generation. 
Mining and metals processing are also very promising,
especially in remote areas where power can also be generated
along with heat, Charlie Ricker, BrightSource senior vice
president of business development, said today in an interview. 
The company is exploring the possibility of more plants
with Chevron and others, Ricker said. 
&#8220;This technology has the potential to augment gas-powered
steam generation and may provide an additional resource in areas
of the world where natural gas is expensive or not readily
available,&#8221; Chevron Technology Ventures President Desmond King
said today in a company statement. The project produces about
the same amount of steam as one gas-fired steam generator,
Chevron said. 
7,644 Mirrors 
The Coalinga plant consists of 3,822 mirror systems, or
heliostats, each with two 10-foot (3-meter) by 7-foot mirrors
mounted on a 6-foot steel pole focusing light on a 327-foot
solar tower. Steam created by the heat is fed into the oil
reservoir, making it easier to bring to the surface. The system
began generating steam in August, Kristin Hunter, a spokeswoman
for Oakland, California-based BrightSource, said today in an e-
mail. 
Areva SA&#8217;s Areva Solar, Seville, Spain-based Abengoa SA,
Erlangen, Germany-based Solar Millennium AG (S2M) and Burbank,
California-based eSolar Inc. are competing with BrightSource
with their own solar-thermal technology. 
Glasspoint Solar Inc., based in Fremont, California, makes
solar steam generators for the oil and gas industry using
mirrored troughs inside of glasshouse enclosures to protect the
mirrors. 
$16.3 Billion Market 
Enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, fits very well with solar
temperatures, Glasspoint Vice President John O&#8217;Donnell, said
today in an interview. 
Some 32 percent of California&#8217;s industrial and commercial
gas use is for EOR as its use grows in the U.S. and all over the
world, O&#8217;Donnell said. The state produces about 40% of its oil
using EOR and in a few years that will grow to 60%, he said. 
The company can produce heat for EOR for about $3 per
million British thermal units, compared with about $4 for a
comparable natural-gas plant in the U.S. and between $10 to $12
for other conventional solar thermal technologies, O&#8217;Donnell
said. &#8220;We are the only ones below natural gas right now in the
U.S.&#8221; 
According to BCC Research, the global market for enhanced-
oil-recovery technologies was $4.7 billion in 2009 and is
expected to grow at a 5-year compound annual rate of 28 percent,
reaching $16.3 billion in 2014, BrightSource said in its
statement. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. oil company.

General Maritime Corp. (GMR)&#8217;s bonds
plunged to the lowest level since at least August 2010 as the
U.S. oil-tanker owner is pressured by low freight rates and a
surplus of ships. 
The company&#8217;s $300 million of 12 percent bonds maturing in
November 2017 tumbled 6.75 cents to 30 cents on the dollar as of
8:17 a.m. in New York, with yields soaring to 48.4 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities, issued
in November 2009, have tumbled from 96.5 cents on the dollar at
the start of the year. 
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service cut New York-based General
Maritime&#8217;s credit grade to Caa3 last month citing the increasing
likelihood of a restructuring of credit facility terms or of the
debt capital structure because of &#8220;weak sector fundamentals.&#8221;
The company&#8217;s &#8220;overreliance&#8221; on its cash balance, which was
almost $59 million as of June 30, may cause it to fall out of
compliance with a minimum liquidity covenant,  Moody&#8217;s analysts
said in the Sept. 1 note. 
The company is likely to &#8220;have a difficult time achieving
positive operating cash flow, which could threaten its ability
to make cash interest payments,&#8221; the Moody&#8217;s analysts wrote.
Weak freight rates will also pressure the market value of tanker
vessels, cutting another source of liquidity, they wrote.

Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s derivatives holdings
may have been misread by markets and investors, prompting the
bank to plunge more than 10 percent on Sept. 30, a Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) analyst wrote in a report. 
Concern about Morgan Stanley &#8220;appears to be driven&#8221; by
confusion over a U.S. government report that said the company
had $1.78 trillion of outstanding notional value of derivatives
in the second quarter, Wells Fargo&#8217;s Matthew Burnell wrote Sept.
30. In reality, so-called netting agreements outlined in the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency report mean Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s derivatives positions totaled $457 million, according
to Burnell. 
&#8220;Net credit exposure is well below its peer group,&#8221;
Burnell, who has a &#8220;market perform&#8221; rating on Morgan Stanley
shares, told clients. 
Morgan Stanley fell 1 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $13.50 at 11
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading, after
climbing as much as 4 percent earlier today. The stock has
dropped 50 percent this year before today. 
The cost of buying credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley,
which offer investors protection against a default by the New
York-based bank, rose to a mid-price of 515 basis points as of
10:28 a.m., according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The
price of insurance on Morgan Stanley is higher than Italian
banks Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) and UniCredit SpA (UCG) and means investors
have to pay $515,000 a year for every $10 million of debt they
are protecting, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
U.S. Aid 
The firm, which owns the world&#8217;s biggest retail brokerage,
was the largest recipient of emergency loans from the Federal
Reserve during the financial crisis and also benefited from
capital provided by Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., now the biggest shareholder, and the U.S. Treasury, which
it repaid with interest less than a year later. 
The largest Wall Street firms will start reporting third-
quarter results this month showing how they performed in a
market grappling with fallout from Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating and concern Greece would default.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley warned investors in
September trading revenue may suffer.

The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive a suit against wireless-phone manufacturers and retailers
filed by customers who said the devices may cause illnesses,
including brain cancer. 
The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said regulations issued by the Federal
Communications Commission preclude suits under state laws by
phone consumers. Most lower courts to consider the issue have
reached similar conclusions. 
The suit before the justices, filed in Pennsylvania state
court, named more than a dozen companies and trade associations
as defendants. Those sued included Nokia Inc.; units of ATT
Inc. (T) and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.; and Verizon Wireless,
a joint venture between Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Vodafone
Group Plc. (VOD) 
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Stephen Breyer didn&#8217;t take part in today&#8217;s decision not to hear the
appeal. Both owned shares of Nokia as of Dec. 31, according
their most recent financial-disclosure report. 
The appeal centered on the legal impact of the FCC
standards that govern radio frequency emissions and require pre-
authorization of phones sold or leased in the country. The
Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said those
rules, first adopted in 1996, preempt any additional
requirements under state law, including those imposed through
lawsuits. 
The Obama administration joined the mobile-phone industry
in urging the Supreme Court to reject the appeal without a
hearing. 
The case is Farina v. Nokia, 10-1064.

Iowa native Justin Bruch marveled at
the opportunity when Morgan Stanley (MS) called in late 2007 to
recruit him for an unusual assignment. 
The New York bank, flush with $7.5 billion in fiscal 2006
profit -- the biggest in its history -- was going to be farming
11 parcels on the steppes of Ukraine. The commodities team
wanted Bruch, a redhead with meaty hands who&#8217;d been farming all
his life, to manage one of them. 
Bruch saw a chance to dig into some famous dirt, Bloomberg
Markets magazine reports in its November issue. The former
Soviet republic has 30 percent of the world&#8217;s black soil, earth
so fertile Adolf Hitler had Nazi troops cart some back to
Germany during World War II. Wheat, corn, rapeseed and
sunflowers thrive there. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s like the prairie land that was broken in the Midwest
100 years ago,&#8221; says Bruch, 34, who grew up on his family&#8217;s
2,500-acre (1,012-hectare) corn and soybean farm. &#8220;The soil and
potential for crops that Ukraine has is the best in the world.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley was primed for the investment. It was then
the second-largest U.S. securities firm by market value, after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive Officer John Mack was
pushing managers to take more risks.

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest retail brokerage, rose 12 percent, the largest gain in
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, after earlier dropping to the
lowest level since December 2008. 
Morgan Stanley rebounded in the last half-hour of trading,
rising $1.54 to $14.01 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. It was the biggest percentage gain since
March 2009 and came after a report that European Union officials
were examining ways to coordinate the recapitalization of
struggling banks. 
The Financial Times quoted Olli Rehn, European commissioner
for economic affairs, as saying there is an &#8220;increasingly
shared view&#8221; that the region needs a coordinated approach to
halt the sovereign debt crisis. Morgan Stanley had dropped 17
percent over the two previous days as concern intensified that
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will infect U.S. bank balance sheets. 
Credit-default swaps on New York-based Morgan Stanley fell
13 basis points to 570 basis points as of 4:01 p.m. in New York,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The contracts
earlier traded as high as 650 basis points, the highest since
October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed for bankruptcy. 
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. said it&#8217;s &#8220;firmly
committed&#8221; to its strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley.
Japan&#8217;s biggest banking group, which is the U.S. firm&#8217;s largest
common shareholder, repeated its commitment in a statement
yesterday &#8220;in response to recent market volatility.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53,
sent a memo to employees yesterday, encouraging them to remain
focused on their jobs and clients instead of responding to &#8220;the
rumor of the day.&#8221; 
&#8220;There has been an enormous amount of confusion and
misinformation about Morgan Stanley and others in our peer
group,&#8221; he wrote in the memo, which was obtained today by
Bloomberg News. &#8220;In fragile markets, where fear triumphs over
common sense, these things are bound to happen.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), which generated more
than $79 million in U.S. theaters after converting &#8220;The Lion
King&#8221; to 3-D, will re-release four other animated features in
the format. 
&#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; will be reissued on Jan. 13 next
year, followed by &#8220;Finding Nemo&#8221; on Sept. 14, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in an e-mail. &#8220;Monsters
Inc.&#8221; will be reissued in January 2013, and &#8220;The Little
Mermaid&#8221; will follow in September of that year. 
&#8220;This is just pure gravy for Disney,&#8221; said Wade Holden,
an analyst with the consulting firm SNL Kagan in Monterey,
California. &#8220;Disney puts their films back in their vault, and
then re-issues them a few years later for the next generation
anyway.&#8221; 
The 3-D conversions also help DVD sales by elevating the
profile of the films, Holden added. Disney released &#8220;The Lion
King&#8221; on DVD and Blu-Ray today. The three-dimensional version
of the film opened in theaters on Sept. 16. 
Disney rose 86 cents to $29.86 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 20
percent this year.

The cost to protect the debt of
Morgan Stanley (MS) against losses fell from the highest levels in
about three years after a report that European Union officials
were examining ways to coordinate the recapitalization of
struggling banks. 
Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley fell 13 basis points
to 570 basis points as of 4:01 p.m. in New York, according to
broker Phoenix Partners Group. The contracts earlier traded as
high as 650 basis points, the highest since October 2008, the

view&#8221; that the region needs a coordinated approach to halt the
sovereign debt crisis. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, plans to increase cost reductions amid
global &#8220;financial volatility,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Giovanni Perissinotto said. 
The firm plans to cut information-technology costs and
improve the efficiency of asset and real-estate management
&#8220;through the full integration of these functions across the
whole group,&#8221; the CEO said today at a conference held by
Merrill Lynch in London. His comments were confirmed by a
company spokeswoman. 
Trieste, Italy-based Generali, which is expanding in
emerging markets including China and the Middle East to boost
profit, expects higher operating margins in the life and non-
life businesses this year. The insurer&#8217;s second-quarter profit
fell 45 percent, hurt by writedowns of Greek bonds and its stake
in Telco SpA. 
&#8220;We have to be ready to live in a world characterized by
stagnant growth, low returns and great financial volatility,&#8221;
Perissinotto said. &#8220;This adverse trend is accentuated by the
lack of decisiveness and coordination of actions.&#8221; 
About 94 percent of the company&#8217;s government bond holdings
have an A rating or higher, he said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) cut its forecast
for Brazil&#8217;s economic growth and said it expects the central
bank to cut interest rates more than it previously expected as
global financial turmoil weighs on confidence in Latin America&#8217;s
biggest economy, 
The bank, in an e-mailed report, said it expects policy
makers to reduce the benchmark interest rate to 10.5 percent by
January from its current 12 percent. Previously the bank
expected the so-called Selic rate to fall to 11 percent in
January. 
Latin America&#8217;s biggest economy should grow 2.3 percent in
the second half of the year, less than a 3.1 percent forecast
made Aug. 8, JPMorgan analysts wrote in the report. The economy
next year should expand 3.4 percent instead of a previous 3.8
percent forecast. 
&#8220;Domestic growth prospects for next year still seems
cushioned by a more preemptive monetary policy response and the
buffers from fiscal and quasi fiscal policies,&#8221; JPMorgan
analysts including Fabio Akira wrote in today&#8217;s report. 
The currency will end the year at 1.80 per U.S. dollar,
compared with the previous forecast of 1.70, JPMorgan said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley led gains in the cost to protect the debt of the biggest
U.S. banks as concern intensified that Europe&#8217;s sovereign
financial crisis will infect lender balance sheets. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased
48.9 basis points to 444.5 basis points at 9:50 a.m. in New
York, according to data provider CMA. Contracts on Morgan
Stanley, the New York-based owner of the world&#8217;s largest retail
brokerage, climbed 40.7 to 623.4 and those on Citigroup Inc. (C)
added 30.6 to 382, the data show. 
Investor confidence in the creditworthiness of the banks
fell as Europe&#8217;s finance chiefs considered &#8220;technical
revisions&#8221; for a second Greek bailout, Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said today. The cost to protect
U.S. company debt rose for the third day to the highest since
May 2009 as Goldman Sachs cut its global growth forecasts and
predicted recessions in Germany and France. 
&#8220;When you get stuff blowing out a couple of hundred basis
points in the span of two days, it causes a lot of people to
seize up,&#8221; said Michael Donelan, who oversees $4 billion of
bonds at Ryan Labs Inc. &#8220;If you see equities continue to be
under pressure, it just leads to a further contagion-type
spreading to credit spreads, credit-default spreads, cash bonds
you name it everything&#8217;s interlinked.&#8221; 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses or speculate on
creditworthiness, added 1.4 basis points to a mid-price of 151.5
basis points as of 11:18 a.m. in New York, according to Markit
Group Ltd. 
Global Economy 
The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, has increased from 136.2
on Sept. 27 as concerns mount that Europe&#8217;s fiscal imbalances
are worsening and the global economic recovery is faltering. 
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index slid as much as 2.2 percent
today to 1,074.77. The measure pared declines and was down 0.1
percent to 1,098.15 at 11:11 a.m. in New York after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank is ready
to take additional steps to boost growth. 
Five-year credit-default swaps tied to Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s senior debt climbed 27.9
basis points to 484.5, according to CMA, a unit of CME Group
Inc. that compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. 
Contracts on New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) added 18.8
to 198.6, and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) increased 19 to 195,
the data show. Swaps on American International Group Inc. (AIG)
climbed to 598.4, the highest since May 2010. 
&#8216;Bear Raiders&#8217; 
Credit swaps on Morgan Stanley are up from 305 basis points
on Sept. 15 and are at the highest level since October 2008, the
month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.
They reached as high as the equivalent of 1,300 basis points on
Oct. 10, 2008, CMA data show. It now costs $623,400 annually for
five years for every $10 million of debt insured. 
&#8220;What you&#8217;ve got right now is bear raiders making a bet
that in the event of a sovereign crisis in Europe coming to a
head, what you&#8217;re going to have is a freezing in the debt
markets,&#8221; Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
in New York, said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; 
That &#8220;will lead to funding problems and all the capital
markets firms will be hurt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s odd about this
is that it requires a number of leaps of faith, and those would
be that central banks are not going to support their commercial
banks and too large to fail is going to be ignored. And I don&#8217;t
think that&#8217;s going to be true.&#8221; 
&#8216;Special Relationship&#8217; 
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. said yesterday it&#8217;s
&#8220;firmly committed&#8221; to its long-term strategic alliance with
Morgan Stanley (MS), reiterating its commitment to the firm &#8220;in
response to recent market volatility.&#8221; 
&#8220;The special relationship we have formed remains core to
our global business strategy,&#8221; the Tokyo-based bank said in the
statement. Mitsubishi UFJ invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley
in October 2008 as the firm&#8217;s stock price collapsed after
Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10

International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is planning more acquisitions to fuel growth in its $22.5
billion software business, Senior Vice President Steve Mills
said in an interview. 
IBM, which last week surpassed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become
the world&#8217;s second-most valuable technology company, after Apple
Inc. (AAPL), may spend $100 million to $300 million on targets, the
Armonk, New York-based company said. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano has said he&#8217;s seeking
$20 billion in additional annual revenue by 2015. The company
aims to double or triple the pace of sales growth at companies
it acquires and looks for deals that will add to earnings within
two or three years, Mills said. 
&#8220;Everything&#8217;s got to fit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No spurious, off-
to-the-side, unrelated things.&#8221; 
IBM generated $99.9 billion in sales last year. Software,
which had gross margins of 86.9 percent last year, is key to
IBM&#8217;s growth plans. 
The company has made almost 50 software acquisitions since
2006 in such areas as data analysis, e-commerce, supply-chain
management and computer security, Mills said. More than half of
those have been in business-data analysis, where IBM says it has
spent $14 billion. The company expects those business-analytics
products to yield $16 billion in sales by 2015. 
&#8216;Hell of a Job&#8217; 
&#8220;They&#8217;ve done a hell of a job,&#8221; said Joel Achramowicz, an
analyst at Blaylock Robert Van LLC, an investment bank in
Oakland, California. IBM is &#8220;making the right acquisitions at
the right time.&#8221; 
The company today said it agreed to buy closely held Q1
Labs, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based provider of security
intelligence software, for undisclosed terms. It also created a
new security systems division, to target the $94 billion market
for security software and services. 
IBM fell $1.30 to $171.99 at 9:38 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had gained 18 percent
this year before today. 
The company is unlikely to make large acquisitions, worth
$10 billion or more, Achramowicz said. He said he dropped
coverage of IBM in April partly because of the company&#8217;s
unwillingness to take on a very large deal. 
&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the reasons we got kind of bored with the
stock,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are some big software companies out
there, which could augment IBM&#8217;s position.&#8221; 
In terms of the existing business, &#8220;IBM&#8217;s done about
everything it can to maximize their operating model,&#8221; he said. 
SPSS, Cognos 
Mills said the company looks for deals that can augment
products it already owns. For example, the statistical-analysis
software company SPSS Inc., which IBM bought in 2009 for about
$1.2 billion, complements the company&#8217;s 2007 acquisition of
Cognos Inc., whose software creates executive &#8220;dashboards&#8221; for
quickly perusing business data. 
SPSS lends Cognos more robust statistics capabilities, and
Cognos helps SPSS users visually depict their data, he said.
That&#8217;s accelerated SPPS&#8217;s growth since IBM bought it, Mills
said. 
&#8220;When you do that, you know you&#8217;re going to get a lift,&#8221;
he said.

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest retail brokerage, named Vikas Khattar managing director
and head of global capital markets in India to tap demand for
investment banking services in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy. 
Khattar, who joined the bank&#8217;s Mumbai office on Oct. 1,
reports to Crawford Jamieson and George Taylor, co-heads of
global capital markets in Asia-Pacific, according to a statement
from Morgan Stanley. 
International banks are bolstering their services as Indian
companies increasingly tap capital markets overseas. Non-rupee
debt sales by firms from the nation doubled to $9.1 billion this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based
Morgan Stanley is ranked 13th in arranging international bonds
and 8th in managing domestic share sales by Indian companies in
the last twelve months, data show. 
Essar Group, controlled by the billionaire Ruia brothers,
is considering listing infrastructure assets in London to raise
about $750 million, three people with knowledge of the matter
said. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG are
working with Essar on the initial public offering, the people
said, declining to be identified because the process in private. 
Khattar was most recently Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s head of South
Asia equity and equity-linked capital markets origination in
India. Before that he was at Merrill Lynch  Co. for 11 years,
according to the release. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired P.V. Krishna from Morgan
Stanley to run its equity capital markets business in India, two

Commodity prices may advance 20
percent over the next year as growth in emerging markets offsets
the impact of the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and a slowdown
in developed economies, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
The bank reiterated an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on
commodities over the next 12 months, while remaining &#8220;neutral&#8221;
in the near term, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a
report today. Oil and copper forecasts for 2012 were reduced. 
Commodities in the three months to Sept. 30 had the worst
quarter since 2008 on concern that there may be another global
recession as the European debt crisis escalated. The world
economy will probably expand 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with
an earlier prediction of 4.2 percent, Goldman&#8217;s economists Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson wrote in an Oct. 3 report. 
&#8220;With recent GDP revisions by our economists falling
hardest on Europe but emerging market growth expectations still
relatively solid, we continue to believe that demand growth in
2012 will be sufficient to tighten major commodity markets,&#8221;
Currie wrote. &#8220;We now see a flatter upward trajectory for
commodity prices.&#8221; 
Brent oil traded in London may average $120 per barrel next
year, down from an earlier call of $130, Goldman said. The
bank&#8217;s 2012 estimate for three-month copper on the London Metal
Exchange was lowered to $9,200 per metric ton from $10,790. 
Cutting Calls 
Goldman joins BNP Paribas SA and Commerzbank AG in cutting
calls for the metal that some investors see as a barometer for
economic activity. The bank also trimmed the 12-month target for
copper to $9,500 per ton from $11,000, while zinc&#8217;s target was
reduced to $2,400 per ton from $2,700. 
&#8220;Sentiment regarding the economic outlook and the European
sovereign-debt problems are likely to remain poor in the near
term, presenting further downside risk to prices as well as our
forecasts,&#8221; Currie wrote. Still, the lower prices should lure
buyers from China, the world&#8217;s largest copper consumer, back
into the market, he wrote. 
Copper for three-month delivery declined for a fifth day in
London, falling as much as 4 percent to $6,712 per ton, before
trading at $6,935 at 2:58 p.m. in Singapore. Brent crude, which
sank 11 percent last month, traded at $101.36 per barrel. 
No Recession 
Barclays Capital also said the world economy may avoid a
recession as emerging markets expand, which should limit further
losses for commodities, according to a report today from
analysts including Kevin Norrish. 
&#8220;A steep rise in production costs over the past few years,
plus a much greater degree of supply risk due to geopolitical
and weather shocks, all suggest there should be a much greater
degree of fundamentals-driven price resilience in many commodity
markets,&#8221; Norrish wrote. 
Weather disappointments should keep risks for soybeans
&#8220;skewed to the upside,&#8221; according to the Goldman report, which
expects them to trade at $13 per bushel in 12 months. The
November-delivery contract last traded at $11.70 per bushel. 
As soybean demand has become more sensitive to consumption
in China, the commodity should be more resilient to a slowdown
in developed markets as long as Chinese income growth remains
robust, Currie wrote.

Morgan Stanley (MS) said it may raise as
much as 385 billion yen ($5 billion) by selling uridashi bonds
to Japanese investors sometime in the next two years. 
The New York-based firm can sell bonds anytime between Oct.
12 this year and Oct. 11, 2013, according to a shelf
registration filed to Japan&#8217;s Finance Ministry today. Uridashi
bonds are debt issued outside of Japan for sale mainly to
Japanese retail investors. 
The U.S. bank is turning to Japanese individuals for
funding at a time when its share price is falling and the cost
of insuring its bonds is surging amid concern that Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis will infect the global banking system. Market volatility
prompted Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306), the biggest
shareholder, to issue a statement yesterday saying it is
&#8220;firmly committed&#8221; to their alliance. 
Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s biggest retail
brokerage, sold uridashi bonds in Japan at least twice in the
past three months, raising 46.5 billion yen in August and 51.5
billion yen in September as part of a 200 billion yen program
announced in April. Natsuo Nishio, a Tokyo-based spokesman,
declined to comment on the timing for any additional sale. 
Sales of yen-denominated uridashi bonds declined 25 percent
to 120.9 billion yen in August from a year ago, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Relies on Debt 
Shares of Morgan Stanley have fallen 54 percent this year
amid speculation that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will erode trading
income and damage balance sheets of U.S. banks. Morgan Stanley
relies on debt markets for funding because it has relatively low
deposits. The bank got less than 10 percent of its funding from
depositors as of June 30, compared with JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
which got more than half from retail deposits, SEC filings show. 
Mitsubishi UFJ invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley in
October 2008 as the U.S. firm&#8217;s stock price collapsed after the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The banks agreed in
April to convert $7.8 billion of preferred shares into common
stock and completed the conversion in June, making the Japanese
lender Morgan Stanley&#8217;s largest common shareholder with a 22.4
percent stake. 
Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ asserted its support for Morgan
Stanley yesterday as the cost to protect the U.S. firm&#8217;s debt
surged to the highest level since the weeks after Lehman
collapsed. Contracts on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the world&#8217;s
largest retail brokerage, soared 92 basis points to a mid-price
of 583 basis points yesterday in New York, the highest since
October 2008, according to London-based data provider CMA. 
The largest Wall Street firms will start reporting third-
quarter results this month showing how they performed in a
market grappling with fallout from Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating and concern Greece would default.
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley warned investors in September
trading revenue may suffer.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
global growth forecast for this year and next, predicting
recessions in Germany and France as the European economy stalls
and the risk of a contraction in the U.S. grows. 
The world economy will probably expand 3.8 percent this
year and 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with earlier predictions
of 3.9 percent for 2011 and 4.2 percent for next year, Goldman
Sachs economists Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson wrote in an Oct.
3 report. The company lowered its forecast for earnings growth
in Asia excluding Japan in a separate report today. 
Europe&#8217;s worsening sovereign debt woes and the threat of a
U.S. recession have roiled global stock markets, erasing about
$13 trillion from equities since May. The debt crisis has
infected the European banking system, making financial
institutions wary of lending to each other and pushing overnight
deposits with the European Central Bank last week to the highest
in more than a year. 
&#8220;The further deterioration in the economic and financial
situation in the Euro area has led us to downgrade our global
GDP forecast significantly,&#8221; the economists said. &#8220;Over the
next few quarters, we now expect a mild recession in Germany and
France, and a deeper downturn in the Euro periphery.&#8221; 
Euro Region 
Goldman Sachs predicts the Euro region will expand 0.1
percent in 2012, down from an earlier forecast of 1.3 percent.
It expects growth of 1.6 percent for this year. Goldman also
lowered its end-2011 forecast for the euro to $1.38 per dollar
from an earlier projection for it to trade at $1.40. 
The ECB has been forced to purchase sovereign bonds to
prevent the crisis from spreading to larger euro nations, and is
providing banks with unlimited liquidity for up to six months
against eligible collateral as governments struggle to restore
investor confidence in the 17-member region. 
The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to ease its
liquidity policies further this month as a result of an increase
in financial risk, Hatzius and Wilson said. The ECB will also
probably cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1
percent by December, they said. 
&#8220;The increase in spillovers from the Euro area, primarily
via tighter financial conditions, is the primary reason why we
have also downgraded our forecasts for the U.S. further,&#8221; the
economists said. &#8220;We now see the risk of a renewed U.S.
recession at around 40 percent.&#8221; 
Flagging U.S. 
The U.S. economy will expand 1.7 percent this year and 1.4
percent in 2012, Goldman Sachs predicts. It had earlier
estimated a 2 percent growth rate for the world&#8217;s largest
economy next year. 
The Federal Reserve announced last month that it would
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries, a so-called Operation Twist, in an
effort to further reduce borrowing costs and strengthen the
flagging U.S. economy. 
&#8220;We expect additional easing of monetary policy beyond the
&#8216;Operation Twist&#8217; announced recently, although this may not come
until sometime in the first half of 2012,&#8221; Hatzius and Wilson
said. &#8220;In addition, the market&#8217;s focus on changes in the Fed&#8217;s
guidance on future policies -- including a greater emphasis on
the employment part of the &#8216;dual mandate&#8217; and/or a temporarily
higher inflation target -- is likely to intensify.&#8221; 
&#8216;Downside Risk&#8217; 
Asia excluding Japan stocks faces a &#8220;downside risk&#8221; of 10
percent to 15 percent, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Timothy Moe
wrote in a report today. 
Earnings per share may grow 10 percent this year and
increase 7 percent next year, lower than an earlier prediction
of 11 percent growth for both years, according to the analysts.
They also cut their 12-month forecast for the MSCI Asia Pacific
excluding Japan Index to 480 from 530. 
Goldman Sachs analysts also lowered their forecasts for 2011
and 2012 oil prices. Crude prices will end this year at $112.50
a barrel, compared with a previous estimate of $119.50. It will
be $122.50 a barrel at the end of 2012, compared with an earlier
forecast of $138.50, according to the report. 
&#8220;The oil market continues to destock as prices anticipate
a potential crisis,&#8221; the economists said. &#8220;If the crisis does
not occur, the oil market risks running into pressing supply
constraints, requiring sharply higher prices than we currently
forecast to force demand in line with supplies.&#8221;

General Atlantic LLC, the U.S.
private equity firm that manages $17 billion, is studying four
acquisitions in India of as much as $200 million each, according
to Ranjit Pandit, its head of investments in the country. 
The planned deals are in the Internet, logistics, financial
and infrastructure industries and will be &#8220;in the $100 million
to $200 million range,&#8221; Pandit said in an interview in Mumbai
yesterday. 
General Atlantic, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, plans to
step up investment in India after a stock market rout reduced
valuations. The firm, which has typically spent about $50
million to $75 million per deal, will also look at acquisitions
of privately held companies, said Pandit. 
&#8220;We are looking at actively pushing a lot of money into
India,&#8221; said Pandit. &#8220;We are looking to do fewer transactions
but bigger transactions.&#8221; He called deal sizes of $100 million
to $200 million the &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; for General Atlantic. 
India&#8217;s private-equity market heated up this year as the
stocks slump shuttered the market for public equity and loans
got pricier, prompting companies to look for other sources of
capital. Private-equity firms have announced $5.52 billion of
deals in the country so far this year, up from $3.79 billion for
all of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
General Atlantic has invested about $900 million in India
since 2002. It owns stakes worth a combined $1.7 billion in
eight Indian companies, according to Pandit. 
Deals Closing 
Pandit said he expects two of the four deals the firm is
working on in the country will close this year, while the other
two will likely be completed in early 2012. The executive said
he may also consider deals of as much as $400 million in the
South Asian nation. 
General Atlantic paid about $90 million for about 3.7
percent stake in IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB), a privately owned lender
based in Mumbai. The stock is down 4.1 percent so far in 2011,
the third-best performance among 14 companies on the BSE Bankex
Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
The private-equity firm&#8217;s total investment in IndusInd Bank
may reach  $100 million to $200 million, according to Pandit. 
Pandit said General Atlantic may sell stakes in information
technology companies, without naming any of them. The firm owns
shares in companies including Genpact Ltd. (G), Hexaware
Technologies Ltd. (HEXW) and Infotech Enterprises Ltd. (INFTC) General Atlantic
hasn&#8217;t decided whether to sell the holdings in public markets or
to other companies, said Pandit. 
&#8220;If we look at our information technology portfolio in
India, without commenting on any specific company, it&#8217;s a group
of companies which we held for some time,&#8221; Pandit said. &#8220;We
may be reaching a point of diminishing return from them.&#8221; 
He said Hexaware &#8220;has a lot of options and General
Atlantic will look at all those options,&#8221; without elaborating. 
General Atlantic, founded in 1980, is setting up a
Singapore office, and is considering investing in Vietnam,
Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan, Pandit said. Abhay Havaldar, who
has been with the firm since 2002, will lead the Singapore
office, he said.

Microsoft Corp. will offer television
service to Xbox Live users through a partnership with Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), a bid to use TV
programming to attract more customers to its game console. 
The Xbox service will offer content from almost 40
television and entertainment companies, Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft said today in a statement. In addition to
Verizon and Comcast, the partners include ATT Inc., Time Warner
Inc.&#8217;s HBO, Sony Corp.&#8217;s Crackle and the BBC. 
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer wants to lure more
families and casual gamers to the Xbox by making it an
entertainment center, challenging TV services from Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and Google Inc. (GOOG) Today&#8217;s announcement furthers a move started in
2008, when Microsoft added Netflix Inc.&#8217;s video streaming and
the music service Last.fm. 
&#8220;The vision of the Xbox back in 2001 was that it would be
an entertainment hub,&#8221; said Michael Pachter, an analyst at
Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. &#8220;Until they launched Netflix
on Xbox Live, it really wasn&#8217;t that. Today we go from Netflix
and Last.fm to 40 vendors.&#8221; 
Microsoft rose 55 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $25.89 today on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 7.2 percent
this year. 
Network Stations 
The Xbox, first released a decade ago, accounted for 48
percent of all current-generation consoles in the U.S. between
2005 and June of this year, according to Microsoft data. Xbox
Live, an Internet service with free and paid versions, already
has more than 35 million members. 
Microsoft didn&#8217;t announce any deals with U.S. network TV
stations, though Comcast and other partners are &#8220;quite likely&#8221;
to add that kind of content in the future, said Ross Honey,
general manager of content acquisition for Microsoft&#8217;s
Interactive Entertainment business. Some network TV content can
already be viewed on Xbox using the Hulu LLC service. 
Other partners announced today include Lovefilm in the
U.K., a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc.; Spain&#8217;s Telefonica SA (TEF);
and Mexico&#8217;s Grupo Televisa SA. 
Microsoft also plans an application for its Windows Phone
mobile software that will turn phones into an enhanced remote
control for the Xbox service. Users will be able to search for
programs and then set them to play on the Xbox, as well as view
additional information about the program, Honey said. 
Apple, Google 
The company intends to offer apps that work with the Xbox
TV service for Apple&#8217;s iOS software as well, Pachter said,
citing a Microsoft analyst briefing yesterday. Honey declined to
comment on those plans, except to say that Microsoft has been
expanding some products to both iOS and Google&#8217;s Android. 
Some programming will require customers to be subscribers
to Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live pay service. Other content, such as the
BBC and other public television, will work with the free version
of Xbox Live, Honey said. 
Customers won&#8217;t have to know which channel or provider
offers the show or movie they want. Instead they can say or type
the name of the program and Xbox&#8217;s Bing search service will
return all options for viewing it, including ones the customer
doesn&#8217;t currently subscribe to, Honey said. 
TV service efforts by companies such as Apple and Google
have gotten little traction with customers. Apple Chief
Executive Officer Tim Cook has said that his company&#8217;s Apple TV
product remains &#8220;a hobby business.&#8221; In April, Logitech
International SA cut the price of its Google TV device, citing
slow initial sales. 
Microsoft has some advantages over those companies, Pachter
said. It already has a big presence in customers&#8217; living rooms:
A total of 55 million Xbox 360 machines have been sold
worldwide. The company also can draw on its search engine, its
Kinect motion-and-voice sensor technology and the new content
agreements. 
&#8220;Each of those guys has a strength, but nobody has
hardware already in the living room, with voice command that
works,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;Microsoft has a big advantage.&#8221;

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) isn&#8217;t anywhere close
to making an offer for Yahoo! Inc. and senior executives of the
software maker aren&#8217;t involved in discussions, two people
familiar with the matter said. 
Microsoft does plan to review Yahoo&#8217;s financial
information, due to be circulated as soon as this week, said one
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
deliberations are private. Yahoo doesn&#8217;t regard Microsoft as a
serious bidder, said a person familiar with Yahoo&#8217;s thinking. 
Yahoo shares surged 10 percent today after Reuters reported
that Microsoft may make an offer. Yahoo is fielding inquiries
from potential buyers after ousting Chief Executive Office Carol Bartz and starting a review of its strategic options last month.
Yahoo rose $1.46 to $15.92 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading, the biggest gain since October 2008. 
Yahoo turned down a $47.5 billion offer from Microsoft in
2008, rankling investors. The two companies later forged a 10-
year agreement to outsource Yahoo&#8217;s search engine to Microsoft,
diminishing the chance of a full acquisition. Since then, Yahoo
has struggled to invigorate sales growth and beat back
competition from Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. 
Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman at Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo, and Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, declined to comment. 
&#8216;Multiple Parties&#8217; 
Yahoo, the biggest U.S. Web portal, said in a September
memo to employees that its advisers have fielded inquiries from
&#8220;multiple parties&#8221; interested in unspecified options. Last
week, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma said he&#8217;s
&#8220;very interested&#8221; in buying Yahoo, which owns about 40 percent
of his company. 
The private-equity firm Silver Lake also has discussed a
possible bid for Yahoo, part of a deal that may include Alibaba
and Russia&#8217;s Digital Sky Technologies, people with direct
knowledge of the matter have told Bloomberg. 
The Silver Lake group contacted Yahoo and its advisers in
recent weeks to inform them of a possible offer, said one
person, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. The discussions are still at an early stage and it&#8217;s
not certain that the group will agree to make a bid, the people
said. 
Before Yahoo&#8217;s stock surge today, the shares had declined
13 percent this year.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest oil company, is offering for sale a 25 percent stake in
an offshore Brazilian oil prospect after drilling two wells that
failed to strike crude. 
The prospect, known as Block BM-S-22 in the Santos Basin,
may hold as much as 1.5 billion barrels of recoverable crude,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in an offering document on
Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)&#8217;s oilfield-marketing website. One of Exxon&#8217;s
partners on the project, Hess Corp. (HES), last year wrote down the
value of two of the three wells already drilled at the prospect
after they came up dry. 
The block lies beneath a layer of salt below the sea floor
in the same region that yielded discoveries such as Tupi, a 6.5
billion-barrel field now known as Lula, Exxon said in the
offering document. 
Exxon owns 40 percent of the prospect and is the operator
of the project. Hess of New York holds a 40 percent stake, and
Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) owns the rest. Hess
expensed its share of costs for the Exxon-drilled Sabia-1 and
Azulo wells during the fourth quarter of 2010, Gregory Hill,
Hess&#8217; executive vice president of worldwide exploration, said
during a Jan. 26 conference call with analysts. 
Agreement 
Exxon and partners Hess and Petrobras, as the Brazilian oil
company is known, &#8220;agreed to seek a fourth co-venturer&#8221; for
the project, Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for Exxon&#8217;s exploration
unit, said today in an e-mailed statement. 
&#8220;We remain interested in future opportunities in Brazil,&#8221;
McGinn said in the e-mail. 
In the offering document, Exxon said an investor must fund
the drilling of one well in the prospect in exchange for the 25
percent stake. The site has already received drilling permits
from the Brazilian government, Exxon said. A data room is being
set up in Houston for prospective buyers. 
&#8220;This opportunity should appeal to companies looking to
gain access to the significant pre-salt play in Brazil,&#8221; Exxon
said in the offering document.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Dmitry Pugachevsky, who oversaw analysis of some of the bank&#8217;s

division. 
Pugachevsky, who has more than 18 years&#8217; experience in the

based JPMorgan. Before that, he was the global head of credit
analytics at Bear Stearns Cos. 
Changes to derivatives regulation in the U.S. and new
international capital rules for banks &#8220;have brought a

firms to adopt active counterparty risk-management systems,&#8221;
Pugachevsky said in a statement released by Summit, New Jersey-
based Quantifi today. 
Pugachevsky has a doctorate in applied mathematics from
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

Protesters assembling today outside a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) building in New Jersey were met by
almost as many security guards and police officers as &#8220;Occupy
Wall Street&#8221; demonstrators sought to single out the bank. 
About 50 people gathered at a Goldman Sachs building
surrounded by metal barricades in Jersey City, where 30 to 40
officers and guards were waiting. The investment bank&#8217;s
employees watched from windows as the crowd chanted &#8220;We are the
99 percent&#8221; before breaking into discussion groups. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs has too many people in government, and too
much influence,&#8221; said Pat Meany, 53, who arrived on his bicycle
and wore clothes painted with fluorescent colors and peace
symbols. &#8220;It seems like they&#8217;re looking out for America&#8217;s rich.
It&#8217;s not for the good of all Americans.&#8221; 
In Trenton, about three dozen protesters were initially
outnumbered by members of the media for a simultaneous gathering
at the World War II memorial across from the Statehouse. The
crowd grew to about 75 people within an hour as participants
took turns to speak about corporate greed, the influence of
money on politics, war and the environment. 
&#8220;There is no reason why this country should be the way it
is,&#8221; said Heath Weaver, 46, of Toms River, a self-employed
videographer who came to the Trenton event with a sleeping bag.
&#8220;Instead of people coming together we&#8217;ve been fighting against
each other and nothing&#8217;s getting solved.&#8221; 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the demonstration.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger will take on the added role of chairman next
year at the theme-park and entertainment company, part of a plan
to appoint a new CEO in 2015. 
Iger, 60, will succeed John E. Pepper at the annual meeting
in March, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a
statement. Pepper, 73, a former chairman and CEO of Procter 
Gamble Co., has led the board since 2007. 
Disney didn&#8217;t name a successor for Iger, who oversaw the
acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel in the past five years and will
become executive chairman in 2015. The company will combine the
top roles for the first time since 2004, when CEO Michael Eisner
was stripped of the chairmanship after a failed proxy fight
waged by Roy Disney, Walt&#8217;s nephew. The company wanted to keep
Iger and have a smooth transition, Pepper said. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m totally surprised that they would do this again,&#8221;
said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware&#8217;s
John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. &#8220;Why stick
your head in a blender? An executive just shouldn&#8217;t be in charge
of the board that monitors him.&#8221; 
Two of Disney&#8217;s top executives, Tom Staggs and Jay Rasulo,
swapped roles at the end of 2009, with Chief Financial Officer
Staggs assuming the job of parks chief and Rasulo becoming CFO,
in a move designed to bolster the experience of both men. 
Race to the Top? 
Iger &#8220;set up a race between the two by having them switch
jobs that ought to help him make that decision,&#8221; said David Joyce, a Miller Tabak  Co. analyst in New York who recommends
buying Disney shares. &#8220;They are both 20-year veterans at the
company and have strong operational backgrounds.&#8221; 
Disney&#8217;s largest business is media networks, led by Anne Sweeney and George Bodenheimer, co-chairmen. The division, which
includes ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channel, had $17.2 billion in
fiscal 2010 sales and contributed two-thirds of Disney&#8217;s $7.6
billion in operating income. 
Disney fell 33 cents to $31.70 at the close in New York and
has declined 15 percent this year. 
The company also extended Iger&#8217;s contract through 2016 and
is increasing his salary to $2.5 million annually from $2
million now. The new agreement includes a $12 million annual
cash bonus target, as well as options and restricted stock
valued at $15.5 million, Disney said. His current agreement ends
in 2013. 
&#8216;Strong Performer&#8217; 
&#8220;Iger has made some forward thinking moves that have made
the company a strong performer,&#8221; Joyce said in an interview.
&#8220;He was the first to embrace digital technology and positioned
the company well with the Pixar and Marvel acquisitions.&#8221; 
The bonus is based on performance yardsticks that include
operating income, return on capital, after-tax free cash flow
and earnings per share, the company said. The stock awards will
be based on total shareholder return and earnings per share,
relative to the SP 500. 
In the announcement, Disney said total shareholder return
under Iger is five times higher than the SP 500 index since he
took over as CEO. 
&#8220;The board is delighted that the company has been able to
secure the longer-term continuation of Bob&#8217;s unique blend of
experience and leadership skills,&#8221; Pepper said. Iger &#8220;will
continue to serve the long-term interests of shareholders.&#8221; 
As part of the transition, Disney will appoint an
independent lead director when Iger becomes chairman, according
to the statement. 
Iger was named president of Disney in 2000 and succeeded
Eisner as CEO in October 2005. He led the $8.06 billion purchase
of the Pixar animation studio in 2006 and the $4.2 billion
acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2010. He previously
headed Disney&#8217;s ABC television unit.

The cost to protect Morgan Stanley (MS)
bonds against losses dropped for the fourth day as concern eased
that its balance sheet will be impaired by Europe&#8217;s sovereign
debt crisis and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analysts said investors
should wager on the bank&#8217;s creditworthiness. 
Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley fell 43 basis points
to 431 basis points as of 3:49 p.m. in New York, according to
prices from London-based data provider CMA. The five-year
contracts have declined from 650 basis points on Oct. 4, the
highest since October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. 
Creditor confidence in New York-based Morgan Stanley is
rebounding after crumbling for two straight weeks amid
speculation the firm faced losses tied to Europe&#8217;s fiscal
imbalances that has sent borrowing costs on governments from
Greece to Italy to records and triggered drops in the stocks of
the region&#8217;s lenders, led by French banks. 
&#8220;We believe concerns regarding its European swap and loan
exposures appear overdone, as the firm signaled its net
exposures to France and the periphery are modest if not
immaterial,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts and strategists including
John Marshall , Louise Pitt and Daniel Harris said in a note
today. 
The analysts recommended investors sell protection with
one-year contracts tied to Morgan Stanley debt that were quoted
at about 640 basis points. That&#8217;s equivalent to about $640,000
on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. 
The surge in credit swaps doesn&#8217;t &#8220;reflect actual credit
fundamentals&#8221; for a bank a with a $182 billion global liquidity
pool at the end of the second quarter, they said. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. 
Cross-Border Exposure 
Morgan Stanley had about $28 billion of cross-border
exposure to French banks at the end of June before accounting
for offsetting hedges and collateral, according to a filing with
the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. 
Cross-border outstandings include cash deposits,
receivables, loans and securities, as well as short-term
collateralized loans of securities or cash known as repurchase
agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. 
While Morgan Stanley hasn&#8217;t updated those figures, the
total risk to France and the country&#8217;s lenders is less than $2
billion when collateral and hedges are included, Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York estimated in a
Sept. 23 note to clients. The bank&#8217;s current exposure to the
nation and its banks is zero after hedges and collateral, a
person close to the firm said Sept. 30. 
Relative to Peers 
Disclosures by the company when it announces third-quarter
earnings this month are likely to calm fears, causing credit
swaps to narrow relative to peers, the Goldman Sachs strategists
said. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit swaps through yesterday were
trading 164 basis points wider than the average of the six-
biggest U.S. banks, according to prices from London-based data
provider CMA. The gap reached 226 basis points at the close of
trading on Oct. 3, the widest since October 2008. 
Swaps on other banks also decreased today. Contracts on
Citigroup Inc. (C) fell 10 basis points to a mid-price of 290 basis
points, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) dropped 5 to 394 and swaps on
Goldman Sachs declined 19 to 355, CMA prices show. 
A benchmark gauge of U.S. company credit risk snapped three
days of declines as Fitch Ratings downgraded Spain and Italy,
overshadowing positive jobs data in the U.S. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index , which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.7 basis point to a mid-
price of 139.6 basis points as of 3:58 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. The measure
had earlier declined as much as 2.6. 
Payrolls Data 
The swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has dropped
from 150.1 on Oct. 3 as investor speculation grew that Europe&#8217;s
leaders are progressing in stemming the debt crisis. 
&#8220;September&#8217;s payrolls data is a light in the middle of the
tunnel for the credit markets,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. &#8220;It&#8217;s not enough to ease investor anxiety
permanently, but it should provide a catalyst for some relief to
these wider spreads.&#8221; 
Payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised 57,000
increase the prior month that was more than originally
estimated, Labor Department data showed today in Washington.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is trying to
persuade the National Hockey League&#8217;s New Jersey Devils to sell
bonds backed by the team&#8217;s future television revenue, newsletter
Asset-Backed Alert reported, without saying where it got the
information. 
The sale, which Goldman Sachs bankers proposed to the team
this week, could raise between $75 million and $100 million, the
report said today. The team&#8217;s officials are reviewing the pitch,
according to the newsletter. 
A sale may depend on whether Jeff Vanderbeek, the former
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. executive who owns 47 percent of
the team, can buy the stake held by co-owner Ray Chambers, the
report said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in
New York, declined to comment. Vanderbeek didn&#8217;t immediately

Morgan Stanley (MS) shares are likely to
rally when the firm reports earnings this month as management
eases concern that profit will be hurt by risks linked to
European sovereign debt, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. 
Morgan Stanley is likely to provide more details on its
sovereign risk and improved liquidity, helping shares to rally
to 70 percent of tangible book value from their current 57
percent, analysts at New York-based Goldman Sachs wrote in a
note today. They recommended investors buy $16 October calls and
sell short-dated credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, which
is also based in New York. 
Investors&#8217; concerns that the firm has large European swap
exposures are &#8220;overdone,&#8221; analysts and strategists including
John Marshall and Louise Pitt said in the note. They made the
recommendation even as they said third-quarter earnings are
likely to be &#8220;weak.&#8221; Goldman Sachs left its &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating
unchanged. 
&#8220;The risk/reward balance of MS shares at current levels
appear tempting,&#8221; the analysts said, referring to the company
by its stock ticker. &#8220;MS should be able to ride out the current
market duress assuming global macroeconomic indicators do not
materially decay. Moreover, concerns regarding its European swap
and loan exposures appear unwarranted, as the firm has signaled
its net exposures to France and the periphery are modest if not
immaterial.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley fell 80 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $14.38 at
12:40 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares gained 22 percent the three days through yesterday, the
largest three-day climb since May 2009. That rally left the
shares down 44 percent this year. An increase to 70 percent of
tangible book value would imply a jump to $18.63. 
Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the
world&#8217;s biggest retail brokerage, fell 54 basis points to 420 as
of 11:07 a.m. in New York, according to broker Phoenix Partners
Group. The five-year contracts have declined from 650 basis
points on Oct. 4, the highest since October 2008, the month
after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won European Union
approval to buy Skype Technologies SA in an $8.5 billion deal
adding the world&#8217;s most popular Web-calling service to the
biggest software maker. 
The deal won&#8217;t harm competition in the region, partly
because of the presence of rivals such as Google Inc., the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. 
&#8220;The investigation found that the parties&#8217; activities
mainly overlap for video communications, where Microsoft is
active through its Windows Live Messenger,&#8221; the commission
said. &#8220;However, the commission considers that there are no
competition concerns in this growing market where numerous
players, including Google, are present.&#8221; 
Microsoft agreed in May to acquire Luxembourg-based Skype,
with 170 million active users, from investors led by private
equity firm Silver Lake. The acquisition, Microsoft&#8217;s largest,
is also the biggest Internet takeover in more than a decade.

ExxonMobil Corp. said it&#8217;s responding
to an oil sheen observed Oct. 7 near its Billings, Montana,
refinery, about 15 miles from an Exxon pipeline spill in July. 
&#8220;ExxonMobil has no pipelines or similar oil containing
equipment in close proximity to the leak,&#8221; said Rachael Moore,
a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based company, in an e-mail
today. The company has &#8220;no reason&#8221; to believe its facilities
were the source of the oil, she said. 
A spill response team from the refinery laid boom to limit
potential environmental damage, and the &#8220;small amount of oil&#8221;
is contained in a side channel of the river, Moore said. 
The company is investigating the source of the sheen, she
said. Moore declined to provide an estimate of how much oil is
in the sheen. 
On July 1, Exxon&#8217;s Silvertip pipeline in Montana ruptured,
spilling as much as 1,000 barrels of crude into the Yellowstone
River. The cleanup effort, which is being led by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, has involved more than 600
people and is expected to cost the company an estimated $42.6
million, Exxon has said.

Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, canceled a
planned appearance tomorrow at Barnard College, whose president
joined the company&#8217;s board four months ago. 
&#8220;Mr. Blankfein&#8217;s office informed us that he would be
unable to deliver his lecture as planned, due to an unavoidable
scheduling conflict,&#8221; Kathryn Kolbert, director of Barnard&#8217;s
Athena Center for Leadership Studies, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We expect that his talk will be rescheduled for a
future date.&#8221; 
The &#8220;Power Talk&#8221; with Blankfein was cancelled because he
&#8220;must be in Washington D.C. that evening,&#8221; the Athena Center
said on its website. 
Debora L. Spar, president of the women-only liberal-arts
school, joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board at a meeting in London on
June 16, her 48th birthday. Blankfein, 57, and his wife Laura, a
Barnard College alumna and former trustee, donated $50,000 to
the New York-based college in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31,
2010, their nonprofit foundation&#8217;s federal tax filings show. 
Students at Columbia University, across the street from
Barnard, had organized a week-long protest against Blankfein
called &#8220;School the Squid,&#8221; which included discussions about
corporate greed and power abuse, the student-run Columbia Daily
Spectator reported on its website today. 
Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before it converted to a bank in
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., set a pay record in 2007 when it awarded
Blankfein a $67.9 million bonus. 
A 2009 article by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone magazine
labeled the company &#8220;a great vampire squid wrapped around the
face of humanity.&#8221; 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
confirmed that Blankfein cancelled his talk due to a scheduling
conflict. He declined further comment.

Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C)
led U.S. banks higher in New York trading after European leaders
pledged to deliver a plan to stem the debt crisis that has led
to concerns about global lenders&#8217; balance sheets. 
Morgan Stanley climbed $1.05, or 7.4 percent, to $15.29 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, bringing
its increase during the last week to 23 percent. Citigroup
jumped 7.6 percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) rose 6.4 percent,
helping to lead the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index to a 5.1 percent gain. 
The SP 500 has rebounded about 9 percent from a 13-month
low on Oct. 3 amid optimism that European leaders will succeed
in taming the debt crisis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday they will
deliver a plan to recapitalize European banks and address the
Greek debt crisis by the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit. 
Every company in the SP Financials Index climbed today.
The index has declined 22 percent this year. Morgan Stanley,
based in New York, is down 44 percent this year. Bank of
America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has dropped 53
percent, while New York-based Citigroup lost 44 percent. 
Merkel said European leaders will do &#8220;everything
necessary&#8221; to ensure that banks have enough capital. Belgium
also said today it will buy part of Dexia SA and provide
security for depositors as part of a plan to rescue the lender. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said last week
that U.S. financial firms have strengthened and there is
&#8220;absolutely&#8221; no chance of another collapse like Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services company, rose to a
record, surpassing the mark set in July. 
IBM rose 2.3 percent to $186.62 at the close in New York,
giving it a market value of $222.9 billion. The price topped the
$185.21 it reached July 19. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s attractive as a safer, less volatile investment in
tech in very turbulent times,&#8221; said Ed Maguire, an analyst at
Credit Agricole Securities USA in New York who rates the shares
&#8220;outperform.&#8221; 
IBM, which went public in 1915, has gained 27 percent this
year, making it the best performer of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The index, down 1.3 percent this year, jumped 3 percent
today as global markets rallied. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano divested the
company&#8217;s PC business six years ago, turning the company once
known for mainframe computers into the world&#8217;s biggest computer-
services provider. IBM is celebrating its 100th anniversary this
year.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), trying to reverse
disappointing sales for its Windows Phone, is counting on
Samsung Electronics Co. and other manufacturing partners to step
up retailer incentives and boost in-store promotions. 
Both Samsung and HTC Corp. have committed to increasing
marketing budgets for the phones, said Andy Lees, president of
Microsoft&#8217;s mobile unit, in an interview. While manufacturers
will determine how the money is spent, some of it will probably
go toward spurring retail staff to tout Windows Phone models, he
said. New handsets with the new Windows Phone 7.5 will go on
sale in the coming weeks, Lees said. 
Since the release of the previous version last October, the
Windows Phone has missed the company&#8217;s sales expectations, and
Microsoft has continued to lose ground to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone
and devices based on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android. Microsoft needs to
do a better job of marketing the new software, which is much
improved, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. 
&#8220;From a technical perspective, it really does put them on
par with the other competitors, but a lot of times Microsoft
gets it right with the technology and then fumbles the marketing
message,&#8221; he said. Mobile-phone retailers haven&#8217;t cooperated in
the past, Gartenberg said. &#8220;If you went to a store they showed
you anything other than a Windows Phone. If you asked for a
Windows Phone, they tried to talk you out of it.&#8221; 
Retail Rules 
Microsoft is especially reliant on the carriers&#8217; retail
salespeople in the U.S., where more than 80 percent of phones
are sold by stores owned by mobile operators, Lees said. In
other countries, a larger percentage of handsets are sold by the
phone makers themselves. He didn&#8217;t specify what form the
incentives might take. 
Windows Phone 7.5, also known as Mango, was released last
month to existing Windows handset customers. In addition to more
aggressive marketing, Microsoft&#8217;s partnership with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)
will help sales, Lees said. Nokia announced earlier this year
that it would base its handsets on Windows Phone software, a bid
to reinvigorate its smartphone strategy. Nokia directly or
indirectly controls more than 6,000 stores, Lees said. 
Gartner forecasts that Microsoft will become the No. 2
smartphone operating system in 2015, with market share of 20
percent. That would vault it past Apple&#8217;s iOS, with Android
remaining in the top spot. Achim Berg, head of Windows Phone
marketing, said at a September conference in Berlin that the 20
percent share may be a conservative estimate. 
First Quarter 
Next year, Microsoft will account for 11 percent of the
market, up from 5.6 percent this year, Gartner said in an April
report. Lees declined to forecast numbers himself, except to say
he expects market share to rise starting in the first quarter of
2012. 
Manufacturers plan to produce a Windows phone that uses the
high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution, or
LTE, in the &#8220;not-too-distant future,&#8221; Lees said. That will
make mobile carriers more eager to promote the Windows Phone. 
Cheaper models also will be produced, giving a boost to the
operating system, Lees said. While handset makers and the
carriers determine prices and subsidies, consumers should see
Windows Phone devices for less than $100 in the U.S., he said. 
&#8220;The stars are really starting to align for us,&#8221; Lees
said. 
The new software, which better integrates apps, search and
phone features, received positive reviews from AllThingsD,
Gizmodo and Bloomberg&#8217;s Rich Jaroslovsky. 
Movies, Maps 
Search for a movie, and the phone brings up a synopsis,
running time, showings nearby, and lets you buy tickets. It also
lists apps related to movies. It has indoor maps so you can find
the parking lot at the mall where the theater is located. A
local app gives you nearby restaurants and if you&#8217;ve downloaded
OpenTable, there&#8217;s a reserve button right there. 
The search key brings up the option to scan book or album
covers for product matches. It will also scan foreign language
text to translate a French restaurant menu. The software can
listen to a piece of music and identify it. 
Microsoft rose 2.6 percent to $26.94 at close in New York.
The stock has dropped 3.5 percent this year.

The cost to protect against losses
on Morgan Stanley (MS) debt dropped to the lowest in almost three
weeks after European leaders pledged this week to ensure the
region&#8217;s banks have enough capital to withstand the sovereign
debt crisis. 
Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley bonds fell 41.7
basis points from Oct. 7 to 392.9 basis points, the lowest since
Sept. 21, according to data provider CMA. The New York-based
bank&#8217;s contracts have declined from 582.7 on Oct. 3, the highest
since October 2008. Bond markets in the U.S. were closed
yesterday for the Columbus Day holiday. A benchmark gauge of
U.S. corporate credit risk tumbled to the lowest in three weeks. 
The drop in swaps prices signals that investors are
regaining some confidence in the banking system since German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Oct. 9 that the region&#8217;s leaders
will do &#8220;everything necessary&#8221; to ensure that European banks
are capitalized after meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s swaps had led a surge in contracts on
U.S. banks amid concerns that an escalating crisis in Europe
would trigger losses globally. 
&#8220;We have valuations in the market now that reflect the
binary outcomes we&#8217;re facing as investors: whether we&#8217;re going
to see a blowup in Europe or whether we&#8217;re going to see an
austerity program in the U.S. or whether were going to somehow
keep on keeping on with gridlock in Washington and the euro zone
keeping together,&#8221; Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of
Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, which manages $17
billion, said in a webcast today. 
Markit CDX Index 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 4 basis points from
Oct. 7 to a mid-price of 135.3 basis points, according to Markit
Group Ltd. The index has fallen from 150.1 basis points on Oct.
3, the highest since May 2009. In London, the Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose
0.8 for the day to 179.1. 
Both indexes typically decrease as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said third-quarter profit rose as proceeds
from a refinery sale and the strengthening U.S. dollar more than
offset slowing oil demand. 
Chevron&#8217;s net income in the period that ended Sept. 30 was
&#8220;comparable&#8221; with second-quarter results, when the company
reported a profit of $7.73 billion, exceeding the $3.77 billion
earned during the third quarter of 2010. Chevron announced
selected third-quarter results in a statement distributed via
Business Wire. The company, based in San Ramon, California, is
scheduled to release full third-quarter results on Oct. 28. 
Chevron sold a U.K. oil refinery and related storage
terminals and marketing assets in Ireland to Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)
in August for $1.73 billion as part of Chief Executive Officer
John Watson&#8217;s effort to shed lower-profit fuel-making units. The
company said today that it recorded a $500 million third-quarter
gain from the sale. 
Chevron&#8217;s oil and natural-gas production during July and
August fell 5 percent from the full third-quarter of 2010 to the
equivalent of 2.6 million barrels a day, the company said. The
declines stemmed from a pipeline incident in Thailand and repair
work to installations in the Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan and the
U.K. 
A U.K. tax increase on oil and gas production prompted
Chevron to take a $150 million &#8220;catch-up charge&#8221; during the
third quarter and will cost an additional $40 million during the
current period, according to the statement. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. of Irving, Texas, is the largest U.S. oil
company by market value.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the top-ranked
fixed-income research firm on Wall Street, upgraded its
recommendation on high-grade corporate debt to &#8220;neutral&#8221; as
the assets attract more money from investors. 
The bank, which cut the debt to &#8220;underweight&#8221; on June 15,
said valuations are more attractive than low-yielding U.S.
Treasuries, especially after the Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;Operation
Twist&#8221; program announced last month, analysts led by Eric Beinstein wrote in a note today. Inflows to the asset class,
high cash balances and &#8220;solid&#8221; corporate credit fundamentals
also fueled the outlook shift, according to the note. 
&#8220;Year-end tends to be when investors review their asset
allocations, and we believe HG U.S. corporate bonds will be
deemed about the best asset class to own heading into the low
growth and potentially recessionary environment of 2012,&#8221;
analysts from the New York-based bank wrote. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury have fallen to
about 2.1 percent from 2.97 percent four months ago as Europe&#8217;s
sovereign debt crisis worsens and after the Fed decided to
replace short-term Treasuries in its $1.65 trillion portfolio
with long-term bonds in a policy known as Operation Twist.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have increased to
4.13 percent from 3.72 percent on June 15, increasing the allure
of such securities. 
The analysts, ranked No. 1 investment-grade strategists in
Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s annual poll, didn&#8217;t assign an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation to high-grade corporate debt,
citing growth slowdowns in the U.S. and Europe that will lead to
heightened &#8220;event risk,&#8221; according to the note. They also
cited the lack of a solution to the European debt crisis, asset
sales by European banks and limited allocations to financial
debt versus non-financial. 
A &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation at JPMorgan means the position
is expected to perform in line with benchmarks over the next
three months, according to today&#8217;s note. 
Investment-grade bonds are rated Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and BBB- and above by Standard  Poor&#8217;s.

General Motors Co. (GM), the biggest U.S.
automaker, is looking at India, Association of Southeast Asian
Nations member states and Africa as sites for expanding
production to tap growing demand in emerging markets. 
&#8220;If there were two areas that I thought were open to
additional investment, those would be India and the ASEAN
area,&#8221; Tim Lee, GM&#8217;s president of international operations,
said in an interview in Dubai. 
India&#8217;s economy, the third-largest in Asia after China&#8217;s
and Japan&#8217;s, is forecast to grow 7.8 percent in 2011 and 7.5
percent next year, the International Monetary Fund said in
September. India will probably in the long term become Detroit-
based GM&#8217;s third-biggest market after the U.S. and China, Lee
said. The company builds vehicles in India in a joint venture
with Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp. 
There is a &#8220;need to look at more production facilities,
but this is yet to be done,&#8221; Lee said in the interview
yesterday. 
The U.S. automaker increased sales in India by 17 percent
in September to 10,112 vehicles, with growth propelled by the
diesel-powered Chevrolet Beat small car, GM said on Oct. 3. The
automaker has estimated that it accounted for 3.4 percent of
India&#8217;s car market in the first nine months of this year. 
&#8220;We expect to grow our share dramatically in India over
the next 12 to 18 months,&#8221; Lee said. 
The executive, who was recently on a visit to Cairo and is
headed to Johannesburg, said Africa is an emerging growth area
&#8220;that would likely support some additional capacity.&#8221; 
South Africa, where GM builds vehicles in Port Elizabeth,
and Egypt, where it has a plant in the Cairo suburb of Maadi,
account for 70 percent of the U.S. company&#8217;s sales in Africa,
the manufacturer said on Nov. 22, when it announced a
reorganization of operations in the region.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stock analysts
took top honors in Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s rating of
the best U.S. financial researchers for the second consecutive
year, winning by the narrowest margin of any firm since 2002. 
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, had 40
top-ranked analysts in the survey, edging out Barclays Plc (BARC) and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch, which tied for second
place with 39 each, the publication said today in a statement.
The number of top analysts at Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) rose to 25 from
18, the largest increase, as Germany&#8217;s biggest lender climbed to
eighth place from ninth last year. 
Institutional Investor&#8217;s 40th annual All-America Research
Team ranking tallied ratings from 3,500 fund managers and
analysts at more than 1,000 investment firms overseeing $10.7
trillion of U.S. equities. New York-based JPMorgan, Barclays and
Bank of America held the top spots even as fewer of their
analysts made the cut. 
&#8220;The competition is fierce,&#8221; Thomas Johnson, the
magazine&#8217;s research editor, said in the statement. &#8220;In a period
of unprecedented economic uncertainty, from sovereign debt
crises in Europe and political unrest in the Middle East to
gridlock in Washington, it&#8217;s not surprising that investors would
flock to banks with global platforms.&#8221; 
UBS Gains 
JPMorgan had 46 analysts on the list in 2010 to capture the
top ranking for the first time, snapping a two-year winning
streak for Barclays Capital, the brokerage arm of London-based
Barclays, which placed second with 43 analysts. Barclays owns
the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which
ranked No. 1 in each of the previous five years. Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America ranked third in 2010. 
UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, climbed to tie Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) in fourth place with 43 analysts, up from fifth
last year. New York-based Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. was the
only firm in the top 10 to fall, slipping to ninth place from
sixth with 22 analysts, down from 25 last year. 
Winners include John Pitzer, who covers technology for
Zurich-based Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan&#8217;s Steven Alexopoulos,
who took the top spot for Banks/Midcap analysts. 

     The following firms ranked highest in the survey:

Liberians began voting today,
deciding whether to give Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf a second term in the presidency amid promises to create
jobs and boost investment. 
Liberians lined up in rainy weather for at least two hours
before voting stations opened at 8 a.m. in the capital,
Monrovia. 
&#8220;There are no reported incidents of violence or any form of
disruptions,&#8221; Bobby Livingstone, director of press for the
National Elections Commission, said by phone. 
Johnson-Sirleaf, 72, faces 15 candidates including Winston
Tubman, 70, a lawyer whose running mate is George Weah, a soccer
star who won the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1995,
and 60-year-old lawyer Charles Brumskine. If no candidate wins
more than 50 percent of the vote a second round of balloting
will be held. 
Announcement of results will start tomorrow with the final
outcome given Oct. 26, said James Fromoyan, chairman of the
elections body, in a statement broadcast on radio stations Oct.
9. Voters are also choosing 15 junior senators and 73 lawmakers,
he said. 
Closing Borders 
Johnson-Sirleaf, who was elected Africa&#8217;s first female
president, has been working to rebuild a country devastated by a
14-year civil war that ended in 2003, leaving an estimated
250,000 people dead. The economy is forecast to expand 6.9
percent this year, outpacing the estimated sub-Saharan African
average of 5.2 percent, according to the International Monetary
Fund. The former banker was named a joint winner of the Nobel
prize on Oct. 7 for her work in promoting women&#8217;s rights.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley may consider dropping their status as bank holding
companies to avoid expenses tied to the Volcker rule, said David Hilder, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP. 
The rule in its current form would impose costs on lenders
and drive capital to non-bank market makers, causing the two New
York-based firms to consider whether to stop being banks, Hilder
said in a note yesterday, when four regulatory agencies issued a
298-page draft of the rule for public comment. 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the biggest U.S.
securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks. 
&#8220;The regulators have proposed a massive new compliance
burden on banks to prove that their market-making activities are
just that, and not proprietary trading in disguise,&#8221; wrote
Hilder, who&#8217;s based in New York. &#8220;If these regulations are
adopted in anything close to their proposed form, there will be
large additional costs imposed on banks as market-makers that
will not apply to market-makers not owned by banks.&#8221; 
David Konrad, a bank analyst at KBW Inc., said Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) are unlikely to change their status as
bank holding companies to dodge the Volcker restrictions. 
&#8216;Protecting Deposits&#8217; 
&#8220;If they tried to do that, Congress would amend the rule
to say systemically important banks rather than bank holding
companies,&#8221; Konrad said in a phone interview. &#8220;This is part
protecting deposits, but also part too-big-to-fail. I don&#8217;t
think there&#8217;s any interest from the investment banks in doing
that, and I don&#8217;t think it would serve that purpose.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said
Jan. 21, 2010, the same day President Barack Obama announced his
support for the Volcker rule, that it was &#8220;unrealistic&#8221; to
imagine the firm won&#8217;t be a federally supervised bank. 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley made &#8220;modest profits&#8221;
from pure proprietary trading, which is why they willingly shut
down those desks, David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities,
wrote in a note today. The rule&#8217;s draft indicates regulators
won&#8217;t interfere with customer flow trading, he wrote. 
Goldman Sachs may be hurt by provisions that limit
investments in hedge funds and private equity, Trone wrote. Had
those restrictions been in place in recent years, they would
have cost the firm about $700 million, or 9 percent, of annual
earnings, he wrote. 
&#8216;Crown Jewel&#8217; Businesses 
The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, was
included in last year&#8217;s regulatory overhaul to rein in risky
trading that helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The central
bank, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency worked with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on the draft issued yesterday. 
Morgan Stanley climbed 45 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $15.84
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Goldman Sachs
advanced 2.5 percent to $99.11. 
Increased regulation and capital rules may mean the largest
banks have to split off some &#8220;crown jewel&#8221; businesses, said
Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern
School of Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. 
&#8220;You have to ask which parts of the business are they
simply not going to be able to continue to do or maintain the
talented people who do it because those guys would have better
options if they left the firm and went to a hedge fund,&#8221; Smith
said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to be left with the third team running
your expensive market-making trading desk.&#8221; 
It&#8217;s too soon to say whether banks affected by the rule
would have to break up to remain competitive and the costs of
the proposal are likely to shift some business to smaller
players, Glenn Schorr, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst, wrote in
a note today. Companies and investors are likely to push back
during the comment period to &#8220;dial back&#8221; some parts of the
rule, he wrote. 
Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Mark Lake declined to comment.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said conventional quantitative easing may
not be enough for the U.S. and U.K. economies and more
&#8220;targeted&#8221; policies are needed to boost confidence and growth. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not obvious to me that conventional QE in the U.K.
or the U.S. has got that much bang for its buck,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said
in an interview with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;The Pulse&#8221; program in London today. &#8220;More imaginative QE or
forms of specific targeted easing, probably involving more
infrastructure or doing something to get bank funding spreads
down, would be more likely to get a stronger result.&#8221; 
His comments were echoed by former Bank of England policy
maker Sushil Wadhwani, who said today that global central banks
need to do &#8220;more creative&#8221; forms of monetary policy to prevent
the global economy slipping into a recession. 
The Bank of England restarted asset purchases last week,
its first expansion of policy since 2009, citing risks to the
recovery from the euro-area debt crisis, while data today showed
the unemployment rate rose to the highest since 1996 in the
quarter through August. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve
announced last month an operation to replace $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries,
aiming to reduce borrowing costs and spur the recovery. 
Less Impact 
The Bank of England&#8217;s new stimulus &#8220;will have less effect
this time than it did last time,&#8221; former Bank of England policy
maker Charles Goodhart said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Last
Word&#8221; with Andrea Catherwood today. &#8220;The real problem isn&#8217;t
the level of official interest rates, but it&#8217;s the difficulties
the banks have in getting funding and the spreads the banks
charge.&#8221; 
He said there is a &#8220;very strong case&#8221; for trying to
provide more assistance to small businesses and first-time home
buyers. Referring to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne&#8217;s credit-easing proposal, he said &#8220;more innovative
ways&#8221; to help boost credit are necessary. 
Wadhwani, founder of Wadhwani Asset Management LLP, said
global policy makers need to do three things &#8220;if they are to
prevent a relapse,&#8221; 
&#8220;First, they need to get firms better access to credit,&#8221;
he said in an e-mailed note co-written with Michael Dicks.
&#8220;Second, they need to help boost demand. And, third, they need
to deal with the euro crisis.&#8221; 
Direct Approach 
Wadhwani recommended U.K. authorities take a more direct
approach to boosting demand by issuing every adult a voucher
that can be spent in the next three months. That is &#8220;surely a
more effective form of quantitative easing&#8221; than the central
bank buying gilts, he said. 
He also said the U.K. and the U.S. can&#8217;t &#8220;play the
innocent bystander and plead with Europe to sort out its mess.&#8221; 
&#8220;Better surely to recognize both the global scale of the
problem and the political constraints that are currently
limiting European policy makers&#8217; room for manoeuvre, and act in
accordance,&#8221; he said. 
The U.K. unemployment data also showed that jobless claims
rose 17,500 in September, a seventh straight increase. Prime
Minister David Cameron said the figures were &#8220;very
disappointing,&#8221; adding that the government won&#8217;t abandon its
budget-reduction plan. 
&#8220;I think it would be a dangerous thing to rule out&#8221; the
U.K. economy deteriorating further &#8220;given what the evidence is
showing,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;It might be because of the fiscal
tightening that is coming home to roost.&#8221;

Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI), the largest
U.S. auto supplier, rose as much as 6.6 percent after
forecasting per-share profit and revenue growth for the 2012
fiscal year. 
Johnson Controls rose 5.7 percent to $31.86 at 11:08 a.m.
in New York after earlier reaching $32.13. The shares dropped 21
percent this year before today. 
Profit in the year that ends Sept. 30, 2012, will be $2.85
a share to $3 a share, including 9 cents to fund pensions and
consolidate a lithium-ion battery joint venture, a gain of as
much as 23 percent from fiscal year 2011. The average estimate
of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for a profit of $3.11 a
share, excluding the one-time items. 
&#8220;The guidance of at least 20 percent earnings growth is
much better than what is priced into the stock,&#8221; David Leiker,
an analyst with Robert W. Baird  Co. in Milwaukee, said in an

said today before its investor day conference in New York. 
Profit in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 increased to 75
cents a share, excluding some costs, compared with 60 cents a
year earlier, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said today in a
preliminary earnings statement. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 78 cents a
share. Sales in the quarter were $10.7 billion, compared with an
average estimate of $10.5 billion. 
Improving Margins 
The company said sales and margins will improve in its
three business units, and it forecast higher auto production in
North America and China, while Europe mostly will be unchanged. 
Johnson Controls received 48 percent of its $34.3 billion
in revenue in its fiscal 2010 from its auto parts unit, which
makes seats and instrument panels. Johnson Controls also makes
car batteries and systems to manage building climate and
security. The company said it plans $1.7 billion in capital
investments this year. 
&#8220;The company&#8217;s long-term growth story is intact,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Roell said in the statement. 
Johnson Controls will release full fourth-quarter results
Oct. 27.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may say profit
slid 10 percent in the third quarter, the biggest drop in more
than two years, as Europe&#8217;s credit crisis and the U.S. debt-
ceiling debate spoiled optimism for an economic recovery. 
Tomorrow&#8217;s report from the New York-based bank will
probably show earnings of $3.96 billion, according to the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That
compares with $4.42 billion a year earlier and $5.43 billion in
the three months ended June 30. 
Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, braced investors last month for a 30 percent
drop in trading revenue from the second quarter, when the
company generated $5.5 billion from that business. He said fees
from investment banking would tumble almost 50 percent to $1
billion. About $2 trillion in corporate bond issues came to
market in the first half before volume plummeted to about $550
billion in the third quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
&#8220;We expect another challenging quarter for the universal
bank group,&#8221; Frederick Cannon and David Konrad, analysts at
Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc. in New York, wrote in an Oct. 10
research note. &#8220;Declining markets and elevated volatility is
expected not only to slow investment-banking and trading
revenues but also to cause negative marks in investments.&#8221; 
JPMorgan, the first of the major U.S. banks to report
third-quarter earnings, will be a barometer for the rest of the
industry and the broader U.S. economy, the analysts wrote. 
Reserve Releases 
CEO Jamie Dimon, 55, led the bank to a record $17.4 billion
in net income last year, the most of any U.S. bank. Earnings
were buoyed by the release of $7 billion in reserves back into
income as the U.S. economy improved, a benefit that may have
continued in the third quarter and helped &#8220;soften the blow,&#8221;
Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
wrote in an Oct. 7 research note. 
At the same time, legal costs to settle lawsuits and other
claims against the company&#8217;s soured mortgage book will continue
to erode earnings, the analysts said. 
The bank, whose $2.25 trillion in assets as of June 30
makes it second to Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), is &#8220;the safe play&#8221; for investors in the sector,
Cannon and Konrad said. 
Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia and analyst with FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia, instead recommends that investors either
&#8220;stay on the sidelines&#8221; or place their bets on better
capitalized banks such as Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. and U.S. Bancorp, he said in an Oct. 10
research note. 
Citigroup, Wells Fargo 
New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S.
lender, may report a profit of $2.5 billion when it releases
results on Oct. 17, and Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco,
will probably say it earned $3.87 billion when it announces
results the same day, the survey of analysts shows. Bank of
America may report a profit of $2.69 billion on Oct. 18 while
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) may say it earned $45.3 million. 
Slowing economic growth and heightened worries about
European sovereign debt have weighed on bank stocks all year.
None of the 24 members of the KBW Bank Index has posted a gain
in 2011, and the worst performer, Bank of America, is down 52
percent through yesterday. A jump in borrowing costs at some
banks, including New York-based Morgan Stanley, subsided last
week as investors became more optimistic that European Union
policy makers would solve the sovereign debt and banking crisis. 
Political &#8216;Incompetence&#8217; 
&#8220;American and EU politicians reached the limit of their
incompetence many months ago,&#8221; Christopher Whalen, founder of
Institutional Risk Analytics, said in a research note yesterday.
&#8220;We see the lack of business volumes and political uncertainty
going into 2012 as far more troubling trends in terms of non-
interest revenue sources for all financials.&#8221; 
Frederic Janbon, the global head of fixed-income at Paris-
based BNP Paribas SA, said in an interview that financial
markets have become &#8220;almost as dysfunctional and illiquid as
they were in 2008.&#8221; 
&#8220;The market is very difficult to trade and highly
sensitive to political news,&#8221; Janbon said. &#8220;Political risk has
moved to the forefront of people&#8217;s minds when looking at the
U.S. and Europe. Since July, anticipation of global economic
slowdown has fundamentally changed this situation. Anxiety has
now spread to all credit products.&#8221; 
Loan growth in the U.S. remains stagnant and net interest
margins, which measure the profit margin on lending, continue to
decline. Bank loans and leases fell $2.1 billion to $6.829
trillion from August 2010 through Sept. 28, according to Federal
Reserve data. 
Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$2.09 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a U.S. producer
of steelmaking coal, jumped 13 percent in New York after the
U.K.&#8217;s Independent reported that Anglo American Plc (AAL) and BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) may bid for the company. 
The potential bidder may be advised by JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the London-based newspaper said,
without citing anyone. Brazil&#8217;s Vale SA (VALE3) and Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA may also may bid, the newspaper said. The shares
rose to $75.22, the biggest gain in five weeks. 
Walter investor Audley Capital Advisors LLP said in July
that the Birmingham, Alabama-based company should explore a sale
because it lacked the leadership to take advantage of an
&#8220;unprecedented market opportunity&#8221; after coal prices jumped.
Walter appointed Walter J. Scheller III as Chief Executive
Officer on Sept. 12. He replaced interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard
and followed Keith Calder, who resigned as CEO in June after
telling the board he had differing opinions concerning
&#8220;management philosophy.&#8221; 
Demand from steelmakers in China and flood-related supply
disruptions in Australia have driven prices for coal to record
highs. Low-volatility coking coal traded at $270 a ton,
Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy Publishing said in a report
last week. 
Emily Blyth, a spokeswoman for London-based Anglo, declined
to comment, as did Ruban Yogarajah, a spokesman for Melbourne-
based BHP, and Paul Blalock, a spokesman for Walter. 
Coal MA 
Vale doesn&#8217;t respond to market rumors, an official at the
company&#8217;s press office who asked not to be named citing Vale
policy, said in a telephone interview. No one at CSN returned
calls and e-mails seeking comment. 
Buying Walter could allow Anglo to replace assets it might
lose in Chile, Dominic O&#8217;Kane, an analyst at Liberum Capital
Ltd. in London, said today in a note. Chilean copper producer
Codelco said yesterday it plans to exercise an option to buy as
much as 49 percent of Anglo&#8217;s unit in the South American
country. 
There were $20.5 billion of takeover offers for coal miners
valued at $100 million or more announced in the first nine
months of 2011, compared with $10.4 billion in the year-earlier
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Alpha Natural Resources Inc. bought rival U.S. coal
producer Massey Energy Co. in June for $7.1 billion. Peabody
Energy Corp. and ArcelorMittal agreed in August to pay A$4.8
billion ($4.9 billion) for Australia&#8217;s Macarthur Coal Ltd.,
which like Walter produces metallurgical coal. 
Walter acquired Vancouver-based Western Coal Corp. in April
for C$5.3 billion ($5.2 billion). Calder was the former CEO of
Western Coal. 
Walter operates mines in Alabama, West Virginia, British
Columbia and Wales.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led
increases in the cost of protecting the debt of U.S. companies
on renewed concern that Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis will continue to
derail the economic recovery and after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
reported a drop in profit. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs added 39 basis points
to 340 basis points, according to data provider CMA. Contracts
on JPMorgan climbed 8 to 142 and those tied to Morgan Stanley,
owner of the world&#8217;s largest retail brokerage, increased 29 to
387, the data show. 
A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk rose from
the lowest level in three weeks after JPMorgan said revenue at
its investment-banking unit fell 13 percent from the second
quarter amid concern that Greece would default and the U.S.
economic recovery was stalling. That overshadowed a report that
applications for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S.
fell more than expected. 
Credit-default swaps on the biggest U.S. banks tend to
swing with market sentiment, acting as a &#8220;bizarre bellwether,&#8221;
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit group at DoubleLine
Capital LP, which has $17.5 billion in assets under management,
said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. &#8220;I still don&#8217;t
get a sense that this is over yet in terms of the bank and
finance risk out there.&#8221; 
Contracts on Citigroup Inc. (C) increased 22 basis points to
250 basis points and contracts on General Electric Co. (GE)&#8217;s finance
arm General Electric Capital Corp. added 32 to 275. Those on San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) climbed 7 to 140.5. 
Six Largest Banks 
Even with today&#8217;s rise, contracts tied to the debt of the
six largest U.S. banks have decreased to 270 basis points from
360 basis points on Oct. 4, CMA data show, as European leaders
signaled progress in stemming the region&#8217;s debt crisis and
investor concern eased that bank balance sheets would be
infected by sovereign defaults. That&#8217;s equivalent to an average
of $270,000 to protect $10 million of debt for five years. 
JPMorgan swaps have dropped from 185 and Morgan Stanley (MS)
credit swaps declined from 650 basis points during the period. 
JPMorgan said third-quarter earnings fell to about $3.1
billion, or 73 cents a share, not including a 29 cents
accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on the same basis a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today. Net income was
$4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with the average per-
share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92 cents in a survey of
30 analysts by Bloomberg. 
Company Risk Gauge 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 132.6 basis points at 4:56 p.m. New York time,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, snapped two days of
declines after dropping from 150.1 on Oct. 3. 
Investor confidence in company creditworthiness dropped
even as applications for unemployment insurance payments
decreased 1,000 in the week ended Oct. 8 to 404,000 Labor
Department figures showed. Economists forecast 405,000 claims,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. 
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 4.8 percent in New York
trading after the company reported that profit declined on a
slump in investment banking and trading. 
JPMorgan dropped $1.60 to $31.60 at 4:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter earnings at the New York-
based lender fell to about $3.1 billion, or 73 cents a share,
not including a 29-cent accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on
the same basis a year earlier. 
Revenue at the investment-banking unit slid 13 percent from
the second quarter as concern that Greece would default and U.S.
lawmakers would fail to raise the debt ceiling roiled markets.
The firm said the division will face similar market conditions
for the rest of the year. 
&#8220;There was a lot of noise in this number,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets. &#8220;When you look
at the core number and back out the benefit of securities gains
and tax benefit, it&#8217;s starting to look like a mid-70 cent
number&#8221; for earnings per share, he said. 
Net income was $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared
with the average per-share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92
cents in a survey of 30 analysts by Bloomberg, the New York-
based company said today. 
Underlying Business 
The debt-valuation accounting gain &#8220;does not relate to the
underlying operations of the company,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, 55, said in a statement. Dimon said on a conference
call with journalists that the after-tax effect of the
accounting change was about 60 percent of the total gain for the
quarter. 
Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), estimated
JPMorgan would post $350 million in gains from the change in
debt valuation. U.S. accounting rules require the adjustment
when the value of a company&#8217;s debt declines, under the theory
that a profit would be realized if it were repurchased at a
discount. 
Third-quarter revenue declined 0.2 percent to $23.8 billion
from a year earlier. Fixed-income and equity-markets revenue
rose to $4.75 billion from $4.3 billion, driven by more than
$900 million in debt-valuation adjustments. 
Jes Staley, CEO of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, braced
investors last month for the drop in trading revenue from the
second quarter, when the company generated $5.5 billion from
that business. The investment bank&#8217;s staff dropped to 26,615 in
the third quarter from 27,716 in the second quarter, a decline
of 4 percent. 
Deposit Growth 
Total deposits surged 21 percent from a year earlier, to
$1.1 trillion. 
The company&#8217;s credit-card division, which posted losses for
all of 2009, generated almost 20 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s net
income for the quarter. The investment bank accounted for 38
percent. 
Fewer consumers fell behind on their credit-card payments
in the third quarter. Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal
of future write-offs, fell to 2.9 percent from 4.6 percent in
the same quarter in 2010 and 3.0 percent in the second quarter.
Write-offs dropped to 4.7 percent from 8.9 percent the prior
year and 5.8 percent in the previous quarter. 
The slower decline in delinquency rates explains why the
company reduced its loan-loss reserve by only $170 million,
Dimon said on a conference call with analysts. 
Mixed Results 
&#8220;If you look at delinquencies, low rates, first-time
delinquent, all that kind of stuff, they&#8217;re kind of mixed. It
could very well improve again, but it&#8217;s flattened out,&#8221; Dimon
said. 
Brennan Hawken at UBS Investment Research in New York was
expecting a reserve release closer to $1 billion. 
&#8220;The worry is that they are seeing something in credit that
has caused them to stop releasing reserves,&#8221; Hawken said in an
interview. &#8220;That means there could be some trend going on that
has caused them to be cautious.&#8221; 
Retail banking, which includes home loans and checking
accounts, earned $1.16 billion, compared with $383 million
during the second quarter and $716 million a year earlier. The
division benefited from a $370 million reduction in loan-loss
provisions to $1.03 billion. 
Net Interest Margin 
JPMorgan, which has benefited from record low costs of
funding mortgages and other assets, faces a squeeze on its net
interest margin -- the difference between what it pays to borrow
money and what it gets for loans and on securities. 
The bank&#8217;s margin narrowed to 2.66 percent from 2.72
percent the previous quarter and 3.01 percent a year earlier. 
&#8220;Trading overall in the third quarter is going to be
challenged amid dislocations both home and abroad,&#8221; Jason Goldberg, a senior bank analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;During the quarter, you saw
both a slowdown in investment-banking activity and more
challenging trading conditions amid a spike in volatility fueled
by concerns in Europe.&#8221; 
Slowing economic growth and heightened concern about
European sovereign debt have weighed on bank stocks all year.
The KBW Bank Index (BKX) had dropped 28 percent this year, and the
worst performer, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), is down 53 percent. A
jump in borrowing costs at some banks, including New York-based
Morgan Stanley, subsided last week as investors became more
optimistic that European Union policy makers will find a
solution. 
JPMorgan was the first of the major U.S. lenders to report
third-quarter results. 
Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, may report a
profit of $2.49 billion when it releases results on Oct. 17, and
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, will probably say it earned
$3.87 billion when it announces results the same day, the
surveys of analysts shows. Bank of America may report a profit
of $2.73 billion on Oct. 18.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) persuaded a
judge to throw out shareholders&#8217; claims that the investment
bank&#8217;s compensation system improperly rewarded employees for
taking risks that hurt the firm&#8217;s stock price. 
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock concluded
yesterday that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board acted properly in setting
up a pay plan for the fifth-biggest U.S. bank. The judge
dismissed a consolidated investor lawsuit claiming the plan
wrongly awarded billions of dollars in bonuses to executives and
employees, including Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, even as the
firm&#8217;s market value declined by $50 billion since 1999. 
Delaware law &#8220;provides corporate directors and officers
with broad discretion to act as they find appropriate in the
conduct of corporate affairs&#8221; and &#8220;in the exercise of their
business judgment on behalf of the corporation,&#8221; Glasscock
wrote in a 67-page opinion. 
Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007,
faced criticism from politicians and labor unions for its
compensation practices after getting taxpayer aid during the
financial crisis. 
In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the New York-based company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first
six months of this year, according to its website. That was 9
percent less than in the same period in 2010 as revenue tumbled
11 percent. 
&#8216;Limited Value&#8217; 
&#8220;The complaint fails to present facts that demonstrate
that the work done by Goldman&#8217;s 31,000 employees was of such
limited value to the corporation that no reasonable person in
the directors&#8217; position would have approved their levels of
compensation,&#8221; Glasscock said. 
Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, the operator of Philadelphia&#8217;s bus and rail network
and a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argued that the firm&#8217;s board
should be held accountable for not properly overseeing the
compensation system and employees&#8217; wrongful conduct. 
Septa&#8217;s lawyers said in court filings that Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year, while the firm settled U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission claims that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. 
$550 Million Penalty 
Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million, the largest
penalty ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to
resolve claims that marketing materials about the investments
had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007 as the U.S.
housing market faltered, without disclosing that a hedge fund
helped pick the underlying securities and then bet against the
investment vehicles, the SEC said in the suit Goldman settled.
The bank didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing as part of the accord. 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the Delaware ruling. 
Last month, a New York judge threw out another pension
fund&#8217;s suit that challenged Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation plan
for providing millions of dollars in bonuses to executives. 
New York State Supreme Court Justice Bernard J. Fried
dismissed suits filed by the Security Police  Fire
Professionals of America Retirement Fund and investor Judith A.
Miller on Sept. 21, according to court dockets. 
The Delaware case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Shareholder Litigation, CA5215, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reduced its
investment-bank workforce by almost 4 percent in the third
quarter and cut employee compensation costs 28 percent as the 
division grappled with fallout from the European debt crisis. 
The investment bank had 1,101 fewer employees at the end of
September than three months earlier and will continue to shrink
its staff of 26,615, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55,
told reporters on a conference call after releasing third-
quarter earnings today. 
While the bank isn&#8217;t planning layoffs, &#8220;we always trim our
sails,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see the headcount coming down as
some of these systems get rolled off to reduce costs.&#8221; The firm
will be &#8220;squeezing a little bit here and squeezing a little bit
there&#8221; to trim the workforce by about 1,000 additional people,
or &#8220;maybe a little bit more&#8221; in the next 18 months, he said. 
Jes Staley, CEO of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, braced
investors last month for a drop in third-quarter revenue as the
European debt crisis roiled markets, and the bank today said it
may face similar challenges in the year&#8217;s final months. A pay
reduction won&#8217;t likely drive out top performers amid such a
difficult environment, said Michael Holland, founder and
chairman of New York-based investment firm Holland  Co. 
&#8220;When things get better they will participate,&#8221; Holland
said in an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; &#8220;When things are crummy, as they
have been for the last number of quarters, they participate in
the downside as well. A number of the star performers who are
getting paid less will stick around, and I think it&#8217;s exactly
the right way to run the business.&#8221; 
Pay Per Employee 
The investment bank generated a $1.64 billion profit in the
third quarter, compared with $2.06 billion in the prior three
months, according to figures posted today on the New York-based
company&#8217;s website. Revenue at the unit fell 13 percent from the
second quarter to $6.37 billion. 
In the first three quarters, the unit set aside $7.71
billion, or 2 percent less than a year earlier, even as it
generated 10 percent more revenue. The expense, which includes
salaries, bonuses and benefits, was enough to give each of the
division&#8217;s employees $289,611. For the same period last year,
the unit set aside $7.88 billion to pay traders, dealmakers and
other personnel, or $298,866 for each of the 26,373 people on
staff as of Sept. 30, 2010. 
Compensation costs fell to $1.85 billion in the third
quarter, compared with $2.56 billion in the second quarter.
Average compensation per employee dropped to $69,510 from
$92,510, the bank said. Companywide, staff expanded 3 percent to
256,663. 
Less Revenue Spent 
Staley set aside 35 percent of the division&#8217;s revenue for
pay in the first nine months, down from 37 percent in the same
period a year earlier, excluding a 2010 U.K. bonus tax,
according to today&#8217;s disclosure. 
Fees from investment banking tumbled 46 percent to $1.04
billion in the third quarter, compared with the previous three
months. About $2 trillion in global corporate bond issues came
to market in the first half before volume plummeted to $553.3
billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end. 
&#8220;The market-related businesses clearly experienced
pressure from the volatility, reduced volumes and mark-to-market
pressures&#8221; amid the quarter&#8217;s market tumoil, Chief Financial
Officer Doug Braunstein told reporters on a conference call.

     Oct. 13 (Bloomberg)-- Just as his trial was set to start
its second day, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab yesterday pleaded
guilty to all eight charges in the attempted bombing of a
Northwest Airlines plane on Christmas Day 2009. 
U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds in Detroit immediately
swore in the Nigerian-born Abdulmutallab, telling the so-called
underwear bomber he had the right to remain silent. He waived
the right and admitted the charges against him. 
The surprise announcement by Abdulmutallab and attorney
Anthony Chambers, so-called standby counsel appointed to assist
him, came as the day&#8217;s first witness was about to be called.
Abdulmutallab planned to represent himself. 
In a statement to the court, Abdulmutallab said he tried to
bomb the plane as an act of retaliation against the U.S. for the
&#8220;killing of my brothers and sisters in Muslim lands.&#8221; 
&#8220;I intentionally carried an explosive device&#8221; onto the
plane, he said. The device was concealed in his underwear. He
was subdued by passengers after failing to set it off. 
Asked if he was aware that his actions were against the
law, he replied, &#8220;Yes, U.S. law.&#8221; He called American law
unjust and oppressive according to the Koran. 
Edmunds accepted his guilty pleas to all eight felony
counts and set sentencing for Jan. 12. The charges include
attempted murder and attempted use of a weapon of mass
destruction. Abdulmutallab has been in custody since his arrest. 
Chambers and U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade said
Abdulmutallab will spend the rest of his life in prison. 
&#8220;This case demonstrates that civilian courts are an
appropriate tool for bringing terrorists to justice,&#8221; McQuade
said in a press conference after the plea. 
The case is U.S. v. Abdulmutallab, 10-cr-20005, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). 
Lawsuit News 
Sprint, Cellular South Seek Access to U.S. Data in ATT Case 
Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and Cellular South Inc. asked for
access to confidential information that the Justice Department
got from ATT Inc. (T) in its probe of the company&#8217;s proposed merger
with T-Mobile USA Inc. 
The companies said U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle
in Washington should allow their outside lawyers and experts to
use the private data to prepare for trial in their own lawsuits
challenging the T-Mobile deal. To deprive them of that
opportunity creates a &#8220;fundamental unfairness,&#8221; they said. 
The companies, in a joint filing made public yesterday,
argued that, as competitors with relevant information, they have
been subpoenaed for documents by ATT in the government&#8217;s
antitrust suit to block the deal. At the same time, Huvelle,
overseeing all the ATT cases, froze document exchanges in the
private lawsuits while she weighs the company&#8217;s bid to dismiss
them. 
In an order yesterday, Huvelle said ATT and the Justice
Department had until Oct. 17 to respond to the request. 
&#8220;Sprint&#8217;s filing is another step in their fight against
competition,&#8221; Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman, said in an e-
mail. 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. Seven states and Puerto Rico joined the
government&#8217;s effort to block the deal, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier. 
Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kansas, brought its
antitrust lawsuit on Sept. 6. The combination of ATT and T-
Mobile would form the country&#8217;s largest mobile phone company. 
Cellular South sued on Sept. 19 claiming the merger
threatened to &#8220;substantially&#8221; cut competition. Cellular South
based in Ridgeland, Mississippi, changed its name to C Spire
Wireless on Sept. 26, according to its website. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
Cerberus, Innkeepers Trial Over Purchase Delayed to Oct. 20 
A trial over Cerberus Capital Management LP&#8217;s decision to
end a deal to buy 64 hotels from Innkeepers USA Trust was
delayed for a fourth time yesterday. 
The trial will begin Oct. 20, Innkeepers lawyer Dan Donovan
said yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
The start date was initially postponed from Oct. 10, when
two people with knowledge of settlement talks said Cerberus
might resolve the dispute by agreeing to buy the hotels at a
lower price. Innkeepers sued after Cerberus, a New York-based
private-equity firm, and Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT) in August sought
to cancel their $1.1 billion purchase. 
The companies agreed to the sale in May and Innkeepers won
approval of its reorganization terms in June. The company, in
bankruptcy since July 2010, operates 71 hotels, including
Residence Inns, Marriott hotels and Hampton Inns. 
Cerberus cited a clause in the sale agreement allowing the
buyers to back out if there was an adverse change in the lodging
company&#8217;s business or in the overall economy. 
The lawsuit against Cerberus is Innkeepers USA Trust v.
Cerberus Four Holdings LLC, 11-02557, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The Chapter 11 case
is In re Innkeepers USA Trust, 10-13800, in the same court.

Trials and Appeals 
Mark Hurd Lawyers Appeal Ruling on Unsealing Fisher Letter 
Lawyers for former Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) Chief Executive
Officer Mark Hurd sought to keep secret a letter about his
relationship with contractor Jodie Fisher, contending in
Delaware Supreme Court yesterday that the contents are private. 
In March, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr.
ruled that a copy of the letter, with a few redactions, should
be made public. The order was stayed after Hurd appealed to the
state&#8217;s high court. 
&#8220;The right to public access is non-existent,&#8221; and the
parties have &#8220;a constitutional right to privacy,&#8221; Hurd&#8217;s
lawyer, Rolin P. Bissell, told the justices at a public hearing
in Dover. 
Publicizing the letter will provide &#8220;a full opportunity to
air out&#8221; background details of Hurd&#8217;s departure,&#8217;&#8217; Felipe
Arroyo, a lawyer for shareholder Ernesto Espinoza, told the
panel. 
The letter was sent to Hurd by Fisher&#8217;s lawyer, Gloria Allred, and is part of a Chancery case filed by Espinoza seeking
access to company books and records. The letter contains
accusations of sexual harassment and details of Hurd&#8217;s alleged
advances toward Fisher and her rejection of them, according to
Parsons&#8217;s ruling. 
Hurd is now president of software maker Oracle Corp. (ORCL) He
resigned from Palo Alto, California-based HP in August 2010
after a company investigation determined he violated its
standards of business conduct. HP said it didn&#8217;t find that Hurd
had violated the company&#8217;s sexual-harassment policy. 
Espinoza also wants to see an internal report prepared for
the HP board by lawyers at Covington  Burling LLP as part of
his investigation into possible waste by directors. Parsons on
March 25 denied Espinoza access to the report. 
The Chancery case is Espinoza v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,
CA6000, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). The appeal is Hurd
v. Spinoza, 167, 2001, Delaware Supreme Court (Dover). 
JJ Didn&#8217;t Warn Levaquin Riskier Than Rivals, Lawyer Argues 
A Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) unit never warned users of the Levaquin
antibiotic that it posed a greater risk of tendon damage than
rival medications, a lawyer for two men suing the company said
yesterday. 
Executives of JJ&#8217;s Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceutical
unit sought to protect sales by omitting information about
Levaquin&#8217;s &#8220;comparative risk&#8221;  from its warning label, Andy
Alonso, a lawyer for Paul Gaffney and Robert Beare, said in
closing arguments in the trial of their lawsuits against the
drugmaker. 
The case, in state court in Atlantic City, New Jersey, is
the third over Levaquin tendon injuries to go to trial since
November and the first to be tried in New Jersey state courts.
JJ faces more than 2,600 claims in U.S. courts over the drug,
court dockets show. 
A lawyer for the JJ unit countered that for more than a
decade starting in 1996, Levaquin&#8217;s labels contained repeated
warnings about the risk of tendon injuries associated with the
drug. 
Gaffney&#8217;s and Beare&#8217;s own doctors said &#8220;they were aware&#8221;
of the tendon risk posed by the drug, Christy Jones, one of the
drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers, told jurors in her closing argument
yesterday. 
Levaquin, which generated more than $1 billion in sales
over an eight-year period starting in 2000, was JJ&#8217;s third-
largest selling product at one point. In 2008, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration required all makers of antibiotics in
Levaquin&#8217;s class to beef up warnings about tendon ruptures. 
Regulators required the upgraded warnings after finding
that the antibiotics increased the risk of tendon ruptures to
three to four times that of the general population, FDA
officials said. 
Lawyers for a Minnesota man relied on the FDA&#8217;s push for
stronger warnings on the class of antibiotics that included
Levaquin to convince a federal court jury in December 2010 to
award him a total of $1.8 million in damages over tendon damage
he blamed on the drug. A separate jury in June rejected another
former Levaquin user&#8217;s claim for damages over his Achilles-
tendon injury. 
The case is Beare v. Johnson  Johnson, L-196-10-MT,
Superior Court of New Jersey for Atlantic County (Atlantic
City). 
Strip Searches of Newly Arrested Questioned by High Court 
The U.S. Supreme Court questioned whether jails can
constitutionally search the private body parts of all new
prisoners, including those arrested for traffic violations. 
During an hourlong argument full of graphic descriptions of
jailhouse strip-search protocols, the justices yesterday sought
to draw a line that would both prevent the smuggling of weapons
and drugs and protect the privacy interests of people arrested
for minor violations. 
Several justices questioned whether jails needed to strip-
search people charged with nonviolent offenses, pointing to
studies indicating that intrusive searches of such people rarely
uncover hidden items. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to find somebody who really was in this
minor offender category who really was found to have
contraband,&#8221; Justice Stephen Breyer said. 
In the case before the justices, Albert W. Florence says he
was strip-searched twice during the week he was jailed following
his arrest for failing to pay an old fine -- a penalty that he
had already paid. Florence is suing officials from two New
Jersey counties -- Burlington and Essex -- over the searches. 
Federal appeals courts around the country are divided on
the issue, which turns on the Constitution&#8217;s Fourth Amendment. A
Philadelphia-based federal appeals court said the counties&#8217;
policies were reasonable ways to prevent prisoners from
smuggling in weapons and drugs. 
Both sides in the case yesterday sought to narrow the
issues before the court. The lawyer for the two counties, Carter Phillips, said jail officials might be barred from touching
inmates during a search. 
Florence&#8217;s lawyer, Thomas Goldstein, allowed that jails
could perform body-cavity inspections on certain categories of
inmates, such as those charged with violent offenses. He also
said all new inmates could be required to strip naked and shower
in front of guards, as long as officials stopped short of a
close-range search of a prisoner&#8217;s genitals and anus. 
That distinction was lost on Justice Sonia Sotomayor. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s OK to stand five feet away, but not two?&#8221; she
asked. She added, &#8220;That&#8217;s a line that doesn&#8217;t make much sense
to me.&#8221; 
The Obama administration argued alongside the counties,
urging the court to give jail officials broad latitude. Nicole
Saharsky, a Justice Department lawyer, said federal jail
officials don&#8217;t have enough information to decide whether a
particular inmate needs to be searched. 
The case is Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the
County of Burlington, New Jersey, 10-945, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington).

Verdicts, Settlements and Sentences 
Microsoft Award to Alcatel-Lucent May Be Lowered, Judge Says 
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) shouldn&#8217;t have to pay $70 million to
Alcatel-Lucent for patent infringement and the jury award may be
lowered to $26.3 million, a federal judge said. 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff in San Diego said at a
hearing yesterday that she will review more legal arguments
before issuing a ruling. Huff said she agreed with the world&#8217;s
largest software maker that the jury&#8217;s July 29 award wasn&#8217;t
supported by evidence presented during a 10-day trial. 
The judge said $26.3 million is &#8220;a fair damages figure
that is not excessive based on the totality of the evidence.&#8221;
She asked lawyers on both sides to file additional legal
arguments on her finding by the&#160;end of the month before she
makes her decision final. 
The jury found that an Alcatel-Lucent patent was infringed
by Microsoft in versions of its Outlook program and two other
applications. Microsoft asked the judge to reduce the award to
no more than $5 million. 
A different jury in San Diego in 2008 found that Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded
$358 million in damages. An appeals court, upholding the
infringement verdict, overturned the damages award, finding the
calculation lacked sufficient evidentiary support. The case was
sent back for retrial on damages only. 
The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., 07-
cv-2000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(San Diego). 
Bayer Settles With Onyx Over Regorafenib Cancer Treatment 
Bayer AG (BAYN) settled a lawsuit with Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX)
over the promotion and sale of regorafenib, a cancer treatment.
Under the agreement reached Tuesday, Bayer will pay Onyx a 20
percent royalty on worldwide sales of regorafenib for use in
oncology, South San Francisco-based Onyx said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer also will pay
Onyx $160 million for the Japanese royalty rights for Nexavar, a
liver-cancer treatment, according to the filing. 
Regorafenib hasn&#8217;t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration or the European Medicines Agency, according to
the statement. Nexavar is approved in the U.S. 
The case is Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Bayer Corp.,
09-2145, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). 
Kimelman Gets 2 1/2 Years on Eve of Rajaratnam Sentencing 
Michael Kimelman, the Incremental Capital LLC co-founder,
yesterday was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for insider
trading. Kimelman was found guilty in June with Zvi Goffer, a
former Galleon employee, and his brother, Emanuel Goffer, in a
scheme to bribe two lawyers at Boston-based Ropes  Gray LLP for
secret information about transactions involving 3Com Corp.,
Axcan Pharma Inc., Kronos Inc. and Hilton Hotels Corp. 
&#8220;I was made aware when I went to trial that I could be
convicted,&#8221; Kimelman told U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan.
&#8220;Now that has happened, I am ready to pay the price and face
the consequences of my decision.&#8221; 
Sullivan yesterday also ordered Kimelman to forfeit
$289,000, the amount prosecutors said he made from the scheme.
In September, Sullivan gave Zvi Goffer 10 years in prison, and
last week he sentenced Emanuel Goffer to three years. 
Kimelman has continued to claim he is innocent and intends
to appeal the conviction. Last week Sullivan denied his requests
for acquittal or for a new trial. 
Kimelman&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Sommer, asked Sullivan for
leniency, arguing that his client never used a prepaid cell
phone to evade detection, as others in the ring did. Kimelman
never took or gave any bribes, wasn&#8217;t a leader of the scheme and
didn&#8217;t pass any tips to others, Sommer said. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Tarlowe urged Sullivan to
sentence Kimelman within the advisory federal guideline range of
33 months to 41 months. He said Kimelman created a phony paper
trail to disguise the insider trades. 
Sullivan said he was influenced in his decision to sentence
Kimelman below the guideline range by the more than 100 letters
he received from Kimelman&#8217;s friends and family. 
The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Rajaratnam Shouldn&#8217;t Get Bail After Sentencing, U.S. Says 
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam shouldn&#8217;t be
granted bail pending appeal after he&#8217;s sentenced today for
insider trading, prosecutors said, because he has millions of
dollars and could flee the U.S. 
Federal prosecutors said that Rajaratnam has failed to
prove that he isn&#8217;t a flight risk and hasn&#8217;t refuted their
argument that he has substantial ties outside the U.S.,
including in Sri Lanka where he was born, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. Rajaratnam, who is a
naturalized U.S. citizen, also retains his Sri Lankan
citizenship. 
While the government has said it opposes bail pending
appeal, prosecutors also said yesterday they have told his
lawyers they won&#8217;t object if Rajaratnam surrenders shortly after
his sentencing and goes directly to the facility designated by
the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Prosecutors said prison authorities
indicated it will take 21 days for them to process his
designation to a federal prison. 
&#8216;Should Rajaratnam flee to Sri Lanka or elsewhere, he would
have access to tens of millions of dollars by the mere touch of
a keystroke and thus could use that money to live abroad,&#8217;&#8217;
wrote assistant U.S. attorneys Jonathan Streeter, Reed Brodsky
and Andrew Michaelson. 
Prosecutors, saying he made $72 million from his crimes,
have asked for a prison term of 19 years and seven months to 24
1/2 years, which Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers called &#8220;grotesquely
severe.&#8221; Defense lawyers said that he only made $7.4 million
from the trades. 
John Dowd, a lawyer for Rajaratnam, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the government&#8217;s
filing. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

New Suits 
Visa, Mastercard Accused of Price Fixing by ATM Operators 
Visa Inc. (V) and Mastercard Inc. (MA), the world&#8217;s biggest payment
networks, were sued by a trade group representing operators of
automated teller machines over claims the card companies fix
prices and suppress competition between ATM networks. 
The companies, in a lawsuit filed yesterday in federal
court in Washington, are accused of &#8220;eliminating or severely
restricting independent decision-making&#8221; among ATM operators by
establishing a uniform agreement with almost every card-issuing
U.S. bank to &#8220;fix&#8221; ATM access fees. 
The allegations were made by the National ATM Council Inc.,
a trade group based in Jacksonville, Florida, and 13 operators
of ATMs in nine states. 
&#8220;The ATM restraints prevent ATM operators from offering
their customers a discount or benefit for completing a
transaction over a network that is less costly to the ATM
operator, so consumers cannot be rewarded for using a lower cost
and more efficient network,&#8221; the lawsuit states. 
James Issokson, a spokesman for Mastercard, based in
Purchase, New York, declined to comment, saying the company had
not been served with the lawsuit. Will Valentine, a spokesman
for San Francisco-based Visa, declined to comment on the
lawsuit. 
The case is National ATM Council v. Visa Inc., 11-1803,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
MassMutual, John Hancock Sued Over Madoff Investment 
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and John Hancock
Life Insurance Co. USA were sued by a limited-liability company
that said they lost millions of the company&#8217;s dollars to Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. 
SSR II LLC bought variable life insurance policies from
John Hancock and Security Life of Denver Insurance Co. Through
the investment-account component of the policies, SSR invested
$13 million in a Tremont Group Holdings Inc. fund, according to
a lawsuit filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. 
The fund, through its fund-of-funds structure, allocated 22
percent of its assets to other funds, substantially all of which
went to Madoff, according to the complaint. MassMutual and other
defendants &#8220;maintained significant influence and/or control
over and provided substantial assistance to&#8221; various Tremont
entities, SSR said. 
&#8220;Rather than managing a portfolio of underlying
securities, however, defendants funneled over one-fifth of
plaintiff&#8217;s investment to Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, where those
funds were dissipated,&#8221; SSR II said. 
Representatives of Boston-based John Hancock, MassMutual
and Security Life of Denver couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment
after normal business hours. 
The case is SSR II LLC v. John Hancock Life Insurance Co.,
652793-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). 
Transocean Sued by U.S. Agency Over Gulf-Rig Blast Subpoenas 
The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board has
sued a Transocean Ltd. (RIG) unit for its allegedly inadequate
response to requests for information related to the April 2010
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig in the Gulf of
Mexico. 
Transocean Deepwater Drilling didn&#8217;t fully comply with &#8220;38
of 39 specific demands&#8221; in five subpoenas issued between Nov.
24, 2010, and April 7, 2011, Donald Holmstrom, an investigator
for the agency said in a sworn statement filed yesterday in
Houston federal court. The board is seeking to force the
drilling contractor to comply with its requests. 
The Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank while drilling a
well for BP Plc (BP/) off the Louisiana coast, killing 11 workers and
causing the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. The board
has been investigating the incident since June 2010. 
&#8220;Transocean&#8217;s ongoing failure to provide information has
impeded and delayed the CSB&#8217;s critical safety inquiry,&#8221;
Holmstrom said. 
Transocean &#8220;produced a number of responsive documents&#8221;
under subpoenas issued by the board between July and August
2010, Holmstrom said. When the agency sought additional
documents and answers to &#8220;11 specific interrogatories,&#8221;
Transocean either refused to respond or provided an insufficient
response, he said. 
Lou Colasuonno, a spokesman for Vernier, Switzerland-based
Transocean, said the company&#8217;s lawyers advised the CSB in July
of its position that the Deepwater Horizon investigation should
be left to the U.S. Coast Guard. 
&#8220;The Chemical Safety Board has no jurisdiction over marine
spills,&#8221; Colasuonno said in a phone interview. 
Holmstrom said the information is &#8220;critical&#8221; to the
board&#8217;s analysis of the blast. 
The case is U.S. v. Transocean Deepwater Drilling Inc.,
4:11-cv-3638, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston).

Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s patent-infringement
jury award against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may be lowered to $26.3
million from $70 million, a federal judge said. 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff in San Diego said at a
hearing yesterday that she will review more legal arguments
before issuing a ruling. Huff said she agreed with the world&#8217;s
largest software maker that the jury&#8217;s July 29 award wasn&#8217;t
supported by evidence presented during a 10-day trial. 
The judge said she disagreed with how an expert witness for
Alcatel-Lucent calculated damages and told lawyers $26.3 million
is &#8220;a fair damages figure that is not excessive based on the
totality of the evidence.&#8221; She asked attorneys on both sides to
file additional legal arguments on her finding by the&#160;end of the
month before she makes her decision final. 
The infringed patent relates to technology used in
Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook program and two other applications.
Microsoft asked the judge to reduce the award to no more than $5
million. 
Microsoft attorney Roger Denning told the judge that
Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s formula for computing damages didn&#8217;t comply
with guidelines set by Huff and appellate court rulings. 
&#8220;Those went ignored,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lucent put its head down
and bullied through with its $70 million figure ignoring the
guidance that was given.&#8221; 
Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s lawyers argued there was more than
sufficient evidence to support the jury&#8217;s verdict and that the
verdict should be respected. 
&#8216;High&#8217; Standard 
&#8220;If the court is going to take the judgment out of the
jury&#8217;s hands the standard is extraordinarily high,&#8221; said
company attorney Luke Dauchot. 
Lawyers for Alcatel-Lucent also asked Huff to award $38.3
million in prejudgment interest on top of the jury&#8217;s $70 million
award. Alcatel-Lucent, France&#8217;s largest maker of
telecommunications equipment, also has been awarded $450,479 in
trial costs. 
The technology at issue, called the &#8220;Day patent,&#8221; was
described in court during the trial as involving a touch-screen
form entry. Microsoft argued the patent relates to a simple
&#8220;date-picker&#8221; function and has nothing to do with e-mail, the
most popular function on Outlook. Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent
described the technology as a tool that &#8220;plays a central role
in the entire operation&#8221; of Outlook. 
Infringement 
A different jury in San Diego in 2008 found that Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded
$358 million in damages. An appeals court, upholding the
infringement verdict, overturned the damages award, finding the
calculation lacked sufficient evidentiary support. The case was
sent back for retrial on damages only. 
The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., 07-
cv-02000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(San Diego). 
Alcatel-Lucent today rose as much as 11 percent to 2.31
euros in Paris trading after the Financial Times reported,
without saying how it got the information, that the company
agreed to sell its corporate call-center business. Alcatel-
Lucent spokesman Simon Poulter declined to comment.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), which rose to a record today, may keep climbing to $200
or more, according to analysts who are boosting their price
targets for the stock. 
Eight of the 19 analysts with price targets surveyed by
Bloomberg estimate IBM will rise to at least $200, 7.1 percent
above yesterday&#8217;s close, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Three analysts increased their price targets to $200
or more this week, ahead of IBM&#8217;s Oct. 17 earnings announcement,
and Macquarie Capital began coverage with a $210 target today. 
&#8220;IBM&#8217;s high recurring revenue business model has
&#8216;Goldilocks&#8217; characteristics, allowing IBM to perform well in a
good or bad macro environment,&#8221; said Louis Miscioscia, an
analyst for Collins Stewart, who raised his price target to $210
today and has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. 
Under Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 60, IBM sold
off its personal computer business and focused on software and
services, helping lift per-share profit for more than 30
straight quarters. Now the world&#8217;s largest computer-services
provider, IBM has gained more than 80 percent since Palmisano
took over, including 30 percent this year. 
Investors have been drawn by &#8220;a very stable earnings
stream,&#8221; said David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus  Co., who has
price target of $210 for IBM. &#8220;If revenues start to come under
pressure for economic reasons, there are several levers at their
disposal that they can exercise to support earnings
expectations.&#8221; 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 2 percent to $190.53
at the close in New York.

Zijin Mining Group Co. has sold
bonds convertible into shares of Glencore International Plc, the
world&#8217;s largest publicly traded commodities supplier, according
to three people familiar with the matter. 
The bonds were sold at 128.25 percent of face value, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
process was private. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managed the sale,
according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. 
Zijin Mining, China&#8217;s biggest gold miner by market value,
acquired the bonds ahead of Glencore&#8217;s May initial public
offering, which ended its more than three decades as a closely
held partnership. Glencore, which sold $10 billion of shares in
the biggest IPO this year, has dropped 20 percent since going
public. 
In December 2009 Glencore had sold $2.2 billion of
convertible 5 percent bonds, its first such offering, saying the
debt could be exchanged for shares in the event of an IPO. Zijin
Mining invested in those bonds together with BlackRock Inc. (BLK),
Government of Singapore Investment Corp. and First Reserve Corp. 
Zijin was offering the $175 million of December 2014 bonds
at 128.25 percent to 130.25 percent of face value, plus accrued
interest, according to the term sheet. 
First Reserve, a private equity firm, sold $800 million of
the bonds last month at $135,313.89 for each $100,000 of
principal amount, and used the proceeds to buy Glencore common
stock. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Morgan Stanley managed First
Reserve&#8217;s transaction. 
A call made to the Zijin&#8217;s office outside of regular
business hours wasn&#8217;t answered. Simon Buerk, a spokesman for
Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore, declined to comment. 
Glencore dropped 3 percent to 422.5 pence at the close of
London trading, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 2.8
percent.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
No 2. U.S. mall owner, sold Faneuil Hall Marketplace, a shopping
and dining complex in Boston, for $140 million. 
The transaction was one of three sales of &#8220;non-core&#8221;
assets completed in the last three months, the Chicago-based
company said in a statement today. General Growth also sold the
office and garage components of Westlake Center in Seattle for
$119 million and Riverside Plaza, a strip shopping center in
Provo, Utah, for $21 million. The buyers weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
&#8220;We continue to execute our investment strategy of
focusing on our regional mall portfolio,&#8221;&#160;Shobi Khan, General
Growth&#8217;s chief operating officer, said in the statement. &#8220;These
recent dispositions strengthen our balance sheet.&#8221; 
The deals helped the company eliminate $95 million of
mortgage-related debt associated with the properties, according
to the statement. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, is the second biggest U.S. shopping mall owner after
Simon Property Group Inc. In August, General Growth said it
would spin off 30 malls to shareholders through a special
dividend and that they would be transferred to a new publicly
traded real estate investment trust, Rouse Properties Inc.

British consumers will spend 19.3
billion pounds ($30.5 billion) by 2021 on purchases using their
mobile phones as technology advances and more people have
smartphones, Barclays Corporate estimated. 
The figure will rise from 1.3 billion pounds now,
encouraged by systems such as Near Field Communications and
faster mobile data transmission, Barclays Corporate, a unit of
London-based banking group Barclays Plc (BARC), said in a report. Food
and groceries are the biggest category, with mobile sales of
almost 300 million pounds this year, according to the report. 
&#8220;With little new shop space coming into play, the real
growth opportunities lie on the virtual high street,&#8221; Richard
Lowe, Head of Retail and Wholesale at Barclays Corporate, said
in the statement. &#8220;Those retailers which are prepared to invest
will be at a significant advantage to the competition.&#8221; 
Mobile commerce will grow by 55 percent over the next five
years, according to Barclays. It said just over half of shoppers
already use their mobiles at some stage of purchasing. 
Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) and other wireless operators said in
June they had agreed to create a common platform for mobile
payment systems to speed up the development of additional
services in the U.K. 
Vodafone, Telefonica SA (TEF), and Everything Everywhere, the
partnership between France Telecom SA (FTE) and Deutsche Telekom AG,
will form a joint venture to help banks and advertisers access
the service, which will let people buy items from groceries to
clothes with a swipe of their smartphone, they said at the time.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, reported third-
quarter sales that missed analysts&#8217; estimates on slowing revenue
growth at its software, hardware and services businesses. 
Sales climbed 7.8 percent to $26.2 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. Analysts predicted
$26.3 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is focusing on areas
such as business analytics, emerging markets and cloud computing
to boost sales amid sluggish economic expansion. The U.S.
economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter
following a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months, the
weakest performance in two years. 
&#8220;Because they didn&#8217;t beat, the stock&#8217;s going to trade
down; the expectation is pretty high for this name,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. A slowdown in
hardware revenue growth is occurring &#8220;sooner than I expected.&#8221; 
It was the second time in nine quarters that IBM missed
sales estimates. Hardware sales growth slowed to 4 percent from
17 percent in the second quarter. Sales growth at IBM&#8217;s services
business slowed to 8 percent from 10 percent, while revenue
expansion at its software unit decelerated to 13 percent from 17
percent. 
Record Last Week 
IBM fell as much as 4.1 percent to $179.02 in extended
trading after closing at $186.59 in New York today. It has risen
27 percent this year as of the close of regular trading. 
The stock reached a record of $190.53 on Oct. 14, and at
least three analysts revised their price estimates to $200 a
share or higher. In September, IBM passed Microsoft in market
value based on closing prices for the first time since 1996
before the companies switched back. 
&#8220;This is a name that you&#8217;re expecting in this environment
to perform very strong,&#8221; said Brad Zelnick, a Macquarie Capital
USA analyst who added coverage of IBM last week. &#8220;Any
deceleration in signings or any significant drain on backlog is
going to send shares down.&#8221; 
Contract signings for services, which make up about 60
percent of IBM revenue, were $12.3 billion, compared with $14.3
billion in the second quarter. 
Projects Software 
The company projects software will make up half of total
profit in 2015. Analytics software, which helps businesses
predict trends, is expected to draw $16 billion in sales by
2015, while cloud computing will draw $7 billion. 
Smarter Planet, Palmisano&#8217;s initiative to provide digital
monitoring of anything from roads to hospitals to make them more
efficient, will grow to a $10 billion business, the company has
said. 
Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, climbed 19 percent last quarter. Sales from the regions
will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the company
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. 
&#8220;Growth market performance was terrific across all
segments,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
call with analysts and investors. 
It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth
in these markets, and it led revenue growth in all business
segments, Loughridge said. IBM opened up 80 new branches, he
said. 
&#8216;Footprint&#8217; Important 
&#8220;They&#8217;re very ahead of where the big markets will be in a
few years, and it&#8217;s very important for them to have a footprint
there,&#8221; Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities
USA, said in an interview. He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
the shares. 
Palmisano has said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions between 2010 and 2015. So far the company has spent
about $3 billion in acquisitions related to cloud computing,
said Steven Tomasco, an IBM spokesman. 
Because of IBM&#8217;s global position and broad set of computer
services, it is &#8220;about as close as you can get to a technology
index fund,&#8221; Maguire said. &#8220;They&#8217;re a bellwether for the rest
of the market.&#8221; 
Accenture Plc and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which compete with IBM in
selling services to technology companies, both benefited from
increased spending by business clients in their most recent
quarters.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, refinanced $966 million of
adjustable-rate mortgages on four properties into fixed-rate
loans with an average term of 9.1 years. 
The real estate investment trust&#8217;s share of the new loans
totals $483 million after adjusting for the company&#8217;s ownership
in the shopping malls, Chicago-based General Growth said today
in a statement. The refinancings lowered the interest rate to an
average 4.63 percent from 5.66 percent on the prior maturing
mortgages. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, has been refinancing debt to lower expenses and plans
to redevelop, expand and refurbish malls to boost growth. The
new loans meet the company&#8217;s financing plans for this year,
according to the statement. 
&#8220;We have accomplished our 2011 goals and are now focused
on 2012 financing opportunities,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Sandeep Mathrani said in the statement. 
The newly refinanced malls are Natick Mall in Natick,
Massachusetts; Galleria at Tyler, in Riverside, California;
First Colony Mall in Sugar Land, Texas; and Northbrook Court in
Northbrook, Illinois. 
General Growth has ownership and management interest in 166
malls in 43 states, totaling 169 million square feet (15.7
million square meters), the company said in the statement. It is
second in size to Simon Property Group Inc., based in
Indianapolis.

General Electric Co. (GE) plans to build
a mining equipment plant in Texas and upgrade a factory in
Pennsylvania, adding 490 workers. 
The projects are part of the GE transportation business&#8217;s
expansion into mining equipment as it branches out from
locomotives, which use similar technology, Lorenzo Simonelli,
the unit&#8217;s chief, said in a telephone interview. 
The expansion &#8220;gives us more scale in mining,&#8221; Simonelli
said. 
Demand for such equipment is growing worldwide as emerging
markets seek more raw materials such as rare earths and copper
for infrastructure. Copper prices have more than doubled since
the end of 2008 as demand climbed in China, the world&#8217;s biggest
metals user. 
The Texas plant, to be located near a Fort Worth locomotive
factory announced in May, will build motorized wheels for off-
highway vehicles, GE said in the statement. The $95 million site
will employ about 130 workers, GE Transportation said. 
About 360 employees will be hired in Erie, Pennsylvania,
including 160 production workers to meet higher demand for
mining equipment, GE said. The company will invest about $136
million in upgrading the plant, which is more than 100 years
old, to boost capacity, add research and testing technology and
install a customer showcase center. 
About $22 million of the Erie upgrades is related to mining
equipment production, GE said. Mining has also been a focus for
the Fairfield, Connecticut-based parent company&#8217;s energy
business, which has invested in oil-and-gas acquisitions.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, posted an 8.1 percent increase in third-
quarter profit after boosting global sales volumes and raising
retail pricing in North America. 
Net income advanced to $2.22 billion, or 95 cents a share,
from $2.06 billion, or 88 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Excluding some items,
profit was $1.03 a share, topping the $1.02 average of 13
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has built new plants in
emerging markets and pushed more profitable package sizes
overseas, helping boost global case volume sales 5 percent in
the quarter. Coca-Cola also raised pricing 2 percent to
retailers in North America, its largest market. 
&#8220;They are still growing in terms of volume, and that&#8217;s
what you want to see,&#8221; Chris Shanahan, a San Antonio-based
analyst at Frost  Sullivan, said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;They are able to maintain organic growth.&#8221; 
Coca-Cola fell 0.4 percent to $66.74 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 1.5 percent this year, while rival
PepsiCo Inc. has decreased 4.5 percent. 
Third-quarter revenue rose 45 percent to $12.2 billion,
helped by the Coca-Cola&#8217;s purchase of its largest bottler last
year. The average estimate of 10 analysts was $12 billion. 
International Sales 
Sales volumes gained 7 percent in Latin America, 6 percent
in the company&#8217;s Eurasia and Africa region and 5 percent in
North American and its Pacific units. The gains were the result
of investments made throughout several years, Kent said today in
an interview. 
&#8220;You have to take a long-term approach to investments and
a shorter term approach to execution,&#8221; said Kent, who last
month announced a plan to spend $3 billion in Russia in the next
five years to develop Coca-Cola&#8217;s brands. 
Coca-Cola said today it plans to buy back as much as $3
billion of its shares this year, up from its previous target of
at least $2.5 billion. The company said today it has repurchased
$2.2 billion shares so far this year. 
Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said today on a
conference call that the company&#8217;s commodity costs will jump
$800 million this year from 2010, more than the $700 million
Coca-Cola previously estimated. The increase is driven by higher
costs for corn syrup used as a sweetener and petroleum-based
plastic for bottles and packaging. 
Coca-Cola said in July it would boost North American
pricing as much as 4 percent in the second half of the year to
offset higher commodity costs.

down; the expectation is pretty high for this name,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. A slowdown in
hardware revenue growth is occurring &#8220;sooner than I expected.&#8221; 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is focusing on areas
such as business analytics, emerging markets and cloud computing
to boost sales amid sluggish economic expansion. The U.S.
economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter
following a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months, the
weakest performance in two years. 
Slowing Growth 
Declines in Japan and the public sector weighed on the
performance of IBM&#8217;s services business, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. IBM has more exposure
to Japan than competitors, David Grossman, an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus in San Francisco, said in a note to investors. 
Sales growth at IBM&#8217;s services unit slowed to 8 percent
from 10 percent in the second quarter, while revenue expansion
at its software unit decelerated to 13 percent from 17 percent.
Hardware sales growth slowed to 4 percent from 17 percent. 
IBM shares have risen 22 percent this year. The stock
reached a record of $190.53 on Oct. 14, and at least three
analysts revised their price estimates to $200 a share or higher
that week. In September, IBM passed Microsoft Corp. in market
value based on closing prices for the first time since 1996
before the companies switched back. 
&#8220;This is a name that you&#8217;re expecting in this environment
to perform very strong,&#8221; said Brad Zelnick, a Macquarie Capital
USA analyst who added coverage of IBM last week. &#8220;Any
deceleration in signings or any significant drain on backlog is
going to send shares down.&#8221; 
Analysts at BMO Capital Markets and FBN Securities reduced
their ratings for IBM shares after the earnings report. 
Backlog Shrinking 
Contract signings for services, which make up about
60 percent of IBM revenue, were $12.3 billion, compared with
$11 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average estimated
$12.5 billion, UBS AG said in a note to investors. 
Backlog, which measures expected future revenue
from contracts, shrank to $137 billion in the quarter from
$144 billion in the second quarter, largely because of changes
in currency exchange rates, Loughridge said. 
Third-quarter net income rose 7 percent to $3.84 billion.
Profit on an operating basis rose to $3.28 a share, beating the
$3.22 average analyst estimate. 
Operating earnings will climb to at least $13.35 a share
this year, up from a previous projection of at least $13.25, IBM
said. Analysts predicted $13.33 on average. 
&#8216;Bellwether&#8217; 
Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, climbed 19 percent last quarter. Sales from the regions
will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the company
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. 
&#8220;Growth-market performance was terrific across all
segments,&#8221; Loughridge said. 
It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth
in these markets, and it led revenue growth in all business
segments, Loughridge said. IBM opened up 80 new branches, he
said. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re very ahead of where the big markets will be in a
few years, and it&#8217;s very important for them to have a footprint
there,&#8221; Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities
USA, said in an interview. He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
the shares. 
Palmisano has said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions between 2010 and 2015. So far the company has spent
about $3 billion in acquisitions related to cloud computing,
said Steven Tomasco, an IBM spokesman. 
Because of IBM&#8217;s global position and broad set of computer
services, it is &#8220;about as close as you can get to a technology
index fund,&#8221; Maguire said. &#8220;They&#8217;re a bellwether for the rest
of the market.&#8221; 
Accenture Plc and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which compete with IBM in
selling services to technology companies, both benefited from
increased spending by business clients in their most recent
quarters.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rose 5.5
percent in New York trading as investors looked past a third-
quarter loss and focused on gains in trading revenue and
prospects for a rebound in underwriting and takeovers. 
Revenue from trading stocks and bonds increased 16 percent
from the second quarter and the backlog of investment-banking
assignments climbed, Goldman Sachs said today. The third-quarter
loss, which was driven by markdowns on the value of the firm&#8217;s
own investments, was $393 million, or 84 cents a share, the New
York-based company said in a statement. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
57, has tied Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fortunes to trading, which
accounted for 62 percent of revenue in the first nine months of
2011. After reporting weaker second-quarter revenue than
competitors in that business, Goldman Sachs beat both Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) last quarter, excluding
accounting gains related to the decline of the banks&#8217; own debt. 
&#8220;In the core business there are some encouraging signs,&#8221;
said William Fitzpatrick, a Milwaukee-based financial-services
analyst at Manulife Asset Management, which manages $217 billion
and owns Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;It was the private-equity
business that weighed on results in the quarter.&#8221; 
The shares rose $5.35 to $102.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain in more than
two months, as the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financial Index climbed
5 percent. 
&#8216;Rough Patch&#8217; 
&#8220;Trading wasn&#8217;t as bad as we all thought, and the bigger
losses came from writedowns in their investing and lending
unit,&#8221; Thomas Brown, chief executive officer of Second Curve
Capital LLC, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In
the Loop.&#8221; &#8220;I see Goldman as going through a rough patch in
the environment, but it&#8217;s environment-driven, not Goldman Sachs-
driven.&#8221; 
The third-quarter loss, which compared with a year-earlier
profit of $1.9 billion, was the second time that Goldman Sachs
failed to post a profit since it became a public company in
1999. In both cases the loss was caused by reductions in the
value of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investments in companies, private-
equity funds and loans. 
The firm, which said in July that it planned to cut about
1,000 jobs to reduce annual costs by $1.2 billion, said it
employed 34,200 people at the end of September, down 1,300 from
the end of June. 
Litton Sale 
Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar told analysts on a
conference call today that about 500 of the job cuts in the
quarter related to the effort to cut costs. The other 800 came
from the sale of Litton Loan Servicing LP to Ocwen Financial
Corp., which more than offset the addition of personnel when the
firm gained control of its Australian joint venture, JBWere Ltd. 
Investing and Lending, which includes Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
stakes in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (1398) Ltd. and other
companies, as well as holdings by the Special Situations Group
run by Jason M. Brown, reported negative revenue of $2.48
billion for the quarter. That compared with $1.8 billion in
revenue in the same period a year earlier. 
About $1.05 billion of last quarter&#8217;s negative revenue was
attributed to a drop in the value of ICBC, China&#8217;s biggest
lender, and $1 billion was caused by losses on other equity
securities. The unit also booked $907 in negative revenue from
&#8220;debt securities and loans,&#8221; while gaining $477 from
investments in other entities. 
Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., had
estimated the unit&#8217;s loss would be $1.67 billion, and predicted
the debt securities and loans segment would post $200 million in
revenue. 
Mezzanine Debt 
Most of the writedowns related to spread widening on senior
debt and so-called mezzanine debt, although the segment also
included some distressed loan losses, Viniar said on the call. 
All of the Investing and Lending division&#8217;s losses were
unrealized, meaning they reflected markdowns in asset values and
not actual sales at lower values, Viniar said. He said that
division sold some assets at a profit during the period, which
helped to offset the writedowns. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to think it won&#8217;t rebound,&#8221; Manulife&#8217;s
Fitzpatrick said of the Investing and Lending results. &#8220;I think
it will remain a big part of the business.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs expects Investing and Lending to produce a
return in excess of 10 percent over the long run, Viniar told
analysts. 
&#8220;In any quarter it can be extremely volatile and up or
down a lot more than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our history has been a
lot better than a 10 percent return.&#8221; 
Book Value 
Third-quarter revenue fell 60 percent to $3.59 billion from
$8.9 billion a year earlier and declined 51 percent from $7.28
billion in the second quarter. The company&#8217;s book value per
common share decreased to $131.09 from $131.44 at the end of the
second quarter. 
Overall revenue from trading, run since February 2008 by
Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz, rose 16 percent to $4.06 billion from $3.52 billion
in the second quarter and was down 13 percent from $4.67 billion
in the third quarter of 2010. 
The trading results included about $450 million of so-
called debt valuation adjustments, or DVAs, with about $300
million in fixed-income and about $150 million in equities
trading, Viniar said. U.S. accounting rules require that banks
book losses when the value of their debt rises and gains when it
declines on the theory that a loss, or profit, would be realized
if the bank were to repurchase the debt. 
&#8216;A Little Confused&#8217; 
Like most of its rivals, spreads on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
corporate debt and credit-default swaps widened during the
quarter as investors became more cautious about risk from the
European sovereign debt crisis. Viniar said the wider spreads
make him &#8220;a little confused&#8221; because the firm believes it has
strong capital and liquidity. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s had minimal impact on our business so far,&#8221; Viniar
said in response to a question on the call. &#8220;It might affect us
versus some competitors who might have lower spreads, but we
also compete on execution as well and our execution tends to be
pretty good.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs has about $5 billion in &#8220;plain vanilla
debt&#8221; maturing by the end of the year, Viniar said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to replace it or
we want to wait for a better time.&#8221; 
Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities,
typically the firm&#8217;s biggest source of revenue, dropped 36
percent to $1.73 billion from $2.69 billion a year earlier and
increased from $1.6 billion in the second quarter. 
JPMorgan Chase 
Excluding DVAs the business produced $1.43 billion, which
fell short of the $2.27 billion that Citigroup reported and the
$2.8 billion that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported on the same
basis. 
The company&#8217;s average value-at-risk, a measure of the
amount of money the firm estimates it could lose in a single
day, was little changed during the quarter at $102 million
compared with $101 million in the prior period. Viniar told
analysts that the company&#8217;s value-at-risk, or VaR, climbed at
the end of the quarter as market volatility, one of the
ingredients of VaR, increased. Most of the rise took place in
the firm&#8217;s bets on interest rates, Viniar said. 
&#8220;I would expect, assuming we made no changes to positions
at all, that our VaR would be fairly significantly higher in the
fourth quarter than the third quarter,&#8221; he said. 
Equities trading revenue rose to $2.33 billion from $1.98
billion a year earlier and from $1.92 billion in the second
quarter. Excluding DVAs, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $2.18 billion of
equities trading revenue beat Bank of America, Citigroup and
JPMorgan Chase. 
&#8216;Best Performer&#8217; 
&#8220;They were the best performer of the four so far,&#8221; said
David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in New York who
rates the stock &#8220;outperform.&#8221; 
Investment banking, overseen globally by Richard J. Gnodde,
David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, generated $781 million of
revenue in the third quarter, down from $1.45 billion in the
second quarter and $1.16 billion in the third quarter of last
year. The company ranks No. 1 among advisers on global takeovers
announced this year and also has the top spot among managers of
global equity and equity-linked offerings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
Investment banking&#8217;s relative contribution within the group
has grown this year. The business generated 15 percent of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue in the first nine months of the year, up
from 11 percent in the same period last year. 
Compensation and Benefits 
Compensation and benefits, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest expense,
fell 59 percent to $1.58 billion in the third quarter from $3.83
billion in the same period last year. The amount set aside to
pay employees in the first nine months of the year fell 24
percent to $10 billion, or enough to pay each employee $292,836.
That compares with $13.1 billion in the first nine months of
2010, or enough to pay each of the firm&#8217;s 35,400 employees at
the time $370,700. 
Goldman Sachs lost $2.12 billion, or $4.97 per share, in
the fourth quarter of 2008 after markets plunged following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman Sachs
rebounded to record profit in 2009 as asset values climbed and
the company slashed pay.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
$10 billion to pay employees in this year&#8217;s first nine months,
down 24 percent from the same period last year as revenue slid
and the firm cut jobs. 
The compensation expense, which includes salaries, bonuses,
stock awards and benefits, was equivalent to $292,836 for each
of the company&#8217;s 34,200 workers as of Sept. 30. A year earlier
Goldman Sachs employed 35,400 people, who shared about $13.1
billion, or $370,706 each, for the nine-month period. 
Goldman Sachs is among firms that have been targeted by
lower Manhattan protests, called Occupy Wall Street, that seek
to call attention to the income disparity between the wealthiest
1 percent of the population and everyone else. Related
demonstrations took place on four continents over the weekend.
Sixty-seven percent of New York City voters support the
movement, according to a Quinnipiac University survey yesterday. 
Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record for a
securities firm before converting to a bank in response to the
financial crisis, may cut compensation for the second year in a
row as declining markets sap trading revenue. After setting
aside 39 percent of revenue for compensation in 2010, the
company has allocated 44 percent of revenue for pay and benefits
so far this year. Revenue for this year&#8217;s first nine months fell
25 percent $22.8 billion. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported last week that it reduced its investment bank&#8217;s
workforce by almost 4 percent in the third quarter and cut
employee compensation costs 28 percent. The investment bank&#8217;s
compensation expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and
benefits, was enough to give each of the division&#8217;s employees
$289,611 for the nine-month period. 
The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
yesterday reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years, sold
$500 million of 50-year unsecured bonds in a transaction aimed
at individual investors. 
Goldman Sachs sold the debt in increments of $25 at a yield
of 6.5 percent after doubling the size of the offering,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based firm
has the option to redeem the bonds at par after five years,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
The transaction was the second Goldman Sachs has targeted
at individual investors, allowing the firm to diversify its
sources of capital while locking in &#8220;attractive&#8221; borrowing
costs, said James Leonard, a credit analyst at Morningstar Inc.
in Chicago. Goldman Sachs issued $1.3 billion of 6.125 percent
notes with a similar structure a year ago, Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a great deal for Goldman,&#8221; Leonard said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re sitting in a win-win situation,
because if interest rates stay low they can call them, but if
rates go up they&#8217;ve got 50 years of funding.&#8221; 
Leonard said he wouldn&#8217;t recommend individual investors buy
the notes because of the difficulty of valuing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
option to redeem them after 2016. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s third-quarter loss of $393 million, or 84
cents per share, compared with a profit of $1.9 billion, or
$2.98, a year earlier, the company said yesterday in a
statement. 
Credit Swaps Fall 
The cost to protect Goldman Sachs&#8217;s debt for five years
using credit-default swaps fell 24 basis points to 321 basis
points, according to London-based data provider CMA. It reached
410 basis points on Oct. 4, the highest since October 2008. 
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses
on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline
as investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. 
&#8216;Confused and Disappointed&#8217; 
David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told
analysts on a conference call yesterday that a widening of the
firm&#8217;s credit spreads over the last six weeks has had a
&#8220;minimal&#8221; impact on its business. He said the firm, which
yesterday reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years as a
public company, has about $5 billion of debt maturing by year
end and &#8220;we&#8217;ll decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to
replace it or we want to wait for a better time.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs executives have been &#8220;confused and
disappointed&#8221; by the rising prices on the firm&#8217;s credit-default
swaps, Viniar said, which investors use to hedge against losses
on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on its creditworthiness. 
&#8220;Given how strong our capital is, our liquidity is, the
maturity of our funding, the balance sheet, we kind of scratch
our heads a little bit,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;But it really hasn&#8217;t
affected anything other than our emotions. We don&#8217;t like seeing
it but it hasn&#8217;t had a big effect.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs fell 1.5 percent to $100.79 in New York after
reaching $102.25 yesterday, the highest since Sept. 20.

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest brokerage, reported profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates
on a $3.4 billion accounting gain and higher revenue from stock
trading. 
Net income was $2.2 billion, or $1.15 a share, compared
with $131 million, or a loss of 7 cents a share after preferred
dividends, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today
in a statement. Earnings beat the 30-cent average estimate of 25
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 20 percent gain in year-over-year
equities-trading revenue was the biggest among the largest U.S.
banks, excluding the accounting benefit. Fixed-income fell 17
percent. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, is trying to
stem a 39 percent decline in the firm&#8217;s shares this year through
yesterday that left the stock trading at a level last seen
during the financial crisis in January 2009. 
&#8220;We saw more activity on the cash equities side,
particularly in electronic trading, and the derivatives business
continued to do well,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said
in an interview after earnings were released. &#8220;The more
challenging part of the market was in the fixed-income market.&#8221; 
Excluding the $3.4 billion accounting gain, known as debt
valuation adjustments, or DVA, profit was 3 cents a share,
compared with estimates of a 9-cent loss from Citigroup Inc.
analyst Keith Horowitz and a 23-cent loss from Barclays
Capital&#8217;s Roger Freeman. 
Share Performance 
Shares of the company rose 1 cent to $16.64 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York, after surging 9.1 percent yesterday. 
The DVA gain stems from declines in the value of the
company&#8217;s debt, under the theory that a profit would be realized
if the debt were repurchased at a discount. Citigroup and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. each booked more than $1.5 billion of such
gains as bank credit spreads widened in the quarter. 
&#8220;It is a bizarre accounting anomaly,&#8221; Gorman said in an
interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Next
quarter, we may have $3.4 billion of negative adjustments.&#8221; 
Revenue at Morgan Stanley climbed 46 percent to $9.89
billion from $6.78 billion a year earlier. Book value per share
rose to $31.29 from $30.17 at the end of June. The firm&#8217;s return
on equity from continuing operations, a measure of how well it
reinvests earnings, was 14.5 percent. 
Fixed Income 
Trading revenue at five of the largest U.S. banks dropped
by a combined 32 percent from the second quarter and was less
than half that of the first quarter, excluding DVA. Morgan
Stanley is &#8220;constantly reassessing&#8221; whether the current
environment represents a cyclical or secular change, Gorman said
on the conference call. 
&#8220;Over the next several months, it will become clearer
which of the businesses that use a lot of balance sheet and take
on a lot of risk can be expected to generate the kind of return
that shareholders need,&#8221; Gorman said in the Bloomberg
Television interview. 
Third-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading,
which is run by Ken deRegt along with commodity trading co-heads
Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, was $3.88 billion. Excluding
DVA, fixed-income revenue was about $1.1 billion, down from $1.9
billion in the second quarter and $1.31 billion in the third
quarter of 2010. The figure compared with $2.8 billion at
JPMorgan, $2.27 billion at Citigroup and $1.43 billion at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Foreign Exchange 
Interest-rates trading revenue increased from the second
quarter, and the firm saw share gains in foreign-exchange
trading, Porat said on a conference call with analysts. Credit
trading suffered from &#8220;illiquidity&#8221; in the corporate credit
and mortgage markets, she said. 
Losses from hedges tied to monoline insurers reduced fixed-
income trading revenue by $284 million, Porat said. The bank
booked about $400 million of writedowns in corporate lending in
its revenue line labeled &#8220;other sales and trading,&#8221; said Mark Lake, a company spokesman. 
In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
third-quarter revenue was $1.96 billion. Excluding DVA, revenue
fell 26 percent from the second quarter to $1.34 billion. That
compared with $2.18 billion at Goldman Sachs and $289 million at
Citigroup. 
Morgan Stanley generated $864 million in third-quarter
revenue from investment banking, which is overseen by Paul J. Taubman. That figure, down 14 percent from a year earlier,
included $413 million from financial advisory, $239 million from
equity underwriting and $212 million from debt underwriting. 
Expense Control 
&#8220;Core trading and investment-banking revenue held up
better than our muted estimates while expense control was
good,&#8221; Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy 
Investment Group Inc., said today in a note to clients. 
Global wealth management, overseen by Greg Fleming, posted
pretax income of $362 million, up from $281 million in the third
quarter of 2010. It also had $15.5 billion in net new assets.
The division&#8217;s pretax profit margin rose to 11 percent from 10
percent in the first half. Gorman has said the unit should
eventually post a pretax profit margin of more than 20 percent. 
Asset management reported a pretax loss of $117 million,
compared with profit of $279 million in the previous year&#8217;s
period. 
Compensation and benefits were unchanged from the year-
earlier quarter at $3.68 billion, or 37 percent of the firm&#8217;s
overall revenue. The ratio was lower than in the third quarter
of 2010, when the bank set aside 54 percent of revenue. 
Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for annual savings
from an initiative to trim expenses to $1.4 billion, from $1
billion when the three-year project was announced in May. 
Share Volatility 
The firm&#8217;s shares fell 41 percent in the third quarter. The
stock dropped further in the first week of October to $11.58,
the lowest since December 2008. 
The volatility prompted Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Morgan Stanley&#8217;s largest common shareholder, to release a
statement on Oct. 3 saying it&#8217;s &#8220;firmly committed&#8221; to its
strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley. Gorman sent a memo to
employees the same day, encouraging them to remain focused on
their jobs and clients instead of responding to &#8220;the rumor of
the day.&#8221; 
&#8220;There has been an enormous amount of confusion and
misinformation about Morgan Stanley and others in our peer
group,&#8221; he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. &#8220;In fragile markets, where fear triumphs over common
sense, these things are bound to happen.&#8221; 
The bank repurchased about $2 billion of its own bonds as
prices fell, Porat said. The gain on the buybacks was less than
$100 million, she said. 
Morgan Stanley updated figures for risks linked to Europe
in a presentation on its website today, saying the five
countries at the center of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis totaled $2.11
billion in exposure including hedges against losses. The risks
linked to France were negative $286 million.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, had the most third-quarter trading revenue
of any Wall Street firm that has reported results so far,
leading the pack for the fourth consecutive period. 
The bank led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, has supplanted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as No. 1 in
revenue from buying and selling bonds, stocks, currencies,
commodities and derivatives, according to company reports.
JPMorgan&#8217;s trading revenue was more than triple that of Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets. 
The table below details third-quarter and nine-month
trading revenue reported by Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. (C),
JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) this month. The
figures exclude so-called debt-valuation adjustments, accounting
gains or losses that banks record when the value of their own
bonds falls. 
All the firms are based in New York except Bank of America,

Morgan Stanley (MS) said risks tied to
five countries at the center of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis totaled
$2.11 billion including hedges against losses. The amount for
France is negative $286 million. 
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain represented
$5.69 billion in exposure before hedges, the New York-based firm
said today on its website. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s risks linked to
France were $1.53 billion before hedges. 
Concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would spark bank losses
contributed to a 41 percent tumble for Morgan Stanley&#8217;s shares
in the third quarter. Europe&#8217;s leaders are set to meet Oct. 23
to discuss how to stem the crisis. 
The risks &#8220;seems meaningfully lower than feared,&#8221; Brennan
Hawken, an analyst at UBS AG, wrote today in a note to
investors. 
The largest net exposure was $1.79 billion to Italy, and
the firm had negative net exposure to Ireland and Portugal. The
figures include obligations tied to sovereign governments,
corporations, clearinghouses and financial institutions. 
&#8220;The exposures have been very well managed,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been
looking forward to addressing this.&#8221; 
Disclosures by the bank are likely to ease concern about
fallout from the crisis, causing Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit spreads
to narrow relative to peers, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
and strategists John Marshall, Louise Pitt and Daniel Harris
said in a note earlier this month. 
Comfort Level 
&#8220;They need to give investors a level of comfort that
they&#8217;re addressing it,&#8221; said Douglas G. Ciocca, managing
director at Kavar Capital Partners LLC in Leawood, Kansas, which
manages about $225 million in assets. He spoke before the
figures were released. &#8220;They&#8217;ll have to be as reasonably
assuring and specific as they can be.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), owner of the ESPN
sports channel and the world&#8217;s largest theme-park operator,
apologized to customers after demand for limited editions of its
princess dolls crashed the Disney Store website. 
More than 1,200 Facebook users posted comments when the
company acknowledged yesterday that the site was &#8220;extremely
busy&#8221; and that it &#8220;won&#8217;t allow such high volume to check out
simultaneously.&#8221; 
The furor erupted when the Burbank, California-based
company put the last five models in its Disney Princess Designer
Doll Collection for sale on its website yesterday for $59.50
each. All of the dolls -- the characters Tiana, Jasmine,
Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Pocahontas -- sold out the same
day, the company said. 
&#8220;DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! I think Disney should go back to the
meeting room on this one,&#8221; Susan Herd Collier posted to
Disney&#8217;s Facebook page. 
The company was contrite. 
&#8220;We acknowledge that this has been a poor experience for
many of you, and we are truly sorry for those of you who were
unable to purchase,&#8221; Disney said yesterday in a statement on
the store&#8217;s Facebook page. 
The Disney Princess Designer Doll collection made its debut
on Aug. 23, starting with the Cinderella model and a plan to
introduce one more character a week for a total of 10. Trouble
started when Snow White went on sale Sept. 19 and it sold out
the same day. The company said the doll was &#8220;oversold&#8221; and
blamed a &#8220;system malfunction&#8221; on its Disney Store blog. 
Five More Dolls 
&#8220;We want you to know that we read your comments on
Facebook, saw your Tweets, and our Cast Members have told us
what they heard from our Guests who visited our stores,&#8221; Jim
Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said in a Sept.
23 post on the store blog. 
Disney said then it would release the five remaining dolls
all on the same day, starting Oct. 17 in its stores and
yesterday from its website. Customers were allowed to order only
one of each character, and even with that limit, demand led to
the website crash. 
Disney spokesman Gary Foster said the company would have no
comment beyond its online posts.

Mobile telephones don&#8217;t raise the
chance of developing central nervous system cancers, according
to a study of Danish mobile-phone subscribers published today in
the British Medical Journal. 
The study examined reports from Denmark&#8217;s centralized
cancer registry and subscriber records from mobile-phone
networks for 358,403 Danes aged at least 30 from 1990 to 2007.
It found no higher incidence of brain tumors or any other
cancers in the people studied. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t find a higher risk for people subscribing for a
mobile phone in the adult population,&#8221; said Patrizia Frei, a
postdoctoral research fellow at the Swiss Tropical and Public
Health Institute in Basel, who led the study while at the
Institute of Cancer Epidemiology in Copenhagen, in an interview. 
The research is the largest of its type and used data that
was already available, instead of retrospectively interviewing
phone subscribers whose recall could be selective or unreliable,
the scientists said. The findings may help clarify previous
research into the link between mobile phones and brain tumors,
which the authors said has been inconclusive and, in some cases,
criticized for being biased or prone to error. 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of
the Geneva-based World Health Organization, said in June that
mobile phones may cause brain cancer. A month later, the
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection&#8217;s
committee on epidemiology undermined those findings, saying that
using the technology may not increase the risk of tumors after
reviewing studies from several countries. 
Electromagnetic Fields 
More than 5 billion mobile-phone subscriptions are held
worldwide, according to the International Telecommunication
Union. Concerns have arisen over whether exposing the brain to
radiofrequency electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones
leads to cancer. The IARC said the fields were &#8220;possibly&#8221;
carcinogenic, the same category as diesel fuel and chloroform. 
A weakness in the Danish study was that it used data about
people who had a mobile-phone contract and excluded corporate
accounts. Some non-users of phones may have been counted among
the subscribers and some heavy users may not have been included
in the study population, wrote Anders Ahlbom, a professor at the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm in an accompanying editorial. 
&#8220;The absence of a trend in the incidence of brain tumors
in national statistics is reassuring,&#8221; Ahlbom wrote.
&#8220;Continued monitoring of health registers and prospective
cohorts is warranted.&#8221; 
The research was funded by the Danish Strategic Research
Council.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $14.5
million to settle a lawsuit brought by two whistle-blowers who
claimed the company improperly marketed its bladder-control drug
Detrol. 
The whistle-blowers, former sales representatives David
Wetherholt and Marci Drimer, sued Pfizer in federal court in
Boston in 2006, claiming the company cheated Medicaid, the
state-administered, federal health-care program for low-income
people, by pushing Detrol for a prostate condition. The suit was
filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. and
multiple states. 
Pfizer will pay $14.5 million to the U.S. government, 49
states and the District of Columbia, Thomas M. Greene, a lawyer
for the whistle-blowers, said today in a statement. The ex-
Pfizer employees will receive 27 percent of the federal portion
of the recovery, or about $3.3 million, he said. 
&#8220;The plan to market Detrol off-label to new patient
populations was hatched by a marketing team, not by research and
development,&#8221; Greene said in an interview. &#8220;Instead of asking,
&#8216;Who will Detrol help?&#8217; or even, &#8216;How does Detrol work?&#8217; the
question became, &#8216;Who can we convince to buy Detrol?&#8217;&#8221; 
&#8216;Favorable Terms&#8217; 
Pfizer denied any wrongdoing. The New York-based company
settled the lawsuit on &#8220;favorable terms,&#8221; it said today in a
statement. 
&#8220;This settlement allows Pfizer to avoid the cost and
distraction of litigation and put this matter behind us,&#8221; the
company said. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, paid $2.3 billion in
2009 to settle U.S. investigations into improper marketing of
its Bextra painkiller and other drugs. The Detrol claim was the
last of the False Claims Act cases connected to these suits, the
company said. 
The U.S. declined to intervene, or join, the Detrol lawsuit
in 2009. The whistleblowers pursued the claim on their own after
that decision, Greene said. 
The former Pfizer sales representatives claimed that the
company marketed Detrol, approved for treatment of overactive
bladder conditions, for an additional, unapproved, use, in
violation of federal regulations. 
Pfizer encouraged prescriptions for patients who have an
impeded flow of urine caused by a condition called benign
prostatic hyperplasia, the whistle-blowers claimed. 
&#8216;Unlawful Conduct&#8217; 
&#8220;Pfizer intentionally embarked on a course of unlawful
conduct that it knew would lead to the submission by physicians
and pharmacists of thousands of Medicaid claims for Detrol uses
that were not covered by Medicaid and for which the drug was
ineffective,&#8221; the whistle-blowers said in their complaint. 
The lawsuit was initially settled in January while the
conclusion of the case was delayed as the plaintiffs got
agreements from the states, according to court filings. 
Wetherholt and Drimer also alleged Pfizer forced them out
after they complained about marketing practices. Greene declined
to comment on whether their claims of wrongful termination were
settled. 
Wetherholt and Drimer will also receive an undetermined
amount from the $2.62 million portion of the settlement shared
by the states, Greene said. 
&#8220;They will receive a percentage of the state settlements
for those states with false claims acts,&#8221; he said. 
The case is U.S. ex. rel. Wetherholt v. Pfizer Inc.,
06-10204, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) disclosed $1.3
billion of new expenses tied to faulty mortgages and
foreclosures in its third quarter, pushing the bill for the five
biggest home lenders since 2007 to almost $69 billion. 
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, set aside $314
million for buying back defective loans and incurred $1 billion
in litigation costs caused mostly by mortgages, according to its
Oct. 13 report. That brought the New York-based bank&#8217;s total to
at least $17.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Cost are mounting as borrowers, investors and states accuse
banks of sloppy lending and improper foreclosures. The total may
top $120 billion because mortgage buyers such as Fannie Mae are
becoming more aggressive, said Paul Miller, the FBR Capital
Markets  Co. analyst, and claims are spreading to loans written
after banks said they reformed their practices. 
&#8220;This is still far from over,&#8221; said Neil Barofsky, former
inspector general for the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program.
&#8220;These numbers are very high to begin with, but this is now an
enormous overhang on the industry, and it&#8217;s well deserved.
Sooner or later the banks will pay the price for their
behavior.&#8221; 
During the housing boom, banks issued mortgages and bundled
them into securities sold to private investors and government-
backed enterprises. They usually offered &#8220;representations and
warranties&#8221; in which lenders promised to buy back the mortgages
or cover losses if the loans turned out to be based on
inaccurate or missing data on criteria such as the borrower&#8217;s
income, the property&#8217;s value or whether it would be used as a
primary residence. 
Bad Loans 
Regulators said banks abandoned their own lending standards
to approve unjustified loans, leading to record defaults and
foreclosures. Investors who owned the mortgages began scouring
the loans for defects and lodging claims, while homeowners and
state attorneys general alleged that banks based seizures on
missing or false documents. Litigation costs for JPMorgan alone
have come to more than $5 billion. 
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), whose Countrywide unit was the
biggest lender during the housing bubble, had $1.18 billion in
third-quarter costs, according to its Oct. 18 report. That
included a $278 million provision for repurchases, $500 million
for litigation costs and $400 million for waivers and
assessments related to foreclosure problems. The total for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company since 2007 is now $40.3
billion, the most of any U.S. home lender. 
Mortgage Servicing 
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) added $390 million to its reserves for
repurchases in the third quarter, bringing its total to $5.48
billion. The San Francisco-based company, the biggest U.S. home
lender, also wrote down the value of its mortgage servicing
rights by $2.64 billion, in part because of expenses &#8220;including
delinquency and foreclosure costs.&#8221; 
The writedown was excluded from Bloomberg&#8217;s tally because
the bank didn&#8217;t say how much of the decline was attributable to
extraordinary foreclosure costs, and Ancel Martinez, a Wells
Fargo spokesman, declined to elaborate. 
Citigroup Inc. (C) reported a $301 million provision for
repurchase demands, lifting the New York-based bank&#8217;s total to
$2.2 billion. 
Thomas Kelly at JPMorgan, Shannon Bell at Citigroup and
Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to
comment. Ally Financial Inc., previously known as GMAC Inc., has
not reported its third-quarter data yet. As of the second
quarter, the Detroit-based lender had been hit with $3.28
billion in costs. Ally is 74 percent owned by the U.S.
government after being rescued from collapse in 2008. 
Fannie and Freddie 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were also bailed out, say
they&#8217;re getting tougher in demanding repurchases, even for loans
that have not gone into default. Some guarantees offered by
banks oblige them to give refunds merely if the underwriting was
defective, even if the borrower is still paying. 
&#8220;Fannie Mae in particular seems to be getting more
aggressive,&#8221; FBR&#8217;s Miller said. Bank of America said it had
$11.67 billion in outstanding claims and JPMorgan had $3.09
billion. 
While most claims have been concentrated in the years
before the housing bubble burst, JPMorgan and Bank of America
reported that demands for repurchases on loans issued after 2008
had about tripled from the year earlier. Previously, the banks
had said they expected few claims those mortgages were faulty
because they had tightened their lending procedures after the
credit crisis. 
Newer Loans 
Wells Fargo said it had received a rising number of
repurchase demands from Fannie Mae for mortgages from 2006 to
2008 and that &#8220;newer vintage demands continued to emerge.&#8221; 
On top of that, banks have been in negotiations with the
attorneys general of the 50 states to resolve litigation for
foreclosure abuses and errors. A settlement may cost about $20
billion. 
Bloomberg&#8217;s tally was compiled from regulatory filings,
company statements and financial presentations by the nation&#8217;s
five biggest mortgage lenders. The data cover provisions and
expenses attributable to repurchases, foreclosure errors and
abuses, payments to reimburse investors for lost value on faulty
mortgages, legal settlements and litigation expenses. 
The compilation also includes writedowns of assets, such as
mortgage servicing rights, when the company attributed the loss
in value to problems in mortgage underwriting or foreclosures
and the costs of remedies. 
The tally would be higher if it included settlements with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading
investors in mortgage-related securities, such as collateralized
debt obligations. 
The SEC announced Wednesday a $285 million settlement with
Citigroup. In July, 2010, the agency announced a $550 million
settlement with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan paid
$153.6 million in a similar case in June. SEC officials have
said more cases are likely.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
to raise a collateralized loan obligation with a target size of
$400 million to be managed by Ares Management LLC, according to
three people with knowledge of the deal. 
The CLO may include a $254 million piece rated AAA by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. Bank of America Corp.
priced a $410 million CLO for the Los Angeles-based investment
manager in January. 
There have been more than $7.6 billion of CLOs backed by
widely syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, more than
double the $3.4 billion raised in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. At the peak of the market in 2007, $91.1
billion of that type of CLO was issued in the U.S., Morgan
Stanley data show. 
The Ares fund may also consist of a $23 million slice rated
AA, a $40 million piece ranked A, a $21 million portion graded
BBB and an $18 million BB piece. There may also be $44 million
of equity, the people said. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs
spokesman, and Bill Mendel, an Ares spokesman, both declined to
comment. 
CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. The SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100
Index, which tracks the 100 largest dollar- denominated first-
lien leveraged loans, has climbed 1.5 cents since September to
90.06 cents on the dollar, the highest level since Aug. 8.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, was sued by Israel-based MiniFrame Ltd. for
allegedly offering anticompetitive terms for multiserver
operating systems. 
MiniFrame said Microsoft uses its monopoly on the client
operating-system market to interfere with potential partners and
customers. Before 2007, Microsoft didn&#8217;t include any
restrictions in its licenses that would prevent multiple users,
MiniFrame said in a complaint filed today in Manhattan federal
court. 
MiniFrame alleges that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
is attempting to retain its monopoly on the server operating-
system market and the client operating-system market and is
attempting to monopolize the personal-computer sharing software
market and the multi-user software market. 
&#8220;Microsoft recognized the competitive threat which shared
PC systems posed and engaged in several anticompetitive
strategies in order to ensure that it will maintain or otherwise
have a monopoly for any multi-user market, whether it be the
server operating system market, the PC sharing software market,
or the combination of the two markets,&#8221; MiniFrame said. 
MiniFrame said there no technological reason multiple users
can&#8217;t access or use the same Windows Client Operating System at
the same time. 
A Microsoft representative didn&#8217;t immediately return a
voice-mail message seeking comment about the complaint. 
The case is MiniFrame v. Microsoft Corp. 11-CV-7419, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said it&#8217;s unlikely that the U.S. economy
will slip back into recession.  
&#8220;There appears to be this mood around of inevitability
about the next quarter that we&#8217;re back into recession or close
to it,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in an interview on CNBC today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
really buy. Most of the ongoing reliable data is quite strong.
There&#8217;s no momentum for a recession.&#8221; 
&#8220;It certainly seems that the U.S. is struggling with trend
growth, but something&#8221; about 2 percent &#8220;strikes me as the
cruising speed the U.S. is at now,&#8221; the economist told CNBC.
There will need to be &#8220;a lot of negative shocks going on to
drag the U.S. down,&#8221; he said. 
O&#8217;Neill also said that &#8220;people seem to be convinced that
Europe going wrong is going to drag the U.S. down. That&#8217;s might
happen, but there&#8217;s a strong likelihood it won&#8217;t.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley bought jet-fuel
cargoes at a reduced premium in Singapore, Asia&#8217;s biggest oil-
trading and refining center. Hin Leong Trading Pte extended its
purchases of fuel oil. 
Light Distillates 
Vitol Group bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON
gasoline from BP Plc in Singapore, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window.
The Geneva-based trader paid $118.50 a barrel to load between
Nov. 6 and Nov. 10. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a 25,000 metric-ton, open-
specification naphtha contract for second-half December from
Mabanaft BV at $884 a ton, the survey showed. 
Naphtha&#8217;s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped $29.74 to $59.90 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time,
based on data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, is the narrowest so far this week. 
Middle Distillates 
Morgan Stanley bought two jet-fuel cargoes in Singapore,
according to the Bloomberg survey. Hin Leong and BP each sold
100,000 barrels at 10 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes, the
smallest premium in a week. The cargoes are for Nov. 4 to Nov.
8, the earliest loading period. 
Jet fuel&#8217;s premium to gasoil, or diesel, fell 5 cents to
$2.80 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. Singapore time, based on data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. This regrade is
the narrowest so far this week, signaling it is less profitable
to produce aviation fuel over diesel. 
Gasoil&#8217;s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 42 cents
to $16.71 a barrel, PVM said. This crack spread is the widest
since Oct. 7. 
Fuel Oil 
Hin Leong bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
fuel oil in Singapore, bringing its purchases so far this month
to at least 240,000 tons, according to the Bloomberg survey. The
closely held trader paid $9 a ton over quotes for first-half
November to Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Vitol, for loading from
Nov. 15 to Nov. 19. 
Fuel oil&#8217;s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 43 cents to
$4.18 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data.
That&#8217;s the smallest gap in a week, indicating reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products. 
The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade decreased 50 cents to $7 a ton, the lowest in a week, PVM
said. A narrowing viscosity spread shows bunker, or marine fuel,
has declined less than higher-quality fuel oil.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) expects production
costs of handsets using Windows Phone 7 software next year to
drop by more than half from when the platform was introduced. 
Cooperation with parts makers including Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) will
allow phones using Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft&#8217;s mobile
operating system to be produced for less than $200, compared
with $400 when the software was released last year, Andy Lees,
head of the Windows Phone division, said in an interview in Hong
Kong today. The actual retail price will be determined by
operators, he said. 
Microsoft is competing with Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) to
gain a bigger share of the $207 billion mobile-phone market,
where it lags behind the Android and iOS platforms. The first
models using the latest version of Windows Phone 7, called
Mango, have already been shipped in Japan, with devices to be
available in China next year, Lees said. 
&#8220;Volume, volume, volume,&#8221; is Microsoft&#8217;s main motivation
for helping vendors offer cheaper handsets, Lees said, declining
to identify phone makers. 
Models using Mango to be introduced in the next few months
will require as little as $220 to produce, before the cost falls
further in 2012, Lees said. 
&#8220;We are supporting componentry that will allow us to go
below $200,&#8221; he said, referring to handset production costs. 
Lower prices will mean less royalty revenue per phone
because Microsoft offers tiered pricing, based on the
manufacturing cost of the handset, he said. 
Microsoft works exclusively with Qualcomm to develop chips
that power handsets using its system, allowing it to specify
technical details to ensure devices run more smoothly, the
executive said. 
There is currently no plan to work with other semiconductor
makers for Windows Phone 7 devices, he said. 
HTC Corp. (2498), Samsung Electronics Co. and ZTE Corp. (000063) are among
device makers that have already developed handsets using Windows
Phone 7. Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), which has agreed to develop phones with
Microsoft, will outline its plans for Windows phones next week,
Lees said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a
judge in New York state court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by
Allstate Insurance Co. over the alleged fraudulent sale of
residential mortgage-backed securities. 
The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer sued New York-based
Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Aug. 15 over the sale of more than $100 million worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
including the lost market value of the investments. 
Allstate filed the lawsuit and seven similar complaints
against various issuers and underwriters of residential
mortgage-backed securities, using &#8220;generalities and unsupported
assumptions&#8221; to recoup investment losses on certificates it
bought in five offerings in 2006, Goldman Sachs said in court
documents filed today. 
&#8220;Despite its financial sophistication and expertise
(including in the housing market, where it is a leading
insurer), Allstate now suffers from buyer&#8217;s remorse and has sued
the counterparties with which it traded at arm&#8217;s length,
claiming in separate actions that each of the eight sellers of
RMBS misled it as to characteristics of the securities,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. 
Allstate has also sued lenders including JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill
Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over residential
mortgage-backed securities. 
The investments, pools of home loans securitized into
bonds, were a central part of the housing bubble that helped
send the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The
housing market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and
investment banks as the market for the securities evaporated. 
The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,
652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by
a pension fund that alleges the New York-based investment bank
had a conflict of interest in its role as adviser in the planned
$21 billion purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP) by Kinder Morgan Inc. 
Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder
Morgan, steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. 
&#8220;The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan,&#8221; lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. 
In addition to Goldman Sachs, the complaint also names
individual El Paso directors and Kinder Morgan. 
While Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser on the
sale, Goldman&#8217;s presence &#8220;tainted the entire process,&#8221; lawyers
for the retirement fund said in the complaint. Goldman continued
to act as financial adviser on &#8220;related matters&#8221; in connection
with the transaction, the pension fund said in the complaint,
citing the companies&#8217; joint press statement. 
Fiduciary Duty 
Goldman Sachs is accused of aiding and abetting a breach of
fiduciary duty by El Paso directors. In addition to seeking
unspecified damages, the pension fund is asking a judge to order
the directors to give &#8220;full and fair consideration&#8221; to any
alternative offers for the company. 
The retirement fund also faulted El Paso directors for
agreeing to an inadequate deal in light of the surge in demand
for pipelines, the pricing power Kinder Morgan will garner as a
result of the transaction and the premiums paid for past energy
deals. The board &#8220;virtually eliminated&#8221; the prospect of
a superior offer by agreeing to unreasonable deal protection
devices including a no-shop clause and a punitive $650 million
termination fee, according to the complaint. 
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the lawsuit except to say that the bank&#8217;s
representatives on Kinder Morgan&#8217;s board recused themselves from
the deal process. 
Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan,
said in an e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending
litigation. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, also
declined to comment. 
Cash and Stock 
El Paso, based in Houston, said Oct. 16 it would be bought
for cash and stock to create the largest natural-gas pipeline
network in the U.S. The company was sued earlier this week by a
shareholder over claims the deal undervalues it shares. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity arm was one of Richard
Kinder&#8217;s co-investors when he took his company private in 2007.
The firm remains one of the largest Kinder Morgan shareholders
and has two representatives on the board. 
Richard Kinder kicked off the takeover talks in late August
when he approached El Paso&#8217;s Douglas Foshee, said Joe Hollier, a
Kinder Morgan spokesman. 
That disrupted a previous plan by El Paso, announced in
May, to spin off its exploration and production assets to
shareholders. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Steve Daniel had been advising El Paso on
the spinoff. For the talks with Kinder Morgan, El Paso instead
turned to a Morgan Stanley team. 
The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) appointed
Greg Agran and Magid Shenouda as co-heads of commodities
trading, according to a company memo obtained by Bloomberg News. 
The memo, dated Oct. 18, was confirmed today by Sophie
Bullock, a company spokeswoman based in London. 
Agran and Shenouda are based in New York and London,
respectively. They replace Jeffrey Resnick, global head of
commodities trading, who decided to retire at the end of this
year after 18 years at the Wall Street firm, the memo said. 
Goldman Sachs generated $3.6 billion of revenue from its
commodities business in 2006 and $3.4 billion in 2007, according
to documents released this year by the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. Goldman likely has a 15 percent
to 20 percent market share in commodities, which generated
industry revenue of $6 billion to $7 billion last year,
according to estimates from Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in New York. 
Agran is currently head of U.S. natural gas and power
trading and head of global commodities principal investing. He
joined Goldman Sachs in 1991 as an analyst in New York and was
named managing director in 1999 and partner in 2006, according
to the memo. 
Shenouda is the bank&#8217;s head of European crude oil and
products trading and European gas and power trading. He joined
Goldman Sachs in 1999 as a vice president in London, after
working as a physical fuel oil trader at independent energy
trader Trafigura Beheer BV. He was responsible for expanding
Goldman&#8217;s physical commodities business, including expanding its
coal, freight, and emissions franchise, the memo said. He was
promoted to managing director in 2005. 
Goldman Sachs competes with other banks in commodities,
including Morgan Stanley (MS), which also has a 15 to 20 percent
market share, according to Schorr at Nomura.

Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis AG (NOVN)
are under investigation by the European Union&#8217;s antitrust
regulator over contracts that may have hampered the sale of
generic versions of pain killer Fentanyl in the Netherlands. 
The EU authority said it&#8217;s probing contractual arrangements
between JJ and Novartis that may have had the &#8220;object or
effect of hindering entry&#8221; of the generic drug onto the Dutch
market. Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis owns Sandoz, a
generic-drug maker. 
&#8220;Pharmaceutical companies are already rewarded for their
innovation efforts by the patents they are granted,&#8221; EU
Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Paying a competitor to stay out of the market is a
restriction of competition that the commission will not
tolerate.&#8221; 
Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on how settlements between companies that make branded
medicines and generics producers might harm consumers. Bayer AG
was among drug firms told by EU officials in January to submit
details of patent-settlement deals that may be used to delay the
sale of generic versions of medicines. Drug developers use
various ways to delay generics, the EU said in a 2009 report. 
The investigation is related to a contractual agreement JJ
had with Sandoz in the Netherlands and is limited to that
country, Stefan Gijssels, a spokesman for JJ&#8217;s Janssen
subsidiary, said in a telephone interview today. The company
will cooperate fully with authorities, he said. 
Teva Deal 
&#8220;It&#8217;s important to underline that the commission has not
made a finding that Janssen did something wrong in the
Netherlands," Gijssels said. &#8216;&#8216;It&#8217;s the start of an
investigation." 
&#8216;&#8216;We don&#8217;t comment on ongoing procedures,&#8217;&#8217; Eric Althoff, a
spokesman for Novartis, said in an e-mail. 
EU antitrust regulators are also investigating Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), the world&#8217;s largest generic
drugmaker, and Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) over a 2005 agreement that may have
delayed generic versions of Provigil. Teva last week completed
its acquisition of Cephalon after agreeing to divest Cephalon&#8217;s
marketing rights in France for a generic version of narcolepsy
drug Provigil. 
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) last year partly lost an appeal at the EU&#8217;s
second-highest court over a commission decision that it had
misled patent officials and flouted antitrust rules to keep a
generic competitor off the market. The London-based company has
an appeal pending.

Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, will sell its Saxon unit to Ocwen Financial
Corp. (OCN), exiting the mortgage-servicing business it bought before
the housing market collapsed. 
Ocwen agreed to pay a base price of $59.3 million plus
about $1.4 billion for receivables outstanding, Morgan Stanley
said yesterday in a statement. The deal is expected to close in
2012&#8217;s first quarter and isn&#8217;t likely to have a material impact
on earnings, New York-based Morgan Stanley said. 
Investment banks are selling mortgage servicers they bought
before the financial crisis as record defaults drive up costs
for billing, collections and foreclosures and make the units
less valuable. Ocwen last month completed the purchase of Litton
Loan Servicing LP from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for $263.7
million. 
&#8220;These transactions demonstrate yet again Ocwen&#8217;s strong
growth prospects as consolidation of private-label servicing
continues and demand increases for specialty servicing,&#8221; Ocwen
Chairman William Erbey said in a separate statement.&#160;&#8220;We remain
bullish on our growth prospects into 2012.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley bought Glen Allen, Virginia-based Saxon in
2006 for $706 million as the investment bank sought a mortgage
issuer and servicer to provide home loans that it packaged into
securities. Morgan Stanley took a $700 million writedown in the
fourth quarter of 2008 related to businesses it owned, with most
of the charge coming from Saxon. 
Impact on Assets 
The sale will reduce Morgan Stanley&#8217;s risk-weighted assets
as it attempts to meet capital standards set to start taking
effect in 2013. It will also reduce the firm&#8217;s headcount by
about 1,200, according to a person familiar with the unit. 
Ocwen outbid Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)&#8217;s Nationstar
Mortgage Holdings Inc., according to another person with
knowledge of the talks, who declined to be identified because
the process wasn&#8217;t public. 
Ocwen, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, acquires $26.6
billion in unpaid principal balances of mortgage servicing
rights, $10.9 billion of which Ocwen already subservices. The
deal also includes another $12.9 billion of loans that Saxon
services for Morgan Stanley and other firms. It gained about
$38.6 billion of unpaid principal balances with its purchase of
Litton, which Ocwen acquired by also agreeing to pay about
$337.4 million to retire some of Litton&#8217;s debt. 
HomEq Purchase 
Ocwen agreed in May 2010 to buy HomEq Servicing, a mortgage
servicer owned by London-based Barclays Plc, for about $1.3
billion in cash conditional on the value of certain assets at
completion, according to a statement from Barclays at the time.
Barclays also agreed to provide Ocwen with about $1 billion in
secured financing and offered assistance in raising more funds,
according to the statement. 
In May, Saxon agreed to pay $2.35 million to resolve a
lawsuit alleging it improperly foreclosed on 17 U.S. military-
service members from 2006 to 2009. The foreclosures violated the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which was enacted to shield
deployed military personnel from financial stress, according to
the U.S. Justice Department. 
Morgan Stanley considered buying New Century Financial
Corp. (CYFL), the subprime mortgage lender that filed for bankruptcy in
April 2007, before acquiring Saxon, Chairman John Mack said in a
November 2010 interview released this year by the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission. 
The bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. won court
approval last year of an agreement to seek buyers or liquidate
its Aurora Bank FSB unit, which includes a mortgage-servicing
arm.

Units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
were sued by Capmark Financial Group Inc., which accused them of
wrongly collecting $147 million five months before Capmark went
bankrupt. 
While they were co-owners of Capmark in May 2009, a group
of Goldman units used their influence to help convince Capmark
to refinance $1.5 billion in unsecured debt owed to Goldman,
according to the lawsuit filed today in Manhattan federal court.
The refinancing allowed Goldman to collect $147 million,
including $7 million in cash, based on the new secured loan,
according to the lawsuit. 
&#8220;Despite these conflicts and close connections -- indeed,
as a result of the influence and insider status that its
multiple simultaneous roles created -- Goldman Sachs actively
and directly participated in internal meetings and discussions
that led to the secured credit facility, which gave it
preferential treatment as a creditor,&#8221; Capmark claimed in the
lawsuit. 
Capmark, the commercial lender once a part of the former
General Motors Corp., exited bankruptcy in September, co-owned
by lower-ranking creditors, some of whom had fought with Goldman
over the refinancing and the payments in bankruptcy court in
Delaware. 
Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman, declined comment
on the lawsuit. 
2006 Purchase 
Capmark, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, became partly
owned by affiliates of New York-based Goldman Sachs when the
bank and a group of investors bought 78 percent of Capmark, then
called GMAC Commercial Mortgage, in 2006 for $1.5 billion in
cash and the repayment of $7.3 billion of debt. 
The creditors committee also battled with Goldman Sachs
over how to handle so-called insider preference claims --
lawsuits sometimes brought against company insiders, including
equity holders, accused of wrongly taking money from the company
in the months before the bankruptcy filing. 
&#8220;Plaintiffs bring this action seeking avoidance and
recovery of all preferential payments made to defendant or for
defendants&#8217; benefit under the pre-petition credit facilities,&#8221;
Capmark said in the complaint filed today. 
Last year, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi gave
Capmark permission to settle allegations that the entire
$1.5 billion refinancing was a fraud on creditors because it
wrongly boosted the repayment priority of Goldman Sachs and
other lenders. 
Under that settlement, Capmark paid New York-based Goldman
Sachs and the other lenders about $835 million, less than the
full value of the loan. 
Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
property values and a drop in lending. 
The case is Capmark Financial Group Inc. v. Goldman Sachs,
11-CV-7511, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), fighting
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. over $6 billion in claims it filed
against the defunct firm, asked a judge to allow continued
sealing of some information in court papers, saying secrecy was
needed to protect entities from harm. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s claims against Lehman and its brokerage are
&#8220;significantly overstated,&#8221; Lehman said in August. The bank, a
go-between for the brokerage&#8217;s repurchase agreements with short-
term investors after the parent&#8217;s Sept. 15, 2008 bankruptcy,
failed to sell collateral securing the loans in a &#8220;commercially
reasonable manner,&#8221; it alleged in a filing where passages were
blacked out. 
Lehman asked the judge to hold a hearing on the issue and
then cut the claims as he considered appropriate. 
JPMorgan later agreed to let Lehman publish a mostly
uncensored version of its objection to the claims, the New York-
based bank said in a filing today. The information that is still
blacked out includes names and account numbers of JPMorgan&#8217;s
trading partners, phone numbers and certain e-mail addresses, it
said. 
Potential Harm 
&#8220;The bankruptcy code provides courts with the power to
issue orders that will protect entitles from potential harm that
may result from the disclosure of certain confidential
information,&#8221; it said in the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. 
In the partially uncensored objection to JPMorgan&#8217;s claim,
Lehman gave details about the sale of collateral. On the morning
the Lehman brokerage went into liquidation, JPMorgan started to
sell the securities, calling the plan &#8220;Project Tassimo,&#8221; after
a coffee maker owned by a bank employee involved in the
transactions, it said. 
The sale was handled &#8220;without any limits or safeguards
ensuring a fair price,&#8221; Lehman alleged. 
Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the largest U.S. bank,
declined to comment on the allegations. Kimberly Macleod, a
Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
Separately, JPMorgan is contesting an $8.6 billion lawsuit
by Lehman, saying it was protected by so-called safe harbor law
when it took collateral from the defunct firm in 2008. Congress
created the law to protect banks lending to faltering companies,
JPMorgan has said. 
Fraud Allegations 
JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, sued Lehman
back, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the loan. 
The brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc., is being separately
liquidated from its parent, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., after
going into liquidation four days after its parent. 
The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-
13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

The European debt crisis and
government belt-tightening may cause the U.S. economy to slow in
early 2012 even as the risk of it faltering this year has waned,
said JPMorgan Chase  Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman. 
&#8220;As we are picking up some steam, we&#8217;re now obviously
facing a new set of drags, mostly emanating from Europe,&#8221;
Kasman said today in a radio interview on &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. &#8220;We also have
this uncertainty about where U.S. fiscal policy is heading.&#8221; 
Economic growth may slow to 1 percent early next year &#8220;on
the back of Europe going into recession and on the back of
fiscal tightening&#8221; in the U.S., New York-based Kasman said. The
slowdown may lead to a rise in the unemployment rate, which was
at 9.1 percent in September for a third month. 
More immediately, Kasman said a waning of headwinds, which
included higher fuel prices and supply disruptions from Japan&#8217;s
natural disaster, has helped U.S. growth speed up after
proceeding at a 0.9 percent rate in the first half of this year,
the weakest pace since the recession ended in June 2009. 
Gross domestic product expanded at about a 3 percent pace
from July to September, Kasman said. Economists project a 2.5
percent advance, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey ahead of the Commerce Department figures on Oct. 27.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s smoking cessation drug
Chantix doesn&#8217;t lead to more hospitalizations than nicotine
replacement therapies such Sanofi&#8217;s NicoDerm patches, two U.S.
studies suggest. 
The Food and Drug Administration said today it continues to
evaluate the risk of mood changes and other psychiatric events
linked to Chantix after releasing the results of two studies the
agency cautioned had limitations. Both lacked a large enough
sample size to detect rare adverse events or dismiss the
increased risk of episodes that don&#8217;t result in
hospitalizations, the FDA said in a safety announcement. 
A boxed warning on Chantix, which works by blocking the
effects of nicotine on the brain, cautions patients they could
experience changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed
mood and suicidal thoughts or actions. New York-based Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, is conducting a large clinical
trial of the drug to assess neuropsychiatric effects, with
results expected in 2017, the FDA said. 
Chantix was approved in May 2006 and 21.8 million
prescriptions were dispensed July 2011, according to the agency. 
&#8220;We are reviewing this important information for smokers
provided by the FDA,&#8221; MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for Pfizer
said in an e-mail. &#8220;Given the significant public health risks
of smoking, Chantix is an important treatment option for adult
smokers to help patients stop smoking.&#8221; 
The FDA sponsored two observational studies with Chantix
conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the
Department of Defense. Both studies&#8217; showed no statistically
significant difference in psychiatric hospitalizations. 
The Veterans Affairs study included 14,131 Chantix users
and an equal number of nicotine replacement therapy users.
Sixteen Chantix-treated patients were hospitalized for
psychiatric reasons compared to 21 in the replacement therapy
group. 
The Pentagon studied 11,978 Chantix users and an equal
number of replacement therapy patients. Patients on Chantix were
hospitalized 18 times for psychiatric reasons compared to 16
times among replacement therapy patients.

Justin Nunez, a former Columbia
University football player in his second year at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), earned the unofficial title of Wall Street&#8217;s best
athlete by winning a charity decathlon held at his alma mater. 
Nunez, 27, finished atop a field of almost 100 traders,
bankers and financial advisers in the 10-event competition,
which benefits the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. Kyle VanFleet, a former Georgetown University fullback who
also works at Goldman Sachs, was runner-up in the competition
that took place over the weekend. 
Nunez finished with 7,095 points -- 27 ahead of VanFleet
and 41 better than Brad Bagdis of Knight Capital Group -- to
improve on his third-place showing at the 2010 Wall Street
Decathlon. Nunez&#8217;s victory came at Columbia&#8217;s Wien Stadium on
the northern tip of Manhattan, where he played four years at
defensive back for the Lions. 
&#8220;To come back and actually have a chance to compete again
on my home turf felt great,&#8221; Nunez, who works in the investment
management division at Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It brings back a lot of good memories.&#8221; 
Nunez, cheered by family, college friends, his girlfriend
and colleagues from Goldman Sachs, said his experience last year
helped him win this time around.

Swiss banks will likely settle a
sweeping U.S. probe of offshore tax evasion by paying billions
of dollars and handing over names of thousands of Americans who
have secret accounts, Bloomberg News&#8217; David Voreacos, Klaus
Wille and Giles Broom report. 
U.S. and Swiss officials are concluding negotiations on a
civil settlement amid U.S. criminal probes of 11 financial
institutions, including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), suspected of
helping American clients hide money from the Internal Revenue
Service, according to five people with knowledge of the talks
who declined to speak publicly because they are confidential. 
Switzerland, the biggest haven for offshore wealth, wants
an end to new U.S. probes while preserving its decades-old
tradition of bank secrecy, the people said. The U.S. seeks data
on Americans who have dodged U.S. taxes and a pledge by Swiss
banks to stop helping such clients, according to the people. The
Swiss reached accords this year with Germany and the U.K. on
untaxed assets. 
&#8220;The Swiss would like to get out of this by paying money,
and they&#8217;ve done that with other countries,&#8221; said tax attorney
H. David Rosenbloom of Caplin  Drysdale Chartered in
Washington, who isn&#8217;t involved in the talks. &#8220;For the U.S.,
it&#8217;s not primarily a money question. It&#8217;s a matter of making
sure the laws apply fairly among taxpayers.&#8221; 
The Swiss government seeks to outline a final accord for
the Foreign Affairs Committee of its Parliament&#8217;s upper house on
Nov. 10, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
number of banks that will pay to resolve the U.S. negotiations
may extend beyond the 11 under criminal investigation, the
people said. 
&#8220;We are aiming for an all-encompassing solution that will
apply to all the banks,&#8221; Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-
Schlumpf said in an Oct. 4 interview in the Swiss capital Bern.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be confronted with the same issues time and
again.&#8221; 
The Justice Department also may bring criminal charges or
civil enforcement actions against any of the 11 financial
institutions. They could avoid prosecution by separately paying
fines, admitting wrongdoing and disclosing data, the people
said. On Aug. 30, the Justice Department requested statistical
data from the 11 about their U.S. accounts, which the U.S. has
received and is analyzing, the people said. 
The group of 11 also includes HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), the
biggest European bank, Basler Kantonalbank (BSKP), Wegelin  Co.,
Zuercher Kantonalbank, and Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), the people
said. Three Israeli banks -- Bank Leumi Le-Israel BM (LUMI), Bank
Hapoalim BM (POLI), and Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF) -- are on the list,
as well as Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG (LLB) and an asset
manager, NZB AG, according to the people.

New Suits 
Goldman Sachs Sued Over Role in El Paso&#8217;s $21 Billion Buyout 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by a pension fund that
alleges the New York-based investment bank had a conflict of
interest in its role as adviser in the planned $21 billion
purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP) by Kinder Morgan Inc. 
Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder
Morgan, steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. 
&#8220;The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan,&#8221; lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed Oct. 20 in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. 
In addition to Goldman Sachs, the complaint also names
individual El Paso directors and Kinder Morgan. 
While Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser on the
sale, Goldman&#8217;s presence &#8220;tainted the entire process,&#8221; lawyers
for the retirement fund said in the complaint. Goldman continued
to act as financial adviser on &#8220;related matters&#8221; in connection
with the transaction, the pension fund said in the complaint,
citing the companies&#8217; joint press statement. 
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment except to say that the bank&#8217;s representatives on
Kinder Morgan&#8217;s board recused themselves from the deal process. 
Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan,
said in an e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending
litigation. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, also
declined to comment. 
The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Standard Bank Sues Saudi Billionaire Over $150 Million Debt 
Standard Bank Plc sued Saudi billionaire Mohamed bin Issa
al Jaber for $150 million in a London court, saying loans made
to companies in his MBI International  Partners Inc. group
weren&#8217;t repaid. 
The bank says al Jaber personally guaranteed three loans to
JJW Hotels  Resorts Ltd. and Ajwa for Food Industries Co. in
2008, according to court papers outlining its claim. 
Al Jaber, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s third-richest man according to
Arabian Business, believes he has a claim against the bank over
a $96.5 million loss from unauthorized foreign-exchange trades,
his lawyer Catharine Otton-Goulder said Oct. 20 at a pre-trial
hearing. 
He blames Standard Bank, a unit of Johannesburg-based
Standard Bank Group Ltd., for the trades from a personal account
he held with the company and says the loans were provided to
cover the foreign-exchange losses. 
Janice Garraway, a spokeswoman for Standard Bank in London,
declined to comment on the case via e-mail Oct. 20. Gary Pegg,
an attorney for al Jaber, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail requesting
comment.

Brigham Exploration Sued by Shareholders Over Statoil Deal 
Brigham Exploration Co. (BEXP) was sued by shareholders contending
that Statoil ASA (STL)&#8217;s $4.4 billion buyout price is too low. 
The offer price is a discount to the oil and gas producer&#8217;s
52-week high trading price, according to separate suits filed by
the same law firm on behalf of shareholders Robert Fioravanti
and Howard Weisberg. 
&#8220;The proposed transaction is the product of a flawed
process that involved no known open auction,&#8221; Weisberg said
Oct. 20 in a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court. 
Statoil said Oct. 17 that it would buy all of Brigham&#8217;s
shares for $36.50 each, a 20 percent premium to the company&#8217;s
Oct. 14 closing price. The deal is the seventh-largest takeover
announced this year in the oil and gas industry. 
Statoil, Norway&#8217;s biggest oil company, is using Brigham to
expand into unconventional U.S. assets such as the Bakken shale
area in North Dakota. 
The offer price reflects an inadequate premium given
Brigham&#8217;s strong growth prospects and is still below the 23
percent average premium for the industry this year, the
shareholders said. 
The deal also includes preclusive protection devices
include a clause prohibiting Brigham from seeking a third-party
bid and a $136.5 million termination fee that discourages other
potential buyers, according to the complaints. 
Weisberg and Fioravanti are seeking to represent all
Brigham shareholders in their request to bar the transaction. 
Rob Roosa, a spokesman for Brigham Exploration, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call seeking comment. 
The cases are Weisberg v. Brigham Exploration Co., CA6957,
and Fioravanti v. Brigham Exploration Co., CA6962, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington)

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
ATT Seeks to Knock Out Government&#8217;s Ally in T-Mobile Hearing 
ATT Inc. (T) will ask a federal judge to throw out Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)&#8217;s lawsuit to stop its purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., seeking a decision that would curb Sprint&#8217;s ability to
help the U.S. block the deal. 
ATT will argue at a hearing today in Washington that
Sprint, as a competitor rather than a consumer, has no right
under antitrust law to bring the suit and that Sprint&#8217;s claims
the $39 billion deal would hurt its business are unfounded. 
Should ATT persuade U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal
Huvelle to dismiss the case, Sprint&#8217;s advice on the Justice
Department&#8217;s suit would be limited by its restricted access to
confidential ATT information, said Thomas Horton, a law
professor at the University of South Dakota Law School and
former antitrust attorney in the department. 
&#8220;It will expedite the government&#8217;s case to have Sprint as
an official ally,&#8221; said Horton, who spent about eight years in
the antitrust division. 
Sprint told Huvelle on Oct. 12 that to prepare its case it
needed access to confidential data the Justice Department
collected from ATT during the U.S. probe of the proposed T-
Mobile merger. The company said it suffered from &#8220;fundamental
unfairness&#8221; because, as a competitor with relevant information,
ATT is allowed to subpoena Sprint documents in the government&#8217;s
antitrust case. 
Huvelle, overseeing all the ATT cases, froze the document
exchanges while she weighs the motion to dismiss. 
The government&#8217;s case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-01560;
Sprint&#8217;s case is Sprint Nextel Corp. v. ATT Inc., 11-01600; and
Cellular South&#8217;s case is Cellular South Inc. v. ATT Inc.,
11-01690, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington).

Goldman Sachs Asks New York Court to Dismiss Allstate Suit 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a judge in New York state
court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Allstate Insurance Co. over
the alleged fraudulent sale of residential mortgage-backed
securities. 
The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer sued New York-based
Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Aug. 15 over the sale of more than $100 million worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
including the lost market value of the investments. 
Allstate filed the lawsuit and seven similar complaints
against various issuers and underwriters of residential
mortgage-backed securities, using &#8220;generalities and unsupported
assumptions&#8221; to recoup investment losses on certificates it
bought in five offerings in 2006, Goldman Sachs said in court
documents filed Oct. 21. 
&#8220;Despite its financial sophistication and expertise
(including in the housing market, where it is a leading
insurer), Allstate now suffers from buyer&#8217;s remorse and has sued
the counterparties with which it traded at arm&#8217;s length,
claiming in separate actions that each of the eight sellers of
RMBS misled it as to characteristics of the securities,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. 
Allstate has also sued lenders including JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill
Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over residential
mortgage-backed securities. 
The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,
652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). 
Andrew Madoff Seeks Appeal in Picard $198 Million Suit 
Andrew Madoff, son of confidence man Bernard L. Madoff,
asked to appeal a bankruptcy judge&#8217;s ruling that allowed a $198
million lawsuit by the liquidator of his father&#8217;s firm to go
forward, according to a court filing. 
Trustee Irving Picard last month won a court ruling
permitting him to pursue most claims in a 2009 lawsuit alleging
that the Madoffs treated the now-defunct firm, Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC, as their &#8220;family piggy bank.&#8221; U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland also dismissed some claims in
the case while allowing Picard to file a new complaint. 
Andrew Madoff asked a U.S. District Court judge to allow an
appeal, according to Oct. 6 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York. In court papers filed in his own behalf and as
executor of his late brother&#8217;s estate, he said the judge&#8217;s
decision would result in a &#8220;massive expansion of liability&#8221;
for managers of banks and large corporations for the wrongs of
individual units. 
Picard opposed Andrew Madoff&#8217;s request to appeal Oct. 20,
saying in his court papers that Lifland&#8217;s ruling was &#8220;well-
reasoned&#8221; and that he would seek to prove his claims at a
trial. 
In his lawsuit, Picard said that Madoff family members --
including Bernard&#8217;s brother Peter Madoff, sons Andrew and Mark
Madoff and niece Shana Madoff Swanson, all of whom held senior
positions at Madoff Securities -- profited from the fraud. 
Instead of preventing the crime, they took $198 million in
investor money from the New York-based money-management firm to
finance a business venture, pay for restaurants, vacations and
clothing and to buy cars, boats and vacation homes, he said. 
Picard didn&#8217;t try to prove in his complaint that the family
&#8220;engaged in any kind of securities fraud, dishonesty, or
deception,&#8221; only that they were derelict in their duty and
misused company funds, he said in the Oct. 20th filing. 
Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer for Andrew Madoff and Mark
Madoff&#8217;s estate, has said that the Madoff sons didn&#8217;t know of
their father&#8217;s scheme and that they contacted prosecutors after
their father told them of his fraud. Bernard Madoff is serving a
150-year prison term. 
The case is Picard v. Madoff, 09-1503, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

AIG Bid to Move BofA Lawsuit to State Court Denied by Judge 
American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s request to move a $10
billion lawsuit against Bank of America Corp. to state court
from federal court was denied by a U.S. judge. 
AIG in August sued Bank of America in New York state court
over $10 billion in losses on mortgage-bond investments.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America then moved the
case to federal court. 
U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan denied New
York-based AIG&#8217;s request to return the case to state court in an
order dated Oct. 20. 
The case is American International Group Inc. v. Bank of
America Corp., 11-06212, U.S. District Court. Southern District
of New York (Manhattan).

Trials 
Kimelman Appeals Conviction, Sentence for Insider Trading 
Michael Kimelman, the co-founder of Incremental Capital
LLC, appealed his conviction and sentence for insider trading. 
Kimelman, sentenced Oct. 12 to 2 1/2 years in prison,
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, according to
a court filing dated Oct. 20. 
A jury found Kimelman guilty in June in a scheme to bribe
two lawyers at the Boston-based law firm Ropes  Gray LLP to
disclose secret information about companies including 3Com Corp.
and Hilton Hotels Corp. Also found guilty were brothers Zvi and
Emanuel Goffer. 
Kimelman was sentenced a day before Raj Rajaratnam, the
founder of Galleon Group LLC, received an 11-year sentence for
insider trading. Kimelman&#8217;s lawyers include Michael Sommer. 
The case is USA v. Goffer, 10-00056, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Massmart Ruling Failed to Consider Economy, Jobs, Union Says 
South African regulators who let Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) buy
control of Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) failed to take account of
negative effects on the economy or jobs, a lawyer for a union
seeking to dismantle the deal said. 
The Competition Tribunal &#8220;has reached a fundamentally
wrong conclusion&#8221; in its conditional approval of the
acquisition, Paul Kennedy, senior counsel for the South African
Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union, told an appeal
court in Cape Town Oct. 21. &#8220;Certainly this merger will benefit
the shareholders of the merged parties. It may have very
negative consequences. There is a danger of job losses.&#8221; 
The union is asking the Competition Appeal Court to
overturn the tribunal&#8217;s May 31 clearance of Wal-Mart&#8217;s purchase
of a 51 percent holding in Johannesburg-based Massmart, South
Africa&#8217;s biggest food and general-goods wholesaler. Approval was
subject to the companies promising to refrain from firing
workers for two years and set up a fund to assist local
suppliers and manufacturers. 
Wal-Mart, the world&#8217;s largest retailer, paid 16.5 billion
rand ($2.05 billion) in June for the stake in Massmart. On June
26, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said it would create
15,000 jobs in South Africa within five years and spend about 60
billion rand more on food or fast-moving consumer goods in the
period, most of which would go to local suppliers. 
Kennedy said there was a &#8220;dearth of information&#8221; about
what effect the takeover will have on imports and employment,
and that the companies failed to disclose sufficient information
to regulators. 
Judge Dennis Davis, the court president, said that while he
had &#8220;significant difficulty&#8221; with evidence provided by the
companies, &#8220;they can&#8217;t have information that goes outside the
confines of their business.&#8221; 
David Unterhalter, the retailers&#8217; senior counsel, argued
that takeovers under South African law should be approved
provided they don&#8217;t significantly reduce competition. There&#8217;s no
onus on companies to prove a takeover is counter to the public
interest, he said. 
The three-judge panel will &#8220;take time to consider&#8221; its
ruling, Davis said at the conclusion of the hearings Oct. 21,
without specifying a deadline. 
Should the court decide against referring the decision back
to the tribunal, it may either uphold the approval of the
takeover or rule that it should have been rejected or subjected
to different conditions, the judge said Oct. 20. 
The case is South Africa Commercial, Catering and Allied
Workers Union v Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Massmart Holdings Ltd.,
111/CAC/Jul11.

Verdicts/Settlements 
Hedge Fund CEO Brownstein Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading 
Drew &#8220;Bo&#8221; Brownstein, the founder and chief executive
officer of Denver-based Big 5 Asset Management, pleaded guilty
to trading on inside information about a corporate merger. 
Brownstein, 35, made more than $2.5 million in illegal
profits for his hedge fund and for relatives by trading on a tip
in advance of Apache Corp. (APA)&#8217;s $2.7 billion acquisition of Mariner
Energy Inc. (ME) in April 2010, prosecutors said. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ve severely disappointed my family, colleagues,
investors and friends,&#8221; Brownstein told U.S. District Judge
Robert Patterson in Manhattan federal court Oct. 21. &#8220;I&#8217;m truly
sorry.&#8221; 
The sentencing guideline is 37 to 46 months with the plea
agreement, the judge said. Brownstein, who pleaded guilty to one
count of securities fraud, will be sentenced on Dec. 20. He was
released on a $500,000 personal recognizance bond. 
&#8220;You had inside information about the fact that Mariner&#8217;s
stock would probably go up because it was about to be acquired
by another company,&#8221; Patterson said to Brownstein. 
The tip originated with H. Clayton Peterson of Denver, a
retired former Arthur Andersen partner who served on Mariner
Energy&#8217;s board of directors, prosecutors said. Peterson, who was
also a director of Re/Max International Inc. and Lone Pine
Resources Inc., pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in August. His son, Drew, a Denver financial adviser,
pleaded guilty to the same charges. 
Clayton Peterson, who was appointed to Mariner&#8217;s board in
March 2006, said he passed information about the planned
transaction in April 2010 to his son. At his guilty plea, Drew
Peterson, 35, said he bought shares of Mariner stock based on
the tip and passed the information to another unidentified
person who also traded on it. 
The case is U.S. v. Peterson, 11-CR-665, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Macklowe Wins Case Icahn Filed Over Aborted 2006 Reckson Bid 
New York developer Harry Macklowe won a jury verdict that
his company doesn&#8217;t owe Carl Icahn&#8217;s Meadow Star LLC $60 million
for backing away from a 2006 bid to buy six New York skyscrapers
from Reckson Associates Realty Corp. 
Macklowe&#8217;s attorney, Roger Netzer, said a unanimous jury
voted in favor of his client after two hours of deliberations in
a lawsuit filed in 2008 by Meadow Star, an affiliate of Icahn
Enterprises LP, in New York state court in Manhattan. A verdict
was entered Oct. 19 for Macklowe, according to court records. 
Meadow Star alleged Macklowe company WH Rome Partners LLC
failed to put up its half of $1.2 billion to outbid SL Green
Realty Corp. (SLG) for the Reckson buildings, according to court
filings. SL Green paid $4.5 billion in cash and stock to buy all
of Reckson&#8217;s holdings. 
&#8220;A deal is a deal and Mr. Macklowe honored his obligations
under the language of the contract that these very sophisticated
parties had agreed to,&#8221; Netzer said Oct. 22 in a telephone
interview. Herbert Beigel, an attorney who represented Icahn&#8217;s
company at trial, declined to comment about the verdict. 
The aborted offer cost Icahn $60 million, according to his
complaint. Netzer said Macklowe&#8217;s half of the bid wasn&#8217;t
required unless certain conditions were met, including a signed
acquisition agreement with Reckson and a guarantee that the bid
wouldn&#8217;t exceed $1.2 billion. 
The case is Meadow Star LLC v. Harry Macklowe and WH Rome
Partners LLC, 08-603165, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). 
Abbott Said to Agree to Pay $1.3 Billion for Depakote Suits [bn:WBTKR=ABT:US]  
Abbott Laboratories (ABT) [] agreed to pay at least $1.3 billion to
settle claims by the U.S. government and 24 states alleging the
company illegally marketed its Depakote epilepsy drug, people
familiar with the accords said. 
Abbott executives, federal prosecutors and state officials
reached a tentative agreement calling for the drugmaker to pay
about $800 million to resolve civil claims over Depakote and
about $500 million in criminal penalties for marketing the
epilepsy medicine for unapproved uses, said three people
familiar with the settlement who declined to be identified
because the agreement hasn&#8217;t been made public. Abbott said last
week it was reserving $1.5 billion to cover costs of the
potential settlement. 
&#8220;Settlement negotiations are ongoing,&#8221; Scott Stoffel, a
spokesman for Abbott, said in a phone interview Oct. 21. He
declined to comment further. Charles Miller, a U.S. Justice
Department spokesman, had no comment on the settlement. 
The Abbott Park, Illinois-based company said Oct. 19 that
it will split next year, with one company selling medical
products and the other prescription medicines. Powered by
Humira, an anti-inflammatory with $6.5 billion in annual sales,
the new drugmaker may attract a bid from Merck  Co., Roche
Holding AG or Bayer AG, said Jeffrey Holford, a Jefferies Group
Inc. analyst. 
The settlement would be the third-largest illegal
pharmaceutical marketing accord in U.S. history, behind the $2.3
billion Pfizer paid in 2009 over the marketing of its Bextra
painkiller and other drugs and the $1.4 billion Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)
paid the same year over sales of its Zyprexa anti-psychotic
medicine. 
The case is U.S. ex rel. McCoyd v. Abbott Laboratories,
1:07-cv-00081, U.S. District Court, Western District of Virginia
(Abingdon).

Markit to Settle Suit Against Former Employees 
Markit Group Ltd. agreed to settle a lawsuit against two
former employees in Singapore after they pledged not to compete
with the firm for one year. 
Zhibo Li, previously a vice-president of sales, and Shiyang
Cui, who was an associate vice-president, are permanently banned
from using or disclosing information obtained from Markit,
according to a filing with the Singapore High Court this month. 
Markit, a swap prices data provider, sued Li and Cui last
month, accusing them of breaching their employment contracts and
misusing the firm&#8217;s trade secrets to set up rival Fundamentrix
Pte. Li and Cui are also banned from soliciting clients of the
London-based company for one year. 
Caroline Lumley, a spokeswoman at Markit, declined to
comment Oct. 20 on the agreement. Both Li and Cui didn&#8217;t reply
to two e-mails seeking comment. 
The case is Markit Asia Pte.  Ors v Zhibo Li  Ors
S628/2011 in the Singapore High Court. 
News Corp. (NWSA) to Pay $4.8 Million to End Dowler Hacking Case 
News Corp.&#8217;s U.K. unit agreed to pay 3 million pounds ($4.8
million) to settle claims that its News of the World tabloid
hacked the mobile-phone messages of a murdered schoolgirl in
2002, hampering a police investigation. 
The deal -- the biggest payout by News Corp. since the
hacking scandal erupted -- includes a 2 million-pound payment to
the family of Milly Dowler and a 1 million-pound donation to
charity, London-based News International said Oct. 20. News
Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, 80, was personally involved in
the negotiations, a person familiar with the matter said last
month. 
&#8220;When I met with the Dowlers in July, I expressed how
deeply sorry I was for the hurt we had caused this family,&#8221;
Murdoch said in the statement, which indicated he would
personally pay the 1 million-pound charitable donation. &#8220;The
behavior that the News of the World exhibited towards the
Dowlers was abhorrent.&#8221; 
The settlement was confirmed by News Corp. the same day as
the New York-based company&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting in Los
Angeles. U.K. lawmaker Tom Watson, who is part of a government
probe of the scandal, said he would attend the meeting to speak
against the company&#8217;s management. The California Public
Employees&#8217; Retirement System and other large investor groups
have also taken stances aimed at loosening Murdoch&#8217;s control,
citing concerns about how the phone-hacking issue was handled. 
Reports in July that Dowler&#8217;s messages had been
intercepted, hampering a police search when she was still
missing, triggered a public outcry that led News Corp. to close
the 168-year-old tabloid and drop its 7.8 billion-pound bid for
full control of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) The hacking
was previously thought to be limited to celebrities, athletes,
royalty and other public figures.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services provider, added $7 billion
to its share-buyback plan to boost per-share earnings and
investor returns. 
The addition brings the size of the repurchase program to
$12.2 billion, as IBM had $5.2 billion remaining of its previous
repurchase authorization, according to a statement from the
Armonk, New York-based company today. Last week, IBM said it had
bought back $11.5 billion of stock this year. 
&#8220;The buyback program, given their exceptional cash flow,
is one of the key elements of continuing to grow their
earnings&#8221; per share, said Louis Miscioscia, a Collins Stewart
analyst in Boston, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is using buybacks as
he targets operating earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015,
up from $13.35 the company projects for this year. IBM has spent
more than $100 billion on dividends and buybacks since 2003, the
year Palmisano became the chairman. He has also increased
earnings by steering the company toward software and services. 
The company has said it plans to spend $50 billion on
buybacks through 2015. In the third quarter, the reduction in
share count contributed 18 cents to earnings of $3.28 a share,
which beat analysts&#8217; estimates. IBM ended the third quarter with
$11.3 billion in cash. 
Dividend Increases 
IBM also declared a quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share,
payable on Dec. 10. IBM has increased its dividend every year
for 16 years, bumping it to 75 cents in April. Since 2006, IBM
has bumped the dividend up by 10 cents each year, except for in
2009, when the increase was halved amid the recession. 
IBM fell 1 percent to $180.36 at the close in New York. The
shares have climbed 23 percent this year. 
The buyback extension is in line with IBM&#8217;s repurchase
strategy and was largely expected by investors, said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities in New York.

Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the
world&#8217;s largest brokerage, plans to adjust its compensation
structure to boost profitability, according to a person familiar
with the discussions. 
The new pay policies are set to go into effect in 2012,
said the person, who declined to be identified because
compensation decisions aren&#8217;t public. The New York-based firm is
raising the minimum amount of revenue a broker must generate to
avoid pay cuts to $300,000 from $250,000, the person said. 
The plan includes bonuses aimed at giving financial
advisers more incentives to bring in new clients and increase
lending to customers. The changes may bring down the division&#8217;s
compensation ratio as President Greg Fleming seeks to achieve
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman&#8217;s goal of a pretax profit
margin of more than 20 percent at the unit. 
&#8220;Greg Fleming is very focused on expense discipline,
expense management,&#8221; Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer
Ruth Porat said on a conference call last week. &#8220;What he&#8217;s
focused on is reducing the lower productivity FAs and that
brings with it some incremental cost savings as well.&#8221; 
Compensation costs amounted to 62 percent of the global
wealth management division&#8217;s net revenue in the first nine
months of the year, down from 63 percent in the same period of
2010. 
Brokers who produce less than $300,000 will receive a
payout of 20 percent of that revenue, instead of 32 percent or
34 percent, the person said. The average annualized revenue per
adviser in the third quarter was $747,000. The firm is also
changing the makeup and vesting schedule of bonuses for
employees who have been with the firm a minimum of five years. 
Reuters reported the pay changes earlier today. 
Advisers&#8217; Bonuses 
Financial advisers&#8217; bonuses based on revenue production
will be reduced by 1 percentage point across the board, the
person said. Brokers can earn as much as $442,500 under new
bonuses that pay as much as 0.40 percentage point on new client
assets and 0.50 percentage point on new mortgages and other
loans sold to customers, according to the person. 
Morgan Stanley bought a controlling interest in the joint
venture two years ago and has the option to buy the business
outright from Citigroup Inc. over the next three years. The
division, which Fleming took over in January, had 17,291
advisers and $1.56 trillion in client assets as of Sept. 30. 
The brokerage will operate with a &#8220;mid-teens&#8221; pretax
margin by the first half of 2013 &#8220;irrespective of the market,&#8221;
Fleming, 48, said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television
with Erik Schatzker. Rising equity markets and higher interest
rates may push the margin to 20 percent, he said.

Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the
world&#8217;s largest brokerage, will operate with a &#8220;mid-teens&#8221;
pretax margin by the first half of 2013 &#8220;irrespective of the
market,&#8221; according to Greg Fleming, president of the business. 
The brokerage can reach the 20 percent pretax profit-margin
target that Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman
has set for the unit, Fleming, 48, said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television with Erik Schatzker. The division had a 10
percent margin in the first nine months of this year. 
&#8220;Eventually we&#8217;ll have a higher SP and higher interest
rates, and that will be the final piece to put us at and over 20
percent,&#8221; Fleming said. 
Investors are looking for an increase in profitability at
the brokerage joint venture, which Morgan Stanley bought a
controlling interest in two years ago. It has the option to buy
the business outright from Citigroup Inc. over the next three
years. The division, which Fleming took over in January, had
17,291 advisers and $1.56 trillion in client assets as of
Sept. 30. 
&#8220;In a Basel 3 world, with the capital standards changing
on some of the trading businesses, these activities are even
more valuable,&#8221; Fleming said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t think the market today
appreciates the business mix that we have and the earnings power
that it will generate going forward, but we&#8217;re willing to be
patient and continue to stay at it and continue to drive higher
margins and better results, and ultimately the market will
reward that.&#8221; 
Fee-Based Accounts 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will increase revenue in part
by raising the amount of assets in its fee-based advisory
consulting accounts, Fleming said. The firm&#8217;s goal is to more
than double those assets to $1 trillion during the next five
years, from $465 billion as of Sept. 30. 
Fleming said there are three &#8220;revenue drivers&#8221; and two
&#8220;expense levers&#8221; the brokerage can use to improve
profitability regardless of the market environment. Revenue from
deposits, lending and transaction and advisory services, along
with decreasing integration expenses and cost synergies, will
drive the margin improvement, according to a presentation by
Gorman in February. 
A 100-point change in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and a
50 basis-point change in the Fed Funds rate each would have
about a 1 percentage point effect on the brokerage&#8217;s pretax
profit margin, Gorman said in February.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) signed a deal with
Compal Electronics Inc. for tablets, mobile phones, e-readers
and other consumer devices running the Android or Chrome
platform. 
Specific details and financial terms of the agreement
weren&#8217;t disclosed other than a mention that the company will
receive royalties from Taipei-based Compal, Microsoft said in a
statement. 
Microsoft&#8217;s patent licensing business began when Marshall Phelps joined the Redmond, Washington-based software company in

billion dollar business at International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
Phelps was Microsoft&#8217;s Corporate Vice President and Deputy
General Counsel for Intellectual Property and Licensing until
his departure in 2010. 
The company began using litigation as part of its patent-
licensing strategy after Horacio Gutierrez took over management
of the company&#8217;s patent portfolio in 2006. 
In the Microsoft statement, Gutierrez said the licensing
agreement with Compal meant that more than half the companies in

Gigaset, a maker of cordless telephones, said in a
statement yesterday that several products in the AVM FRITZ!

The company is seeking money damages and an injunction
regarding the use of its technology. It also asked for a court
order for destruction of the allegedly infringing products. 
Phyton Sues Samyang in Germany Over Paclitaxel Production Patent 
Phyton Ltd.&#8217;s Phyton Biotech unit filed a patent-
infringement suit against Seoul&#8217;s Samyang Corp., according to a
company statement. 
The suit, filed in a German court, is related to a patent
for plant cell fermentation using cell lines derived from the
Taxus species to produce the paclitaxel compound. Taxus is the
family to which yew trees belong, and paclitaxel is used to
treat a variety of cancers. 
Phyton claims Samyang&#8217;s method of producing paclitaxel
infringed the patent. It asked the court to order Samyang to
halt its alleged infringement, and requested a ban on the sale
and use of Samyang&#8217;s paclitaxel in Germany. 
Phyton, based in San Antonio, is a global supplier of
paclitaxel and docetaxel, a related anti-cancer compound also
produced from yew trees.

Apple Tells German Cafe&#8217;s Logo Infringes Trademarks 
Apple Inc. (AAPL), maker of the iPod and iPad, has sent a cease-

Geek.com technology news website reported. 
Apfelkind cafe, which registered its mark in Munich in
June, was told its logo was confusingly similar to Cupertino,
California-based Apple, according to Geek.com. 
The cafe, which offers a family-oriented coffeehouse
setting with a playroom for kids, features apple-related foods
and drinks on its menu, such as apple blossom tea, Geek.com

McDonald&#8217;s Says Wonderful&#8217;s &#8216;W&#8217; Logo Infringes Arches Trademark 
McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD), the world&#8217;s largest restaurant chain, has
filed a second trademark infringement suit against Wonderful, a
Beijing restaurant, the WantChinatimes.com news website
reported. 
Since 2003 Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald&#8217;s has been
objecting to Wonderful&#8217;s logo, a red letter &#8220;W&#8221; on a yellow
background it says too closely resemble its &#8220;golden arches&#8221;
logo, according to the website. 
Earlier, China&#8217;s trademark appeal board said that despite
McDonald&#8217;s protests, the logo could be used for non-restaurant
purposes, WantChinatimes.com reported. 
McDonald&#8217;s argues in Beijing No. 1 People&#8217;s Court that the
restaurant&#8217;s application to register the mark was made in a
malicious fashion, the website reported. 
Registration Sought for &#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; Trademark 
Interest in the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; movement has led to several new
applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
according to that office&#8217;s trademark database. 
A resident of Los Angeles filed an application Oct. 6 to
register &#8220;Occupy D.C. 2012,&#8221; with the mark to be used on T-
shirts. 
An &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; application was filed Oct. 18 by
a resident of West Islip, New York. According to the
application, the mark would be used for beach bags, back packs,
overnight bags, umbrellas, bumper stickers and clothing. 
On Oct. 19 a resident of Powell, Ohio, filed an application
to register &#8220;Every Where I Go I Occupy.&#8221; That mark would be
used on T-shirts. 
As further evidence of the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; zeitgeist, Caf&#233;Press
Inc.&#8217;s website lists 99 pages of print-on-demand items the San
Mateo, California-based company says are related to the

Comcast Files Suit in Utah over &#8216;The Biggest Loser&#8217; Trademark 
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s Universal City Studios sued 14 Utah-based
companies and residents and another 50 unnamed defendants for
trademark infringement. 
The suit, filed Oct. 21 in federal court in Salt Lake City,
Utah, is related to &#8220;The Biggest Loser&#8221; trademark associated
with Comcast&#8217;s NBC unit&#8217;s television program by the same name. 
According to court papers, the defendants have made
unauthorized use of the trademark on www.premierfitnesscamp.com,
which is used to promote the weight-loss camp with which the
defendants are involved in what Universal calls a &#8220;tangled
web&#8221; of ownership and control. 
Universal claims it has suffered &#8220;great detriment and
injury&#8221; to its trademark, business, goodwill and profits. News
Corp (NWSA) is a co-plaintiff with Universal because of an agreement
sharing the rights to the mark, according to court papers. 
The company asked the court to bar further infringement of
its mark, and for awards of money damages, profits the
defendants realized as the result of their alleged infringement,
and attorney fees and litigation costs. 
Premier Fitness Camp didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-

China Isn&#8217;t Cutting Piracy Enough, Software Alliance Says 
China isn&#8217;t reducing software piracy quickly enough and the
government should aim to cut illegal use by 10 percentage points
in the next two years, according to a trade group that tracks
counterfeiting. 
The country will eventually surpass the U.S. to become the
industry&#8217;s largest source of piracy losses, Robert Holleyman,
chief executive officer of the Business Software Alliance, said
at a press conference in Beijing yesterday. He declined to
provide a more specific forecast. 
In China, almost four out of five programs in use are
pirated, the alliance said in its annual report in May. The
$7.78 billion commercial value of software pirated in China last
year was second only to the $9.52 billion lost in the U.S., the
report said. 
&#8220;We are seeing progress, but it&#8217;s not progress at the pace
we would have liked to have seen or anticipated,&#8221; Holleyman
told reporters. &#8220;Virtually everyone agrees, piracy in China is
higher than it should be.&#8221; 
China isn&#8217;t currently on pace to achieve a 10 percent age-
point reduction over the next two years, Holleyman said. 
Should that target be reached in four years, it would
result in creation of 250,000 industry jobs and generate $4
billion in tax revenue in China, Holleyman said. 
The percentage of software in China that is pirated dropped
to 78 percent last year, from 79 percent in 2009 and 92 percent
in 2003, according to the May report. While the proportion of
stolen software has declined, its value has increased as the
Chinese software market expands, the report said. 
Holleyman called on the country to update its copyright law
to provide for criminal offenses for piracy and said the country
wouldn&#8217;t see a significant decline in the practice unless it
takes that step. The group will &#8220;ramp up&#8221; lawsuits against
users of unlicensed software, he said, without giving details. 
China has said it increased enforcement of intellectual
property rights. Last year, Chinese courts ruled on 48,051 cases
of intellectual property rights violations, a gain of 33 percent
from the previous year, Wang Shengjun, president of the Supreme
People&#8217;s Court, said in a report to the National People&#8217;s
Congress on March 11. 
The value of pirated software worldwide rose 14 percent to
$58.8 billion in 2010, almost double the total in 2003,
according to the group. 
Members of the Washington-based Business Software Alliance
are some of the biggest software companies including Microsoft
Corp., Apple Inc. and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE)

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage 
Leesburg Claims Details of Smart Grid Contract Are Trade Secrets 
The city of Leesburg, Florida, has refused to release the
cost of a contract with General Electric Co. (GE) to own and operate
the city&#8217;s &#8220;smart grid&#8221; electrical grid system, Florida&#8217;s

The city is claiming the price and the details of the
bidding process are trade secrets, according to the newspaper. 
Leesburg Finance Director told the Sentinel that rate
payers needn&#8217;t worry that the project will cause power-delivery
problems because &#8220;as high-profile as GE is, they&#8217;re not going
to let this puppy fail.&#8221; 
City officials have said that once the contract with GE is
signed, the total price will be revealed, minus the specifics of
the bid, the Sentinel reported.

General Dynamics Corp. (GD), maker of
Gulfstream business jets and Abrams tanks, said third-quarter
profit rose 2.5 percent as sales of aircraft and combat vehicles
increased. 
Profit from continuing operations advanced to $665 million,
or $1.83 a share, from $649 million, or $1.70, the Falls Church,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
predicted $1.77 a share, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. 
Chief Executive Officer Jay Johnson said today that he
forecasts full-year profit &#8220;at the high end&#8221; of the $7.15 to
$7.20 per share range. Analysts are forecasting $7.19 per share,
the average of 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;As we plan for 2012, the defense market is shrouded by
the uncertainty&#8221; of Pentagon funding, Johnson said in an
earnings conference call. Congress has not yet approved a
Pentagon budget for fiscal year 2012, which started Oct. 1, and
a special congressional committee has been tasked with finding
ways to trim government spending by at least $1.2 trillion. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that defense spending will be part of
addressing our nation&#8217;s economic problems,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;The
manner and degree to which cuts are made will dictate how they
impact our industry.&#8221; 
&#8216;Looks Resilient&#8217; 
Total sales declined 2 percent to $7.85 billion. General
Dynamics had about $2.16 billion in cash on hand for the quarter
ending July 3. 
&#8220;This was another good operating performance from General
Dynamics, with margins offsetting some top-line weakness,&#8221;
Robert Stallard, a New York-based analyst for RBC Capital
Markets, wrote in a note to clients today. &#8220;Gulfstream backlog
continues to grow, and it looks like the G650 is still on
track.&#8221; He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on the stock. 
Sales at the Aerospace unit, the maker of Gulfstream jets,
rose 9.4 percent to $1.41 billion from $1.29 billion the year
before. Profit at the unit rose 9 percent to $217 million from
$199 million. 
General Dynamics&#8217; Gulfstream unit is adding new models as
demand for business jets starts to rebound, according to unit
President Larry Flynn. Gulfstream expects to boost deliveries
about 10 percent this year and more than 15 percent next year as
the long-range G650 enters service, Flynn said in a recent
interview. 
G650 Certification 
General Dynamics expects provisional certification for the
G650 in the &#8220;next several weeks,&#8221; Johnson said today. 
For the G280 jet, the company anticipates Israeli
certification by the end of the year. U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration certification is expected to slip into the first
part of 2012, according to Johnson. 
During the quarter the Aerospace unit received an order for
20 Gulfstream aircraft, worth $810 million, from Minsheng
Financial Leasing, a Chinese aviation leasing company. 
Sales at the Combat Systems unit, which manufactures Abrams
tanks and Stryker vehicles, rose 3.4 percent to $2.14 billion. 
Profit rose 2.6 percent to $319 million. General Dynamics
during the quarter was awarded $440 million for the technology
development phase of the U.S. Army&#8217;s new ground combat vehicle
program. 
Stryker Contract 
The Army also awarded General Dynamics $250 million to
produce 115 Stryker vehicles with a double V-shaped hull to
protect against roadside bombs, the company said in its earnings
statement today. 
In addition, General Dynamics received an order from the
Canadian government to upgrade the Canadian Army&#8217;s fleet of LAV
III combat vehicles. The order was valued at $1.05 billion. 
The Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology
units had a decline in revenue and reported an increase in
profit. 
Revenue at the Marine Systems unit, which builds nuclear-
powered submarines and Navy destroyers, fell 4.6 percent to
$1.62 billion, while profit rose 2.4 percent to $173 million.
During the quarter, the unit received a $1.8 billion order from
the U.S. Navy for the engineering, design and construction of
two DDG-1000 destroyers, which are scheduled for delivery in
2015 and 2018. 
Information unit sales fell 9.2 percent to $2.68 billion
and profit rose 1.3 percent to $310 million, the company said in
its statement today. 
Two Acquisitions 
Johnson has said that acquisitions are &#8220;very important&#8221;
to General Dynamics, both to expand its current portfolio and to
fill gaps. 
General Dynamics on Sept. 30 completed the acquisition of
Vangent Holding Corp., the parent company of Vangent Inc., a
health-care information technology provider to the federal
government. The cash transaction was valued at about $960
million. 
It announced on Sept. 21 that it had bought privately held,
400-employee Metro Machine Corp., an East Coast surface-ship
repair company that supports the Navy&#8217;s fleet in Norfolk,
Virginia. The government approved the deal on Oct. 19. General
Dynamics did not disclose the value of the cash transaction. 
The company said it expects both acquisitions to be
&#8220;accretive&#8221; to the company&#8217;s earnings beginning in 2012. 
General Dynamics fell $1.37, or 2.1 percent, to $63.89.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is among
firms that could gain by buying part or all of MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MF), said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale
Securities LLC. 
&#8220;Goldman could benefit from MF Global&#8217;s plight,&#8221; Bove
said in a note today. &#8220;One might argue that Goldman is over
capitalized and that it has too much liquidity. Buying some or
all of MF Global might create the opportunity to make a windfall
profit.&#8221; 
MF Global, run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jon Corzine, is exploring strategic options, including a potential
sale, after reporting its biggest quarterly loss ever and having
its credit ratings cut by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, a person
with knowledge of the matter said today. 
The firm needs to generate liquidity and find a partner
with excess capital and a &#8220;sizable&#8221; trading operation, Bove
said in a telephone interview. Goldman Sachs, which Corzine
helped run from 1994 to 1999, and Citigroup Inc., both based in
New York, would be &#8220;logical buyers,&#8221; he said. 
David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos at Citigroup declined to comment. 
Large deposit-taking banks may not want to buy MF Global
because they would have to set aside cash to back the futures
trades placed by the firm&#8217;s customers, said Allan Zavarro, the
former global head of futures trading for ABN Amro Bank NV.
Regulatory capital in the range of 6 percent to 10 percent of
client funds on deposit must be set aside by the broker or bank,
Zavarro said. 
Capital Allocation 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure the big banks would want a big futures
position on their books now because they have to allocate
regulatory capital to it,&#8221; he said in an Oct. 25 telephone
interview. As of Aug. 31, MF Global had $7.2 billion of customer
funds in segregated accounts, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. 
In 2008, MF Global sold $300 million in preferred shares
and notes to the public and as much as $300 million in equity-
linked securities to buyout firm JC Flowers  Co. to help repay
a $1.05 billion bridge loan. 
Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR), the investment bank founded by
former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, might also
show interest in a deal with MF Global, Bove said. The firm is
advising MF Global on the review of its business, said a person
with knowledge of the matter today. Evercore may be interested
in providing advisory clients with the ability to raise funds
through a fixed-income trading platform, Bove said. 
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if Evercore jumped up as a
company that was going to acquire them,&#8221; he said. Such a deal
might not resolve MF Global&#8217;s liquidity needs, he said. 
Evercore would more likely be interested in fee-based, low-
capital-intensive businesses, said Warren Gardiner, an analyst
for Ticonderoga Securities LLC. 
Dana Gorman, a spokesman for Evercore, declined to comment.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised holdings in the past year in the
London Metal Exchange, the 134-year old bourse that&#8217;s facing a
possible takeover. 
Goldman increased its stake in LME Holdings Ltd. by 330,000
ordinary shares to 1.23 million shares as of Sept. 26, according
to filings with the U.K.&#8217;s Companies House. JPMorgan owned
800,000 shares compared with 550,000 shares a year earlier,
while ScotiaMocatta transferred 30,000 shares in the period to
leave the company with no shares, the filings show. 
The LME, which handles 80 percent of global trade in metals
futures, told members last month that it would begin a process
that may lead to &#8220;an acceptable offer for the company being
received.&#8221; Any sale would take at least until the end of the
second quarter to complete, Martin Abbott, chief executive
officer, said earlier this month. The bourse operates London&#8217;s
last open-outcry transactions in which traders shout out orders. 
The exchange issues two share classes. Ordinary shares
confer ownership and 330,000 of them traded at 4.925 pounds
($7.89) in July, according to data on the bourse&#8217;s website. B
shares exchanged hands at 85.425 pounds on Sept. 27. Neither
shares trade on an exchange. 
LME spokeswoman Miriam Heywood declined to comment on the
latest holdings. Sophie Bullock, Goldman&#8217;s spokeswoman, declined
to comment. Kate Haywood, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson may struggle to reach his full-year
production target after rallying oil prices reduced the
company&#8217;s take from wells in Africa and output slumped in the
U.S. and Europe. 
Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest company by market value, needs
to boost production in the current quarter to the equivalent of
5 million barrels a day to meet the 4 percent growth target for
2011 that Tillerson set forth during a March presentation to
analysts in New York. 
The closest Exxon ever came to pumping that much crude and
natural gas was during the final three months of 2010, when
daily output reached 4.97 million barrels. Even with new wells
in Iraq and Russia adding to the company&#8217;s global production,
Tillerson may fall short of the mark, said Allen Good, an oil-
industry analyst at Morningstar Investment Services Inc. in
Chicago. 
&#8220;I&#8217;d be surprised if they hit that number,&#8221; Good said
during a telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re having long-term trouble
growing oil volumes and I don&#8217;t see how they get to five&#8221;
million barrels a day. 
Exxon&#8217;s worldwide oil and gas production declined by 3.8
percent during the July-to-September period to the equivalent of
4.28 million barrels of crude a day, the Irving, Texas-based
company said yesterday in a statement. It was the lowest output
since the second quarter of last year and the largest decline
since 2008, according to Bloomberg data. 
Production Agreements 
When international crude prices rise, energy prospectors
such as Exxon receive a smaller portion of output from wells
governed by production-sharing contracts in countries like
Nigeria. In Africa, which accounts for more than one-fifth of
Exxon&#8217;s global crude supply, the company&#8217;s output tumbled 24
percent during the quarter, the biggest decline anywhere in the
world. 
In Europe, Exxon&#8217;s crude output dropped 16 percent,
according to a company statement. U.S. oil production from Exxon
wells declined by 5.8 percent. The company boosted crude output
in Asia by 7.3 percent to 806,000 barrels a day. 
Excluding the impacts of higher crude prices, asset sales
and quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Exxon&#8217;s output was unchanged from a year earlier,
David Rosenthal, the company&#8217;s vice president of investor
relations, said during a conference call with analysts
yesterday. 
Major Producer 
On that basis, Exxon may be able to meet its full-year
production forecast, he said during the call. In March, at the
company&#8217;s annual presentation to the investment community at the
New York Stock Exchange, Tillerson forecast production growth of
as much as 4 percent this year. 
Such a growth rate would translate into full-year average
daily output equivalent to 4.625 million barrels, compared with
4.447 in 2010, based on Bloomberg calculations. 
Exxon pumps about 3 percent of the world&#8217;s oil, producing
more than OPEC members such as Kuwait and Algeria, according to
International Energy Agency figures. The company&#8217;s $396 billion
market valuation exceeds the economic output of all but 22
nations. 
Exxon is outperforming its biggest rivals, advancing 12
percent since the end of last year. PetroChina Co. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), the second- and third-largest oil companies by
market value, have increased 2.2 percent and 10 percent,
respectively. 
Exxon abandoned a well in the Turkish sector of the Black
Sea during the third quarter that failed to find oil or gas,
Rosenthal said yesterday. The dry hole followed recent
exploration failures by the company in Brazil, where Exxon is
attempting to sell a 25 percent stake in an offshore prospect. 
Unconventional Prospects 
Tillerson is spending as much as $37 billion this year to
search for crude, erect gas-liquefaction plants and expand
refineries and chemical plants. The company spent $38 billion in
the past 16 months acquiring shale-rock formations and the
expertise to crack them as part of Tillerson&#8217;s move into so-
called unconventional prospects that require intensive drilling
techniques. 
Exxon also is counting on production increases from mega-
projects such as the Kearl oil-sands development in Canada, the
West Qurna oilfield in Iraq and Sakhalin-1, an offshore oil and
gas project in Russia&#8217;s Far East, said Douglas Ober, whose $1.6
billion under management includes Exxon shares at Adams Express
Co (ADX) and Petroleum  Resources Corp. (PEO) in Baltimore. 
Project Pipeline 
&#8220;They are probably going to fall a little short&#8221; of the
production target this year, said Ober, whose holdings include
1.6 million Exxon shares. &#8220;That said, they&#8217;ve got a bunch of
projects coming on stream in the next couple of years that will
add a lot to output. To expect them to keep having new projects
come online constantly is unrealistic.&#8221; 
Exxon&#8217;s output during the current quarter probably will get
a boost as the European winter begins and rising furnace use
increases demand for gas from Exxon-run fields in countries such
as the Netherlands, Morningstar&#8217;s Good said. European wells
account for 25 percent of the company&#8217;s worldwide gas
production.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, said net income exceeded $10
billion for a third consecutive quarter as rallying crude prices
more than made up for the biggest production decline in three
years. 
Oil and natural-gas production fell 3.8 percent to the
equivalent of 4.28 million barrels of crude a day, the largest
decline since the third quarter of 2008, according to Bloomberg
data. The drop was smaller than the double-digit production
shortfalls reported earlier this week by rivals such as BP Plc,
ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp. (HES) 
Third-quarter profit rose to $10.33 billion, or $2.13 a
share, from $7.35 billion, or $1.44, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said today in a Business Wire statement. The
per-share result was in line with the average estimate of 19
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 32 percent to $125
billion. 
&#8220;These guys keep pushing the oil out and selling it like
it&#8217;s going out of style,&#8221; Douglas Ober, who manages $1.6
billion at Adams Express Co. and Petroleum  Resources Corp. in
Baltimore. 
$10 Billion Streak 
The last time Exxon&#8217;s quarterly profits exceeded $10
billion for three consecutive periods was 2008, when Brent oil
touched an all-time record of $147.50 a barrel and the company
reaped $45.22 billion in full-year net income. So far this year,
Exxon shares have risen 12 percent, poised for the best annual
performance since 2007. 
Exxon&#8217;s 41 percent profit increase was the second-largest
among major international oil companies that have announced
third-quarter results. Only Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the world&#8217;s
third-largest energy company by market value behind Exxon and
PetroChina Co., boasted a larger jump, by doubling net income to
$7 billion. 
State-controlled PetroChina lifted third-quarter profit by
7.8 percent. BP Plc, owner of the Macondo well that erupted last
year and fouled the Gulf of Mexico with millions of barrels of
crude, posted a 3.6 percent decline in net income.
ConocoPhillips (COP), based in Houston, said third-quarter profit fell
14 percent. 
Rounding out the largest international oil companies,
Chevron Corp. and France&#8217;s Total SA are scheduled to announce
results tomorrow, followed by Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo
Brasileiro next month. 
Spending Plans 
Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s oil, jumped 46 percent during the July-through-September
period to average $112.09 a barrel. 
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson plans to spend
as much as $37 billion this year to find untapped oil and gas
reserves, construct gas-export terminals and expand refineries
and chemical plants. In August, Tillerson signed a $3.2 billion
agreement with Russia&#8217;s state-controlled OAO Rosneft to drill
wells in the Black Sea and offshore Arctic. 
In exchange, Moscow-based Rosneft will be allowed to invest
in some deep-water Gulf of Mexico and onshore Texas prospects,
David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, said
today during a conference call with analysts. Exxon won&#8217;t swap
any assets with Rosneft, he said. 
Outlining Growth 
The Rosneft deal was Exxon&#8217;s biggest transaction since its
$34.9 billion acquisition last year of XTO Energy, a Fort Worth,
Texas-based natural-gas producer. Tillerson is using XTO&#8217;s
expertise in cracking open dense, gas-rich shale rock to access
previously-impenetrable geologic formations in Poland and
elsewhere. 
Exxon shares rose 1 percent to $81.88 at the closing of
trading in New York. The stock has 14 buy recommendations from
analysts, 11 holds and two sells. 
Exxon&#8217;s crude output fell 7.1 percent to 2.25 million
barrels a day, led by declines in Africa, the U.S. and Europe,
according to the statement. The company raised gas output in
Europe and the U.S. 
A well in the Turkish sector of the Black Sea that failed
to discover oil or gas has been plugged and abandoned, Exxon&#8217;s
Rosenthal said today. 
Exxon plans to begin drilling for oil in the Romanian
sector of the Black Sea next year and the Russian sector in
2014, Rosenthal said. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the company today increased its
estimate for the size of the column of oil-soaked rock
discovered in the Hadrian prospect to 1,000 feet (305 meters)
from a previous 750-foot estimate. The figure was revised after
additional drilling, Rosenthal said. In June, when the discovery
was announced, Exxon said the field probably holds the
equivalent of 700 million barrels of crude.

Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s El Segundo refinery
in California is conducting planned maintenance that may result
in flaring through tomorrow. 
The refinery may flare gases until 10 a.m. local time
tomorrow, according to a South Coast Air Quality Management

the facility,&#8221; Rod Spackman, a spokesman for the San Ramon,

repairs this weekend, a person with direct knowledge of the work
said Oct 26.

Chevron Corp. (CVX) reported its biggest
quarterly profit in three years, outperforming other major oil
companies, as rising crude prices and proceeds from the sale of
a refinery made up for a slump in production. 
Third-quarter net income more than doubled to $7.83
billion, or $3.92 a share, from $3.77 billion, or $1.87, a year
earlier, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a
statement today. Excluding a gain from the sale of a Welsh
refinery, the per-share result was 22 cents more than the
average of 19 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chevron quit the European oil-refining market in August
when it sold the U.K. refinery and related assets to Valero
Energy Corp. (VLO), a transaction that accounted for $500 million of
third-quarter results. Production fell to the equivalent of 2.6
million barrels of oil a day, from 2.74 million for the same
period last year. Sales rose 30 percent to $64.4 billion. 
&#8220;They are benefiting from higher crude prices and
strategic asset sales,&#8221; Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire
Advisory  Research Inc., a Chicago-based risk-management
consultant to the energy industry. &#8220;I&#8217;d expect production to
bounce back in the near future.&#8221; 
Oil and natural-gas production was less than the 2.63
million barrels a day forecast by Paul Cheng, a New York-based
analyst at Barclays Plc. Two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico,
maintenance work at oil installations and less production from
some overseas joint ventures hurt output, the company said. 
Chevron posted the largest year-on-year third-quarter
profit increase among major international oil producers that
have announced results. 
Other Results 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc&#8217;s 100 percent gain was the second-
largest, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp., which reported a 41
percent increase, and Total SA, which boosted profit by 13
percent. PetroChina Co. said net income rose 7.8 percent, while
BP Plc and ConocoPhillips saw profit decline. 
&#8220;Chevron is the strongest of the majors right now,&#8221; said
Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis
who rates the shares a &#8220;buy.&#8221; &#8220;Even with production coming in
a little lower than my expectations, they offset that with
pretty strong refining results.&#8221; 
Chevron was paid an average of $103 for each barrel of
crude produced outside the U.S. during the quarter, up 47
percent from $70 a year earlier, the company said. International
oil prices soared as growing demand bumped up against supply
constraints in Libya. Chevron gets 74 percent of its crude
outside the U.S., according to an Aug. 4 regulatory filing. 
Chevron rose less than 1 percent to close at $109.64 in New
York. The shares have gained 20 percent this year. 
Profit from oil and gas sales climbed 74 percent to $6.2
billion, the company said. Refining profits more than tripled to
$1.99 billion from $565 million. 
The proceeds from the sale of the Pembroke refinery in
Wales accounted for 22 cents a share in profit, Youngberg said.

Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd.,
an Australian hedge fund, filed a new lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over the sale of securities known as Timberwolf
and Point Pleasant after a similar complaint was dismissed. 
The suit, filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, accuses
New York-based Goldman Sachs of &#8220;knowingly making materially
false and misleading statements and omissions&#8221; in connection
with the securities. 
&#8220;Within weeks after BYAFM entered into these transactions,
they precipitously declined in value, as defendants knew and
intended they would,&#8221; Basis Capital said in the complaint. &#8220;As
a result, BYAFM lost more than $67 million plus consequential
damages.&#8221; 
A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital over the securities
was dismissed this year by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan, who ruled the Australian fund couldn&#8217;t use U.S.
securities laws to pursue its claims against Goldman Sachs. 
Jones&#8217;s ruling followed a decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court last year in Morrison v. National Australia Bank. In that
decision, the high court said U.S. securities laws don&#8217;t apply
to the claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S. securities on
foreign exchanges. 
Not Misled 
Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, said the U.S. bank acted appropriately and Basis Capital
wasn&#8217;t misled. 
&#8220;Basis and Goldman Sachs relied on the same data on the
underlying mortgages and both were well aware of the prevailing
global market conditions,&#8221; Naylor said in a phone interview
today. &#8220;Goldman Sachs was also an investor in Timberwolf
securities and lost several hundred million dollars.&#8221; 
The suit filed yesterday relates to Point Pleasant, a
collateralized debt obligation based on subprime residential
home mortgages, and two credit default swaps that referenced
securities from a similar CDO known as Timberwolf, Basis Capital
said in the lawsuit. 
Basis accuses Goldman Sachs of marketing new CDO
investments in early 2007, after the company had already
determined that the value of securities in that market &#8220;would
likely go into sharp decline in the near future,&#8221; and used the
new CDOs as a vehicle to short the market, the lawsuit says. 
Basis Capital said Goldman was formalizing its Timberwolf
deal with the fund during the same week that a Goldman Sachs
executive sent an e-mail describing the Timberwolf investment as
&#8220;one shi--y deal.&#8221; 
&#8216;Key Part&#8217; 
&#8220;The Point Pleasant and Timberwolf offerings were a key
part of this Goldman strategy, and provided a vehicle for
Goldman to unload its toxic inventory and to profit from the
decline in value of the very securities it was recommending that
its clients purchase.&#8221; 
Basis Capital is seeking to recover the $67 million and
$1 billion in punitive damages, according to the lawsuit. 
The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master), 652996/2011,
New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, added M. Michele Burns as an
independent director, expanding its board to 12 members and
adding a third woman to the board for the first time. 
Burns, 53, was chairman and chief executive officer of
Mercer, a unit of Marsh  McLennan Cos., until earlier this
month, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a statement today.
She was recently named to plan and design a new retirement
policy center for Marsh  McLennan, Goldman Sachs said. Her
election was effective yesterday. 
Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, has been seeking
new directors since H. Lee Scott, the former Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) CEO, left Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board earlier this year and Brown
University President Ruth Simmons stepped off the board in May
2010. Goldman Sachs, which reported its second quarterly loss in
12 years as a public company this month, named Barnard College
President Debora L. Spar to the board in June. 
Burns and Spar join Lois D. Juliber, the former Colgate-
Palmolive Co. vice chairman who has served on the Goldman Sachs
board since March 2004, in making women represent one quarter of
the board&#8217;s members. Rival banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. each have two female
directors.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is winning
higher ratings from analysts than Apple Inc. (AAPL), the iPad maker
that doubled since its low last year, after the European debt
crisis battered the U.S. bank&#8217;s shares. 
The two companies are among 15 in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
1500 Composite where &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendations made up 85 percent
of analyst ratings and there were no &#8220;sells,&#8221; data compiled by
Bloomberg Rankings as of Oct. 24 show. Stocks with fewer than 15
analysts covering them were excluded. For JPMorgan, the total
was 89.5 percent, compared with 87.5 percent at Apple. 
JPMorgan shares are lagging behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index by 15 percentage points this year after investors sold
banks amid concern the European crisis would prompt losses.
Following its decline, no other financial institution in the
U.S. has more support from analysts. 
&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be beaten up,&#8221; Jeff Harte, a Chicago-based
financial analyst at Sandler O&#8217;Neill  Partners LP, said in a
telephone interview on Oct. 26. During the last financial crisis
in 2008, JPMorgan &#8220;capitalized on others&#8217; weakness.&#8221; 
JPMorgan, based in New York, topped Bank of America Corp.
as the biggest U.S. lender by assets as of Sept. 30 and posted
more trading revenue than any other Wall Street firm for the
fourth straight quarter. 
The company was profitable every quarter during 2007 and
2008 as the collapse of the subprime mortgage market prompted
$2.1 trillion in writedowns and losses at banks, brokerages and
other financial firms worldwide. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon bought Bear Stearns Cos. and the banking unit of
Washington Mutual Inc. amid the turmoil three years ago. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Drop 
JPMorgan has retreated 13 percent since Dec. 31, while the
SP 500 posted a gain of 2.1 percent, turning positive for the
year yesterday for the first time since Aug. 3. The stock, which
had 34 &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings and four &#8220;holds&#8221; as of Oct. 24, is
beating its peers. The diversified financials group in the SP
500 has slumped 20 percent in 2011. 
&#8220;JPMorgan tends to be run more conservatively, which is
probably why it&#8217;s liked by its analysts,&#8221; Craig Hodges,
president of Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management Inc., who
oversees about $700 million, said in an Oct. 26 phone interview. 
Besides JPMorgan and Apple, the 15 companies include Google
Inc. (GOOG) and Halliburton Co. (HAL), according to Bloomberg data. The most-
favored stocks in the SP 500 beat the entire index since the
last bear market ended 2 1/2 years ago, the data show. They
returned 144 percent on average since March 9, 2009, versus 90
percent for the SP 500. Since the index peaked this year in
April, the 15 stocks have lagged behind, falling 3 percentage
points more than the measure.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), owner of the ABC
TV network and Disney Channel, will license a limited number of
its older TV shows to Amazon&#8217;s Prime streaming video service,
the world&#8217;s biggest Internet retailer said in a statement. 
Disney will license more than 800 episodes of such shows
as ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Lost&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; and &#8220;Phineas and

almost 13,000 episodes by early next year, he said. 
The newly licensed Disney content will be available on
more than 300 devices, including Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire, the
company said. The movies are only available to consumers who
pay $79 a year for Amazon&#8217;s Prime delivery service. Amazon
didn&#8217;t give terms for the agreement. 
Disney also extended its agreement with Netflix to add
older movies and TV shows for that service as well, according
to a separate statement. Episodes from Disney and ABC series
will be made available to Netflix 30 days after the final
episode of each season airs, according to that statement.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, plans to hire staff and be &#8220;physically
present&#8221; in West and central Africa&#8217;s French-speaking nations,
regional General Manager Simon Ouattara said. 
So far this year, the Redmond, Washington-based company has
placed employees in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Guinea, Benin and
Republic of Congo and plans to be present in all 17 Francophone
nations in the region, as well as Cape Verde and Sierra Leone,
Ouattara said in an interview in Abidjan, Ivory Coast&#8217;s
commercial capital, yesterday. 
Microsoft wants to &#8220;support our partners better by placing
the managers closer to them,&#8221; Victoria N&#8217;dee Uwadoka, marketing
manager for the region, wrote in an e-mailed response to
questions. &#8220;Our interest is basically to increase the business
opportunities for Microsoft and also for our partners,&#8221; she
said. 
Ouattara said Microsoft wants to take advantage of
investments other companies are making in the West African
nation, which is seeking to lure investment and boost growth
following a violent post-election crisis. 
&#8220;There is a mass of initiatives and projects in the
country at the moment, and a lot of companies are equipping
themselves again in software,&#8221; he said. 
Ivory Coast&#8217;s economy may contract 5.8 percent this year
after the crisis that was sparked by ex-leader Laurent Gbagbo&#8217;s
refusal to cede power to Alassane Ouattara after a November
election. Businesses shut their doors, banks closed their
branches and cocoa exports were largely halted in the world&#8217;s
biggest producer of the chocolate ingredient. 
In April, Gbagbo was captured in Abidjan and a month later,
Ouattara sworn in as leader. The economy may expand 8.5 percent
next year as cocoa exports and gold mining increases along with
spending on electricity and roads. 
Microsoft currently has offices in Senegal and Cameroon and
staff in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said the company&#8217;s
Ouattara, who is not related to the president.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s purchases of
Treasury securities in Brazil, where benchmark yields averaged
almost 12 percent this month, helped push the bank&#8217;s holdings in
South America&#8217;s biggest economy 40 percent higher in two months. 
Assets at JPMorgan&#8217;s Brazilian unit jumped to 22.5 billion
reais ($12.6 billion) as of Aug. 31 from 16.2 billion on June
30, Claudio Berquo, chief executive officer of the business,
said in an interview in Sao Paulo. About 4 percent is company
loans and most of the rest is Treasury securities, according to
the unit&#8217;s chief financial officer, Cristiano Almeida. 
The Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy of keeping its benchmark
interest rate near zero percent in the U.S. is pushing
investments offshore, said Richard Bove, a bank analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC. Brazil&#8217;s real-denominated bonds
returned 14 percent in the past year, compared with the 7
percent average return in local currency terms on JPMorgan&#8217;s
government bond index for emerging markets. 
&#8220;We are having a wonderful year in Brazil, better than
planned,&#8221; Berquo, 50, said. 
Bond purchases by the New York-based bank contributed to a
46 percent jump in earnings from Brazil in the first eight
months of 2011, to 94.5 million reais, even after the bank
boosted expenses to continue investing in the country, according
to Almeida. 
Goldman Sachs 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. have also
targeted Brazil for a bigger share of their investments. New
York-based Goldman Sachs said earlier this year that Brazil was
one of three countries, along with China and India, where most
of its hiring efforts have been concentrated. Citigroup, also
based in New York, added more than 340 employees in Brazil in
the month of March alone. 
&#8220;U.S. banks have got to find growth somewhere, and they&#8217;re
not going to find it in the United States if the economy is
going to lope along at the current level,&#8221; said Bove, whose
company is based in Lutz, Florida. 
Loans to Brazilian companies represent a small percentage
of JPMorgan&#8217;s assets in the country because the bank has only
just started offering credit denominated in reais, Berquo said.
Dollar loans remain the majority of JPMorgan&#8217;s lending to
companies in the country, and those assets, which Berquo
declined to quantify, are booked in New York. 
The Brazilian unit had 952.9 million reais of loans
outstanding as of Sept. 11, about twice as much as the level in
December 2009, he said, adding that the bank&#8217;s goal is to lend
to the top 300 Brazilian firms with annual revenue above 1
billion reais. 
Room to Grow 
&#8220;We are already doing business with half of these
companies, but we still have a lot of room to grow,&#8221; he said. 
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will crimp the amount of credit
international banks are willing to lend Brazilian companies and
banks, Berquo said. &#8220;A lot of banks will cut credit to
Brazilian clients and the spreads are going to go up,&#8221; and that
trend may be an opportunity for JPMorgan to gain market share,
he said. 
As part of that effort, JPMorgan moved about 923 million
reais in capital into Brazil in September, and &#8220;we will bring
in as much as needed,&#8221; Berquo said. 
JPMorgan was the 23rd largest bank by capital in Brazil as
of June 30, with 1.7 billion reais, according to central bank
figures. Itau Unibanco Holding SA, the biggest, had 67.2 billion
reais. 
Oil and Gas 
&#8220;We want to finance the biggest oil and gas projects, the
infrastructure projects, we want to be a big credit bank in
Brazil,&#8221; Berquo said, adding that trade finance and export-
prepayment loans are also being targeted. 
&#8220;But we are also planning to start participating in the
local bond markets, which are open right now and more attractive
than international markets,&#8221; he said. 
JPMorgan hired Ricardo Leoni from Santander to head fixed
income in Brazil, and plans to bring on more people after the
end of the bonus season in February, Berquo said. JPMorgan has
more than doubled its headcount, to 750 employees from 339,
since Berquo came back from New York to head the Brazilian
operation at the end of 2009. 
The bank is also expanding in asset-management for larger
companies and institutional investors and has 40 people devoted
to the business so far. 
Last year, JPMorgan bought Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the
wealth-management company founded by former Brazilian central
bank Governor Arminio Fraga, for an undisclosed amount. The bank
also has a private-equity arm, One Equity Partners, to invest
JPMorgan&#8217;s own money. That business in Brazil is run by Veronica
Serra, the daughter of Jose Serra, who ran for the presidency
last year against Dilma Rousseff and lost. 
&#8220;We will keep growing in the asset-management business, in
private and corporate banking,&#8221; Berquo said, adding that the
plan is to reach 1,000 employees by the end of 2014.

(Corrects number of index members in eighth paragraph.) 
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of top-seller Lipitor to help cushion
tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic versions reach
the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. 
Lipitor, which is Pfizer&#8217;s biggest product, loses U.S.
patent protection on Nov. 30. The New York-based company is
looking for ways to replace its $10.7 billion in annual revenue
as cheaper copies drive down prices. 
&#8220;There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace,&#8221; Read said today on a conference
call discussing third-quarter earnings. A nonprescription
version of Lipitor wouldn&#8217;t be available until at least 2013
because of the regulatory process to get it approved, he said. 
&#8220;We have no definitive evidence we can do it,&#8221; Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. 
The loss of Lipitor&#8217;s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said
yesterday in a report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the
top spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. 
&#8216;Rapid&#8217; Decline 
Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be &#8220;very rapid.&#8221; Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. &#8220;We believe it would be economically
important, but you have to look in the context of some of the
larger OTC brands,&#8221; he said. The company&#8217;s Advil and Centrum
nonprescription drugs generate $175 million to $250 million each
per quarter, Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said in the
interview. 
Pfizer increased 1.3 percent to $19.50 at 3:10 p.m. New
York time, while the other 29 companies in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average index fell. 
Divesting Units 
The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. 
The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor&#8217;s
prescription. 
Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) for $16.6 billion. 
Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. 
Pfizer reported third-quarter earnings today that beat the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by 6 cents
a share, as increased sales overseas and favorable exchange
rates helped boost revenue. Profit excluding one-time items was
62 cents a share. 
Net income increased more than fourfold to $3.74 billion,
or 48 cents a share, from a year earlier when the company had
charges related to an acquisition and asbestos litigation,
Pfizer said in a statement.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) seeks a lien on
all of MF Global Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s assets and may have a lien on
its operating account balance of $26.6 million, the bank said. 
MF Global, which filed for bankruptcy with assets of $41
billion, has five operating accounts, all with JPMorgan. The
bank may have a lien on the entire balance because of so-called
setoff rights related to a credit line to MF Global where it
acts and agent and lender, the New York-based bank said in a
filing. 
&#8220;JPMorgan asserts, and the debtors admit, that &#8216;by virtue
of such setoff rights, such funds may be subject to liens in
favor of&#8217;&#8221; JPMorgan, it said. 
Lenders move to protect themselves after a bankruptcy
filing. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, made the statement in
an objection filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today
to a cash management plan proposed by the company. Limits should
be placed on the company&#8217;s use of cash, it said. 
JPMorgan holds less than $80 million of the MF Global&#8217;s
debt, said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank and acts as an agent to lenders for a $1.2 billion
credit line to MF Global Holdings and a $300 million credit line
to its broker-dealer unit. 
Protect Collateral 
JPMorgan seeks the on all of MF Global&#8217;s assets to protect
its collateral, including proceeds of potential lawsuits, as
well as reimbursement for its own legal fees in the bankruptcy,
it said in the filing. The bank also asked Bankruptcy Court
judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan to limit intercompany transfers
and order the company to deliver it a budget and full list of
its assets. MF Global has asked to have until Jan. 30 to report
a full list of its assets and debts. Glenn will hold a hearing
today beginning at 3 p.m. 
&#8220;Although JPMorgan is hopeful the debtors will be able to
generate meaningful recoveries for creditors, no one, including
the debtors, can predict whether, when and to what extent this
may actually occur,&#8221; lawyers from Simpson, Thacher  Bartlett
LLP wrote, representing the bank. 
JPMorgan said it won&#8217;t allow its collateral to backstop
payment of the administrative expenses for MF Global&#8217;s
bankruptcy.  MF Global asked for a carve-out for some of its
professionals of $4 million, which would apply if a
reorganization fails and there aren&#8217;t enough assets to pay for
the costs of liquidation. 
No Recovery Prediction 
MF Global&#8217;s request should be limited because the firm has
&#8220;no reliable basis for predicting the extent to which creditors
may expect to see a recovery here,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a filing
today in bankruptcy court. 
&#8220;There is a real risk that every dollar of cash collateral
spent as the debtors propose will be potentially lost&#8221; if the
request is granted, the bank said. 
MF Global filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy
yesterday, after failing to find a buyer over the weekend. The
New York-based futures broker suffered a ratings downgrade and
loss of customers after revealing it had investments related to
$6.3 billion in European sovereign debt, leading to the filing.
Regulators are investigating hundreds of millions of dollars
that may be missing from its client accounts, two people have
told Bloomberg News. 
MF Global drew almost all of a $1.2 billion credit line
that was amended last year to give it more liquidity, and its
broker-dealer unit has borrowed about $210 million of a $300
million secured credit line. JPMorgan Chase is the agent to
lenders who supplied credit for both loans. 
The bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF), 11-bk-
15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, separated responsibility for its capital markets
business into two groups, naming new heads for equity and debt. 
Andy O&#8217;Brien and Jim Casey will become co-heads of global
debt capital markets, a team combining debt capital markets and
leveraged finance, investment-banking chief Jeff Urwin said in
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. The two previously ran
syndicated and leveraged finance in North America together. 
Viswas Raghavan, formerly head of international capital
markets, will become global head of equity capital markets as
the bank combines its regional teams, according to the New York-
based lender. Raghavan will remain based in London. 
&#8220;Clients in all regions are facing similar issues and
increasingly are seeking access to capital outside their home
markets,&#8221; Urwin said. &#8220;Investors want to broaden the
geographic reach of their investments.&#8221; 
O&#8217;Brien and Casey are succeeding Therese Esperdy, who ran
global debt capital markets and is leaving to become co-head of
Asia Pacific investment banking with Todd Marin, who previously
ran the group alone, according to an Oct. 24 internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg. Esperdy and Marin will run JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank throughout Asia Pacific, except Japan, said the
memo from Urwin and Gaby Abdelnour, chairman and chief executive
officer for Asia Pacific. 
Best-Paid Bank 
JPMorgan, the most profitable U.S. bank, was the world&#8217;s
best-paid investment bank in 2010 in the Bloomberg 20 ranking of
advisers, with total fees of $4.14 billion. The bank also led
the field in fees from bond and equity issues. 
So far this year, JPMorgan ranks No. 1 among underwriters
in high-yield and high-grade debt and No. 2 behind Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in U.S. leveraged loans, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
O&#8217;Brien took the lead in pulling together a $20 billion,
unsecured loan to Dallas-based ATT Inc. in March-- one of the
largest unsecured corporate loans ever. The financing package
helped the bank land the deal advising the telecommunications
company&#8217;s $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG&#8217;s wireless
unit, T-Mobile USA.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest

The bank was testing a $3 fee in Georgia and northern

Morgan Stanley (MS) fell as much as 12
percent in New York trading, leading financial stocks lower on
concern a Greek referendum on Europe&#8217;s bailout plan will worsen
the region&#8217;s debt crisis. 
Morgan Stanley dropped $1.11, or 6.3 percent, to $16.53 at
10:37 a.m., the biggest decline in the 81-company Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index, which slid 2.3 percent. Citigroup
Inc. (C) fell 4.3 percent and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) decreased 4.1
percent. 
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou plans to hold a
referendum after details of last week&#8217;s second bailout package
for Greece are approved. The move poses a threat to financial
stability in the euro region and increases the risk of a
&#8220;disorderly&#8221; default, Fitch Ratings said. 
&#8220;Macro uncertainty is certainly the word of the day,&#8221;
Thomas Brown, chief executive officer of Second Curve Capital
LLC, said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In The Loop.&#8221; &#8220;There is
a lot of concern that the European solution is going to fall
apart and we&#8217;re going to have a global recession.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley has dropped 14 percent in the past two
trading days. Shares of the New York-based firm rallied 27
percent during the previous two weeks as the firm reported
earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates and said it had $2.1
billion of net exposure to the peripheral European countries. 
MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) became the first U.S. bank to
collapse under the weight of the crisis, filing for bankruptcy
yesterday after a $6.3 billion bet on European debt. 
Missing Funds 
U.S. regulators are investigating whether hundreds of
millions of dollars are missing from client accounts at MF
Global, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The firm was ordered by the enforcement division of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to preserve records for the
review, one of the people said. 
EU leaders carved out a second aid package for Greece at a
summit in Brussels last month after Papandreou scraped together
parliamentary approval for the second round of austerity
measures in four months. Greece will receive 130 billion euros
($180 billion) in public funds plus a 50 percent writedown on
Greek debt, following a fully taxpayer-funded package of 110
billion euros extended in May 2010.

Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and

chosen as a top currency fundamentals analyst in an annual
survey by J-Money, a Japanese financial magazine. 
Sasaki, who moved up from third place last year, was

strategist at Citigroup Inc. (C) in Tokyo. Minori Uchida, a senior
analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., and Atsushi Kobayashi, head of foreign-exchange sales at BNP Paribas in
Tokyo, were tied for third. 
J-Money, previously known as the Japanese version of the
Euromoney magazine, based the ranking on an August survey of 797
institutional investors in the Tokyo foreign-exchange market.
The ranking was published in its Autumn 2011 edition. 
The top financial firms in terms of currency trading were
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, No. 1 for a sixth-straight year,

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), the U.S. coal
producer that paid C$5.3 billion ($5.2 billion) for Western Coal
Corp. in April, fell 6.7 percent after forecasting fourth-
quarter profit that was lower than analysts&#8217; estimated. 
Net income will be $120 million to $150 million, or $1.91
to $2.39 a share, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in
a statement today. That compares with the $2.64-a-share average
of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Sales of hard-coking coal, which is used by steelmakers,
will be 2.1 million to 2.3 million tons in the quarter.
Production will be 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons, Walter said. 
Third-quarter net income fell 44 percent to $76.2 million,
or $1.21 a share, from $136.2 million, or $2.55. That beat the
$1.12 average of 17 analysts&#8217; estimates. 
Sales rose 49 percent to $690.1 million from $464.2
million. 
Walter dropped to $68.80 as of 6:29 p.m. in New York.

Total SA (FP) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) to become the first and only
Asian company in the top five, according to a list published by

firm&#8217;s financial performance in fiscal 2010 in asset worth,
revenue, profit and return on invested capital, the energy news

Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR), the energy explorer being acquired by
Vedanta Resources Plc (VED), was the fastest-growing Asian company on
the list, according to Platts. The firm was placed 120 in the
overall ranking. 
Apart from PetroChina, China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. (600028),
known as Sinopec, was the only other Asian company to rank in
the global top 10, the pricing service said. 
Britain&#8217;s BP Plc (BP/), Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), the Brazilian

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) paid
bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. about $438 million for
the defunct firm&#8217;s stake in 10 Virginia buildings, according to
a court filing. 
Lehman, which has said it expects enough votes by Nov. 4
to back a $65 billion liquidation plan, has been buttressing its
real estate to prepare for more sales. Last year it said it
would spend as much as $262.5 million to pay mortgages on the 10
office buildings it owns with partners in Rosslyn, Virginia, a
suburb of Washington. Lehman&#8217;s share of the investment was
$206 million and its partners&#8217; share was $56.5 million, it said. 
Yesterday&#8217;s filing disclosing the price followed an Oct. 31
statement that New York-based Goldman Sachs was the buyer of
Lehman&#8217;s stake. Lehman, also based in New York, may receive
another $10 million for the properties and other sums through
2015, it said in the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. 
The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ),
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of Lipitor, its top-selling drug, to help
cushion tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic
versions reach the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
said. 
Lipitor loses U.S. patent protection on Nov. 30. The New
York-based company is looking for ways to replace its $10.7
billion in annual revenue as cheaper copies drive down prices. 
&#8220;There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace,&#8221; Read said yesterday in a
conference call discussing third-quarter earnings. 
A nonprescription version of Lipitor wouldn&#8217;t be available
until at least 2013 because of the regulatory process needed to
get it approved, he said. 
&#8220;We have no definitive evidence we can do it,&#8221; Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. 
The loss of Lipitor&#8217;s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said in
an Oct. 31 report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the top
spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. 
Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be &#8220;very rapid.&#8221; Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. 
&#8220;We believe it would be economically important, but you
have to look in the context of some of the larger OTC brands,&#8221;
he said. 
The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. 
The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor&#8217;s
prescription. 
Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. 
Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. 
AMD Loses Bid for Immediate Halt to S3 Patent Case Against Apple 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) failed to persuade a U.S. judge
to halt a patent dispute S3 Graphics Co. has against Apple Inc. (AAPL)
at the U.S. International Trade Commission, according to a
filing with the trade agency. 
AMD, a maker of chips for Apple computers, sued S3 last
month, claiming it owned the patents that S3 has asserted
against Apple. In an Oct. 28 filing with the ITC, S3 said the
federal judge denied a request for an immediate halt to the ITC
case. The commission is scheduled to release its final decision
on Nov. 15. 
The civil suit is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. v. S3
Graphics Co., 11-cv-965, U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware (Wilmington). 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Devices
with Image Processing Systems, 337-724, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). 
Piramal Healthcare Settles Patent Litigation With Baxter 
Piramal Critical Care Inc., a unit of India&#8217;s Piramal
Healthcare Ltd. (PIHC), settled patent litigation related to Baxter
Healthcare Corp.&#8217;s Suprane inhaled anesthetic. 
Piramal didn&#8217;t disclose terms of the settlement in a
statement. Baxter filed the suit in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware, in 2009, accusing Minrad International Inc. of Orchard
Park, New York, of infringing patent 5,617,906. 
Baxter, based in Deerfield, Illinois, sued shortly after
Piramal said it would acquire Minrad. 
The case is Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. Minrad Inc., 1:09-

Trademark 
&#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; Draws Competing Trademark Applications 
Two competing applications have now been filed to register
&#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; as a trademark, according to the most
recent listings in database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. 
One group lists itself as &#8220;Occupy Wall Street,&#8221; and uses
a New York City address. According to its website, Occupy Wall
Street  is a &#8220;leaderless resistance movement with people of
many colors, genders and political persuasions.&#8221; 
The other applicant, Fer-Eng Investments LLC, lists an
address in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Vincent Ferraro of Fer-
Eng told Cable News Network that his company had no affiliation
with the movement and simply filed the application as a business
proposition. 
Both applications were filed Oct. 24. The California
applicant said the mark would be used mainly for clothing and
accessories such as T-shirts, backpacks and hats. 
The New York applicant seeks to register the mark for a
broader range of uses, including newsletters, periodicals, and
photo, audio, video and press &#8220;educational and entertaining
materials relating to Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement
in general.&#8221;  That application also seeks to register the mark
for clothing items such as t-shirts. 
The application from the California company doesn&#8217;t list an
attorney. The New York application was submitted on Occupy Wall
Street&#8217;s behalf by Wylie Stecklow, a New York attorney who does
criminal defense, immigration and plaintiffs personal injury
work, according to his website.

Copyright 
&#8216;Hello Dolly&#8217; Set Design Infringed, Copyright Holder Claims 
The holder of copyright to stage sets designed by the late
Oliver Smith sued a New Orleans costume and fabric shop for
copyright infringement. 
Smith, who died in 1994, was known for his innovative set
design for American Ballet Theater productions such as
&#8220;Rodeo,&#8221; &#8220;Fancy Free,&#8221; and &#8220;Swan Lake.&#8221; He also designed
the Broadway productions of &#8220;Hello Dolly,&#8221; &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;
and &#8220;Auntie Mame.&#8221; 
Rosaria Sinisi of Brooklyn, New York, is the inheritor of
the Smith copyrights, according to the complaint filed in
federal court in New Orleans. For a fee, she licenses the
copyrights for use in productions in the U.S, and abroad, she
said in the complaint. 
Broadway Bound Costumes Inc. of New Orleans bought a set
for a production of &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221; from a licensee, and used it
for a production of the musical at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux
Carre, in New Orleans&#8217; French Quarter in 2003 and has since
rented the set to productions in New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts, according to court papers. 
Sinisi claims that the New Orleans company never had the
right to use the design in any performance or to rent the set to
others using this design. She also accused Broadway Bound of
modifying the design without permission. 
As a result of the company&#8217;s actions, Sinisi said she&#8217;s
harmed and claims she will continue to sustain &#8220;substantial,
immediate and irreparable injury&#8221; without intervention by the
court. 
She asked the court to bar further infringement of her
copyright, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. 
Sinisi is represented by Jennifer Stierman Edwards and R.
Vaughn Cimini of Cimini  Associates of Metairie, Louisiana. 
The case is Sinisi v. Broadway Bound Costumes Inc., 2:11-
cv-02625-ILRL-ALC, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). 
First Infringement Notices Under New Law Hit New Zealand ISPS 
The first infringement notices have been received by
Internet service providers under New Zealand&#8217;s newest copyright
regime, the New Zealand Herald reported. 
To date, all notices were sent by the Recording Industry
Association of New Zealand, according to the newspaper. 
Most of the first batch of infringement notices were
related to unauthorized downloading of music by Rihanna, Lady
Gaga and the British musician Taio Cruz, according to the
newspaper. 
In many cases, teenage children of the Internet subscribers
did the unauthorized downloading, which meant that the
infringement notices are likely to be an unpleasant surprise to
recipients, the Herald reported. 
Taiwan Funeral Homes Become Music Copyright Enforcement Targets 
As part of growing efforts toward copyright enforcement,
nine infringement suits were filed against Taiwan funeral homes
in connection with the pre-recorded music they use at funerals,
the Voice of America reported. 
The funeral homes say they shouldn&#8217;t have to pay the $30
per service demanded by the music studios, according to VOA. 
The music is based on Buddhist chants and not protected by
copyright, VOA reported.

Manga Creator Says Copyright Change Will Damage His Industry 
Ken Akamatsu, creator of the &#8220;Negima&#8221; and &#8220;Love  Hina&#8221;
series of the Japanese comics known as &#8220;manga,&#8221; warned that
changes in Japan&#8217;s copyright law could destroy derivative self-
published works and diminish the entire Japanese comics
industry, AnimeNation reported. 
Japan is presently involved in regional trade-agreement
discussions involving nine other nations, aimed at making
copyright laws more uniform, according to AnimeNation. 
If Japan joins the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement
under discussion, a formal complaint from the content owner
would no longer be required to trigger infringement prosecution,
AnimeNation reported. 
Akamatsu, who operates the j-comi.jp website, posts, with
permission of the creators, derivative self-published works
alongside the originals, according to AnimeNation.

The New York Yankees will focus on
&#8220;pitching, pitching, pitching&#8221; as they seek to improve their
starting rotation and bullpen during the Major League Baseball
offseason, General Manager Brian Cashman said. 
Cashman said hitting isn&#8217;t a concern for New York, which
had a major league best 222 regular-season home runs this year
while ranking second to the Boston Red Sox in runs scored and
runs batted in. By contrast, Yankees pitchers combined for a
3.73 earned run average to rank 11th of 30 major league teams. 
&#8220;As we enter the process this winter, I don&#8217;t anticipate a
bat being of need at all,&#8221; Cashman told reporters on a
conference call yesterday. &#8220;Our main focus and efforts are
going to be to continue to support and reinforce the pitching
rotation and bullpen.&#8221; 
Cashman&#8217;s comments probably rule out attempts by the
Yankees to sign first basemen Albert Pujols or Prince Fielder,
the top sluggers in this year&#8217;s free agency class. 
Fielder ranked second in the majors during the regular
season with 120 runs batted in and was fifth with 38 home runs
for the Milwaukee Brewers, one more than Pujols had for the St.
Louis Cardinals. Curtis Granderson and Mark Teixeira of the
Yankees finished second and third in the majors with 41 and 39
home runs respectively. 
&#8220;Offense is not an issue that we&#8217;ll be focusing on,&#8221;
Cashman said. &#8220;It will be the pitching. I feel our offense is
very, very strong.&#8221; 
Free Agents 
C.J. Wilson, Mark Buehrle and Hiroki Kuroda are leading
pitchers entering free agency. 
Wilson finished the regular season with a 16-7 record and
2.94 ERA for the Texas Rangers, who lost the World Series in
seven games to the Cardinals. Buehrle went 13-9 with a 3.59 ERA
for the Chicago White Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers&#8217; Kuroda
finished the year with a 13-16 mark and 3.07 ERA. 
The Yankees two days ago agreed to an extension with All-
Star pitcher CC Sabathia that could keep him in pinstripes
through the 2017 season. Locking in Sabathia was a key part of
the team&#8217;s strategy, Cashman said. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s certainly the most important piece as we entered
this process,&#8221; Cashman said. &#8220;CC provides us a lot of
security.&#8221; 
While the Yankees re-signed Sabathia, they had eight
players become free agents, including starting pitchers Bartolo Colon and Freddy Garcia, and catcher Jorge Posada, who has been
with the team since 1995. Free agents are allowed to sign with
any team starting at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. 
Burnett to Stay 
A.J. Burnett will probably remain in the starting rotation
and New York is open to re-signing Colon and Garcia, Cashman
said. Burnett had a 5.15 ERA in the regular season this year to
rank 94th in the major leagues. 
The Yankees, who had an opening day payroll of about $202
million that was the highest in baseball, won the American
League East this year with a 97-65 record and fell in the first
round of the playoffs to the Detroit Tigers. 
Cashman yesterday signed a three-year contract extension.
The 44-year-old&#8217;s previous three-year, $6 million contract
expired two days ago. Financial terms of his new deal weren&#8217;t
disclosed. 
Cashman joined the Yankees in 1986 as a 19-year-old intern.
He was 31, baseball&#8217;s youngest general manager at the time, when
he took over from Bob Watson in February 1998, two years after
the Yankees won their first title in 18 years. 
In Cashman&#8217;s 14 seasons in the team&#8217;s front office, the
Yankees have won 11 AL East division titles and World Series
championships in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. 
Cashman&#8217;s career winning percentage of .605 (1,369-895) is
the best of any major league general manager with at least five
seasons of experience since 1950.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of Lipitor, its top-selling drug, to help
cushion tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic
versions reach the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
said. 
Lipitor loses U.S. patent protection on Nov. 30. The New
York-based company is looking for ways to replace its $10.7
billion in annual revenue as cheaper copies drive down prices. 
&#8220;There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace,&#8221; Read said yesterday in a
conference call discussing third-quarter earnings. 
A nonprescription version of Lipitor wouldn&#8217;t be available
until at least 2013 because of the regulatory process needed to
get it approved, he said. 
&#8220;We have no definitive evidence we can do it,&#8221; Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. 
The loss of Lipitor&#8217;s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said in
an Oct. 31 report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the top
spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. 
Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be &#8220;very rapid.&#8221; Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. 
&#8220;We believe it would be economically important, but you
have to look in the context of some of the larger OTC brands,&#8221;
he said. 
The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. 
The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor&#8217;s
prescription. 
Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. 
Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. 
AMD Loses Bid for Immediate Halt to S3 Patent Case Against Apple 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) failed to persuade a U.S. judge
to halt a patent dispute S3 Graphics Co. has against Apple Inc. (AAPL)
at the U.S. International Trade Commission, according to a
filing with the trade agency. 
AMD, a maker of chips for Apple computers, sued S3 last
month, claiming it owned the patents that S3 has asserted
against Apple. In an Oct. 28 filing with the ITC, S3 said the
federal judge denied a request for an immediate halt to the ITC
case. The commission is scheduled to release its final decision
on Nov. 15. 
The civil suit is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. v. S3
Graphics Co., 11-cv-965, U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware (Wilmington). 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Devices
with Image Processing Systems, 337-724, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington).

Trademark 
&#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; Draws Competing Trademark Applications 
Two competing applications have now been filed to register
&#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; as a trademark, according to the most
recent listings in database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. 
One group lists itself as &#8220;Occupy Wall Street,&#8221; and uses
a New York City address. According to its website, Occupy Wall
Street  is a &#8220;leaderless resistance movement with people of
many colors, genders and political persuasions.&#8221; 
The other applicant, Fer-Eng Investments LLC, lists an
address in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Vincent Ferraro of Fer-
Eng told Cable News Network that his company had no affiliation
with the movement and simply filed the application as a business
proposition. 
Both applications were filed Oct. 24. The California
applicant said the mark would be used mainly for clothing and
accessories such as T-shirts, backpacks and hats. 
The New York applicant seeks to register the mark for a
broader range of uses, including newsletters, periodicals, and
photo, audio, video and press &#8220;educational and entertaining
materials relating to Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement
in general.&#8221;  That application also seeks to register the mark
for clothing items such as t-shirts. 
The application from the California company doesn&#8217;t list an
attorney. The New York application was submitted on Occupy Wall
Street&#8217;s behalf by Wylie Stecklow, a New York attorney who does
criminal defense, immigration and plaintiffs personal injury
work, according to his website.

Copyright 
&#8216;Hello Dolly&#8217; Set Design Infringed, Copyright Holder Claims 
The holder of copyright to stage sets designed by the late
Oliver Smith sued a New Orleans costume and fabric shop for
copyright infringement. 
Smith, who died in 1994, was known for his innovative set
design for American Ballet Theater productions such as
&#8220;Rodeo,&#8221; &#8220;Fancy Free,&#8221; and &#8220;Swan Lake.&#8221; He also designed
the Broadway productions of &#8220;Hello Dolly,&#8221; &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;
and &#8220;Auntie Mame.&#8221; 
Rosaria Sinisi of Brooklyn, New York, is the inheritor of
the Smith copyrights, according to the complaint filed in
federal court in New Orleans. For a fee, she licenses the
copyrights for use in productions in the U.S, and abroad, she
said in the complaint. 
Broadway Bound Costumes Inc. of New Orleans bought a set
for a production of &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221; from a licensee, and used it
for a production of the musical at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux
Carre, in New Orleans&#8217; French Quarter in 2003 and has since
rented the set to productions in New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts, according to court papers. 
Sinisi claims that the New Orleans company never had the
right to use the design in any performance or to rent the set to
others using this design. She also accused Broadway Bound of
modifying the design without permission. 
As a result of the company&#8217;s actions, Sinisi said she&#8217;s
harmed and claims she will continue to sustain &#8220;substantial,
immediate and irreparable injury&#8221; without intervention by the
court. 
She asked the court to bar further infringement of her
copyright, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. 
Sinisi is represented by Jennifer Stierman Edwards and R.
Vaughn Cimini of Cimini  Associates of Metairie, Louisiana. 
The case is Sinisi v. Broadway Bound Costumes Inc., 2:11-
cv-02625-ILRL-ALC, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). 
First Infringement Notices Under New Law Hit New Zealand ISPS 
The first infringement notices have been received by
Internet service providers under New Zealand&#8217;s newest copyright
regime, the New Zealand Herald reported. 
To date, all notices were sent by the Recording Industry
Association of New Zealand, according to the newspaper. 
Most of the first batch of infringement notices were
related to unauthorized downloading of music by Rihanna, Lady
Gaga and the British musician Taio Cruz, according to the
newspaper. 
In many cases, teenage children of the Internet subscribers
did the unauthorized downloading, which meant that the
infringement notices are likely to be an unpleasant surprise to
recipients, the Herald reported. 
Taiwan Funeral Homes Become Music Copyright Enforcement Targets 
As part of growing efforts toward copyright enforcement,
nine infringement suits were filed against Taiwan funeral homes
in connection with the pre-recorded music they use at funerals,
the Voice of America reported. 
The funeral homes say they shouldn&#8217;t have to pay the $30
per service demanded by the music studios, according to VOA. 
The music is based on Buddhist chants and not protected by
copyright, VOA reported. 
The five Taiwan music-collection management societies may
also begin demanding payment for live performances of music at
some funerals, according to VOA. 
Manga Creator Says Copyright Change Will Damage His Industry 
Ken Akamatsu, creator of the &#8220;Negima&#8221; and &#8220;Love  Hina&#8221;

Morgan Stanley (MS) won a narrowing of
claims in a lawsuit by Singapore investors who said the firm
induced them to buy synthetic collateralized debt obligations
that were designed to fail. 
U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand on Oct. 31 granted the
firm&#8217;s request to throw out the claims of negligent
misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
aiding and abetting. Sand, in New York, allowed other claims of
fraud and breach of good covenant and good faith to continue. 
Last year, a group of investors sued Morgan Stanley, the
sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, alleging it created
collateralized debt obligations -- a debt security usually
backed by bonds or corporate loans -- and failed to inform the
investors that it was a counter-party to the agreements. For
each dollar the investors lost, the bank gained a dollar, the
investors said. 
Sand said the plaintiffs &#8220;have pled what amounts to self-
dealing by Morgan Stanley, insofar as Morgan Stanley was betting
against, or &#8216;shorting&#8217; the synthetic CDOs that it had itself
created. The engineered frailty of the CDOs and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
positions on both sides of the deal adequately alleges motive.&#8221; 
&#8216;Place on Guard&#8217; 
The judge said that New York-based Morgan Stanley hasn&#8217;t
proffered evidence to suggest that investors were &#8220;placed on
guard&#8221; and concluded the plaintiffs have shown sufficient
evidence that they acted reasonably in relying upon the firm&#8217;s
statements. 
&#8220;Even a sophisticated investor armed with a bevy of
accountants, financial advisers, and lawyers could not have
known that Morgan Stanley would select inherently risky
underlying assets and short them,&#8221; Sand said. 
Several Morgan Stanley units created the scheme to redirect
funds into the bank&#8217;s own coffers, the investors including the
Singapore Government Staff Credit Cooperative Society Ltd. said
in the complaint. 
The case is Dandong v. Pinnacle Performance Limited, 10-
CV-8086, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Buyout firms circling Regions
Financial Corp. (RF)&#8217;s Morgan Keegan brokerage unit lowered bids by
at least $200 million after financing markets deteriorated and
MF Global Holdings Ltd. filed for bankruptcy, according to
people with direct knowledge of the process. 
Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and Jeffrey Greenberg&#8217;s Aquiline
Capital Partners LLC submitted the highest offer at about $750
million, the people said, asking not to be named because the
talks are private. The group topped a joint bid from Carlyle
Group LP and Blackstone Group LP (BX), according to the people, who
said previous offers valued the unit at more than $1 billion. 
A deal hasn&#8217;t been reached and talks could fall apart as
Regions is pushing both groups to raise their price, the people
said. Regions, based in Birmingham, Alabama, has been planning
to use proceeds from the sale to boost capital and pay back a
$3.5 billion U.S. bailout. Regions has indicated it plans to
collect a $250 million dividend from Morgan Keegan prior to any
sale, increasing proceeds from the business, the people said. 
Evelyn Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Regions, declined to
comment on Morgan Keegan. Shares of the company rose 5 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $3.93 in New York trading at 1:39 p.m. They&#8217;ve
lost 44 percent this year. 
Regions is among the biggest U.S. banks that have yet to
repay the Treasury Department rescue. The company said in June
it was exploring options for Morgan Keegan, which provides
brokerage and investment-banking services. Founded with five
workers in 1969, the unit has more than 300 offices and 4,400
employees across the Southeast and Midwest, including Texas,
Missouri, Ohio, the Carolinas and Florida. 
Third-Quarter Profit 
Morgan Keegan agreed to be sold to Regions in 2000 for
about $789 million. The unit, based in Memphis, Tennessee, had a
$26 million third-quarter profit, Regions said on Oct. 25. That
was up from $22 million a year earlier and a decrease from $60
million in the second quarter. 
Regions Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, 54, told
investors in September that the Troubled Asset Relief Program
repayment would depend on achieving &#8220;sustainable profitability&#8221;
and an improvement in credit metrics, not just a successful
resolution of the review of Morgan Keegan. Regions, the 10th-
largest U.S. bank by deposits, has said it hired Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) to help examine options for the unit and find ways to
manage capital and increase shareholder value. 
Stifel Financial Corp. (SF), a brokerage based in St. Louis,
also bid for Morgan Keegan and was rejected, people with
knowledge of the matter said last month. Among the reasons was a
concern that Morgan Keegan executives and brokers, some of whom
opposed selling to a competitor, might quit before the purchase
was completed and jeopardize the deal, they said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon was targeted by protesters during a keynote
speech in Seattle last night, with activists picketing and
chanting &#8220;banks got bailed out, we got sold out.&#8221; 
More than 100 participants weathered pouring rain and
temperatures in the 40s to air frustrations as Dimon, 55,
addressed the University of Washington Foster School of
Business&#8217; annual business leadership dinner. 
At least three protesters said they were hit with pepper
spray as they tried to block entrances to a Sheraton hotel,
where the dinner was closed to the public. Activists held signs
that called for Dimon&#8217;s arrest and compared his hourly wage,
which they calculated at around $10,000, with about $23 for an
average worker. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re bringing to the surface the pent up
disappointment, anger, frustration and fear that the American
people has with the direction that the economy and country has
taken over the last decade,&#8221; said John Taylor, president and
CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a
Washington-based non-profit group that represents affordable
housing charities. 
Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the Seattle demonstrations. 
Occupy Wall Street activists have repeatedly targeted Dimon
as they protest income disparity, the influence of money on
politics and the use of taxpayer funds to rescue banks in 2008.
They marched from Wall Street in downtown New York to his home
on the upper East Side on Oct. 11. The route also included
demonstrations outside homes of News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch,
billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson and Republican donor
David Koch. 
Avoided Losses 
Dimon, who runs the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,
saw his institution through the recession without posting a
quarterly loss. He has said that JPMorgan, which took $25
billion in money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, did so
only to encourage other banks to participate and shore up the
financial system, not because it needed the money. 
Boston, San Francisco, Washington and London are among
cities where rallies have been held to protest banks and their
executives. People are focusing lenders&#8217; role in creating the
housing crisis and the impact it had on the economy and
unemployment, said Taylor. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not Jamie personally, it&#8217;s the institutions
themselves and what they are doing or not doing,&#8221; he said. 
&#8216;Do the Right Thing&#8217; 
More than 1,200 people signed an online petition last year
urging Syracuse University in New York to rescind Dimon&#8217;s
invitation as the commencement speaker. Dimon presented the
address, telling students to have the courage to speak the
truth, even when it&#8217;s unpopular. He told graduates to &#8220;do the
right thing, not the easy thing&#8221; and not to become someone
else&#8217;s &#8220;lapdog or sycophant.&#8221; 
Less than a dozen graduates protested in silence by
removing their caps and gowns during his speech. While Dimon
urged graduates to hold him and other CEOs accountable for their
actions, he warned against indiscriminately judging all
executives based on the failings of a few as &#8220;another form of
prejudice and ignorance.&#8221; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s okay for us at times to blame and be dissatisfied
with others and hold them responsible, but it&#8217;s not okay to
oversimplify and paint everyone with the same brush,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It should not be acceptable to denigrate entire groups, not
all companies, not all CEOs, not all politicians, not all media,
not all students.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said its traders lost money on 16 days in
the third quarter as turmoil in Europe roiled bond and equity
markets. 
The bank had 177 days of positive trading revenue in the
first nine months, including five days in which the gains
exceeded $200 million, according to a regulatory filing today by
New York-based JPMorgan. The biggest U.S. lenders have leaned on
trading operations this year to boost profit as results at
consumer-related businesses sagged. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s nine-month perfect trading record ended in the
second quarter with two days of losses, as concern rose that
Greece would default on its debt and U.S. lawmakers would fail
to raise the debt ceiling. In all, JPMorgan&#8217;s traders lost money
on 26 days during the past seven quarters. 
Trading revenue averaged $76 million a day during the first
nine months. Revenue at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment-banking unit,
which houses the trading desks, fell 13 percent from the second
quarter to $6.4 billion.

General Electric Co. (GE) officials told
U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, in their first
meeting since he took the post, that they&#8217;ll keep pressing to
win congressional backing for an alternative F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter engine. 
David Joyce, chief executive officer of General Electric
Aviation, and other company officials met on Monday with Carter,
who became deputy defense secretary last month, according to GE
spokesman Rick Kennedy and Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. 
The Pentagon in April told General Electric and partner
Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/) that it was ending the secondary engine
program for Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)&#8217;s F-35. Since then, the U.S.
House has included provisions in its version of the annual
defense authorization bill to revive the project, which GE and
Rolls-Royce plan to self-fund. The Obama administration opposes
the legislation, calling the second engine wasteful spending. 
The meeting took place at GE&#8217;s request, Whitman said in an
e-mailed statement. In his previous position as the Pentagon&#8217;s
acquisition chief, Carter terminated the second-engine project. 
Pratt  Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (UTX),
builds the primary engine for the F-35. 
GE Aviation leaders discussed &#8220;the GE/Rolls-Royce desire
to seek congressional approval to self-fund the F136 development
in 2012, a proposal which received overwhelming support in the
House Defense Authorization bill,&#8221; Kennedy said in an e-mailed
statement. The topic was part of an update on the General
Electric military engine fleet, Kennedy said. 
Pentagon Still Opposed 
Carter and GE officials agreed during the meeting to find
ways to enhance &#8220;work on leading edge engine technologies,&#8221;
Whitman said. The Pentagon&#8217;s position on scrapping the
development of the second F-35 engine is unchanged, according to
Whitman. 
&#8220;We believe it is just as important as ever to advocate
for the House DoD Authorization bill provision that preserves
the F136 engine and associated equipment, while authorizing GE
and Rolls Royce to self-fund the engine in 2012,&#8221; Kennedy said. 
The House legislation prohibits the Defense Department from
destroying or discarding the engines made by GE and Rolls Royce. 
General Electric and Rolls Royce proposed to self-fund the
development of the alternative engine for the rest of this year
and next year. That would cost more than $100 million, Kennedy
said in May. The company&#8217;s goal is to compete with primary
engine maker Pratt  Whitney starting in 2016, Kennedy said. 
Congress still has to approve the 2012 defense
authorization bill, which sets spending targets and military
policy. The House approved the bill in May and the Senate may
start debating its version of the bill as early as next week. 
The Senate Armed Services panel included a provision that
prohibits any government funds to be spent on the development of
a second engine for the F-35.
