Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to lend its
Quigley unit as much as $65 million in cash to extend the
subsidiary&#8217;s bankruptcy, potentially giving Pfizer further
protection against claims for asbestos-related health issues. 
Quigley asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein for
permission to borrow the money in court papers filed July 29 in
Manhattan. The cash would extend Quigley&#8217;s $20 million loan
agreement from 2004, when the unit entered bankruptcy, and
finance the case until Feb. 24, 2012, Quigley said. 
The additional money and time will free Quigley to work
with Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, and a committee of
creditors &#8220;toward confirmation and consummation of a
reorganization plan,&#8221; Quigley said. 
Lawyers for the U.S. Trustee, an arm of the Justice
Department, asked in December to end Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy.
Creditors alleging asbestos-related health issues have been
unable to sue New York-based Pfizer during the case, and many of
them have died, the U.S. Trustee said. 
Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company
looks forward to working through a bankruptcy plan with Quigley
and creditors, which the extension of the credit agreement will
allow. 
&#8220;In 30 years of asbestos litigation, Pfizer has never been
found to be derivatively liable for Quigley&#8217;s liabilities,&#8221;
Loder said. Quigley&#8217;s products were made for decades before
Pfizer acquired it, he said. 
Reorganization Hearing 
A hearing on a request to dismiss Quigley&#8217;s bankruptcy or
approve proposed terms of its reorganization, set for Aug. 4,
was adjourned without being rescheduled, according to court
papers. 
Quigley Co., founded in 1916, made three products for the
steel industry from the 1940s to the 1970s that contained
asbestos. Pfizer bought Quigley in 1968, and the company stopped
most operations in 1992. Pfizer said it never made or sold any
Quigley products, and some claimants hadn&#8217;t released Pfizer from
alleged &#8220;derivative liability.&#8221; 
Bernstein refused to allow Quigley to exit Chapter 11 court
protection in September, saying Pfizer had manipulated the
process to benefit itself. Pfizer and a committee of asbestos
claimants won his approval of an agreement that will support the
new Chapter 11 plan, which still requires court approval. 
A committee of creditors known as the &#8220;Ad Hoc Committee of
Tort Victims&#8221; asked in October 2010 to have Quigley&#8217;s
bankruptcy dismissed so it could bring tort claims, which are
otherwise blocked by bankruptcy law. 
&#8216;Asset-Less Dummy&#8217; 
In court papers, the group called Quigley an &#8220;asset-less
dummy entity that was resurrected, handed Pfizer&#8217;s money-losing
claims handling unit, and then propped up by Pfizer pursuant to
a non-arm&#8217;s-length contract of limited duration -- all in order
to provide Quigley&#8217;s extremely well-heeled non-debtor parent
Pfizer with a channeling injunction against present and future
asbestos claims.&#8221; 
The group said Quigley has depleted insurance assets to
sustain $54 million in operating losses and $34 million in
professional fees. 
Quigley&#8217;s sixth outline of a plan to reorganize, filed in
April, would have resolved disputes over how much Pfizer should
contribute by having it turn over a 281,581-square-foot building
leased to a brewery to help pay asbestos claims. The terms of
that reorganization also required Pfizer to forgive a secured
claim of $86 million, a $12.6 million bankruptcy loan and
unsecured claims of $33 million. The drugmaker would also
contribute $81 million in insurance proceeds, according to court
papers. 
Asbestos Claims 
Asbestos claims against Quigley may total $4.45 billion
during the next 42 years, according to testimony cited by
Bernstein in September. In November, Pfizer reported a $701
million third-quarter charge for asbestos litigation related to
Quigley. 
The case is In re Quigley Co., 04-15739, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income trading revenue would likely be crimped
if the U.S. credit rating is downgraded, according to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst. 
A downgrade will bring a &#8220;never before experienced&#8221;
environment with changing rates, currency-market volatility and
widening credit spreads, Hintz wrote in a note to investors
today. &#8220;This environment will negatively impact trading
revenue, repo financing and debt capital markets activity,&#8221; he
said. Both firms have liquidity and capital &#8220;to navigate
challenging market conditions successfully.&#8221; 
President Barack Obama and Congressional leaders are
rushing to push through a compromise to raise the U.S. debt
limit by at least $2.1 trillion and slash government spending by
$2.4 trillion or more. Ratings companies including Standard 
Poor&#8217;s have warned that the nation may lose its top AAA
sovereign grade depending on the contents of the debt deal. 
While a downgrade is likely to happen soon, firms have had
time to prepare for the event, Hintz said. That means the
decline in Wall Street&#8217;s fixed-income trading revenue will
likely be less than the 36 percent drop that followed the 1998
Russian default, he wrote. 
&#8220;Wall Street&#8217;s fixed-income trading units are positioning
themselves in anticipation of a downgrade and are minimizing
their inventory positions,&#8221; Hintz wrote. &#8220;These events tend to
be painful but relatively short lived.&#8221; 
Viewed as &#8216;Manageable&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are based in New
York, may each have to post $5.2 billion in additional
collateral for so-called repurchase agreements, Hintz wrote.
Banks and other financial companies use U.S. Treasuries as
collateral for loans in repurchase-agreements, or repos, and the
prospect of a downgrade has raised questions about whether such
loans would become more expensive. 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mary Claire Delaney at Morgan Stanley (MS) declined to comment on the
note. 
Goldman&#8217;s senior executives view a potential downgrade of
the U.S.&#8217;s credit rating as &#8220;manageable,&#8221; Citigroup Inc.
analysts led by Keith Horowitz wrote in a note to investors last
week. The analysts said that they met with Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar, Co-Head of Securities Harvey M. Schwartz, and Co-Head of Investment Banking David M. Solomon. 
&#8220;Management noted that they have run through various
scenarios and implied the risk of a U.S. debt downgrade seems
manageable, with the important caveat that there is always the
possibility of more severe knock-on effects,&#8221; the Citigroup
note said. Goldman Sachs &#8220;noted that collateral agreements
related to Treasuries are not dependent on Treasury ratings.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley is &#8220;not rushing&#8221; to raise collateral
requirements ahead of a potential downgrade, David Hilder, an
analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP, wrote in a note to
clients last week, citing a meeting with Ken deRegt, who helps
lead Morgan Stanley&#8217;s fixed-income trading group. 
Only a small number of investors are required to own AAA-
rated securities, limiting the impact of a downgrade, deRegt
said, according to Hilder&#8217;s note.

Thailand&#8217;s Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn will use his personal funds to recover an
airplane seized by German liquidators in Munich last month as
part of a bankruptcy dispute. 
Werner Schneider, the insolvency administrator for builder
Walter Bau AG (WTB), seized a Boeing 737 belonging to the crown prince
on July 11 to force payment on a 30 million-euro ($43.3 million)
claim against the Thai state, the company said last month. 
The crown prince &#8220;has no connection with the dispute
between the Thai government and Walter Bau, and didn&#8217;t cause the
dispute,&#8221; the crown prince&#8217;s secretariat said in a statement
late yesterday. &#8220;To avoid any impact to the good relationship
between Thailand and Germany and to end the dispute on good
terms and in an expeditious manner, the crown prince will
provide his personal funds to end the dispute.&#8221; 
A 2009 decision by the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law, or Uncitral, ordered Thailand to pay
Walter Bau more than 30 million euros for breaching a bilateral
investment treaty between Germany and Thailand. The order found
that Thailand&#8217;s government breached the terms of a toll road
concession operated by a venture partly owned by Walter Bau. 
A Berlin court ruled on July 20 that Thailand must deposit
20 million euros to secure the release of the aircraft,
according to the crown prince&#8217;s statement.
The crown prince&#8217;s statement didn&#8217;t say how much will be paid.
He is the only son of head of state King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
Thai law imposes a jail sentence of up to 15 years for defaming,
insulting or threatening the king, queen, heir apparent or
regent. 
Marco Polo Seatrade Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy in New York 
Marco Polo Seatrade BV, a manager of funds, trusts and
foundations, filed for bankruptcy court protection in New York. 
The Amsterdam-based company listed both assets and debt of
$100 million to $500 million in Chapter 11 documents filed July
29 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
Affiliates Seaarland Shipping Management BV, Magellano
Marine CV and Cargoship Maritime BV also sought court
protection. 
Falm International Holding BV owns 100 percent of the
equity of Marco Polo, court papers show. 
The case is In re Marco Polo Seatrade BV, 11-bk-13634, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Bundesbank Loses U.K. Bid to Seize Assets in Lehman CDO Deal 
Germany&#8217;s central bank lost its bid to take control of a
2.9 billion-euro ($4.2 billion) securitization set up by Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) just before its collapse. 
Judge Michael Briggs on July 29 ruled Excalibur Funding No.
1 wasn&#8217;t in default for long enough to allow the senior
noteholder, the Bundesbank, to wrest control away from Lehman. 
Excalibur was created by Lehman in May 2008 when the U.S.
bank packaged together a group of loans and collateralized debt
obligations. New York-based Lehman filed for bankruptcy three
months later listing assets of $639 billion. 
Under the rules of the Excalibur agreement, if the special
purpose vehicle was found to be in default, management of its
assets would pass to the Bundesbank as holder of 2.1 billion
euros of its senior debt. Lawyers for Lehman, which holds 722
million euros of Excalibur&#8217;s junior debt, argued Excalibur had
enough cash to meet its obligations. 
Magnus Makela, a spokesman for the Bundesbank, said the
central bank came to own the Excalibur notes because they were
used as collateral on a loan for a German subsidiary of Lehman,
which followed its parent into bankruptcy. 
The central bank won&#8217;t comment further until it&#8217;s examined
the ruling in detail, Makela said. 
Kimberly Macleod, a spokeswoman for Lehman, declined to
comment. 
While there was a default on Jan. 25, it didn&#8217;t continue
beyond Jan. 28, Justice Briggs said in his ruling. He granted
all parties permission to appeal his decision. 
Standard  Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC, which gave
Excalibur&#8217;s senior notes an &#8216;A&#8217; rating when the security was
issued in 2008, warned in November the vehicle didn&#8217;t have
enough income to pay interest on the junior notes held by Lehman
and that senior noteholders were unlikely to be repaid in full. 
In the latest of a series of downgrades, it lowered
Excalibur&#8217;s rating to &#8216;D&#8217; in March. 
Pakistani Investor Fiyaz is Third A-Tec Suitor, Oesterreich Says 
Pakistani investor Alshair Fiyaz is the third bidder for A-

Investments and hedge fund Springwater in bidding for the

Tokyo Electric Power Shouldn&#8217;t Enter Bankruptcy, Kaieda Says 
Japan&#8217;s Trade Minister Banri Kaieda said it isn&#8217;t
&#8220;appropriate&#8221; for Tokyo Electric Power Co. to enter bankruptcy
proceedings. Tokyo Electric isn&#8217;t expected to become insolvent
for now, Kaieda told upper house lawmakers in Tokyo. There are
&#8220;various possibilities&#8221; in dealing with the company in the
future, he said.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said he won&#8217;t seek large deals to replace falling
revenue, as the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker loses patent
exclusivity to drugs responsible for 60 percent of yearly sales. 
&#8220;We are not going to chase revenue at the destruction of
capital,&#8221; Read said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;We have
geographic breadth, we have portfolio breadth, we have
technology breadth. We never say never, but I don&#8217;t see why we
would need that.&#8221; 
Read has been shrinking the company by selling units and
buying back shares, in contrast to his predecessors Jeffrey Kindler, who bought Wyeth for $64 billion in 2009, and Henry McKinnell, who bought Pharmacia for about the same price in
2002. Pfizer will still form partnerships and pursue companies
with treatments in mid- to late-stage testing, Read said. 
Pfizer, based in New York, faces competition from cheaper
generic medicines to at least 19 drugs from 2010 through 2015,
led by the cholesterol pill Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling
drug, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors have
rewarded Read&#8217;s strategy for dealing with the acquisitions, with
shares climbing about 14 percent since he took over on Dec. 5,
more than double the return of the company&#8217;s U.S. peers.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
No. 2 U.S. shopping-mall owner, fell the most in more than a
year after reporting lower-than-estimated funds from operations
before items and saying that it plans to spin off 30 properties. 
Second-quarter &#8220;core&#8221; FFO fell to $199.6 million, or 20
cents a share, from $206.1 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier,
the Chicago-based real estate investment trust said in a
statement today. Analysts expected 23 cents a share, the average
of 12 estimates in a Bloomberg survey. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, said late yesterday that it plans a spinoff of the 30
malls to shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse Properties
Inc., the company said. General Growth spent $11.3 billion to
buy commercial-property developer Rouse Co. in 2004. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re probably malls that don&#8217;t have the same kind of
growth prospects,&#8221; Craig Guttenplan, an analyst at CreditSights
Inc. in London, said in a telephone interview, of the malls to
be spun off. &#8220;It&#8217;s not where GGP wanted to focus its
investment.&#8221; 
The company&#8217;s shares fell $1.45, or 8.7 percent, to $15.32
at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. It
was the biggest loss since May 7, 2010. 
Bankruptcy Filing 
General Growth, which owns Water Tower Place in Chicago and
Faneuil Hall Marketplace in Boston, filed for Chapter 11
protection in April 2009 after weighing itself down with debt
from the Rouse purchase that it was unable to refinance because
of the credit crisis and collapse of the commercial mortgage-
backed securities market. 
FFO, a measure of a property company&#8217;s ability to generate
cash, was hurt in the second quarter by lower income from lease
terminations, General Growth said. Core FFO excludes items such
as discontinued operations and costs related to debt retirement. 
The malls to be spun off have lower occupancy and are in
smaller markets, according to Guttenplan. They may need
&#8220;substantial investment,&#8221; he said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s only a couple of properties that were legacy
Rouse properties,&#8221; Guttenplan said. &#8220;It&#8217;s kind of almost
ironic that they&#8217;re bringing back the Rouse name.&#8221; 
Malls in Plano, Texas, and Taylor, Michigan, are the only
ones acquired in the Rouse deal that will be in the new REIT,
according to a comparison of Rouse&#8217;s last annual report in 2003
and the list of General Growth&#8217;s planned malls to be spun off. 
166 Malls 
General Growth has ownership and management interest in 166
shopping malls in 43 states. The properties proposed to be spun
off account for 7 percent of the company&#8217;s net operating income,
according to yesterday&#8217;s statement. 
The decision to spin off the malls &#8220;suggests that the
market for B quality regional mall assets is not strong,&#8221; Rich Moore, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in Solon, Ohio, said in
a note to investors today. General Growth&#8217;s operational results
were &#8220;lighter than those produced&#8221; by its peers, Moore wrote. 
Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, last week reported second-quarter FFO that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates on higher rents and occupancies. The
Indianapolis-based company raised its full-year forecast.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, reported second-quarter profit that topped analyst
estimates as sales of pain medicines offset declining revenue
from expired patents. 
Profit excluding some items was 60 cents a share, beating
by a cent the average estimate of 16 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Revenue fell 0.9 percent to $16.98 billion, matching
estimates. Sales of the New York-based company&#8217;s Lyrica pain
pill and Enbrel arthritis medicine topped analyst predictions. 
Pfizer is selling its animal health and infant formula
units and trimming its workforce to prepare for the loss in
November of exclusive rights to Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-
selling drug with $10.7 billion in annual sales. Pfizer has
three late-stage experimental medicines that analysts estimate
may bring in more than $3.5 billion annually by 2015. 
&#8220;Investors are shifting their focus back to the pipeline,
shifting back to the cost cutting and the share repurchases,&#8221;
said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar Inc., in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We probably have one more quarter where
the divestitures will be of high interest, but people are going
back to the core business.&#8221; 
Net income rose 5.2 percent to $2.61 billion, or 33 cents a
share, from $2.48 billion, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the
company said. Pfizer reiterated its 2011 profit forecast range
of $2.16 to $2.26 a share. It also maintained its guidance for
2012, the first full year of generic competition to Lipitor.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. mall operator, plans to spin off 30 of its
malls to shareholders through a special dividend. 
General Growth will issue the dividend in the form of
common stock in Rouse Properties Inc., a recently formed company
into which General Growth will transfer the shopping centers,
the Chicago-based company said in a media release. 
The group, which came out of bankruptcy in November, has
sold about $300 million of properties since then, has another
$387 million under contract for sale, and plans to dispose of
another $350 million of assets by the end of this year, Chief
Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani said on June 9. The spin-off
was one of the options considered for the properties, the group
said in a statement distributed through PR Newswire. 
The transaction &#8220;enables General Growth shareholders to
participate in Rouse&#8217;s significant growth potential as a
standalone entity and efficiently streamlines General Growth
into a highly focused, premier mall operator,&#8221; Mathrani said in
the statement. 
The distribution will be made on a pro-rata basis to
holders of General Growth common stock on the dividend record
date in the fourth quarter, the company said. The properties in
Rouse, which accounts for about 7 percent of General Growth&#8217;s
net operating income, are about 87.7 percent leased, the group
said. 
Rouse will be listed on the New York stock exchange as a
real estate investment trust, General Growth said.

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest retail brokerage, named Charlie Mak president of the
firm&#8217;s international wealth-management unit. 
Mak, previously head of the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney
unit in Asia, will report to Greg Fleming, president of global
wealth management, according to an internal memo today from
Fleming. Jim Wiggins, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan
Stanley, confirmed the memo&#8217;s contents. 
Fleming, 48, said in April that he asked Michael Armstrong,
who headed international wealth management, to focus on his role
as head of capital markets for the brokerage. The wealth-
management group had $10 billion in international client inflows
in 2010, compared with $12.9 billion from domestic customers. 
James Jesse, chief operating officer of the capital markets
unit, will become COO of Morgan Stanley International Wealth
Management, according to the memo. Jesse will relocate from New
York to Hong Kong, Fleming said in the memo. 
Chris Van Aeken will lead the brokerage&#8217;s international-
banking and lending efforts, in addition to his role as chairman
of the firm&#8217;s Swiss private bank, according to the memo.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its forecast
for U.S. economic growth in the third quarter by a percentage
point to 1.5 percent, partly because of a slowdown in consumer
spending, chief U.S. economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note today. 
Feroli also lowered the forecast for fourth-quarter growth
to 2.5 percent from a prior estimate of 3 percent. The world&#8217;s
largest economy will expand 2 percent in the first six months of
2012, less than a previous projection of 2.5 percent. 
With the economy expanding at that pace, the jobless rate
will hold at 9 percent or above until the third quarter of 2012,
he said. Recent production data wasn&#8217;t &#8220;setting up well&#8221; for
the current quarter, while early surveys suggested activity
&#8220;may have stalled&#8221; amid wrangling over the debt-ceiling
extension, Feroli said. 
&#8220;The revised forecast implies very little improvement in
the unemployment rate,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Anticipated drag from higher
taxes and lower federal outlays&#8221; was behind the lower estimates
for next year, Feroli wrote. 
JPMorgan also pushed back its estimate for the first
increase in the Federal Reserve&#8217;s overnight lending rate until
mid-2013 from a prior forecast for the beginning of the year.
The Fed will &#8220;undertake further measures to deliver monetary
stimulus to the economy,&#8221; even though they may not be
&#8220;particularly powerful,&#8221; he said. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t see more asset purchases forthcoming but we do
think the committee will take incremental steps to signal
increasingly accommodative policy,&#8221; Feroli wrote, referring to
the Federal Open Market Committee. 
The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending grew 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, the final months of the recession.

Morgan Stanley (MS) puts were the most
active in the U.S. equity-options market after an investor
bought a block of contracts with a strike price 25 percent below
yesterday&#8217;s closing level. 
A trader purchased 34,532 October $16 puts to sell the
owner of the world&#8217;s largest retail brokerage for 28 cents each,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The October $16 put
contract had an open interest of 193 before today, the data
show. This was the biggest trade in New York-based Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s puts since January 2010, according to Henry Schwartz,
president of Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of
options-market data and analytics. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty impressive trade,&#8221; said Schwartz in a
telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s a downside hedge into the fall.
Somebody is maybe getting seriously nervous. It does show some
significant concern or desire to hedge risk of a move lower.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley has been trading below book value, or the
value of its assets, and the shares are near the lowest level
since March 2009. Revenue climbed to $9.28 billion from $7.96
billion a year earlier, the highest since the end of the
financial crisis, the company said July 21. The stock jumped 11
percent that day. It has dropped 14 percent since, as financial
companies in the SP 500 retreated 6.8 percent amid concerns the
U.S. recovery is weakening and the European sovereign-debt
crisis will spread. Morgan Stanley shares fell 2.7 percent to
$20.74 at 2:52 p.m. in New York. 
Right to Sell 
The 34,532-option trade would give the right to sell
3,453,200 Morgan Stanley shares at $16. The company hasn&#8217;t
closed below $16 since January 2009. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s September $20 puts were the sixth-most-
traded equity contracts in the U.S. after two blocks of more
than 5,000 traded. Those puts rose 62 percent to 89 cents each. 
Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in 30 days, advanced to 42.35 from
37.11 yesterday. 
More than 90,000 Morgan Stanley puts changed hands, 6.1
times the four-week average and 3.5 times the numbers of calls
to buy. Volume of the bearish options rose to its highest level
since April 2010. The October $16 puts were the most traded and
accounted for more than a third of all put volume. The
contracts, which expire Oct. 21, gained 65 percent to 33 cents
each.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the most
prolific U.S. issuer of corporate bonds this year, tapped the
market again as yields on the debt fall to the lowest on record. 
JPMorgan sold $1.25 billion of 4.35 percent, 10-year notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investment-grade
corporate bond yields fell to 3.51 percent yesterday, surpassing
the previous all-time low of 3.53 percent set Nov. 4, Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data show. 
Borrowing costs for companies are plunging along with
Treasury yields amid mounting evidence that the U.S. economy is
faltering. Banks have taken advantage of the decline to lock in
funding, selling about 60 percent of investment-grade corporate
bonds last month, the biggest proportion of 2011, Bloomberg data
show. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s notes yield 175 basis points, or 1.75 percentage
points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries. The New York-
based company sold $17.6 billion of bonds in the U.S. this year
through yesterday, including $855 million of 3.15 percent, five-
year notes on July 29, Bloomberg data show. 
Its $2 billion of 4.625 percent notes due in May 2021
traded yesterday at 103.4 cents on the dollar to yield 158 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. 
Banks&#8217; issuance accounted for $31.6 billion of last month&#8217;s
$50.2 billion of investment-grade corporate bond sales in the
U.S., Bloomberg data show.

Three companies are dropping European
Union antitrust complaints against International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) over its mainframe computers. 
T3 Technologies Inc. and Neon Enterprise Software LLC have
or will withdraw separate complaints filed with the European
Commission, IBM said in a regulatory filing last month.
TurboHercules SAS has also withdrawn its complaint, said Carina
Oliveri, a spokeswoman for the company in Paris. 
The European Commission declined to comment on the status
of its investigation into allegations IBM linked sales of its
mainframe computers to its software and that it discriminated
against competing sellers of services for the computers. 
EU antitrust regulators often end investigations into
companies after complaints from rivals or customers are
withdrawn. The European Commission ended a four-year-old probe
into Qualcomm Inc. in 2009 after all complaints were withdrawn. 
IBM, the biggest computer-services company, declined to
comment beyond its regulatory filing. 
Austin, Texas-based Neon said in May that it settled its
legal dispute with IBM and would stop selling its zPrime
software and request customers to remove and destroy their
copies. Two calls and two e-mails to the company today weren&#8217;t
immediately answered. 
Dropped Appeal 
T3 withdrew its EU complaint in May after dropping an
appeal to a U.S. court ruling dismissing its claims against IBM,
according to IBM&#8217;s filing. T3 didn&#8217;t respond to a telephone
message and e-mail to its Tampa, Florida offices. 
The European Commission opened two separate investigations
into Armonk, New York-based IBM last year over possible anti-
competitive behavior that may have blocked competition for rival
mainframe software and on maintenance contracts for the systems
by &#8220;restricting or delaying access to spare parts.&#8221; 
While IBM has shifted its focus away from hardware toward
its more profitable software and services businesses, the
mainframe operations have high gross margins and helps pull in
revenue for other IBM divisions. IBM began developing mainframe
computers in the 1940s and 1950s and is now among the few
companies to offer the systems. 
Reuters reported the IBM regulatory filing earlier today.

Chip Skowron, the ex-FrontPoint
Partners LLC hedge-fund manager charged as part of a nationwide
insider-trading crackdown, will waive his right to be indicted,
the government said in a court filing. 
Skowron, charged in April with conspiracy, securities fraud
and obstruction of justice, was in talks with federal
prosecutors to resolve the case, prosecutors said in court
papers in June. Yesterday, the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in
Manhattan filed a notice of intent to submit a criminal
information in Skowron&#8217;s case after he waives indictment. 
Defendants regularly waive their right to be indicted when
entering into an agreement in which they plead guilty. 
The one-page filing was signed by prosecutors and by James
Benjamin Jr., a lawyer for Skowron. Benjamin declined to comment
on whether his client will plead guilty. 
In the U.S. federal system, a defendant charged with a
felony has the right to be charged by an indictment, which is a
document approved by a grand jury. A defendant may instead agree
to be charged in a criminal information, which is filed by
prosecutors. 
The government claims Skowron obtained nonpublic
information from Yves Benhamou, an expert in hepatitis drugs and
a former adviser for Human Genome Sciences Inc. The tips
concerned hepatitis C drug trials and enabled Greenwich,
Connecticut-based FrontPoint to avoid more than $30 million in
losses, the government said. Benhamou has pleaded guilty. 
In addition to the criminal case, Skowron has been sued by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The case is U.S. v. Skowron, 11-MAG-00997, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
JPMorgan Asks Judge to Toss $19 Billion Madoff Trustee 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) asked a judge to dismiss a $19 billion
lawsuit by the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm, saying the
trustee lacks &#8220;standing&#8221; to bring common-law claims against
the bank. 
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff last week threw out trustee
Irving Picard&#8217;s bid for almost $9 billion in damages from HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) and feeder funds, saying Picard has no right to sue
using common-law claims against parties &#8220;who allegedly violated
a duty to Madoff Securities&#8217; customers by failing to detect
Madoff&#8217;s fraud.&#8221; Citing the ruling, JPMorgan asked Judge
Colleen McMahon, who is handling its dispute with Picard, to
toss out similar demands. 
&#8220;As Judge Rakoff held in the HSBC case, the trustee has no
standing to bring customer damages claims,&#8221; the New York-based
bank said in a filing Aug. 1. 
Separately, UBS AG (UBSN), saying Picard sued it for more than $2
billion based on common-law claims of aiding and abetting the
fraud, asked McMahon to bar the trustee from seeking such
damages. 
The JPMorgan and UBS filings were &#8220;expected,&#8221; said Picard
spokeswoman Amanda Remus. The Madoff trustee is preparing to sue
HSBC for $2 billion in bankruptcy court, she has said. 
Remus declined to comment on Rakoff&#8217;s remarks. 
The bankruptcy court case is Picard v. Katz, 1:10-ap-05287,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The review is Picard v. Katz, 11-cv-03605, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Kohlberg Capital Wins Dismissal of Investor Lawsuit 
Kohlberg Capital Corp. (KCAP), the investment company taken public
in 2006 by leveraged-buyout pioneer Jerome Kohlberg, won
dismissal of a lawsuit filed by an investor. 
Kohlberg Capital was sued in federal court in Manhattan in
December 2009 by investor Dennis J. Angeleri of Muskegon,
Michigan, who accused the New York-based company of lying about
the value of its portfolio. 
Angeleri said in the suit that Kohlberg Capital issued a
release in November 2009 that was &#8220;materially false&#8221; because
it misstated the value of the company&#8217;s investment portfolio.
Kohlberg asked U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldbaum Cedarbaum in
June to dismiss the complaint, saying its investments are
difficult to value. 
Cedarbaum on July 28 signed an order approving Kohlberg&#8217;s
motion, according to a court document filed yesterday. Cedarbaum
said Angeleri can file an amended complaint no later than Aug.
22. 
The case is Angeleri v. Pearson, 09-cv-10609, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Macquarie, Bank of Queensland Lose Bid to Throw Out ASIC Suit 
Bank of Queensland Ltd. and two other lenders lost a bid to
dismiss a lawsuit that claims they knew Storm Financial Ltd. was
violating regulations before the fund manager and adviser
collapsed in 2009. 
Federal Court of Australia Justice John Reeves ruled
yesterday the lawsuit can proceed. Investors will be able to
claim damages from Bank of Queensland, Macquarie Bank Ltd. and
Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) if a judge rules that Storm broke
the rules and they knew about it. 
The Australian Securities  Investments Commission, which
filed the lawsuit in December, &#8220;has now made a valid and
justiciable claim for relief,&#8221; Reeves wrote in a ruling posted
on the Federal Court&#8217;s website. 
Storm, which had managed A$4 billion ($4.4 billion),
induced investors to mortgage their homes, take out margin loans
and put the money into Storm Australian Index Trusts with the
promise their returns would be enough to pay the loans and live
off the proceeds in retirement, according to ASIC&#8217;s statement of
claim. 
The banks didn&#8217;t exercise due diligence to determine if the
investors could afford the loans, failed to warn them of the
risks and received interest fees, possible commissions and the
prospect of further referrals from Storm, according to the ASIC
statement. 
Storm got commissions from the trust investments and had an
incentive to encourage clients to put more money into the funds,
the regulator said. 
The company collapsed in January, 2009. Storm said at the
time trading losses resulted in a decline in income which the
company couldn&#8217;t absorb any longer. 
The case is Australian Securities and Investments
Commission v. Bank of Queensland Ltd. (BOQ) NSD1797/2010. Federal
Court of Australia (Sydney). 
New York State&#8217;s Fracking Lawsuit Barred by Law, U.S. Says 
The U.S. government said it will ask a judge to dismiss a
New York lawsuit that seeks to force a fuller environmental
review of how natural-gas extraction could affect 9 million
water drinkers in the state. 
The U.S. plans to ask U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis
in Brooklyn, New York, to dismiss the case on the grounds that
the state can&#8217;t prove injury and doesn&#8217;t have the right to sue
federal agencies, according to a letter filed with the court
Aug. 1. 
The New York state complaint is &#8220;barred by well-settled
principles of sovereign immunity,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney
Sandra Levy wrote in the letter to the judge. Sovereign immunity
protects the U.S. from lawsuits unless it waives the right. 
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued on May 31,
saying a commission that oversees the Delaware River Basin has
proposed regulations that will allow hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking, at 15,000 to 18,000 gas wells without a full
environmental review. Fracking is the process in which water,
sand and chemicals are pumped underground to break apart rock
formations and release natural gas. 
&#8220;As our complaint makes clear, the federal government has
an obligation to undertake the necessary environmental impact
study,&#8221; Schneiderman spokeswoman Lauren Passalacqua said in a
statement. 
Schneiderman&#8217;s suit seeks to halt the regulations until the
commission complies with the National Environmental Policy Act&#8217;s
requirement for a full review of all health and safety risks. 
The case is New York v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 11-
cv-2599, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York

New Suits 
TIAA Sues Deutsche Bank Over Mortgage-Backed Securities 
Teachers Insurance  Annuity Association of America sued
Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) in New York state court for fraud over
residential mortgage-backed securities the Frankfurt-based bank
sold it. 
TIAA invested in the securities unaware that the bank
internally viewed the loans and securities as &#8220;pigs&#8221; and
&#8220;crap,&#8221; according to the suit, filed Aug. 1 in New York state
Supreme Court. 
The suit duplicates wording and claims that Dexia SA (DEXB), the
lender to local governments rescued by France and Belgium in
2008, made in a similar suit filed against Deutsche Bank last
month in connection with more than $1 billion in residential
mortgage-backed securities. 
Deutsche Bank, Germany&#8217;s biggest bank, originated,
purchased, financed and securitized &#8220;exception&#8221; loans into the
securities while betting against the U.S. housing market as far
back as 2005, ultimately developing a $10 billion short position
that paid off when the loans backing the securities failed,
according to the TIAA complaint. 
&#8220;We will vigorously defend ourselves against this suit
which we believe is without merit,&#8221; Renee Calabro, a
spokeswoman for Deutsche Bank, said in an e-mailed statement.
The bank gave the same response to the Dexia suit. 
The case is Teachers Insurance  Annuity Association of
America v. Deutsche Bank AG, 652122/2011, New York state Supreme
Court (Manhattan). 
Ex-UBS Banker Martin Lack Is Indicted in Tax Conspiracy Case 
A former UBS AG banker was indicted on a charge of
conspiring to help wealthy Americans evade taxes by hiding
accounts in a smaller Swiss regional bank. 
Martin Lack, a Swiss resident and independent investment
adviser, helped U.S. clients hide assets from the Internal
Revenue Service through accounts at UBS and the so-called
cantonal bank, according to an indictment in federal court in
Fort Lauderdale, Florida. That bank, not named in the
indictment, is Basler Kantonalbank, according to a person
familiar with the matter. 
The indictment cites nine U.S. customers that Lack
assisted. He helped them withdraw cash from undeclared accounts
and discouraged them from joining an IRS amnesty program,
according to the indictment. UBS, the largest Swiss bank,
avoided prosecution in 2009 by paying $780 million and admitting
it helped Americans evade taxes. 
&#8220;Lack would and did solicit U.S. customers to open
undeclared accounts at UBS and Cantonal Bank because Swiss bank
secrecy would assist U.S. customers to conceal their ownership
of the accounts,&#8221; according to the indictment. 
Lack is accused of conspiring with Renzo Gadola, a UBS
banker from 1995 until 2008. Gadola pleaded guilty Dec. 22 in
federal court in Miami, admitting that he encouraged U.S.
clients to move their undeclared UBS accounts to Basler
Kantonalbank. (BSKP) He is cooperating with prosecutors. 
Lack didn&#8217;t immediately return a call left at the firm
yesterday. 
Michael Buess, a spokesman for Basler Kantonalbank, a Swiss
regional lender based in Basel, said he couldn&#8217;t confirm or deny
any &#8220;cooperation between Lack and Basler Kantonalbank.&#8221; 
The Lack case is U.S. v. Lack, 11-cr-60184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). The
Gadola case is U.S. v. Gadola, 10-cr-20878, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Florida (Miami).

Ex-News of the World Editor Said to Be Arrested in Probe 
London police arrested former News of the World managing
editor Stuart Kuttner as part of their probe into phone hacking
and bribery at News Corp. (NWSA)&#8217;s now-defunct Sunday tabloid, two
people familiar with the case said. 
A 71-year-old man was arrested by appointment at a north
London police station and later released on bail, the
Metropolitan Police said in statements yesterday. The man is
Kuttner, said the people, who declined to be identified because
they&#8217;re not authorized to name suspects. 
It is the 11th arrest stemming from police investigations
opened this year into allegations that journalists at the
tabloid hacked into the phones of celebrities, politicians, and
murder victims, and bribed police for information. The scandal
forced News Corp. (NWS) to shutter the 168-year-old News of the World
and drop its bid for British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) 
Police have previously arrested Rebekah Brooks, a former
chief executive officer of News Corp.&#8217;s News International unit,
and ex-News of the World editor Andy Coulson, who was Prime
Minister David Cameron&#8217;s press chief until January. 
A number for Kuttner couldn&#8217;t be located in public filings
or on the Internet. A police spokesman declined to comment
beyond the statement. 
&#8220;News International continues to fully cooperate with the
Metropolitan Police Service in their ongoing investigations,&#8221;
spokeswoman Daisy Dunlop said in a phone interview. She declined
to provide contact information or the name of an attorney for
Kuttner.

NBA Sues Players Association to Forestall Antitrust Claims 
The National Basketball Association sued its players
association, asking a court to rule that the league&#8217;s lockout of
players doesn&#8217;t violate antitrust law. 
The suit arises from the union&#8217;s &#8220;threatened use of
antitrust litigation to extract more favorable terms and
conditions of employment&#8221; in collective-bargaining
negotiations, the NBA said in a complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. 
&#8220;The union&#8217;s improper threats of antitrust litigation are
having a direct, immediate and harmful effect upon the ability
of the parties to negotiate a new collective bargaining
agreement,&#8221; the NBA said in the complaint. 
The league said it&#8217;s seeking court orders stating that the
lockout doesn&#8217;t violate antitrust laws and that federal courts
don&#8217;t have jurisdiction to end the lockout. The case was
assigned to U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe. 
The NBA and the National Basketball Players Association
made no significant progress Aug. 1 in their first formal
bargaining session on a new labor contract since the lockout
began one month ago. 
The NBA also filed an unfair labor practices charge with
the National Labor Relations Board yesterday, accusing the
players association of failing to negotiate in good faith, the
league said in a statement. In May, the union filed a complaint
against the league with the NLRB. 
The players&#8217; association will seek the dismissal of both
the lawsuit and the unfair labor practice charge, said William
Hunter, the union&#8217;s executive director. 
The association &#8220;has not made any decision to disclaim its
role as the collective bargaining representative of the players

Trials/Appeals 
Ex-TCW Employee Searched New Space Before Gundlach&#8217;s Firing 
DoubleLine Capital LP communications director Barbara
VanEvery said she started looking for office space months before
TCW Group Inc. fired her and Jeffrey Gundlach in December of
2009. 
VanEvery testified yesterday at a trial that pits Gundlach,
her and two other former TCW employees against the company over
claims they stole TCW&#8217;s trade secrets and proprietary
information to set up DoubleLine within weeks after they were
terminated. They have countered that TCW fired them to avoid
paying Gundlach&#8217;s group hundreds of millions of dollars in
performance fees. 
Under questioning by TCW&#8217;s lawyer, VanEvery said she
retained a real estate broker in September 2009 to find office
space because she expected that either Gundlach would get fired
or that he and his group would leave TCW through a negotiated
departure. 
&#8220;I was under the impression that something was going to
happen by December,&#8221; VanEvery told jurors yesterday in state
court in Los Angeles. &#8220;It was coming to a head. I felt there
was going to be some kind of separation.&#8221; 
Gundlach, 51, was the investment chief at TCW, the Los
Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale. (GLE) He started DoubleLine in
December 2009, 10 days after TCW fired him. TCW sued Gundlach a
month later, after half of its fixed-income professionals had
joined DoubleLine. Gundlach countersued, saying he was fired so
that TCW wouldn&#8217;t have to pay management and performance fees. 
VanEvery wasn&#8217;t cross-examined by DoubleLine lawyers
yesterday and she is scheduled to finish her testimony today. 
The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,
California Superior Court, Los Angeles County.

Citigroup Gave Negligent Advice to 88-Year-Old, Lawyer Says 
Citigroup Inc. (C) had undue influence over 88-year-old Ie Seng
Hoan and was negligent in its investment advice to the partly
deaf client, resulting in a loss of $18.1 million, his lawyer
said yesterday. 
&#8220;It knew full well of Pak Ie&#8217;s health problems, his
language difficulties and his lack of financial acumen and
education,&#8221; Ie&#8217;s lawyer Koh Hai Keong said in his opening
statement at a Singapore High Court trial. 
Ie, an Indonesian textile businessman, accused Citigroup&#8217;s
Singapore unit, where he was a client since 2003, of negligent
misrepresentations and hiding material facts and claimed the
bank had &#8220;undue influence&#8221; on his investment decisions. He was
also misled by his banker into believing he made a profit when
he suffered a loss after the collapse of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. in Sept. 2008, according to the lawsuit. 
Citigroup has denied wrongdoing and sent Ie a letter in
2007 confirming that he had extensive investing experience and
had an &#8220;aggressive&#8221; risk tolerance, according to the bank&#8217;s
defense filed by its lawyer Hri Kumar. 
The bank acted professionally in managing the accounts of
Ie and his company Zhen Yin at all times, Hong Kong-based
spokesman Godwin Chellam said yesterday. 
&#8220;The litigation is wholly without merit and we will defend
it vigorously in court,&#8221; Chellam said, adding it would be
inappropriate to comment further. 
The case is Zhen Yin Co. v Citibank NA S550/2009 in the
Singapore High Court.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest energy company, said its Nigerian Escravos gas-to-
liquids plant is more than 70 percent complete and on course to
start production in 2013. 
The facility, which will refine natural gas to produce
33,000 barrels a day of fuels including diesel, is set &#8220;to be
completed at the end of 2012,&#8221; Andrew Fawthrop, chief executive
officer of the company&#8217;s Nigerian unit, said in an interview
yesterday in Abuja, the capital. 
Chevron holds a 75 percent interest and will operate the
estimated $8.4 billion project jointly developed with the state-
owned Nigeria National Petroleum Corp., he said. 
Nigeria, holder of Africa&#8217;s largest gas reserves of about
187 trillion cubic feet, burns off, or flares, most of the fuel
it produces along with oil because it lacks the infrastructure
to process it. At least $3 billion in revenue is lost annually
due to flaring, according to the Petroleum Ministry. The country
flared 15.2 billion cubic meters last year, according to the
World Bank&#8217;s Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership. 
Chevron&#8217;s daily production in Nigeria averaged 524,000
barrels of crude, 206 million cubic feet (5.8 million cubic
meters) of natural gas and 5,000 barrels of liquefied petroleum
gas in 2010 as security improved in the oil-rich Niger River
delta, according to the company. 
The company holds interests in 10 deepwater oil blocks in
Nigeria, including its 250,000 barrels per day Agbami field
located 70 miles (113 kilometers) off the country&#8217;s coast. A 10-
well development program within the next three years is expected
to boost output to offset declining production in the field. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re continuing the development of the Agbami field and
we&#8217;re looking for new opportunities in deepwater continuously,&#8221;
Fawthrop said.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, may say second-quarter profit declined 24
percent on higher writedowns and taxes. 
Net income will probably fall to 262 million euros ($372
million) from 346 million euros a year earlier, according to the
average estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The
estimates ranged from 81 million euros to 387 million euros. 
&#8220;Impairments on Greek bonds and higher taxes&#8221; hurt
second-quarter results, Cristian Galizzi, an analyst at
Intermonte SIM SpA, who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; recommendation on
the stock, wrote in a July 29 report. &#8220;Results net of those
one-offs should remain operationally sound.&#8221; 
Generali said on July 5 that it will participate in a plan
to roll over part of its 3 billion euros of Greek debt, the most
held by any Italian financial institution. The insurer, led by
Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto, has net exposure,
which refers to bonds in its own portfolio, of 500 million
euros. 
Generali&#8217;s quarterly earnings may also include about 80
million euros of writedowns of the stake held in Telco SpA, the
holding company that controls Telecom Italia SpA. 
The insurer&#8217;s combined ratio, a measure of profitability,
may have improved to 97.1 percent in the first half from 98.8
percent a year earlier, the survey shows. Operating profit at
the Trieste, Italy-based insurer probably rose 2 percent to 1.03
billion euros in the quarter. 
The insurer is scheduled to report earnings on Aug. 5 and
to hold a conference call at 4 p.m. the same day. Following is a
table of the analysts&#8217; estimates and the year-earlier results
calculated by Bloomberg by subtracting published first-quarter
figures from the first-half results. The figures are in millions

James Gorman, chief executive officer
of Morgan Stanley, purchased $2.06 million of stock in the firm
as the shares touched their lowest level since March 2009. 
Gorman bought 100,000 shares today at a weighted average
price of $20.62, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. The stock tumbled $1.32 on the New York
Stock Exchange, or 6.3 percent, giving Gorman a $92,000 one-day
loss on the transaction. 
The purchase, which was larger than his cash bonus for
2010, increased Gorman&#8217;s holdings to 955,370 shares, worth about
$18.8 million at today&#8217;s closing price of $19.70. It was
Gorman&#8217;s first outright purchase since he became CEO of the New
York-based firm at the start of 2010. 
Morgan Stanley (MS) fell 28 percent this year, making its shares
worth 35 percent less than book value. The bank&#8217;s puts were the
most active in the U.S. equity-options market yesterday after an
investor bought a block of contracts with a strike price 25
percent below the previous day&#8217;s closing level. 
Morgan Stanley shares dropped to $19.70 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest level since
March 9, 2009. 
Gorman said in May that the market was assuming worst-case
scenarios for financial companies, which may get a boost if a
notable value investor were to step in and take a large
position. Gorman said in an internal memo in December that the
stock, then trading at $26.86, was &#8220;meaningfully undervalued.&#8221; 
Gorman&#8217;s Stake 
Gorman&#8217;s net worth has dropped with Morgan Stanley&#8217;s plunge
this year as the firm tries to raise its market share in fixed-
income trading and increase profitability at the retail
brokerage. His shareholdings were worth about $26.2 million when
he received his annual stock award in January. That figure had
dropped to about $18 million yesterday. Gorman also holds more
than 800,000 options, all of which are more than 30 percent out
of the money. 
The stock jumped 11 percent on July 21 after Morgan Stanley
reported a smaller loss than analysts estimated on higher
trading revenue. It has dropped 19 percent since then, as
financial companies in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index retreated
amid concern the U.S. recovery is weakening and the European
sovereign-debt crisis will spread. 
A trader yesterday purchased 34,532 October puts to sell
Morgan Stanley shares at $16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was the biggest trade in Morgan Stanley&#8217;s puts
since January 2010, according to Henry Schwartz, president of
Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market
data and analytics.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), seeking to
placate buyers and guard its reputation, is compensating
investors for losses they incurred after a $1.5 billion
commercial-mortgage bond deal was pulled last week. 
The bank is paying clients that purchased the securities
and entered into contracts that protect against changes in
interest rates and prices for the debt, according to two people
familiar with the transaction who declined to be identified
because the talks are private. The investors will be paid for
contracts that lost money between when the deal was placed and
its withdrawal five days later. 
Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Inc. (C) were forced to scuttle the
deal on July 28 after Standard  Poor&#8217;s withdrew its grades
because the rating company spotted an error in its process. The
banks already had to boost yields and restructure the
transaction, tied to loans on everything from shopping centers
to student housing, as investors pushed back on deal terms. 
&#8220;The bankers have enterprise value to protect,&#8221; said
Richard Jones, a partner in the real estate group at law firm
Dechert LLP. &#8220;Once something goes this fundamentally wrong, it
doesn&#8217;t matter who is responsible.&#8221; 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, and Mark Costiglio of Citigroup, declined to comment. 
Losses were likely &#8220;relatively small&#8221; because markets
weren&#8217;t volatile between the time the deal priced and when SP
pulled its ratings, said Richard Parkus, a commercial-mortgage
debt analyst at Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;The issuers did the right thing by absorbing investors&#8217;
hedging losses,&#8221; he said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) reduced its
estimate for U.S. end-summer natural gas inventories by 1
percent after a heatwave, while forecasting prices will remain
&#8220;under pressure&#8221; as temperatures ease. 
A surge in demand amid the hottest July in U.S. history
contributed to the bank revising its forecast for inventories at
the end of the Northern Hemisphere summer to 3,770 billion cubic
feet, down from an earlier outlook of 3,807, Johan Spetz and
Samantha Dart, London-based analysts at the bank, wrote in an
Aug. 3 report. 
Incremental gas demand for power generation more than
doubled in July to 105 billion cubic feet from 43 billion in
June, according to the bank&#8217;s estimates. Temperatures surpassed
100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) in cities from New York to
Houston in June and July, diverting more gas to plants to
generate electricity for air conditioners. 
Natural gas futures have dropped since the middle of July
after temperatures subsided and hydroelectricity generation
increased, reducing the need for the fuel, the report said.
Goldman said it sees a &#8220;structural oversupply&#8221; in the U.S. as
a result of shale production. 
&#8220;We expect the underlying balance to remain soft in coming
months, although less so as the transient effect of strong
hydro-generation subsides,&#8221; the analysts wrote, saying they
maintained a &#8220;moderately bearish&#8221; outlook for prices. 
The bank forecasts gas will average $4 per million British
thermal units for the third quarter and $4.25 per million Btu in
the October-to-December period. 
Natural gas futures for delivery in September traded at
$4.09 per million Btu today on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped 10 percent since July 15.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, is studying whether its Lipitor cholesterol pill can
be sold as an over-the-counter medicine, according to a person
familiar with the discussions. 
The company hasn&#8217;t determined whether the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration would allow the drug to be sold without a
prescription, the person said. Pfizer has assembled a team to
examine the feasibility of a switch to over-the-counter sales,
as well as other options for the medicine, said the person, who
asked not to be named because the deliberations are private. 
Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world with $10.7
billion in sales last year, loses U.S. patent exclusivity in
November. Previous attempts to sell over-the-counter versions of
cholesterol-lowering drugs, including Merck  Co.&#8217;s Mevacor and
Zocor, were unsuccessful because of the side effects. Patients
using Lipitor need regular tests of their cholesterol and liver
functioning, according to the drug&#8217;s label. 
&#8220;There is no reason to think that somehow where Mevacor
and Zocor failed, Lipitor would be successful,&#8221; David Maris, an
analyst with CLSA in New York, said in an e-mail. &#8220;This also
would not be a savings to consumers, just to insurance
companies, managed-care plans and the government,&#8221; he said. 
MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for New York-based Pfizer,
declined to comment on the company&#8217;s plans to pursue an over-
the-counter version of Lipitor. 
&#8216;Strategic Plans&#8217; 
&#8220;We can confirm that we have strategic plans in place for
Lipitor&#8217;s loss of exclusivity,&#8221; Jimeson said. 
Pfizer gained 13 cents to $17.49 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The drugmaker has gained 8
percent in the past 12 months. 
In order to sell Lipitor without a prescription, Pfizer
must show that patients can safely diagnose themselves and use
the drug properly, said Shelly Burgess, a spokeswoman for the
FDA. No cholesterol-lowering drug, or statin, has been able to
do that, she said. 
&#8220;They would have to provide data to show that consumers
understand the treatment and recognize that cholesterol-
monitoring is required,&#8221; Burgess said. In previous studies
&#8220;most study participants made mistakes and chose to take the
proposed over-the-counter statin when they should not have done
that.&#8221; 
Drugs with U.S. sales of more than $1 billion a year
typically lose 73 percent of revenue in the first three months
after generic copies are introduced, according to an analysis by
Bloomberg Industries. Pfizer successfully took its allergy
medicine, Zyrtec, over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its
consumer unit that year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. 
Pfizer last month completed a review of four business units
for possible sale or divesture. The company decided to keep the
consumer unit that it gained in the 2009 acquisition of Wyeth
and its established products unit, which makes generic drugs and
branded versions of drugs with expired patents. The company said
it plans to sell its animal health and baby formula units.

million. 
Taubman bought 50,000 shares yesterday at a weighted-
average price of $20.3847, worth $1.02 million, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today.
Porat purchased 25,000 shares at $20.50, worth $512,500,
according to a separate filing. 
Morgan Stanley rose 1.6 percent today, the second-largest
gain in the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index,
after earlier touching the lowest price since March 2009. The
shares have fallen 26 percent this year. The bank&#8217;s puts were
the most active in the U.S. equity-options market on Aug. 3

Taubman, 50, who has worked at the New York-based firm for
almost 30 years, now owns 1.15 million shares, worth $23 million
at today&#8217;s closing price. Porat, 53, owns 695,667 shares, worth
$13.9 million. Board member Hutham Olayan purchased 5,000 shares
at $20, worth $100,000, according to a filing today. 
Morgan Stanley rose 32 cents to $20.02 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. It was the largest
increase in more than two weeks and made the firm one of only 10
companies in the SP 500 Financials Index (S5FINL) to climb. 
Gorman&#8217;s Purchase 
Gorman, 53, bought 100,000 shares yesterday at a weighted
average price of $20.62, according to a filing yesterday. The
purchase, which was larger than his cash bonus for 2010,
increased Gorman&#8217;s holdings to 955,370 shares, worth about $18.8
million at yesterday&#8217;s closing price. It was Gorman&#8217;s first
outright purchase since he became CEO last year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, had two days of trading losses last
quarter after a perfect first three months in 2011. 
Gains from market-related risk in the investment bank,
chief investment office and mortgage-banking unit topped $200
million on four days during the first half, New York-based
JPMorgan said today in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
The two days of losses didn&#8217;t exceed the firm&#8217;s value-at-
risk gauge, JPMorgan said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said today
it saw a one-in-three chance of a renewed recession in the U.S.
within the next nine months as it cut its growth forecast to 2
percent through the first quarter of 2012, chief economist Jan Hatzius wrote in a note to clients. 
Goldman now sees growth averaging 1.7 percent this year,
from a prior 1.8 percent forecast, Hatzius said. The world&#8217;s
largest economy will expand 2.1 percent in 2012, down from a
previous estimate of 3 percent, he wrote. 
The U.S. unemployment rate will rise to 9.25 percent by the
end of 2012, reflecting the weaker pace of growth, Hatzius said.
A worsening of the European debt crisis, failure to extend the
U.S. payroll-tax cut beyond 2011 and further increases in
unemployment were cited as key risks to the outlook. 
&#8220;Even our new forecast is subject to meaningful downside-
risk,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &#8220;Increases in the U.S. unemployment rate
have historically had a tendency to feed on themselves, and this
could happen again.&#8221; 
Goldman expects the Federal Reserve will &#8220;provide more
guidance&#8221; about the future size of its balance sheet at next
week&#8217;s policy meeting, Hatzius wrote. Goldman anticipates &#8220;no
rate hikes or changes in the size of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet
until 2013 or later,&#8221; he wrote. 
The unemployment rate fell to 9.1 percent in July from 9.2
percent in June, the Labor Department reported today. Payrolls
rose by a more-than-forecast 117,000 after a 46,000 increase in
June, the report said. 
The economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second
quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the first
three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department reported last week. Consumer
spending rose 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, when the recent recession ended.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), ranked
second among takeover advisers this year, would be No. 1 if the
bank had its way after a call made to Medco Health Solutions
Inc. (MHS) following its $29.1 billion sale to Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) 
Days after the second-largest takeover this year, Medco
received a request from Goldman Sachs to be credited for helping
to arrange the deal, said four people with knowledge of the
matter, who declined to be identified because the conversation
was private. In the July 21 statement announcing the
transaction, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Lazard Ltd. (LAZ) were
identified as Medco advisers. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) worked with Express Scripts. 
During the discussion between Goldman Sachs and Medco, a
Goldman Sachs banker reminded Medco of the firm&#8217;s past work for
the company and Medco&#8217;s role as a manager of pharmacy benefits
for some Goldman employees, the people said. Medco considered
the discussion of its business relationships as pressure to put
Goldman Sachs on the deal and was concerned the bank would yank
the benefits contract if it weren&#8217;t credited, the people said. 
People close to Goldman Sachs said the banker was
highlighting its relationship with Medco, and the firm deserved
recognition for previous work related to the transaction.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.

providing equity-market trading and clearing reports to some
clients this morning because of the high volume yesterday. 
&#8220;We told clearing clients that some reports might be
delayed due to the high volume of trading yesterday,&#8221; said
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm. &#8220;Ninety-
five percent of the usual data was available by 7 a.m. and the
rest was available by the time the U.S. stock market opened.&#8221; 
The affected unit was Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing

options and futures. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, made
the most revenue from trading equities of any bank in the world
last year.

message on a client website this morning notifying customers
that there would be custody reporting delays.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), sued for
$8.6 billion by bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), said the
defunct firm&#8217;s common-law claims against it must be decided by a
U.S. district court judge rather than a bankruptcy judge. 
In a court filing yesterday in Manhattan, the New York-
based bank said the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in the Anna Nicole
Smith case limited the power of bankruptcy judges to rule on
such claims. 
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, has been fighting
Lehman&#8217;s suit in bankruptcy court, fending off demands for the
return of $8.6 billion in collateral, plus &#8220;tens of billions&#8221;
in damages for allegedly accelerating the former investment
bank&#8217;s demise. After the ruling in the Smith case, a district
judge must determine damage claims brought under New York state
law, JPMorgan said in the filing. 
&#8220;Those claims, through which plaintiffs seek to augment
the estate by recovering damages for JPMorgan&#8217;s alleged
misconduct in precipitating LBHI&#8217;s bankruptcy filing, are
legally indistinguishable from the state-law tortuous
interference counterclaim in Stern,&#8221; the bank said, referring
to the Supreme Court case known as Stern v. Marshall. 
Recent rulings by higher courts have left bankruptcy cases
in disarray. U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff threw out demands by
the liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm for billions of dollars
in damages from London-based HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The Supreme
Court&#8217;s June decision limited bankruptcy courts&#8217; ability to rule
on state-law claims as well as ending any chance for heirs of
Smith, a former Playboy model, to collect a $449 million
judgment against the estate of J. Howard Marshall, the Texas
billionaire to whom she had been married. 
Collateral Demand 
According to JPMorgan, Lehman&#8217;s demand for return of the
collateral can&#8217;t be decided by a bankruptcy judge either. Those
claims were made to pad out bankrupt Lehman&#8217;s estate, and &#8220;fall
outside the claims-allowance process&#8221; that is the business of a
bankruptcy court, it said. 
Lehman disagreed about the impact of Stern v. Marshall. 
&#8220;The Stern court left untouched the bankruptcy courts&#8217;
authority to enter final judgments on common-law claims&#8221; that
stem from the bankruptcy, it said in a filing. 
Lehman claimed in the lawsuit filed last year that JPMorgan
demanded loan guarantees that fatally weakened the firm.
JPMorgan, which lent about $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, responded by
suing Lehman, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the
loan. 
The Lehman suit is: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Mexican traders are postponing bets
for interest-rate increases to August after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. lowered the country&#8217;s growth
forecast amid concern the U.S. may relapse into recession. 
Yields on futures for the 28-day interbank due in August,
known as TIIE, sank 15 basis points in the past week to a record
low 5.02 percent. The contracts indicate traders expect Banco de
Mexico to leave its key rate unchanged at 4.5 percent until that
month. They have delayed their estimates for a rate boost 14
times this year. In Brazil, traders are pricing in the
possibility the central bank may lower borrowing costs by
December after betting on an increase three weeks ago. 
Mexico&#8217;s growth prospects are dimming after the economy in
the U.S., the Latin American country&#8217;s biggest trade partner,
grew less than forecast in the second quarter. Mexico is more
likely to cut interest rates than raise them next year, Goldman
Sachs economist Alberto Ramos wrote in a research note. Mexico
is the only major Latin American country to keep its key rate
unchanged in the past year as inflation holds near a five-year
low. 
&#8220;With the data where they are and inflation so benign,
some are betting there could be an even longer pause,&#8221; Gabriel Casillas, chief Mexico economist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in
Mexico City, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We expected a long
pause.&#8221; 
The yield on Mexico&#8217;s benchmark peso bonds due in 2024 fell
56 basis points, or 0.56 percentage point, in the past month to
6.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In Brazil,
yields on similar-maturity government debt fell 13 basis points,
or 0.13 percentage point, in the past five sessions while those
on Colombian debt fell eight basis points. 
&#8216;Highly Dependent&#8217; 
Goldman Sachs on Aug. 5 reduced its Mexican growth forecast
for this year to 4.1 percent from 4.4 percent and its estimate
for 2012 to 3.9 percent from 4.5 percent, citing weakening
demand from the U.S. A day earlier, Bank of America cut its 2012
growth projection to 4 percent from 4.5 percent, while leaving
its forecast for this year at 4 percent. 
&#8220;Given the logistical proximity to the U.S., Mexico will
always be an economy that is highly dependent on the U.S.,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Ramos said in a telephone interview. &#8220;There is
not much they can do. When the U.S. is doing well, they benefit
handsomely. When the U.S. is not doing so well, they are more
exposed than other economies.&#8221; 
&#8216;Remain Cautious&#8217; 
The U.S. economy, the destination for 80 percent of Mexican
exports, grew at a less-than-forecast 1.3 percent pace in the
second quarter following revised growth of 0.4 percent in the
first three months of the year that was less than previously
estimated, the Commerce Department said July 29. U.S. consumer
spending grew 0.1 percent, the smallest gain since the second
quarter of 2009, the final months of the recession. 
Press officials at Mexico&#8217;s central bank didn&#8217;t return
telephone calls seeking comment. 
The Finance Ministry maintained its forecast of 4.3 percent
growth this year and 4.2 percent in 2012, Miguel Messmacher,
chief economist, said in an Aug. 5 phone interview. 
&#8220;The different indicators of economic activity aren&#8217;t for
the moment sounding any alarms, even though we have to remain
cautious,&#8221; Messmacher said from Mexico City. 
The extra yield investors demand to hold Mexican government
dollar bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 19 basis points to
160 at 6:01 p.m. New York time, according to JPMorgan Chase 
Co. 
The peso weakened 2.7 percent to 12.3253 per U.S. dollar.
It&#8217;s up 0.1 percent this year. 
Default Swaps 
The cost to protect Mexican debt against non-payment for
five years rose 24 basis points to 152, according to data
provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities or the cash equivalent if a government
or company fails to adhere to its debt agreements. 
Mexico&#8217;s economy will weather the slump in the U.S. and
grow 4.8 percent this year, said Sergio Luna, head of economic
research at Citigroup Inc. in Mexico City. Central bank Governor
Agustin Carstens will raise the benchmark rate from 4.5 percent
in January, Luna said. 
&#8220;The market reaction has been disproportionate to the data
in the U.S.,&#8221; Luna said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
see a deterioration in the data that indicates any more
difficulty for the U.S. markets. The data in Mexico has also
been much better than that in the U.S.&#8221; 
Rate Outlook 
Economists expect Banxico, as Mexico&#8217;s central bank is
known, to stay on hold until May, according to the median
forecast of 21 economists in a survey distributed Aug. 4 by
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Banamex unit. 
Inflation slowed in Mexico to 3.28 percent in June from
3.69 percent a year earlier. It touched a five-year low of 3.04
percent in March. 
The Mexican economy is still struggling to rebound from its
2009 recession, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Ramos said. Mexico&#8217;s economy
shrank 6.1 percent that year, the worst since 1995. 
&#8220;The recovery from the brutal 2009 recession has been very
moderate,&#8221; Ramos said. &#8220;Things never accelerated to gain a lot
of momentum.&#8221;

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest publicly traded oil company, said it&#8217;s trying to sell
its interests in some Indonesian natural-gas operations that are
part of an ongoing lawsuit. 
The properties include the Arun field and satellite fields,
and the North Sumatra Offshore field, David Eglinton, a
spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an e-
mailed statement today. The assets had annual average net
production of 215 million cubic feet a day of gas last year, as
well as some liquids, Eglinton said. 
In July, a U.S. appeals court reinstated a lawsuit thrown
out by a lower court, ruling that Exxon must face allegations
that it aided and abetted murder, torture and sexual assault by
its security forces in Indonesia&#8217;s Aceh province. At the time,
Exxon said it has &#8220;fought these baseless claims for many
years.&#8221; Today, the company asked the full appeals court to
review the three-judge panel&#8217;s decision. 
The attempt to sell assets in Indonesia is consistent with
the company&#8217;s &#8220;long-standing practice of continually reviewing
assets for their contribution to Exxon Mobil&#8217;s operating and
financial objectives, as well as their potential value to
others,&#8221; Eglinton said in the statement today. 
The asset sale &#8220;has nothing to do with the Aceh lawsuit,&#8221;
he said. Eglinton said the sales process doesn&#8217;t involve other
Exxon projects in Indonesia. Exxon and predecessor companies
have operated in Indonesia for more than 100 years and will
retain &#8220;an active presence&#8221; in the country, he said.

General Maritime Corp. (GMR) led declines
by oil-tanker stocks in New York as the threat of a second U.S.
recession in three years increased the risk that energy imports
into the world&#8217;s largest economy may fall. 
General Maritime fell 29 cents, or 39 percent, to 45 cents
in New York Stock Exchange trading. The six-member Bloomberg
Tanker Index (TANKER) dropped 11 percent, the most since March 5, 2009,
to the lowest level since May 9, 2003. 
&#8220;The stock market is discounting problems ahead,&#8221; Andreas Vergottis, research director at Tufton Oceanic Ltd., manager of
the world&#8217;s biggest shipping hedge fund, said by phone. &#8220;It
will be very bad for tankers.&#8221; 
The U.S. economy is heading into a &#8220;double-dip&#8221;
recession, Nouriel Roubini, the co-founder and chairman of New
York-based Roubini Global Economics LLC, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television. 
Tanker shares retreated as equities slumped globally. The
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index dropped 6.7 percent to 1,119.46, the
lowest level since September. The MSCI World (MXWO) Index slid 5.1
percent, extending its drop from this year&#8217;s high to 19 percent. 
A return to recession in the U.S. would delay any rebound
in charter rates for tankers until after 2013, said Jonathan Chappell, an analyst at Evercore Partners Inc. in New York. Hire
costs for very large crude carriers, each able to haul 2 million
barrels of oil, are at the lowest level in 10 years, according
to the analyst. 
34% Decline 
&#8220;What this could do is delay the recovery out further,&#8221;
Chappell said. 
Hire costs on the industry&#8217;s benchmark Saudi Arabia-to-
Japan route fell 1.7 percent to 46.09 industry-standard
Worldscale points today, according to the Baltic Exchange in
London. The decline was the 12th in a row. Rental rates are down
34 percent this year. 
Seaborne shipments of oil into the U.S. were forecast to
reach 6.9 million barrels a day, or 17 percent of all crude
shipped this year, an 11-year low, according to Clarkson
Research Services Ltd., a unit of the world&#8217;s largest
shipbroker. The country is the world&#8217;s biggest oil importer. 
Owners are facing a glut of ships after ordering the most
in almost three decades in 2007 and 2008 before the world
economy entered its worst recession since World War II. Supply
and demand in the tanker market probably would only return to
balance later than 2013 if demand were to weaken further,
Chappell said. 
Negative Rates 
Average quarterly rates for VLCCs carrying crude to the
U.S. from the Middle East have been unprofitable since October,
according to data from the exchange. It assesses freight costs
on more than 50 international maritime routes. 
Unprofitable, or negative, rates mean tanker owners
effectively are paying some of charterers&#8217; costs because agreed
daily hire rates fail to cover all fuel and operating expenses
for a journey. 
Tankers will ship an estimated 40.9 million barrels of
crude oil, Clarkson said. 
&#8220;Trade will slow down, and I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we
see negative growth,&#8221; Tufton&#8217;s Vergottis said.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Chevron Corp. (CVX) and
other energy companies fell the most in more than two years on
concern that a cut in the U.S. debt rating signals lower crude
oil prices, investors and analysts said. 
Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas, dropped $4.63, or 6.2
percent, to $70.19 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, wiping out its gain this year. Chevron, based
in San Ramon, California, fell $7.36, or 7.5 percent, to $90.25.
The one-day declines were the steepest since Dec. 1, 2008. 
The downgrade of U.S. debt by Standard  Poor&#8217;s Aug. 5
crystallized recession concerns based on rising U.S. and
European debt and a U.S. government report last week that those
out of work 27 weeks or more comprise 50 percent of the
unemployed, said James Glickenhaus, who manages about $2 billion
at Glickenhaus  Co. in New York. 
&#8220;People are calling up mutual funds, saying, &#8216;Get me out
of stocks,&#8217;&#8221; Glickenhaus, said today in an interview. 
Widely owned and easily traded stocks like Exxon are part
of the general selloff, he said. 
&#8220;This is contagion,&#8221; Donald Coxe, who manages $500
million at Coxe Advisors in Chicago, said in an interview.
&#8220;Gold is going up because of fear the financial system is going
to implode.&#8221; 
Oil Falls 
Gold rose $61.40 to a record $1,713.20 an ounce, up 3.7
percent at today&#8217;s close in New York. Crude oil for September
delivery fell $5.57, or 6.4 percent, to $81.31, on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the lowest price since Nov. 23. 
&#8220;The SP downgrade confirmed everybody&#8217;s fear,&#8221; Fadel Gheit, a New York-based energy analyst for Oppenheimer  Co.
said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;Less confidence in the
U.S. economy alone will bring the outlook for consumption lower.
We&#8217;ll use less oil.&#8221; 
Quicksilver Resources Inc. (KWK), based in Fort Worth, Texas,
fell $2.65, or 23 percent, to $9.10, the lowest price in more
than two years. The oil and natural-gas producer said it will
raise spending 39 percent this year after missing its second-
quarter production target. 
&#8220;Every company that&#8217;s had the big increase in capital

Lowering U.S. credit one level to AA+ won&#8217;t hurt Exxon

Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth largest
U.S. bank by assets, said Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade of the
nation&#8217;s credit rating may have a &#8220;material adverse&#8221; impact on
financial markets and the firm&#8217;s business. 
The downgrade could affect the firm&#8217;s credit ratings and
require it to post more collateral on some loans, the New York-
based company said today in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Spreads in money markets and other short-
term rates already increased in anticipation of the downgrade,
the bank said. 
&#8220;Because of the unprecedented nature of negative credit
rating actions with respect to U.S. government obligations, the
ultimate impacts on global markets and our business, financial
condition and liquidity are unpredictable and may not be
immediately apparent,&#8221; the firm wrote. 
Group of Seven and Group of 20 leaders said they are ready
to stabilize financial markets after SP lowered the top U.S.
rating by one level to AA+. Policy makers held emergency
conference calls over the weekend to try to stave off weakening
investor confidence that has already wiped out about $5.4
trillion in global equity values since July 26. 
&#8220;It could disrupt payment systems, money markets, long-
term or short-term fixed-income markets, foreign-exchange
markets, commodities markets and equity markets and adversely
affect the cost and availability of funding,&#8221; Morgan Stanley
said of the downgrade in the filing.

(Corrects currency from euros to dollars in ninth paragraph
of story that ran Aug. 5.) 
Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, said second-quarter profit fell 45
percent, hurt by writedowns of Greek bonds and its stake in
Telco SpA. 
Net income declined to 190 million euros ($269 million)
from 346 million euros a year earlier, missing the 261 million-
euro estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The second-
quarter figures were calculated by Bloomberg by subtracting
first-quarter numbers from the first-half results. 
&#8220;We are confident that we will reach our full-year target
of an operating result of between 4 billion euros and 4.7
billion euros,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto
said in a statement today. 
Generali joined insurer Unipol Gruppo Finanziario SpA (UNI) and
Italian banks in writing down Greek debt after signing the
Institute of International Finance&#8217;s rescue plan last month. The
company wrote down 140 million euros of its 500 million-euro net
exposure, which represents Greek bonds in its own portfolio. 
The company wrote down bonds expiring by 2020, which
account for 70 percent of its holdings. Quarterly earnings at
the Trieste, Italy-based insurer were also hurt by a 143
million-euro writedown of the stake held in Telco, the holding
company that controls Telecom Italia SpA (TIT), as well as the
increase of an Italian regional tax, known as IRAP. 
Operating Margins 
Generali expects higher operating margins both in the life
and non-life segments this year. &#8220;We continue our strategy of
expansion in markets with high growth potential and our focus on
efficiency improvements in the core European countries,&#8221; the
CEO said. 
Quarterly operating profit rose 20 percent to 1.15 billion
euros on growth of its non-life business. The insurer&#8217;s non-life
premiums climbed 2 percent to 5.2 billion euros, while the
combined ratio, a measure of profitability, improved to 96.5
percent in the first half from 98.8 percent a year earlier. 
&#8220;Operating results beat expectations,&#8221; Werner Eisenmann,
an analyst at DZ Bank AG, wrote in a note to clients. &#8220;New
business in life was still sluggish,&#8221; he said. 
The insurer, which gets about 13 percent of its operating
income in central and eastern Europe, is in talks with VTB Group
to form a joint venture to sell its products in Russia,
Perissinotto said in May. Generali expects to increase assets
under management in Asia and eastern Europe to $30 billion by
2015. 
Generali fell 3.3 percent to 11.6 euros in Milan, giving
the company a market value of 18 billion euros. The Bloomberg
Europe 500 Insurance Index, which was down 3 percent today, has
dropped 24 percent in the past six months, compared with
Generali&#8217;s 31 percent decline. 
Europe at Risk 
The euro region is at &#8220;serious risk&#8221; of breaking up,
Perissinotto said. &#8220;Europe faces a serious risk of breaking up
into its constituent parts and finding itself and its various
member states impoverished,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Unfortunately we have
not seen yet a coordinated response and I urge our central
authorities, such as the ECB, to act in a decisive way.&#8221; 
Generali cut its exposure to corporate bonds and Italy&#8217;s
financial industry in the first half, while it boosted the
weight of Italian government bonds from 49 billion euros at the
end of March to 51 billion euros. 
The CEO also said that the company aims to grow internally
because &#8220;it&#8217;s no time for acquisitions.&#8221;

Morgan Sindall Group Plc (MGNS), a U.K.
construction and refurbishment company, said first-half profit
climbed 14 percent as affordable housing revenue was boosted by
an acquisition and it reduced its share of public-sector work. 
Net income rose to 14.9 million pounds ($24.5 million),
from 13.1 million pounds a year earlier, the London-based
company said in a statement today. Revenue advanced 11 percent
to 1.09 billion pounds. Pretax profit dropped 9 percent to 16.7
million pounds as &#8220;challenging&#8221; market conditions affected
margins. 
Morgan Sindall bought Connaught&#8217;s maintenance business out
of administration last year, helping to boost revenue for its
affordable housing unit 32 percent to 228 million pounds. The
company also reduced the effect of government spending cuts by
reducing its share of public-sector work, which now accounts for
50 percent of business, compared with 60 percent a year earlier. 
In February, Chairman John Morgan said the company expected
the private sector &#8220;to pick up some of the slack&#8221; from
spending cuts. 
&#8220;In the last few downturns we&#8217;ve increased our market
share and we expect to do the same this time,&#8221; Morgan said in a
phone interview today. &#8220;Our biggest challenge at the moment is
how do we make the most of this so that we can look back in four
years time and say we had a good recession. Margins are very
tough but we&#8217;re in a strong place&#8221; 
Morgan Sindall shares slipped 0.9 percent to 612 pence as
of 11:34 a.m. in London. The stock has dropped 13 percent this
year, giving the company a market value of 264.3 million pounds.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, posted third-quarter sales and profit that
beat analysts&#8217; estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN sports
network countered flat cable advertising sales. 
Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Profit
excluding some items was 78 cents, beating the 73-cent average
of 22 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Cable-network profit rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year&#8217;s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of &#8220;Cars&#8221; and Marvel merchandise. 
&#8220;This is a little better than expected, but there was
really nothing that&#8217;s remarkable in these numbers,&#8221; said
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst with Wunderlich Securities in
Denver who recommends the stock. &#8220;The affiliate fees at ESPN
were a little unexpected, and the parks were able to take
advantage of the Easter holiday.&#8221; 
Disney may consider new discounts at its domestic theme
parks if the economy weakens, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said on a conference call with analysts, adding &#8220;We&#8217;re not
thinking of doing that any time soon.&#8221; 
Attendance at Disney&#8217;s domestic theme parks increased by 2
percent, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on the call,
and per-capita spending by 8 percent. 
Seeking Acquisitions 
Disney will continue to make acquisitions, Iger said,
without identifying potential targets. Since becoming CEO in
2005, the company has acquired Pixar and Marvel. Last month,
Disney offered to buy the 49.6 percent of India&#8217;s UTV Software
Communications Ltd., a production company, it doesn&#8217;t own for
$454 million. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to continue to deploy capital in this
direction,&#8221; Iger said. He estimated that the $13 billion Disney
has spent to acquire companies in the last five years
represented about $23 billion in &#8220;enterprise value.&#8221; 
Disney fell 45 cents to $34.25 in extended trading. The
shares gained $1.67, or 5.1 percent, to $34.70 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading and have declined 7.5
percent this year. 
Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts&#8217; projections of $10.5 billion. 
Cable Revenue 
Cable revenue advanced 7.2 percent to $3.52 billion, with
fees from pay-TV systems countering ad sales at ESPN that were
little changed, the company said. 
ABC&#8217;s profit rose 20 percent to $250 million, benefiting
from lower production costs and higher network advertising.
Total revenue from broadcasting decreased 1 percent to $1.43
billion, reflecting lower ad sales at local television stations,
Disney said. 
Profit at Disney&#8217;s consumer products division increased 32
percent to $155 million, buoyed by merchandise from the &#8220;Cars&#8221;
animated movies and the Marvel character line. Revenue rose 13
percent to $685 million. 
Revenue at Disney&#8217;s parks division increased 12 percent to
$3.17 billion.

The cost to protect against a default
by U.S. banks plunged after soaring yesterday by the most in
almost three years, as the Federal Reserve vowed to keep
interest rates near zero through mid-2013. 
Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan
Stanley (MS), which decline as investor confidence improves, dropped
by the most since at least May 2010, according to data provider
CMA. A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk also fell by the most
since that month. 
Traders pushed the cost of protecting corporate and
financial debt lower after the Fed discussed a range of policy
tools to bolster the economy. Investor confidence in bank and
corporate creditworthiness improved after deteriorating
yesterday at the fastest pace in a year following Standard 
Poor&#8217;s cut of the U.S. government&#8217;s credit rating on Aug. 5. 
&#8220;While we appreciate the uncertainty regarding the
economy, confidence, mortgage putbacks and Europe contagion, we
firmly believe that yesterday was way overdone in the credit
markets,&#8221; Jonathan Hatcher, a credit strategist at Jefferies
Group Inc. in New York, wrote in a note to clients. U.S.
financial companies today have better balance sheets and
stronger capital and are no longer reliant on overnight
liquidity, he said. 
Swaps on New York-based JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, declined 19 basis points to 116 basis points,
according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles
prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. 
Citigroup, Goldman 
Contracts linked to Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) each decreased 25 to 185. Swaps tied to Morgan Stanley debt
dropped 30 to 250 and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) declined 20 to
115, the data show. Contracts on Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the
largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 17 to 278, the data show. 
The average credit swap price on the six biggest U.S. banks
fell 23 to 188 after jumping 51 yesterday to 211, the largest
gain since September 2008 when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed for bankruptcy and caused credit markets to seize up. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index of
credit-default swaps, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
fell 7.6 basis points to a mid-price of 107.5 as of 5:30 p.m. in
New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
The index of default swaps climbed 12.1 basis points
yesterday to reach 115.1 points, the highest level since July 7,
2010, Markit data show.

The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s
chairman illegally transferred more than $2.5 million to his own
accounts while running the Albert Ellis Institute, the nonprofit
said in a lawsuit claiming JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) let it happen. 
Jeffrey Bernstein, the former president of Albert Ellis&#8217;
board of trustees, &#8220;secretly and without authority or the
knowledge of its other trustees&#8221; moved institute funds into
personal bank accounts he owns or controls, the organization
said in the lawsuit. 
Bernstein was first elected to the institute&#8217;s board of
trustees in March 2006 and was chosen as president of the board
in July 2006, the institute said in the lawsuit. He was named
acting director of administration in January 2010 and appointed
to the permanent post the following month. Bernstein resigned
from all offices he held at the institute after the fraud was
discovered in February 2011, lawyers for the group said in the
complaint, which was filed today in federal court in Manhattan. 
JPMorgan has been provided with a list of 65 unauthorized
transactions by Bernstein and has refused to restore the funds
to the institute&#8217;s account, lawyers for the institute said in
the lawsuit, which seeks more than $2.3 million in damages. 
U.S. Investigation 
The institute contacted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance&#8217;s office about the alleged fraud, and the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s
Office in Manhattan is investigating, David Blasband, an
attorney representing the institute, said in a telephone
interview. 
Joan Vollero, a spokeswoman for Vance&#8217;s office, declined to
comment on whether the district attorney is investigating. Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, didn&#8217;t
respond to an e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit. 
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. Patrick J. Smith, an
attorney representing Bernstein, didn&#8217;t return a telephone
message left at his office seeking comment on the complaint.
Bernstein isn&#8217;t named as a defendant in the suit. 
The institute, located on East 65th Street in Manhattan, is
a not-for-profit psychotherapy organization founded in 1959 by
its late namesake, Dr. Albert Ellis. It is &#8220;committed to
alleviating emotional disturbances and enhancing emotional well-
being through the study, teaching and application of rational
emotive and cognitive behavioral therapy,&#8221; according to the
lawsuit. 
&#8216;Chart Our Course&#8217; 
The Manhattan Chamber of Commerce has no information about
the matter, President Nancy Ploeger said in an e-mailed
statement. Bernstein has resigned as the chamber&#8217;s chairman
effective immediately, and the organization&#8217;s board will meet as
soon as possible to &#8220;chart our course going forward,&#8221; Ploeger
said in the statement. 
Bernstein serves as chairman of the New York-based
Archstone Group, a corporate management consulting group, and
was the founder of TruFoods Systems Inc., a company that
operated more than 100 restaurants until 2007 when it was sold
to Trufoods LLC, according to a biography posted on the
Manhattan Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s website. 
TruFoods began in 1998 when Bernstein acquired Pudgie&#8217;s
Famous Chicken at a bankruptcy court auction, according to the
biography. Digital Creative Development Corp. (DCDC), which operated
the Arthur Treacher&#8217;s Fish  Chips chain, bought Pudgie&#8217;s in
October 2000 and named Bernstein chief executive officer of the
combined company. 
Stalking Horse Bidder 
Digital Creative sold its interest in the combined company
to an affiliate of Bernstein&#8217;s in March 2002. TruFoods also
participated as a stalking horse bidder in bankruptcy
transactions, according to Bernstein&#8217;s biography. 
Bernstein previously served as president and CEO of
Consolidated Services Inc., a management consulting firm that
was retained by debtors, creditor committees and secured lenders
in more than 100 Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases, according to the
biography. Bernstein has also served as chief restructuring
officer and an examiner in several Chapter 11 cases, the
biography says. 
Bernstein told the institute shortly after he was appointed
director of administration that an operating account it had
maintained at JPMorgan had been closed, the institute said in
the lawsuit. 
The institute discovered in February that the account
hadn&#8217;t been closed and started an investigation that revealed
that the funds in question had been used by Bernstein for his
&#8220;personal benefit,&#8221; the institute claims in the complaint. 
&#8220;When questioned about the allegedly closed Chase Bank
account, Bernstein refused to provide any information, failed to
explain his actions or account for the monies misappropriated
from the institute,&#8221; lawyers for the institute said in the
lawsuit. &#8220;However, as noted, Bernstein resigned all offices he
held at the institute. Bernstein&#8217;s fraud was immediately
reported to law enforcement authorities.&#8221; 
The case is Albert Ellis Institute v. JP Morgan Chase Bank
NA, 11-cv-5504, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, was sued over its sale of mortgage-
linked securities to now-failed credit unions hours after it
disclosed a list of other potential complaints. 
The National Credit Union Administration filed a lawsuit in
California today and said it&#8217;s seeking more than $491 million of
damages from Goldman Sachs. American International Group Inc. (AIG),
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are among firms that have also
threatened to take legal action against the bank over mortgage-
related securities, Goldman Sachs said in a regulatory filing. 
The bank was already facing active mortgage-linked lawsuits
from companies and investors that the firm estimated had
experienced cumulative losses of $485 million as of June 30. The
new potential claims aren&#8217;t included in that estimate or in the
firm&#8217;s $2 billion estimate of &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses
from legal cases. 
The list of entities, which also includes the Federal
Housing Finance Agency and insurance companies Allstate Corp. (ALL)
and John Hancock, &#8220;threatened to assert claims against the firm
in connection with various mortgage-related offerings,&#8221; New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in the quarterly filing. The
company has reached agreements with some of the entities to toll
the relevant statute of limitations. 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. The stock rose $5.07, or 4.3 percent, to
$122.73 in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading after
falling as low as $111.60 earlier in the session. Goldman Sachs
is down 27 percent so far this year. 
Lawsuit Targeting JPMorgan 
The NCUA&#8217;s suit against Goldman Sachs, which relates to the
collapse of U.S. Central and Western Corporate federal credit
unions, follows a complaint against JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and two
against Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. (RBS) 
&#8220;Those who caused the problems in the wholesale credit
unions should pay for the losses now being paid by retail credit
unions,&#8221; NCUA Chairman Debbie Matz said in a statement. 
AIG, the insurer rescued by U.S. bailouts during the 2008
financial crisis, yesterday sued Bank of America Corp. (BAC) In that
case, AIG claimed that Bank of America caused more than $10
billion in losses at AIG, which specialized in investments and
insurance tied to mortgage bonds. Bank of America rejected the
assertions of New York-based AIG. 
Possible Losses 
Mark Herr, a spokesman for AIG, declined to comment on the
company&#8217;s potential suit against Goldman Sachs, as did Maryellen Thielen, a spokeswoman for Allstate. Laurie Lupton, a
spokeswoman for Toronto-based Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC), which
owns John Hancock, had no immediate comment. 
Spokespeople for the FHFA and Freddie Mac also declined to
comment, while Amy Bonitatibus, a spokeswoman for Fannie Mae,

Goldman Sachs reduced its estimate of &#8220;reasonably
possible&#8221; losses from lawsuits to $2 billion as of June 30 from
$2.7 billion on March 31, according to the quarterly filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October that they
should disclose such costs &#8220;when there is at least a reasonable
possibility&#8221; that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. 
The estimate, the third of its kind made by Goldman Sachs,
is the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of losses in matters where the risk is
&#8220;more than remote but less than likely,&#8221; the New York-based
firm said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said some current and former
employees are the target of a criminal complaint in South Korea
related to sales of collateralized debt obligations. 
Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. &#8220;filed a criminal complaint
against certain past and present employees of the firm in South
Korea relating to its purchase of a CDO securitization from
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today. 
Heungkuk Life and Heungkuk Fire  Marine Insurance Co.
filed a complaint to the Seoul Central District Prosecutors&#8217;
office on June 28 against nine Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
executives and employees, accusing them of fraud, Lee Yun No, an
official at Heungkuk Life, said by phone on July 5. 
The Korean companies have seen losses from purchasing
collateralized debt obligations in 2007 from Goldman Sachs, Lee
said, without elaborating. 
Goldman Sachs confirmed the complaint for the first time
publicly in today&#8217;s quarterly submission to the SEC. 
The complaint &#8220;does not represent any judgment by a
governmental entity, but starts a process whereby the prosecutor
investigates the complaint and determines whether to take
action,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said
American International Group Inc. (AIG), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
are among companies that have threatened to take legal action
against the firm over mortgage-related securities. 
A list of entities, which also includes the Federal Housing
Finance Agency and insurance companies Allstate Corp. (ALL) and John
Hancock, &#8220;threatened to assert claims against the firm in
connection with various mortgage-related offerings,&#8221; New York-
based Goldman Sachs said in a quarterly filing today. Goldman
Sachs said it reached agreements with some of the entities to
toll the relevant statute of limitations. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
already facing active mortgage-related lawsuits from companies
and investors that the firm estimated had experienced cumulative
losses of $485 million as of June 30. The new potential lawsuits
aren&#8217;t included in that estimate or in the firm&#8217;s $2 billion
estimate of &#8220;reasonably possible&#8221; losses from lawsuits. 
AIG, the insurer rescued by U.S. bailouts during the 2008
financial crisis, yesterday disclosed plans to sue Bank of
America Corp. In that case, AIG alleges that Bank of America
caused more than $10 billion in losses at AIG, which specialized
in investments and insurance tied to mortgage bonds. Bank of
America rejected the assertions of New York-based AIG. 
Goldman Sachs reduced its estimate of &#8220;reasonably
possible&#8221; losses from lawsuits to $2 billion as of June 30 from
$2.7 billion on March 31, according to its quarterly filing
today with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.
bank that makes more than half its revenue from trading, lost
money in that business on 15 days during the second quarter, the
most daily losses since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
The firm&#8217;s traders lost more than $100 million on one of
the days, according to the New York-based company&#8217;s quarterly
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They
generated more than $100 million on four days out of 63 total
days, the filing showed. The second quarter ended June 30. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported second-quarter earnings that fell short of
analysts&#8217; estimates as fixed-income trading revenue plunged 63
percent from the first quarter. The company blamed the fixed-
income trading drop, which was more than twice as large as any
other bank&#8217;s, on a reduction in risk-taking. 
The company reported zero days of trading losses during the
first quarter of last year, the first perfect quarter in the
firm&#8217;s history. It reported 10 such days in the second quarter,
two in the third and 13 in the fourth. 
The company said its trading losses exceeded the firm&#8217;s
value-at-risk limit, a measure of how much the company could
lose in the securities markets in one day, on one occasion
during the quarter. Average daily value-at-risk was $101 million
in the quarter.

A former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) manager
fired for allegedly kissing a colleague at a conference, and
then lying about the incident, sued the company in a London
court. 
Simon Negus, a partner and general manager at Microsoft&#8217;s
U.K. unit until he was dismissed in September, filed the lawsuit
on Aug. 3. The complaint followed one made by Microsoft in April
against Negus, now chief operating officer of Upstream Systems,
seeking to reclaim holiday pay and part of his signing on bonus. 
The dispute relates to an incident at Microsoft&#8217;s annual
conference in Atlanta in July 2009. Negus, a U.K. board member,
may have been seen kissing a female colleague in full view of
other attendees, Microsoft said in a court filing. 
Negus denied the &#8220;kissing incident&#8221; had taken place and
when further information came out suggesting it had, he was
dismissed for dishonesty, the Redmond, Washington-based company
said in its claim. 
Negus didn&#8217;t respond to calls and e-mails for comment. 
Microsoft&#8217;s disciplinary panel found Negus had &#8220;behaved
dishonestly, and thereby acted in a manner calculated or likely
to destroy trust and confidence between him and Microsoft,&#8221;
according to court documents. 
A spokeswoman at Edelman, a public relations firm employed
by Microsoft, declined to comment. 
Microsoft is seeking the return of 75,000 pounds
($122,600), part of a signing bonus paid to Negus when he joined
from Dell Inc. in 2008 that required him to remain at Microsoft
for three years. The company is also claiming 2,563 pounds of
holiday pay. 
Negus joined Upstream, a mobile-marketing technology
company, on July 20. In a press release issued at the time,
Upstream said Negus led Microsoft&#8217;s U.K. Enterprise and Partner
Group, and the U.K. unit had won Microsoft &#8216;Subsidiary of the
Year&#8217; in 2010. 
The cases are: Simon Negus v. Microsoft Limited,
HQ11X02875, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division; and

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
theme-park company, fell the most since 2008 on concern that
slowing consumer spending and rising costs at the ESPN sports
network may crimp profit growth. 
Among the largest media companies, including Time Warner
Inc. (TWX), News Corp. and Viacom Inc., Disney is the most exposed to
consumer spending through its theme parks, as well as broadcast
and cable-TV units, said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg
Industries. Increasing costs to broadcast sports on ESPN and a
declining DVD market may also hurt earnings, according to
Matthew Harrigan, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities. 
&#8220;Certainly there are cost pressures at ESPN and at the
parks, but they were a little worse than I would have thought,&#8221;
said Harrigan, who cut his rating on the shares to &#8220;hold&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; after the company reported quarterly earnings. 
The stock dropped 9.1 percent to $31.54 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, the most since Dec. 1,
2008. With today&#8217;s decline, the shares have fallen 16 percent
this year. 
Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion in the fiscal
third quarter ended July 2, the Burbank, California-based
company said in a statement yesterday after the markets closed. 
ESPN Affiliate Fee 
While earnings of 78 cents beat the 73-cent average of
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg, they included 6 cents
in deferred ESPN affiliate revenue that analysts expected in the
fourth quarter. Without that fee, earnings would have fallen
short, Harrigan said. 
U.S. personal spending fell 0.2 percent in June, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke vowed yesterday to keep borrowing costs at an all-time
low to revive an economic recovery that&#8217;s &#8220;considerably
slower&#8221; than expected. 
Higher costs at ESPN and lower syndication sales at the ABC
broadcasting network will lower this quarter&#8217;s earnings by 7
cents a share, Chief Financial Officer James Rasulo said
yesterday on the conference call. The ESPN expenses are
associated with new contracts to broadcast college sports, Major
League Baseball, and the National Football League, he said. 
&#8220;Earnings upside was less than met the eye,&#8221; Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets in New York, said
in a note to investors. The fiscal fourth-quarter oulook is
&#8220;muddied,&#8221; said the analyst, who rates the stock &#8220;neutral.&#8221; 
Studio Costs 
Studio entertainment operating income fell 60 percent to
$49 million in the quarter. While &#8220;Pirates of the Caribbean: On
Stranger Tides&#8221; earned more than $1 billion at the box office
worldwide, &#8220;increased revenue was largely offset by higher
marketing and distribution costs,&#8221; said Rasulo, the financial
chief. 
&#8220;The costs just need to be trimmed,&#8221; said Harrigan, the
Wunderlich analyst. 
Time Warner last week reported a 14 percent increase in
second-quarter net income as revenue from its cable-TV, movie
and magazine businesses rose. 
News Corp. (NWSA) reported fourth-quarter earnings per share of 35
cents, excluding some items, beating the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by five cents. The shares rose
2.1 percent in after-hours trading at 4:22 p.m. New York time.

Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Gilead
Sciences Inc. (GILD) won U.S. approval of a once-daily HIV treatment
that combines multiple medicines into one tablet. 
The Food and Drug Administration cleared the therapy that
combines New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ&#8217;s Edurant and
Gilead&#8217;s Truvada, Foster City, California-based Gilead said
today in a statement. A single, or fixed-dose, daily tablet
simplifies HIV therapy, said John Martin, Gilead&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer, in the statement. 
The combination product, called Complera, is expected to
generate $567 million in revenue in 2013, said Joel Sendek, an
analyst with Lazard Capital Markets in New York. He called the
drug a &#8220;catalyst&#8221; for Gilead, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of
AIDS drugs, in a July 27 note to clients. 
&#8220;The concept of a single-tablet regimen has become a goal
in HIV drug development and the standard of care in medical
practice in the United States,&#8221; Tony Mills, an investigator in
Complera studies, said in the Gilead statement. &#8220;Given its
efficacy, safety and convenience, the availability of Complera
represents an exciting milestone in addressing the individual
needs of patients new to HIV therapy.&#8221; 
About 1.2 million people in the U.S. have HIV with about
48,100 new patients contracting the virus in 2009, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention said Aug. 4 in a report. 
Gilead&#8217;s Pill 
Gilead now sells the only single-pill HIV regimen, Atripla,
a triple-drug combination approved in 2006 that includes Sustiva
from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY) Atripla was Gilead&#8217;s top seller in
2010, generating $2.9 billion. 
Gilead and JJ announced an agreement June 28 to develop a
fixed-dose HIV treatment combining Gilead&#8217;s experimental
cobicistat and Prezista from JJ. Cobicistat increases blood
levels of certain HIV medicines to allow for once-daily dosing,
according to a statement from Gilead. 
The companies also said they are negotiating the terms of
an agreement to develop a single-tablet regimen combining
Prezista with Gilead&#8217;s Emtriva, cobicistat and investigational
GS 7340. 
Truvada is Gilead&#8217;s second-highest selling drug behind its
Atripla with $2.6 billion in sales last year, according to
Bloomberg data. The FDA approved Edurant May 20, in combination
with other antiretroviral agents, for patients who have never
taken HIV treatment before. 
The companies originally filed an application for the
Truvada and Edurant combination Nov. 23. The FDA told the drug
manufacturers Jan. 25 the agency needed more information, which
Gilead and JJ included when they refiled their application Feb.
10, according to a statement from Gilead.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read said his company, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, will
fight attempts to cut Medicare payments for medicines after the
industry helped underwrite the U.S. health-care overhaul. 
Drug companies contributed $112 billion in discounts and
refunds to last year&#8217;s health-care law, helping Democrats make
up for new spending in the bill. U.S. drugmakers led by Pfizer
and Merck  Co. (MRK) are concerned they will be asked to give more in
the debt-limit deal President Barack Obama signed Aug. 2 that
requires further negotiated cuts in government expenditures. 
&#8220;We made a contribution to the Affordable Care Act that
was substantial and fundamental,&#8221; New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s Read
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We are only 10 percent of the
health-care spend in the United States, and we are the most
efficient part of that.&#8221; 
Squeezing drug savings from Medicare, the U.S. health
program for the elderly and disabled, may cost makers $20
billion and eliminate 260,000 jobs, according to the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in
Washington. Obama endorses a proposal to discount drugs for
Medicare patients who also qualify for Medicaid, the federal-
state health program for the poor.

 Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
largest theme-park company, is seeking acquisitions, a year and
a half after completing its $4.2 billion takeover of Marvel
Entertainment&#8217;s cast of film and comic-book characters. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have what I&#8217;d call a strategic hole,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said yesterday on a conference
call after the company&#8217;s third-quarter earnings release. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ve looked expansively at opportunities across the world to
buy either new characters or businesses that are capable of
creating great characters and great stories.&#8221; 
Iger didn&#8217;t specify any targets. He cited international as
an area of interest, and India as &#8220;another example of a high-
growth market. We think investing in it, at least in today&#8217;s
world, is a smart move,&#8221; Iger said. 
Disney is in the middle of a regulatory review of its
proposal to buy the 49.6 percent of UTV Software Communications
Ltd. (UTV), a Mumbai-based film and TV production company, that it
doesn&#8217;t own for as much as 20.1 billion rupees ($445 million). 
From fiscal 2006 to 2010, Burbank, California-based Disney
has spent $13 billion on acquisitions, Iger said. The company
now puts a $23 billion enterprise value on those purchases, he
said. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s been smart about buying assets that contribute to
the core of the company,&#8221; said Bill Smead, chief investment
officer of Seattle-based Smead Capital Investment, which owns
57,813 shares of Disney. &#8220;He hasn&#8217;t overpaid, and he has
created value.&#8221; 
Pixar Purchase 
Disney acquired Pixar Animation for $8.06 billion in stock
in 2006, a deal announced three months after Iger assumed the
CEO&#8217;s job. The company completed the Marvel acquisition in
January 2010 and acquired the Internet casual game company
Playdom in August 2010 for $563 million in cash. 
Iger spoke after Disney posted third-quarter sales and
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates as pay-TV fees to the ESPN
sports network countered flat cable advertising sales. 
Net income rose 11 percent to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a
share, from $1.33 billion, or 67 cents, a year ago, Disney said
yesterday in a statement. Profit excluding some items was 78
cents, beating the 73-cent average of 22 analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. 
Cable-network earnings rose 10 percent, with ESPN enjoying
gains in fees from pay-TV systems. Theme-park profit advanced
8.8 percent, fueled by higher admission prices at U.S. resorts
and this year&#8217;s later Easter break. The consumer products unit
boosted profit with sales of &#8220;Cars&#8221; and Marvel merchandise. 
Sales in the period ended July 2 gained 6.7 percent to
$10.7 billion, exceeding analysts&#8217; projections of $10.5 billion. 
Disney fell 5 cents to $34.65 at 7:34 a.m. before the open
of the New York Stock Exchange, after gaining 5.1 percent to
$34.70 yesterday. The shares had declined 7.5 percent this year
before today.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is being probed about its
compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the firm
said in a filing yesterday. 
The bank and some of its units are subject to a number of
probes and reviews, some of which also involve other firms,
according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Goldman Sachs officials in London couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. 
Regulators are probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s dealings with the
Libyan Investment Authority, the Wall Street Journal reported
today, citing people familiar with the investigation. 
The SEC opened an investigation in January into whether
banks, hedge funds and private-equity firms paid placement
agents to win access to the government-run funds, people
familiar with the matter said at the time. 
An agent working with a sovereign wealth fund may be
considered a government official, making interactions with that
person subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which
forbids U.S. companies from paying bribes to officials of
overseas governments.

A single trade for 100 shares of
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) more than 6 percent below yesterday&#8217;s closing

trading in the stock. 
The trade, later canceled, was executed at 10:33 a.m. New

Jerry Wood is relying on skills that
helped him recruit and develop top talent at Morgan Stanley (MS) in
his latest endeavor: coaching the men&#8217;s golf team at Manhattan
College. 
Wood, 57, has spent 30 years at Morgan Stanley, where he&#8217;s
a senior adviser after holding managerial roles including global
head of sales for fixed income and equities. 
While the duties of part-time college golf coach may not
seem to dovetail with that of an executive at the world&#8217;s top
merger adviser, Wood says he sees similarities. 
&#8220;You recruit kids from schools, you try to get the best
talent, you give them the tools to learn the business, then
basically mentor them, and hopefully they come through in a big
way,&#8221; Wood, of Huntington, New York, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;A lot of the kids I hired as MBA&#8217;s and analysts are
now managing directors running the business. It&#8217;s very rewarding
seeing somebody who you kind of picked.&#8221; 
Wood never has coached golf before but brings a competitive
background to his new job. 
He was captain of the golf team in 1975 as a senior at
Manhattan, which plays in the Metro Atlantic Athletic
Conference, and has memberships at Huntington Country Club and
Garden City Golf Club on New York&#8217;s Long Island. He finished
ninth at last year&#8217;s Long Island Senior Open at Fresh Meadow
Country Club against professionals and amateurs. He has a 2.3
handicap index and said he&#8217;s played all but six or seven of Long
Island&#8217;s 140 golf courses. 
Golf Management 
&#8220;If you talk to anybody who played golf in college or high
school at the competitive level, they&#8217;ll tell you that as they
got older they learned a lot more about the game and their
swing,&#8221; Wood said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what I can bring to the table for
these kids: How do you manage yourself around the golf course as
opposed to just getting up and ripping it?&#8221; 
After graduating from Manhattan with an accounting degree,
Wood started his career at Ernst  Ernst, then spent one year at
Merrill Lynch before joining Morgan Stanley in 1978 as a
municipal bond trader. He got his MBA in 1980 after taking night
classes with his wife. 
Wood left in 2003, going to Credit Suisse Group AG and
working with John Mack, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s current chairman. Wood
returned to Morgan Stanley in 2005 and a year or so later
resumed playing competitive golf in senior tournaments. In his
current advisory position, Wood helps with Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
charity efforts and client relationships. 
Wood&#8217;s ability to manage -- in the boardroom and on a long
par-5 -- appealed to Manhattan Athletic Director Bob Byrnes. The
two were introduced within the last year by a mutual golf
partner, school chaplain Rev. George Hill, and Byrnes contacted
Wood when his previous coach retired. 
Bunker Lesson 
Wood invited Byrnes out for a round at Huntington and
offered an impromptu lesson when the athletic director was
struggling in a bunker. Wood accepted the coaching vacancy soon
after, his flexibility at Morgan Stanley allowing him the chance
to pursue the new role. Manhattan College, in New York City&#8217;s
Riverdale section, is about an hour&#8217;s drive from his home. He&#8217;s
donating his $11,000 salary back to the golf program. 
&#8220;A lot of this is weekend and some mid-week tournaments,
and some time with practice, so it&#8217;s a full-time job that&#8217;s part
time, so to speak,&#8221; Byrnes said. &#8220;But once you meet Jerry, you
see why he&#8217;s such a successful businessman because he quickly
gets to the subject and heart of the matter. He&#8217;s a terrific
player himself and is going to be a great teacher.&#8221; 
Perfect Score 
Wood, who is married with three children between the ages
of 23 and 27, got a perfect score on the National Collegiate
Athletic Association&#8217;s recruiting test for coaches and has
already arranged team travel for the season that begins Sept. 9
with the Central Connecticut State Blue Devil Fall Invitational.
He can&#8217;t meet or practice with his players until classes start
at the end of this month. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m excited because a lot of the kids on our team are
business students or engineering students and I think that not
only will he help them in golf, but really in their future
lives,&#8221; Byrnes said. &#8220;This is a unique hire for me, and I&#8217;m
not a rookie. This is my 24th year. It&#8217;s very energizing for me
that Jerry will be with us.&#8221; 
Swing Tips 
Steve D&#8217;Antonio, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global head of
securitized products, has seen Wood&#8217;s competitive drive, on and
off the course. D&#8217;Antonio, who said it&#8217;s a &#8220;rare but wonderful
moment&#8221; when he takes Wood&#8217;s money in a match, predicts his
colleague and golfing buddy will be as successful with college
players as he has been with clients. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s had leadership roles, he&#8217;s a very good communicator
and he gets along with a very wide range of people,&#8221; D&#8217;Antonio,
who&#8217;s known Wood since his first day at Morgan Stanley 25 years
ago, said by phone. &#8220;He had relationships with a very broad set
of people and clients.&#8221; 
Byrnes said Wood has a natural &#8220;knack for communicating
and that&#8217;s really what coaching is.&#8221; 
While Wood has a lot of experience to impart, D&#8217;Antonio
joked that it&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;ll be sharing too many swing tips
with his players when they step to the tee. 
&#8220;I can tell you one thing, his kids will have much better
looking swings than his,&#8221; said D&#8217;Antonio, 51. &#8220;He has an ugly
swing, it just works. He just repeats it. The kids on the team
will have a good time with that, but he gets it done. He&#8217;s in
the fairway all day long.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Charles LeCroy said the key to landing bond deals in Jefferson County,
Alabama, was finding out whom to pay off. In one example, that
meant a $2.6 million payment to Bill Blount, a local banker and
longtime friend of County Commissioner Larry Langford. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of money, but in the end it&#8217;s worth it on a
billion-dollar deal,&#8221; LeCroy told a colleague in 2003, according
to a complaint filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
That&#8217;s because in the $2.9-trillion market for state and
local government debt, where 80 percent of all financings are
negotiated in private, conflicts of interest prevail. While
Langford and Blount are in jail, LeCroy is fighting an SEC
action. JPMorgan, which provided most of the toxic debt that
devastated Jefferson County, has suffered no loss of business as
the nation&#8217;s third-largest underwriter of municipal bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Just 21 months ago, JPMorgan agreed to a $722 million SEC
settlement to end a case over secret payments to friends of
Jefferson County commissioners. The financings arranged by
JPMorgan, a package of floating-rate debt and derivatives,
exposed taxpayers to the 2008 credit crisis and dealt a blow
that may lead the county to approve the biggest U.S. municipal
bankruptcy as soon as today. 
&#8220;As an outsider looking in, it just certainly appears to me
that JPMorgan ravaged this county,&#8221; said Robert Brooks, a
finance professor at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa and
the author of a textbook on derivatives. &#8220;They convinced
Jefferson County to pursue a strategy they never would have
followed to generate a lot of fees.&#8221; 
Deals Backfired 
Jefferson County&#8217;s financing shows how Wall Street peddled
complex bond-and-derivative deals that backfired on taxpayers,
from small Pennsylvania school districts to California&#8217;s state
government. Banks may have charged $20 billion in hidden fees on
the derivatives alone, Andrew Kalotay, a New York-based
financial consultant who specializes in such agreements, told an
SEC hearing in Jefferson County last month. The agreements
allowed lenders to earn fees that were rarely, if ever,
disclosed, while exposing municipalities to unexpected increases
in borrowing costs. 
Yet while JPMorgan&#8217;s deals denuded Jefferson County, the
company has emerged with its municipal-debt underwriting
business unscathed. During the past two years, public officials
from California to Massachusetts hired the New York-based bank
to arrange $64.7 billion of bond offerings, making it the third-
largest underwriter in the market for state and local
securities, according to Bloomberg data. 
&#8216;Very Aggressive&#8217; 
&#8220;The issuers need the bankers,&#8221; said Christopher Whalen,
managing director of Torrance, California-based Institutional
Risk Analytics, which assesses banks. &#8220;Morgan&#8217;s a big house and
they&#8217;re very aggressive and they&#8217;re out there looking for
business everywhere. So people tend to forget.&#8221; 
Last month, without admitting or denying wrongdoing,
JPMorgan agreed to pay $211 million in a separate settlement
with state and federal regulators over charges that its
municipal-derivatives unit participated in an industry-wide
scheme to fix prices and overcharge local governments on
investment contracts. The bank blamed former employees and said
it has increased oversight of its public finance business. 
In a motion to dismiss a lawsuit by Jefferson County,
JPMorgan said the county was inappropriately attempting to lay
blame for the debt crisis at the bank&#8217;s feet. 
&#8220;The simple fact is that the county took on too much debt
and vastly underestimated the cost of building out its sewer
system,&#8221; lawyers for JPMorgan argued. &#8220;These problems were
only exacerbated by the county&#8217;s poor management of its sewer
system and the current credit crisis.&#8221; 
Dodd-Frank Law 
JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras declined to comment for
this story and said Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, who
joined JPMorgan after the Jefferson County deals were done,
wasn&#8217;t available for an interview. William B. Harrison Jr., the
bank&#8217;s CEO at the time it sold the contracts, didn&#8217;t return
phone calls seeking comment. 
The county&#8217;s collapse has loomed over the municipal bond
market for more than three years and inspired provisions in the
Dodd-Frank law seeking to protect localities from complex
financial trades involving derivatives. Officials are asking
JPMorgan and other creditors to forgive about $1 billion of the
bonds or may decide as soon as today to file for bankruptcy
protection to escape the debts. 
Money-Saving Plan 
In Jefferson County, JPMorgan pitched a money-saving plan
that converted almost all the county&#8217;s $3 billion of sewer-
system debt into floating-rate securities coupled with
derivatives. The deals comprised the largest transactions in
municipal swaps and auction-rate bonds, a form of floating-rate
borrowing, in the bank&#8217;s history, according to the SEC. 
Like homeowners who turned to exotic mortgages, officials
refinanced 93 percent of the sewer bonds into securities with
adjustable interest rates. They bought interest-rate swaps, in
which two parties make periodic payments based on an underlying
measure of borrowing costs. The contracts were supposed to
offset the floating rates the county paid and give it a fixed
rate that was lower than on traditional bonds. 
The county paid JPMorgan, Bear Stearns Cos, Bank of America
Corp. and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. $120 million in fees for
swap trades. Those fees were as much as six times the prevailing
rate, according to a report by former county financial adviser
Porter White  Co. of Birmingham, Alabama. 
The money-saving strategy backfired. JPMorgan&#8217;s financings
unraveled in early 2008 as the subprime mortgage-market meltdown
sent ripples through Wall Street, undermining the credit ratings
of the companies that insured Jefferson County&#8217;s bonds. 
Interest Costs Soared 
The county&#8217;s interest costs soared as investors dumped the
bonds. After banks demanded early payoffs, the county defaulted.
The swaps exposed the county to hundreds of millions in fees to
refinance. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Dimon has moved to put the municipal crisis
behind him. 
In 2008, the bank said it got out of the business of
selling interest-rate swaps to state and local governments. In
November 2009, it settled with the SEC over allegations that
LeCroy and former JPMorgan colleague Douglas MacFaddin funneled
$8 million of secret payments to bankers, including Blount, who
had ties to Jefferson County politicians. 
&#8220;It looks like they&#8217;ve done the right things to limit the
reputational damage,&#8221; said Matt Fabian, who tracks the state
and local government securities industry for Municipal Market
Advisors Inc. in Concord, Massachusetts. 
In the Jefferson County case, much of the blame for the
collapse has been cast on corrupt politicians. 
&#8216;Hasn&#8217;t Hurt&#8217; 
&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t hurt them a bit because the whole thing has
been sold that they were dealing with corrupt officials,&#8221; said
Christopher Taylor, the executive director of the Municipal
Securities Rulemaking Board from 1978 until 2007. &#8220;But the
truth of the matter is they were in bed with the issuer.&#8221; 
Larry Langford, the former commissioner in charge of
finance, was found guilty on U.S. criminal charges of accepting
bribes from Blount, who pleaded guilty in the case. 
LeCroy and MacFaddin, the former head of municipal
derivatives for the bank, are fighting SEC civil claims that
they failed to disclose payments to Blount and others. JPMorgan
fired LeCroy in 2004 and terminated MacFaddin in 2008. No one
from JPMorgan is accused of criminal wrongdoing. 
MacFaddin and LeCroy have argued that the SEC lacks
authority to pursue them under federal anti-fraud statutes
because the interest-rate swaps aren&#8217;t securities. 
Richard Lawler, MacFaddin&#8217;s attorney, declined to comment.
LeCroy&#8217;s lawyer, Lisa Mathewson, also declined to comment. 
21 People 
In Jefferson County, 21 people, including four county
commissioners, were convicted or pleaded guilty to charges
related to the sewer construction or financing. 
Former County commissioner Langford, 63, a longtime friend
of Blount&#8217;s who was responsible for finance, was convicted of
taking $242,000 in bribes in exchange for steering business to
Blount. Langford lost an appeal of his convictions, according to
a notice posted Aug. 5 by the federal appeals court in Atlanta. 
According to the SEC, LeCroy also paid fees to two other
local firms to win the support of another former commissioner. 
LeCroy joked about the tactics with a fellow JPMorgan
banker in 2003. &#8220;We have to pick the partners who are going to
get free money from us this time,&#8221; he said, according to the
SEC complaint. 
Deals Raised Questions 
Bond insurer Syncora Guarantee Inc., which backed about $1
billion of the bonds, said in a lawsuit that JPMorgan knew that
the county wouldn&#8217;t have enough revenue to pay its debts in a
few years but kept a report documenting that secret. 
A least one banker at JPMorgan, Charles Giffin, raised
internal questions about the risk. 
&#8220;Do these guys know the risks they are taking (in large
doses)?&#8221; Giffin wrote in a May 12, 2003, e-mail to a colleague,
when asked to prepare materials explaining why the county should
buy more derivatives, according to SEC records. &#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t we
be pitching diversification arguments?&#8221;

Nathan Myhrvold -- the former chief
strategist and chief technology officer at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) --
opens a bottle of wine and pours it into a kitchen blender. 
&#8220;Decanting is about doing two things,&#8221; Myhrvold, 52, says
before flipping on the power switch. &#8220;It&#8217;s about mixing oxygen
in with the wine and about taking dissolved gasses out of the
wine. So, if a little bit of decanting works, why not a lot?&#8221; 
We&#8217;re in an industrial unit in suburban Seattle, the home
of Myhrvold&#8217;s company, Intellectual Ventures. He&#8217;s giving a
PowerPoint presentation before a 30-course dinner made up of
dishes from &#8220;Modernist Cuisine, The Art and Science of
Cooking,&#8221; the six-volume, 2,438-page book he&#8217;s produced. 
(Myhrvold is also a columnist for Bloomberg View.) 
To say the dishes are unusual would be an understatement.
The first consists of watermelon chips with spicy pickles. Thin
slices of fruit and pickle are mixed with modified starch
slurry, compressed in vacuum bags and then deep fried. 
&#8220;I figured that if I could make chips out of watermelon, I
could do it for anything,&#8221; Myhrvold explains as we sip hyper-
decanted wine. (I wouldn&#8217;t have guessed it was from a blender.) 
Next up? Corn and green-pea butter spread on brioche and
walnut-bread toasts. Run through a centrifuge, the corn and peas
yield three distinct layers: juice, starch and a small quantity
of a substance that has 20 times the flavor intensity of the raw
ingredient and the texture of soft butter, Myhrvold says. 
MasterChef Contestant 
Fifteen people from around the world are attending the
dinner. My table includes a journalist from Germany, an academic
from New York, a food technologist who works for Mars Inc. and
Alvin Schultz, a Houston-based contestant from chef Gordon Ramsay&#8217;s Fox TV show, MasterChef. Myhrvold divides his time
between providing a commentary and helping prepare the food. 
We&#8217;re sitting in the laboratory with chefs working along
one side. Heading the kitchen is Maxime Bilet, co-author of
&#8220;Modernist Cuisine.&#8221; He graduated with highest honors from the
Institute of Culinary Education in New York and also worked at
the Fat Duck, outside London. 
The courses keep coming: Puffed Chicken Skin, Peking
Flavors involves the skin being cooked sous vide -- in an
airtight bag in a water bath -- then puffed in oil with hoisin
sauce, scallion oil emulsion, cucumber and shaved scallions.
Liquid Caprese is a cold, emulsified soup of olive oil and
tomato water. The equipment required? A rotor-stator
homogenizer, a pressure cooker and a centrifuge. 
Baked Potato Soup consists of wafer-thin potato ravioli
filled with shallots melted in bacon fat, and dressed with an
intense broth of potato juice infused with roasted potato skins. 
Kansas Ribs 
The recipe for the Hot-Smoked Spare Ribs, Barbecue Sauces
from Kansas City, South Carolina, requires an Enviro-Pak cold
smoker, an ultrasonic bath, centrifuge, liquid nitrogen, vacuum
sealer and a water bath. The ribs are cooked sous vide for 48
hours, then dry rubbed, smoked and vacuum sealed. The chefs then
warm them in a bath and &#8220;cryofry&#8221; by dipping them in liquid
nitrogen and then deep-frying them. This process creates an
intense crust without overcooking the meat below. 
You may be asking by this stage: How does the food taste?
The answer is great. The flavors are intense, the textures
distinct, the aromas enticing. Many courses evoke memories of
childhood, when a simple strawberry may be a mouthful of heaven
and chocolate more fun than playing in the park. 
Yet somewhere in multicourse modernist meals -- and 48
dishes at El Bulli was my limit -- I tend to tire of perfection.
I want a piece of meat that hasn&#8217;t been cooked for days, I don&#8217;t

Lemongrass Egg 
Myhrvold is such an entertaining host, sharing funny
stories and being completely un-precious about his food, that an
evening at his laboratory is a delight. Even the food has wit.
The waitresses said that one dish, Raw Quail Egg, came from
birds kept on the roof of the building. The yolk turned out to
be passion fruit, the white a gel of lemongrass. 
Myhrvold was a postdoctoral fellow in the department of
applied mathematics and theoretical physics at Cambridge
University in the U.K. and worked with Professor Stephen Hawking
on research in cosmology, quantum field theory in curved space
time and quantum theories of gravitation. He doesn&#8217;t keep all

A Pfizer Inc. (PFE) patent for the
impotence pill Viagra is valid, a U.S. judge ruled, blocking
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) from marketing a generic
version until 2019. 
The decision, protecting Pfizer&#8217;s $1 billion a year in U.S.
Viagra sales for most of the next decade, was handed down Aug.
12 after a two-week non-jury trial that began June 15, according
to court papers. 
&#8220;The pharmaceutical industry will take note&#8221; of the
ruling, Navid Malik, a London-based analyst with Matrix
Corporate Capital LLP, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The
generic companies are still going to be aggressive, but the
pharmaceutical companies aren&#8217;t going to be easy touches,
they&#8217;re fighting back.&#8221; 
U.S. District Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in Norfolk,
Virginia, ruled against Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, which
claimed the patent wasn&#8217;t valid and couldn&#8217;t be enforced. 
&#8220;Teva has not shown by clear and convincing evidence that
the patent is invalid,&#8221; Smith said in a 110-page opinion.
&#8220;There is utterly no evidence&#8221; to support Teva&#8217;s claim that
that Pfizer intentionally withheld documents from the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office, Smith wrote. 
Denise Bradley, a Teva spokeswoman, declined to comment on
the ruling. 
Viagra sales increased 1 percent in the second quarter from
a year earlier to $495 million, Pfizer said this month. New
York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, posted net
income of $8.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, last year on sales of
$67.8 billion. 
&#8216;Innovative Core&#8217; 
&#8220;Protecting the intellectual property rights of our
innovative core is critical,&#8221; Amy Schulman, Pfizer&#8217;s general
counsel, said in a statement. &#8220;Friday&#8217;s court decision
acknowledges Teva&#8217;s clear violation of our patent rights.&#8221; 
Teva fell 3 percent to 138.30 shekels in Tel Aviv. The
company&#8217;s American depositary receipts, each representing one
ordinary share, rose 79 cents, or 2 percent, to $40.49 at 2:55
p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. 
Pfizer gained 41 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $18.27 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The ruling is worth about 3 cents to Pfizer&#8217;s 2012 per-
share earnings and 6 cents to the company&#8217;s annual per-share
earnings through 2019, Christopher Schott, a New York-based
analyst for JPMorgan Chase  Co., said in a note to clients
today. Teva will probably appeal, he wrote. 
The ruling was &#8220;a surprise,&#8221; Bloomberg Industries analyst
Asthika Goonewardene said in an interview. 
&#8220;The patent was a method-of-use patent, and usually these
don&#8217;t hold up that well in court for small molecular drugs,&#8221;
Goonewardene said. &#8220;The court&#8217;s decision to uphold this patent
means other filers wanting to enter in 2012 are not likely to do
so then.&#8221; 
The case is Pfizer v. Teva, 10-cv-128, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Virginia (Norfolk).

(Corrects date of memo in second paragraph.) 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said Glenn Earle, chief operating officer of its European, Middle East and
African unit, will retire after almost 25 years with the firm. 
Earle, 53, will be replaced by Robin Vince, global head of
operations, the bank said in a memorandum to employees last
month. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London confirmed the
contents of the document today. 
Earle&#8217;s &#8220;judgment regarding reputational and suitability
matters was invaluable in meeting the needs of our clients and
protecting the firm&#8217;s global franchise,&#8221; New York-based Goldman
Sachs said in the memo. 
The bank was last year accused by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission and a Senate subcommittee of misleading
customers in a 2007 mortgage-linked investment. Goldman Sachs
paid $550 million in July 2010 to settle the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit,
without admitting or denying guilt, and said it made a mistake
in the marketing materials. 
Earle, who received a master&#8217;s in business administration
from Harvard Business School, joined the firm in 1987 and became
a partner in 1996. Between 1996 and 1999 he helped the firm
develop its operations in central and eastern Europe, the Middle
East and Africa. He was co-head of the European advisory group
within the investment banking unit from 1999 to 2004 before
being named chief operating officer for the region in 2006. 
In the first half of 2011, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s operations in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa, known as EMEA, contributed
$4.63 billion of revenue, 24 percent of the total, down from 28
percent in the same period a year earlier, according to the
firm&#8217;s quarterly 10-Q filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The region contributed $1.57 billion toward pretax
profit in the first half, 27 percent of the total. 
Vince, who will remain global operations head, will be
based in London. He became a managing director in 2002 and a
partner in 2006. Financial News reported Earle&#8217;s retirement
earlier today.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is selling $1.85
billion of bonds, including its first 30-year debt in almost a
decade, as the Federal Reserve pledges record-low interest rates
through mid-2013. 
The world&#8217;s largest theme-park company plans to sell $750
million each of five- and 10-year notes and $350 million of 30-
year bonds, said a person with knowledge of the transaction.
Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, said the
person, who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. 
Disney is selling bonds for the second time in 2011 even as
Standard  Poor&#8217;s said the company already has &#8220;exceptional
liquidity&#8221; that could cover its uses by more than two times
during the next two to three years. Investors are seeking
longer-term bonds for relatively higher yields after the Fed&#8217;s
pledge last week while companies are taking advantage of about
the lowest borrowing costs on record. 
Yields on corporate debt maturing in 15 years or more fell
to 5.42 percent yesterday, compared with the 1.72 percent on
company debentures due in one to three years, according to Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data. Overall investment-grade
bond yields tumbled to a record low of 3.45 percent on Aug. 4
before rising to 3.62 percent yesterday, the index data show. 
Burbank, California-based Disney&#8217;s five-year notes may pay
60 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, the 10-
year notes may pay a 72 basis-point spread, and the 30-year
bonds may pay an 87.5 basis point spread, said the person with
knowledge of the transaction. 
2002 Offering 
Disney last sold 30-year debt in 2002, Bloomberg data show.
The company issued $500 million of 10-year notes in May, which
was its first return to the bond market in more than two years,
the data show. 
The theme park operator sold $500 million of 7 percent, 30-
year debt in 2002 that yielded 170 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show. The notes traded on
Aug. 8 at 133.8 cents on the dollar with a spread of 79.6 basis
points and a yield of 4.47 percent, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. 
Disney is rated A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the data show. 
The company is joined by Burlington Northern Santa Fe, the
railroad purchased by Berkshire Hathaway Inc., in selling 30-
year bonds today, said the person with knowledge of that
transaction.

Exxon Mobil Corp. sued the U.S.
Interior Department, asking a judge to set aside the agency&#8217;s
decision to cancel offshore leases that may yield &#8220;billions of
barrels of oil.&#8221; 
The department overstepped its authority in a ruling on
Gulf of Mexico leases for the so-called Julia Unit, Exxon Mobil
said in a complaint filed Aug. 12 in federal court in Lake
Charles, Louisiana. Statoil ASA (STL), a partner of Exxon Mobil&#8217;s in
the Julia fields, filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on
Aug. 15. 
&#8220;The Interior decision is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse
of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law,&#8221; and &#8220;deprives
Exxon Mobil of property without due process of law,&#8221; the
Irving, Texas-based company said in its complaint. 
Exxon Mobil, the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded oil
company, said federal regulations allow oil producers to suspend
production in their fields, partly &#8220;to facilitate proper
development of a lease.&#8221; Because of drilling complexity, Exxon
Mobil said, it asked for a suspension for Julia in 2008. 
The Interior Department denied the request in 2009, stating
that the company &#8220;had not demonstrated a commitment to
production,&#8221; according to court papers. Unsuccessful appeals
followed. 
The Interior Department is reviewing the Exxon Mobil
complaint, Melissa Schwartz, spokeswoman for the department&#8217;s
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement,
said in an e-mailed statement. 
&#8216;Safe Development&#8217; 
&#8220;Our priority remains the safe development of the nation&#8217;s
offshore energy resources, which is why we continue to approve
extensions that meet regulatory standards,&#8221; Schwartz said. The
government must respond to the Exxon suit within 60 days of
receiving the Aug. 15 summons, according to a court filing. 
The lawsuits were reported earlier by the Wall Street
Journal. 
Analysts Fadel Gheit at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York and
Brian Youngberg at Edward Jones in St. Louis said they
ultimately expect Exxon Mobil to reach an agreement with the
government to keep the leases. Both said they hadn&#8217;t heard of
the Julia discovery before the lawsuit. 
&#8220;Exxon&#8217;s not just going to walk away from it,&#8221; said
Gheit, who rates the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221; and owns an
undisclosed number of them. 
Shares Drop 
Exxon Mobil fell $3.24, or 4.4 percent, to $70.92 at 2:49
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading as crude oil
slumped the most in a week after Morgan Stanley and Deutsche
Bank AG cut their forecasts for global economic expansion.
Statoil&#8217;s American depositary receipts, each representing one
ordinary share, declined $1.68, or 7 percent, to $22.40. 
Wyn Hornbuckle, a U.S. Justice Department spokesman,
declined to comment on the dispute. Jonathan A. Hunter, lead
attorney on the suit for Exxon, couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached
for comment. 
President Barack Obama stopped deep-water oil and natural-
gas drilling early last year after a BP Plc (BP/) well blew out off
the Louisiana coast, claiming 11 lives and causing the largest
U.S. oil spill. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the ban in
October. 
Exxon alleges that the Interior Department terminated the
Julia leases to gain new leases and make more money. 
&#8220;Cancellation of the original Julia leases would give
Interior the opportunity to collect millions of dollars in
bonuses and royalties that it otherwise would not be entitled to
collect,&#8221; Exxon said in court papers. 
If the agency&#8217;s decision stands, Exxon Mobil and Statoil
will &#8220;lose the enormous value of those leases and their
hundreds of millions of dollars in investments,&#8221; Statoil said
in its complaint. 
Ola Morten Aanestad, a spokesman for Stavanger, Norway-
based Statoil, had no immediate comment on the complaints. 
The case is Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) v. Kenneth Salazar, 11CV1474,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Louisiana (Lake
Charles).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will start offering banking
services to South Africa&#8217;s largest companies as it seeks to tap
faster growth outside the U.S. and Europe. 
The bank will offer corporate clients lending as well as
treasury and foreign exchange services, Eric von Glehn, managing
director of JPMorgan in Johannesburg, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. The lender, which has been in South Africa
since 1998, already offers clients services such as advice on
mergers and acquisitions and on debt and stock offerings. It
doesn&#8217;t plan to compete with South African banks, he added. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re broadening our products and services,&#8221; von Glehn
said. &#8220;We have lots of big multinationals doing business all
over Africa and in South Africa and we&#8217;re in Africa so it makes
enormous sense to be their partners.&#8221; 
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has made expanding
overseas a priority as growth in the U.S. and Europe stalls.
South Africa&#8217;s economy is forecast to grow 3.7 percent this
year, according to the central bank. JPMorgan, the top-ranked
adviser on mergers globally, is also trying to add clients as
its share of South Africa&#8217;s market for stock offerings shrinks. 
The bank, the top-ranked adviser on stock offerings in
South Africa between 2001 and 2004, fell every year to ninth
position last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
This year it doesn&#8217;t feature at all in the equity rankings. In
mergers, JPMorgan worked with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) on its
acquisition of a 16.5 billion-rand ($2.32 billion) stake in
South African retailer Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM), a deal which
started last year and was approved in May. 
Gaining Market Share 
Competitors such as BNP Paribas (BNP) SA and Citigroup Inc. (C) are
gaining market share and are the two top-ranked stock
underwriters in Africa&#8217;s largest economy this year.
Johannesburg-based Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) has worked with parent
Barclays Plc (BARC) to net 37 debt underwriting assignments in 2011. 
Transactions may come from working more closely with South
African companies, Von Glehn said. Banks, retailers and mining
companies are all expanding across the continent with South
Africa home to some of the world&#8217;s biggest metals producers
including Anglo American Platinum Ltd. and Gold Fields Ltd. 
&#8220;The mining sector is certainly an area we&#8217;re going to be
focusing on,&#8221; he said. We&#8217;ll be looking at the blue chips, the
top 40.&#8217;&#8217; 
Companies have held nine share sales for a combined total
of $1.4 billion in South Africa this year, according to
Bloomberg data. That compares with 21 offerings valued at $4.5
billion in total last year. In the year to date South African
companies have also proposed 156 takeovers valued at 81.8
billion rand, compared with 195 mergers in the first three
quarters of 2010 which were valued at almost 130 billion rand. 
&#8220;A lot of deals are taking longer to close than we had
hoped but it probably means next year will be exciting,&#8221; Von
Glehn said. &#8220;The difficulty closing is a function of markets
being wobbly, concerns about economic growth and a lack of
confidence.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley cut its forecast for
global growth this year, citing an &#8220;insufficient&#8221; policy
response to Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis, weakened confidence
and the prospect of fiscal tightening. 
The bank estimates expansion of 3.9 percent, down from a
previous forecast of 4.2 percent, according to an e-mailed
report dated today. Morgan Stanley cut its China growth forecast
for next year and Deutsche Bank AG reduced its estimates for the
nation for 2011 and 2012. 
The threat to the global economy from the debt burdens of
developed nations from the U.S. to Europe has roiled world
markets this month and wiped trillions of dollars off the value
of equities. At the same time, slowing expansions in countries
including Germany, the key driver of European growth, are
hurting confidence. 
The U.S. and Europe are &#8220;dangerously close to
recession,&#8221; Morgan Stanley analysts including Chetan Ahya said
in the note. &#8220;Recent policy errors, especially Europe&#8217;s slow
and insufficient response to the sovereign crisis and the drama
around lifting the U.S. debt ceiling, have weighed down on
financial markets and eroded business and consumer confidence.&#8221; 
The MSCI All-Country World Index slid 0.7 percent to 305.64
as of 4:24 p.m. in Hong Kong, set for the steepest drop since
Aug. 10. 
&#8216;Stagnating&#8217; Economies 
In the euro area, &#8220;broadly stagnating&#8221; growth later this
year and in early 2012 will mean that &#8220;it won&#8217;t take much to
tip the balance towards recession, especially as a final
resolution of the debt crisis -- in the form of fiscal transfers
or common bond issuance -- is likely to be very slow in
coming,&#8221; the Morgan Stanley economists wrote. 
The bank cut an estimate for China&#8217;s growth next year to
8.7 percent from 9 percent. Deutsche Bank trimmed a prediction
for this year to 8.9 percent from 9.1 percent, and a forecast
for 2012 to 8.3 percent from 8.6 percent, in a report dated
yesterday. 
&#8220;In the near term, the single most important shock to the
Chinese economy will be the likely slowdown -- or even recession
-- of the EU and U.S. economies,&#8221; Deutsche Bank economist Ma
Jun said in a note. 
Hong Kong will have a &#8220;shallow recession&#8221; with the
economy contracting in the third quarter from the previous three
months after already shrinking in the second quarter, Morgan
Stanley said in another e-mailed note today. 
&#8220;Western demand will shrink as they need to tighten their
fiscal policies,&#8221; Chinese Commerce Minister Chen Deming said in
Hong Kong yesterday. 
Merkel, Sarkozy 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President
Nicolas Sarkozy this week ruled out steps such as the issuance
of euro bonds or expanding a bailout fund to counter the
European debt crisis. Pacific Investment Management Co., the
world&#8217;s biggest bond fund manager, said that European
politicians should let Greece, Ireland and Portugal default
while taking steps to ensure Italy and Spain won&#8217;t. 
Morgan Stanley cut its estimate for growth in the Group of
10 nations to 1.5 percent this year and next, down from previous
forecasts of 1.9 percent in 2011 and 2.4 percent in 2012,
today&#8217;s report showed. 
&#8220;A negative feedback loop between weak growth and soggy
asset markets now appears to be in the making in Europe and the
U.S.,&#8221; the analysts said. &#8220;This should be aggravated by the
prospect of fiscal tightening in the U.S. and Europe.&#8221; 
France&#8217;s growth stalled in the second quarter, while the
German economy gained 0.1 percent from the first quarter. In the
U.S., the Federal Reserve has pledged to keep interest rates at
a record low through mid-2013, indicating that the world&#8217;s
biggest economy will continue to need support.

Morgan Stanley (MS), ranked by Global
Custodian magazine as the second-largest prime broker worldwide,
named Mehdee Reza as Asia head of the business that provides
services to hedge funds. 
Reza, currently Hong Kong-based head of Asian generalist
cash sales at the New York-based bank, will take up the new job
in late September, Morgan Stanley confirmed in an e-mailed
response to a Bloomberg News query. 
Global investors added $2.6 billion to hedge funds focused
on Asia, pushing regional industry assets to $89.5 billion at
the end of the second quarter, a post-2007 high, according to
Chicago-based data provider Hedge Fund Research Inc. 
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. each had 179
hedge fund mandates in Asia with the former&#8217;s estimated $23.4
billion of client assets closing gap with Goldman Sachs&#8217; $23.7
billion, said an AsiaHedge survey published in May. 
In his new role, Reza will take charge of prime brokerage
sales, capital introduction and client services in the region
which includes Japan and Australia, the e-mail said. Prime
brokers&#8217; capital introduction teams link hedge funds with
potential investors. 
Reza will report to Alex Ehrlich, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s global
head of prime brokerage in New York, and to Ed Sisterson,
regional head of equity financing products in Hong Kong, the e-
mail said. 
Global Franchise 
Reza joined Morgan Stanley&#8217;s London office as a generalist
sale person in 2005 after a stint as a partner of an
unidentified London-based hedge fund, according to the e-mail.
He had spent eight years with Credit Suisse Group AG in Hong
Kong before that, heading the regional banks research team, it
added. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Asian prime brokerage business is &#8220;a
critical part of our growing global franchise,&#8221; Ehrlich said in
the e-mail. &#8220;Mehdee&#8217;s wealth of experience in Asia and
specifically with Asian hedge funds will help ensure we continue
to offer the very best services to our global and regional
client base.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley commanded nearly 12 percent of the global
prime brokerage market by assets, second to Goldman Sachs&#8217; 13
percent, with Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG trailing by
about 1 percentage point, according to the survey by Global
Custodian released in June.

The European Central Bank may cut
interest rates next year amid a &#8220;dire&#8221; economic outlook,
Morgan Stanley economists said after reducing their euro-area
growth forecasts. 
&#8220;Slower growth, falling capacity utilization and rising
unemployment will likely put a dampener on underlying inflation
in the euro area,&#8221; economists including Elga Bartsch wrote in a
research note to clients. A &#8220;benign inflation outlook would
allow the ECB to reverse the course of its monetary action and
start to cut interest rates in early 2012 when inflation falls
meaningfully below 2 percent.&#8221; 
At the same time, &#8220;the possibility of the ECB raising
rates once more in October cannot be completely dismissed yet,&#8221;
they said. President Jean-Claude Trichet has indicated the bank
is still in tightening mode and stressed that interest rates can
change independently from liquidity measures, the economists
wrote. 
Morgan Stanley predicted the ECB will lower its benchmark
rate -- currently at 1.5 percent -- to 1 percent by the end of
2012. The economists cut their euro-area growth forecasts to 1.7
percent for this year and 0.5 percent for next year from 2
percent and 1.2 percent respectively. 
&#8220;While not our base case at this stage, we see a material
risk of outright recession,&#8221; they said.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has developed a computer chip inspired by the human brain
that may predict tsunamis and highlight risks in financial markets. 
The technology, called cognitive computing, is programmed
to recognize patterns, make predictions and learn from mistakes,
human-like capabilities not possible using today&#8217;s best
computers. It&#8217;s a sharp departure from traditional chip design
concepts, IBM said in a statement today. 
Systems built with the new chip can synthesize events
currently occurring and make decisions in real time, the Armonk,
New York-based company said. Sponsored by the U.S. Department of
Defense, IBM has received $21 million more in funding after
today&#8217;s developments to bring the technology to applications.
The advancement marks the end of a conceptual phase and
initiates the first step to find out how to bring the chips to
scale for production, said Kelly Sims, an IBM spokeswoman. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re inventing a new system, changing the game,&#8221;
Dharmendra Modha, the project&#8217;s leader, said in an interview.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a new generation of computers, bypassing the hurdles
faced by today&#8217;s computers.&#8221; 
While current computers handle commands individually on a
linear if/then basis, Modha said machines equipped with the new
chips will &#8220;rewire themselves on the fly.&#8221; Without any set
programming, the devices reach decisions through integrated
memory, computation and communication cores that resemble
synapses, neurons and axons, respectively, in the brain&#8217;s
nervous system. The sensor network is three times larger than
any ever created, he said. 
Reacting to Surroundings 
Cognitive computers may react to taste, touch, smells and
sound, Modha said, while consuming less power and volume than
today&#8217;s technology. 
The core of the device has 3.8 million transistors in a 4.2
millimeters square of silicon, a tiny scale for what the chip
accomplishes, said Richard Doherty, research director at
Seaford, New York-based Envisioneering Group, a technology
assessment firm. 
&#8220;Research like this has been going on for decades, but
this marks the beginning of commerce, industry and profits for
cognitive computing,&#8221; Doherty said in an interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re
going to be more like humans and primates than ever before.&#8221; 
Current chips using 2 billion transistors couldn&#8217;t perform
similar tasks, he said, and they&#8217;d have to be 10 times as large. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re giving birth to a new type of architecture-enabling
applications to ask computers to help us with today,&#8221; Modha
said. 
Potential Uses 
Some of that help may come, for example, in the form of
predicting tsunamis or creating financial opportunities, he
said. By constantly recording and reporting temperature,
pressure, wave height and ocean tides, such a system could issue
a warning for giant waves based on its decision making. 
&#8220;In a financial sense, it would be looking not for micro
opportunities, but a macro pattern that spots anomalies, risks,
and creates new possibilities,&#8221; he said. 
The technology also might be used in a doctor&#8217;s glove,
providing real-time patient data during surgery based on the
body&#8217;s texture, smell and temperature. 
&#8220;The impact of this is inevitable, but the timing is
unpredictable,&#8221; Modha said. &#8220;As a civilization we&#8217;re computing
with half a brain, and now we&#8217;re bringing forth that other half
to complement it.&#8221;

A one-atom-thick layer of carbon may
one day help International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and the U.S.
military build more precise radar and computers that operate at
near the speed of light. 
Physicists Konstantin Novoselov, 36, and Andre Geim, 52, at
the University of Manchester in the U.K., have found a way to
manipulate how graphene, the thinnest and toughest material ever
produced, conducts electricity, a breakthrough that opens the
door to its use in digital electronics. 
Because graphene conducts electricity 30 times faster than
silicon -- approaching the speed of light, according to the
researchers -- the finding may be used by companies such as IBM
to speed up computers. The material was first isolated by the
two Russian-born scientists in 2004, and they were awarded a
Nobel Prize last year. The latest research was published last
week in the journal Science. 
&#8220;They&#8217;ve observed a phenomenon that was unattainable
previously,&#8221; said Yu-Ming Lin, an IBM researcher who developed
the first integrated circuit from wafer-size graphene in June.
The Armonk, New York-based company, which funded the study along
with Samsung Electronics Co. and the U.S. Air Force and Navy,
will now consider how to use graphene in semiconductors and
computers, he said. 
Until recently, use of graphene was limited to development
of more-efficient batteries and foldable touch screens, items
that didn&#8217;t require scientists to be able to stop and start the
movement of electrons in the material. Novoselov and Geim were
able to control the current by suspending two layers of graphene
in a vacuum, reordering the electronic structure. 
&#8216;New-Type Transistors&#8217; 
The finding may lead to &#8220;completely new types of
transistors,&#8221; Novoselov said in a telephone interview. &#8220;You
can probably start using it for computer chips, but we believe
we have something different, bigger here.&#8221; 
The finding is &#8220;bringing people&#8217;s attention back to
graphene,&#8221; and spurring a new look at whether the material &#8220;is
usable in digital widgets,&#8221; IBM&#8217;s Lin said. 
The international market for graphene-based products may
reach $675 million by 2020, Wellesley, Massachusetts-based BCC
Research LLC estimated in February, when the material&#8217;s use as a
semiconductor was considered impossible. If the new research
leads to semiconductor devices, graphene would be entering what
the Washington-based Semiconductor Industry Association said was
a $298.3 billion industry worldwide in 2010. 
&#8220;Within the next couple years you will hear a lot about
transistors based on bilayer graphene,&#8221; Geim said in an e-mail.
&#8220;It will be a very long road to graphene integrated circuits.&#8221; 
Mobile Phones, Radar 
IBM, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense&#8217;s Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency, is researching the material&#8217;s
ability to create more-efficient mobile phones, clearer wireless
signals, and better radar, Lin said. The material&#8217;s magnetic
traits may also enable IBM to utilize high frequency waves for
medical devices that would spot diseases early on, Lin said. 
Novoselov and Geim are part of a $1.4 billion effort put
together by nine European organizations, including the
University of Cambridge and Finland-based Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), to research
graphene. Geim and Novoselov discovered graphene by extracting
the material from a piece of graphite such as is found in
ordinary pencils, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said
last year when announcing the scientists won the Nobel in
Physics. 
Nokia Research 
Nokia, the world&#8217;s largest maker of mobile phones by
volume, is investigating the material&#8217;s potential use in cell
phones, touch screens, and printed electronics. Graphene as a
cheap replacement for current touch screen technology is right
around the corner, said Jani Kivioja, a research leader at Nokia
whose team develops graphene&#8217;s electronic sensing ability.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein and other employees hired
attorneys this year when the U.S. began a probe of matters
raised by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
Attorney General Eric H. Holder said on May 3 that the
Justice Department was reviewing an April report on the
financial crisis by the Permanent Subcommittee, led by Carl M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, and Thomas A. Coburn, Republican of
Oklahoma. The report accused Goldman Sachs of misleading clients
about complex mortgage-related investments in 2007, and Levin
alleged that Blankfein misled Congress. 
&#8220;As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department&#8217;s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset,&#8221; the
company said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. 
Goldman Sachs fell 4.7 percent in New York trading on
concern that Blankfein&#8217;s hiring of a criminal defense attorney
could mean the firm will face more legal woes. He has been
represented by Reid H. Weingarten, a partner at Steptoe 
Johnson LLP in Washington, since the Justice Department inquiry
began, according to a person familiar with the matter. 
Weingarten is a friend of Holder&#8217;s, with whom he helped
found the nonprofit See Forever Foundation, according to
Weingarten&#8217;s biography on Steptoe  Johnson&#8217;s website. 
Wall Street&#8217;s Role 
Blankfein, 56, hasn&#8217;t been charged with wrongdoing amid
federal probes of Wall Street&#8217;s role in the housing boom and
credit crisis. Goldman Sachs is paying Blankfein&#8217;s legal costs,
according to the bank. 
Goldman Sachs has said the testimony its employees gave to
the Permanent Subcommittee &#8220;was truthful and accurate and this
is confirmed by the subcommittee&#8217;s own report.&#8221; 
Reuters reported yesterday that Blankfein had hired
Weingarten, citing an unidentified government source. The report
contributed to the decline in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock, which
closed at $106.51 on the New York Stock Exchange and has dropped
37 percent this year. 
&#8220;The fact that the attorney was hired months ago rather
than recently moderates the impact and implications of the
story,&#8221; William Tanona, an analyst at UBS AG who has a &#8220;buy&#8221;
rating on the stock, wrote in a note yesterday. Still &#8220;these
continued distractions increase the probability of a management
reshuffle over the next few years, which will undoubtedly cause
some investor angst.&#8221; 
Built a Reputation 
Weingarten won the acquittal in May of Lauren Stevens, a
former GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) attorney accused of impeding a U.S.
Food and Drug Administration investigation. He also represented
Elizabeth Monrad, the former chief financial officer at General
Reinsurance Corp. who was convicted in an accounting fraud
scandal. She won a retrial earlier this month. 
Weingarten previously represented former WorldCom CEO
Bernard Ebbers, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison after he
was convicted of an $11 billion fraud. He defended former Enron
Chief Accounting Officer Richard Causey, who was sentenced to 5
1/2 years in prison. 
Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment. Weingarten didn&#8217;t respond to e-mail and phone
messages requesting comment. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
subpoenaed earlier this year by the Manhattan District
Attorney&#8217;s office for information related to the Permanent
Subcommittee&#8217;s report, a person familiar with the matter said in
early June.

As markets convulsed in September
2008, Morgan Stanley (MS) Treasurer David Wong briefed the Federal
Reserve on a &#8220;dark&#8221; scenario in which the U.S. firm would need
at least $10 billion of emergency loans from the central bank. 
It got 10 times darker by month&#8217;s end. Morgan Stanley
borrowed $107.3 billion, the most of any bank, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg News using information released in
response to Freedom of Information Act requests, related court
orders and an act of Congress. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s borrowing -- more than twice the amount
all banks got from the Fed in the market squeeze that followed
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks -- peaked after hedge funds
pulled $128.1 billion from the firm in two weeks, documents
released by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission show. 
The first comprehensive examination of the Fed&#8217;s emergency
lending reveals how close the New York-based bank came to
running out of cash because of a run on its prime brokerage, the
unit that finances hedge funds&#8217; trades and holds their cash and
securities. The Fed loans also show the degree to which Morgan
Stanley and other banks depended on such brokerage accounts for
funding, even though clients could close them on short notice. 
&#8220;These were like hot-money deposits that could flee in an
instant,&#8221; said Tanya Azarchs, a former Standard  Poor&#8217;s
analyst who covered Morgan Stanley during the crisis and is now
a consultant in Briarcliff Manor, New York. The firm &#8220;never
thought that the hedge funds would get that spooked.&#8221; 
29,346 Pages 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Fed loans -- tallied in a Bloomberg News
database assembled from government records of more than 21,000
transactions and 29,346 pages -- open a window on Wall Street&#8217;s
secretive, lucrative and risky dealings with hedge funds. 
(View the Bloomberg interactive graphic to chart the Fed&#8217;s
financial bailout.) 
The bank never told investors about the extent of its Fed
borrowings, even as they rose to the most in the 97-year history
of emergency lending by the U.S. central bank. Citigroup Inc. (C),
the New York-based lender whose balance sheet is more than twice
the size of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s, was the second-largest Fed
borrower, with a balance of $99.5 billion in January 2009. 
At the peak of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Fed borrowings, on Sept.
29, 2008, the firm reported that liquidity was &#8220;strong,&#8221;
without mentioning how dependent its cash stores had become on
the government lifeline. Liquidity refers to the daily funds a
bank needs to operate, including cash to cover withdrawals. 
&#8216;Black Box&#8217; 
Neither Morgan Stanley nor its competitors in prime
brokerage -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
Citigroup and Credit Suisse Group AG -- disclose the size of
their hedge-fund balances, leaving shareholders dependent on
regulators who previously failed to rein in the risks. 
&#8220;It remains a black box,&#8221; said Adam Hurwich, a former
member of the Financial Accounting Standards Board&#8217;s Investors
Technical Advisory Committee who&#8217;s now a portfolio manager at
New York-based investment firm Ulysses Management LLC. &#8220;They
don&#8217;t give you the information to be able to decipher whether
they have changed anything.&#8221; 
Prime brokers facilitate short trades, the sale of borrowed
stock in the hope of buying it back later at a lower price. They
also make margin loans to finance stock purchases. In exchange,
hedge funds usually keep their cash and stock in accounts at the
prime-brokerage companies. 
Frozen Assets 
Few analysts understood how dependent the brokerages had
become on such balances as a cheap source of funding, said Frank Suozzo, a former head of growth financial-services research at
AllianceBernstein LP. 
&#8220;Prime brokerage was presumed to be a pretty secure
business, where the funding was not actually part of the
liquidity of the bank,&#8221; said Suozzo, now president of advisory
firm FXS Capital LLC in Goldens Bridge, New York. &#8220;So if
clients pulled their money out, the view was that money had not
been lent out, so the cash would have been sitting there able to
hand over. It turns out that that was not entirely correct.&#8221; 
In reality, &#8220;prime brokers were able to reuse clients&#8217;
assets to raise cash for their own activities,&#8221; the financial
crisis commission wrote in its final report, published in
January. Azarchs said that in her years covering Morgan Stanley
for SP she never heard executives discuss the risk that the
funding might evaporate. 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy changed matters
when it froze at least $65 billion of assets held by that firm&#8217;s
London-based prime brokerage. For hedge funds, it was a lesson
not to bank with companies perceived to be at risk of failure,
according to the commission report. So hedge funds moved quickly
to pull their money from Morgan Stanley, viewed as the next
weakest securities firm after Lehman, according to the report. 
Unregulated, Unrated 
Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to
disclose the bank&#8217;s current hedge-fund balances. 
&#8220;The financial crisis of 2008 caused&#160;the industry to
fundamentally&#160;re-evaluate the way it manages liquidity,&#8221; Lake
said. &#8220;We have taken the lessons we learned from that period
and applied them to&#160;our liquidity-management program to protect
both our franchise and our clients going forward.&#8221; 
Lake wouldn&#8217;t say what practices the firm has changed. 
Hedge funds are mostly private, unregulated and unrated
investment pools that often try to increase trading returns by
supplementing their own capital with stock and cash borrowed
from Wall Street&#8217;s prime-brokerage divisions. 
Prime-Brokerage Revenue 
The world&#8217;s 10 largest investment banks garnered about $10
billion in revenue from prime brokerage in 2010, almost as much
as they made trading stocks, according to London-based research
firm Coalition Development Ltd. The top 25 hedge-fund managers
earned $22.1 billion in 2010, according to AR magazine. 
Prior to the crisis, prime brokerage was one of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s most profitable businesses, generating at least $2
billion of revenue a year, according to Brad Hintz, a former
Morgan Stanley treasurer who now follows the firm as an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The bank doesn&#8217;t
disclose how much revenue it gets from the business. 
Any requirement that prime brokers keep more cash on hand
to survive a hedge-fund run may cut into the profitability of
the business. That&#8217;s because cash and Treasury securities that
can be liquidated easily in a squeeze are less profitable to
hold than loans and bonds that pay higher interest rates. Also,
prime brokers may have to issue more long-term debt, which would
force them to pay higher interest rates, said Richard Lindsey, a
former prime-brokerage chief at Bear Stearns Cos. 
&#8216;Infinitely Lived Borrowing&#8217; 
&#8220;The safest way to fund something is to take out long-term
debt or, even better, equity, which is essentially infinitely
lived borrowing,&#8221; said Lindsey, now principal of Callcott Group
LLC in New York, which advises pension funds and endowments on
portfolio risks. &#8220;The problem of course is that those are the
most expensive forms of financing.&#8221; 
In July 2008, Morgan Stanley said in a regulatory filing
that its policies were designed &#8220;to ensure adequate funding
over a wide range of market environments.&#8221; The firm&#8217;s
&#8220;contingency&#8221; plan anticipated a &#8220;potential, prolonged
liquidity contraction over a one-year time period,&#8221; according
to the filing. Resources included a $5 billion credit line from
a group of banks that could be used in an emergency. 
At the end of August, Morgan Stanley had $179 billion of
liquidity, filings show. The firm had $2 billion of Fed loans
outstanding on Aug. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
As of Sept. 29, its liquidity had shrunk 44 percent to
$99.8 billion, according to internal reports released by the
crisis commission. By then, the firm had $107.3 billion of Fed
loans outstanding, the Bloomberg data show. 
&#8216;Adverse Funding Flows&#8217; 
The bank didn&#8217;t mention the Fed loans in a press release
about its financial condition that day. Two weeks later, in
another filing, the firm disclosed it was benefiting from
&#8220;expanded sources of funding and liquidity resulting from the
Fed&#8217;s current policies,&#8221; without specifying the amount. 
Staffers at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York were
astonished at how quickly Morgan Stanley&#8217;s cash dwindled, e-
mails released by the crisis commission show. 
At 11:05 p.m. on Sept. 15, 2008, William Brodows, a bank
supervision officer at the New York Fed, wrote to colleagues
that Wong, 44, the Morgan Stanley treasurer at the time, and two
other executives had called him at home that night. They wanted
&#8220;to express their concern that MS had experienced some adverse
funding flows late in the day from prime brokerage accounts,&#8221;
Brodows, 61, wrote. 
Free Credit 
Executives had already begun estimating Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
potential use of the Fed&#8217;s Primary Dealer Credit Facility, a
program created that year to supply emergency funds to
securities firms. Such companies lacked access to the central
bank&#8217;s discount window, its last-resort lending program. 
&#8220;In their &#8216;dark&#8217; scenario, they felt their PDCF usage
would increase to $10-$15 billion,&#8221; Brodows wrote in the e-
mail. 
At 6:59 a.m. the next morning, the concerns were echoed in
an e-mail by Matthew Eichner, 46, then an assistant director at
the Securities and Exchange Commission, to Brodows and other New
York Fed employees. 
&#8220;Definitely some major outflows of PB balances at both GS
($5 b) and MS ($7 b),&#8221; Eichner wrote, referring to prime-
brokerage balances at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. &#8220;Not
pretty.&#8221; 
It got uglier. At 10:18 p.m. that night, a New York Fed
&#8220;on-site primary dealer update&#8221; stated that Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
prime brokerage had suffered &#8220;free credit withdrawals of $20
billion over the last two days, contributing to a $23 billion
decline in the parent company liquidity pool to $106 billion.&#8221;
Free credit is an industry term for hedge-fund cash balances,
according to Lindsey. 
&#8216;Catastrophic Scenario&#8217; 
Two hours later, at 12:30 a.m. on Sept. 17, New York Fed
Senior Vice President Til Schuermann forwarded the update to
Brodows. Under Morgan Stanley&#8217;s &#8220;catastrophic scenario,&#8221;
Schuermann wrote, &#8220;they expect to lose $21.5 bn over the first
2 weeks -- not 2 days -- from PB!&#8221; 
Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, declined to
comment. Eichner now works for the Fed in Washington. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s shares fell 24 percent that day, and then-
Chief Executive Officer John Mack sent a memo to the firm&#8217;s
46,000 employees saying &#8220;there is no rational basis for the
movements in our stock.&#8221; 
&#8220;We&#8217;re in the midst of a market controlled by fear and
rumors, and short-sellers are driving our stock down,&#8221; Mack,
66, wrote, adding that &#8220;we have talked to&#8221; Henry Paulson, U.S.
Treasury secretary at the time, and then-SEC Chairman
Christopher Cox about the issue. He reiterated that the firm had
$179 billion of liquidity as of Aug. 31. He didn&#8217;t mention that
the figure had since dwindled to $117.7 billion, even as the
firm drew an additional $38.5 billion from the Fed. 
Chanos Withdrawal 
Jim Chanos, president and founder of New York-based hedge
fund Kynikos Associates LP, which specializes in short selling,
decided to pull $1 billion out of Morgan Stanley because he was
angry that Mack had put out a memo demonizing short sellers, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. 
Chanos, 53, has since returned to Morgan Stanley as a
prime-brokerage client, partly because the firm in September
2009 announced that Mack would give up his daily operational
role as CEO, while remaining chairman, the person said. 
On Sept. 19, 2008, Citigroup representatives told Fed
staffers that &#8220;Goldman and Credit Suisse are actively pursuing
Morgan&#8217;s prime business clients,&#8221; according to an internal
report that afternoon. The flows from Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs were coming in so quickly that Citigroup barely had time
to vet the new clients, the report said. 
Counterparty Risk 
Within a week of Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy, Morgan Stanley had
lost $84.8 billion of prime-brokerage free credits, according to
a Morgan Stanley treasurer&#8217;s report released by the crisis
commission. The next week, $43.3 billion more flowed out. 
By Sept. 29, the bank was borrowing $61.3 billion from the
PDCF through units in the U.S. and London and getting $36
billion from the Term Securities Lending Facility. The TSLF
allowed broker-dealers to swap mortgage bonds for liquid
Treasuries that could then be sold or pledged for cash close to
their face value. Morgan Stanley also received $10 billion from
the Fed&#8217;s single-tranche open-market operations, another
emergency-lending program for broker-dealers. 
The firm, which routinely demands collateral from hedge
funds to guard against default, faced a bigger risk when clients
suddenly began worrying the bank might not survive. 
&#8220;This was a world turned on its head,&#8221; said Bernstein&#8217;s
Hintz. &#8220;Who would have guessed that hedge funds would have
worried about the counterparty risk of Morgan Stanley? Morgan
Stanley worried about the counterparty risks to hedge funds, not
the other way around.&#8221; 
Mitsubishi Stake 
The bank&#8217;s draws from the Fed began to ebb after Sept. 29,
2008, when the firm announced an agreement for Tokyo-based
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. to invest $9 billion in
Morgan Stanley for a 21 percent equity stake. 
&#8220;This $9 billion investment will further bolster Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s strong capital and liquidity positions,&#8221; the firm
said in a press release that day. 
Colm Kelleher, 54, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s chief financial officer
at the time, disclosed on Dec. 18, 2008, that the firm&#8217;s prime-
brokerage balances had tumbled 46 percent to about $150 billion
as of Nov. 30 from $280 billion on Aug. 31. On a conference call
that day, Kelleher said the erosion was &#8220;clearly a function of
the downsizing of the hedge-fund business.&#8221; 
&#8216;Safer Place&#8217; 
While many hedge funds have since returned to Morgan
Stanley, the firm doesn&#8217;t provide detailed updates on its prime-
brokerage balances. 
&#8220;Prime-brokerage revenues were up significantly&#8221; over the
previous quarter, while client balances &#8220;continued to grow
modestly,&#8221; Ruth Porat, 53, who replaced Kelleher as CFO, said
on a call with investors on July 21, without disclosing amounts. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s liquidity stood at $182 billion as of June
30 and represents 22 percent of total assets, up from 18 percent
just before the crisis. 
&#8220;Nobody could withstand a run on liquidity, except, of
course, the government,&#8221; Morgan Stanley CEO James Gorman, 53,
said in a May 24 speech in New York. &#8220;Hopefully we&#8217;re in a much
safer place as a result of it.&#8221; 
In a brief interview afterward, Gorman declined to comment
on what changes the firm had made in its prime brokerage. 
&#8220;We give out as much as we feel is appropriate on that
business,&#8221; he said. 
A new rule adopted in December by the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, an international panel of regulators,
requires global banks to keep enough cash or cash-like reserves
on hand to survive a 25 percent run-off of balances in
&#8220;clearing, custody or cash-management&#8221; accounts during a
crisis lasting 30 days. The rule doesn&#8217;t take effect until 2015. 
&#8216;Almost Impossible&#8217; 
While Morgan Stanley&#8217;s liquidity has increased, &#8220;it&#8217;s
almost impossible&#8221; to judge whether it&#8217;s enough, Hintz said. 
&#8220;You don&#8217;t know whether the liquidity pool is required by
the ratings agencies, or whether it is required by the Federal
Reserve,&#8221; Hintz said. &#8220;I suspect there&#8217;s something of both.
But it&#8217;s a recognition that the old contingency funding plans
had a flaw, and that these events can happen very quickly.&#8221; 
Hedge funds have changed their business practices to
protect themselves from the collapse of a prime broker, limiting
the amount of funding that securities firms can get from such
relationships, said Allan Yip, a former in-house prime-brokerage
lawyer for Bear Stearns. 
Repledging Assets 
Many funds now restrict the ability of securities firms to
repledge assets to obtain funding, a process known as
&#8220;rehypothecation,&#8221; Yip said. More funds stipulate that their
cash must be held in separate bank accounts. 
&#8220;This has been a market-driven change, in terms of what
liquidity can be obtained by the banks,&#8221; said Yip, who now
advises hedge funds on prime-brokerage and trading documentation
as a partner in London at law firm Simmons  Simmons LLP. 
Not that the funds have to worry. It&#8217;s probable the central
bank would again lend to a big firm such as Morgan Stanley if
another crisis hit, said Viral Acharya, a New York University
finance professor who serves as an academic adviser to the Fed,
according to the university&#8217;s website. 
For hedge funds, &#8220;it&#8217;s basically like you get the too-big-
to-fail benefit from being connected to a large financial
firm,&#8221; Acharya said. &#8220;If you dealt with a small prime broker,
say a boutique investment firm, it&#8217;s unlikely to be bailed
out.&#8221;

Investor confidence in U.S.
corporate credit deteriorated to the worst level since June 2010
and the cost to protect Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) debt jumped
following a report that Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
hired a defense attorney. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 4 basis points to a
mid-price of 126.8 basis points as of 5:35 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. Credit-
default swaps on Goldman Sachs jumped 40 basis points to 255.4
basis points, the highest level since April 2009, according to
data provider CMA. 
Traders earlier pushed down the benchmark gauge of
investment-grade debt risk, which typically falls when investor
confidence improves and rises when it deteriorates, before the
Federal Reserve holds its annual symposium in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming this weekend. The index reversed as credit risk at
finance companies including Bank of America Corp. (BAC) gained. 
&#8220;Monday saw a tug-o-war of themes that pitted financial
sector concerns against bullish sentiment tied to speculation
Bernanke&#8217;s speech on Friday will deliver a message of further
stimulus,&#8221; Adrian Miller, fixed-income strategist at Miller
Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mail. 
The index has soared from 96.3 at the end of July as
investor concern mounted that the global economic recovery is
slowing. 
Goldman Sachs said Blankfein and other people hired
attorneys in relation to a U.S. probe of matters raised by the
Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
Justice Department 
&#8220;As is common in such situations, Mr. Blankfein and other
individuals who were expected to be interviewed in connection
with the Justice Department&#8217;s inquiry into certain matters
raised in the PSI report hired counsel at the outset,&#8221; the New
York-based company said today in an e-mailed statement. 
Contracts linked to the debt of Bank of America, based in
Charlotte, North Carolina, added 38.6 basis points to 380.6, the
data show. 
Investor confidence in high-yield, high-risk debt plunged
for a third day to the lowest level in almost two years. The
Markit CDX North America High Yield Index, which falls as
investor confidence deteriorates, dropped 0.6 percentage point
to 91.8 percent of face value, the lowest level since Sept. 10,
2009. High-yield, high-risk bonds and loans are rated below Baa3
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by SP. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, began arguing its U.S. trade case that Android-
based smartphones made by Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. use
technology derived from Microsoft inventions. 
In a trial that began today before the International Trade
Commission in Washington, Microsoft accused Motorola Mobility of
infringing seven of its patents and requested a halt to imports
of certain Motorola phones. The ITC has the power to stop
imports of products that violate U.S. patent rights. 
The case is the first smartphone dispute to be heard by the
agency since Google Inc. (GOOG) said Aug. 15 it would buy Motorola
Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that could be used
as a bulwark against a surge of lawsuits targeting handsets and
tablet computers that use Google&#8217;s Android operating system. 
&#8220;We have a responsibility to our employees, customers,
partners and shareholders to safeguard our intellectual
property,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft&#8217;s corporate vice president
and deputy general counsel for litigation, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;Motorola is infringing our patents and we are confident that
the ITC will rule in our favor.&#8221; 
Motorola Mobility is &#8220;vigorously defending&#8221; itself
&#8220;against Microsoft&#8217;s patent attack business strategy,&#8221;
Jennifer Erickson, a Motorola Mobility spokeswoman, said in an
e-mail. &#8220;We have also brought legal actions of our own in the
U.S. and in Europe to address Microsoft&#8217;s large scale of
infringement of Motorola Mobility&#8217;s patents.&#8221; 
Smartphone Market 
Microsoft&#8217;s claim against Libertyville, Illinois-based
Motorola Mobility is one of more than a dozen smartphone cases
before the ITC, as companies seek to use patents to gain a
bigger share of a market projected by researcher IHS Inc. to
reach $206.6 billion this year. Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft makes its own mobile operating system, Windows Phone
7, which competes with Android and Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone. 
The Android platform accounted for 43.3 percent of the
smartphone market last quarter, according to Stamford,
Connecticut-based research firm Gartner Inc. (IT) Microsoft, with
less than 2 percent of the market, is counting on an agreement
with Espoo, Finland-based Nokia Oyj (NOK) to put Windows Mobile on its
phones to increase market share. 
Cases brought by Microsoft and Cupertino, California-based
Apple are targeting devices that run on Android. Microsoft,
which contends all Android devices use its technology, also has
a case against Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS), targeting the Nook reader. 
Testimony in today&#8217;s Motorola Mobility trial focused on
details about functions that Microsoft calls &#8220;essential to the
smartphone user experience,&#8221; including ways to synchronize e-
mail, calendars and contacts; schedule meetings; and notify
applications of changes in signal strength and battery power. 
Block Imports 
Microsoft has asked the agency to block imports of Motorola
phones including the Droid 2, Droid X, Cliq XT, Devour, Backflip
and Charm. Administrative Law Judge Theodore Essex is scheduled
to release his findings in the case Nov. 4, and the commission
has a target to complete its investigation by March 5, according
to information on the agency&#8217;s website. 
Mountain View, California-based Google, which wasn&#8217;t named
in the complaint, accused Microsoft of disclosing Google&#8217;s
source code to a Microsoft expert without first letting Google
know. Essex on Aug. 15 denied Google&#8217;s request that sanctions be
imposed on Microsoft, saying Google had failed to provide any
information that it has made a &#8220;reasonable, good-faith effort
to resolve the matter with Microsoft.&#8221; 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile Devices,
Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington).

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Nigerian unit is
awaiting an arbitration ruling to end its dispute with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. over &#8220;entitlements to lift
crude oil&#8221; from the Erha offshore field. 
&#8220;We can confirm that the arbitration hearing ended in
Abuja on March 2,&#8221; Nigel Cookey-Gam, an Exxon spokesman in
Nigeria, said today in an e-mailed statement. The &#8220;parties are
currently awaiting an award by the tribunal.&#8221; 
Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest company, sought arbitration in
2009 after talks with the Nigerian government and the state oil
company, known as NNPC, had &#8220;been unsuccessful,&#8221; the statement
said. There&#8217;s no specific date yet for the ruling, said Cookey-
Gam. Levi Ajuonuma, a NNPC spokesman, declined to comment. 
The Erha field, located about 97 kilometers (60 miles)
offshore Nigeria, started production in 2006 and has the
capacity to pump about 190,000 barrels of crude a day. Exxon
Mobil, operator of the field, holds a 56.25 percent interest and
Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co., a local unit of
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), holds 43.75 percent. 
Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s top oil producer, is the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. imports of the fuel. Shell, Exxon, Chevron Corp.,
Total SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with state-owned NNPC,
which pumps about 90 percent of the country&#8217;s crude.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest oil company by market value, estimated the cost to clean
up a July 1 oil spill into the Yellowstone River in Montana will
be $42.6 million, according to a filing with federal regulators. 
The company&#8217;s emergency response to the spill from the
Silvertip pipeline will cost $40 million and property claims
will be $2.5 million, the company said in a July 29 filing with
the Transportation Department&#8217;s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration. Exxon also lost about $100,000 of oil and
other commodities in the spill, according to the document,
obtained by Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act
request. 
Exxon&#8217;s 69-mile (111-kilometer) Silvertip line spilled an
estimated 1,000 barrels of crude into a flood-swollen
Yellowstone River near Laurel, Montana. The pipeline runs from
Elk Basin, Wyoming to Exxon&#8217;s refinery in Billings, Montana. 
More than 1,000 people were working to clean up the site as
of Aug. 12, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, which is leading the response effort. Sampling results
for air, water, soil and sediment around the river show &#8220;no
levels of concern&#8221; for water supplies or air quality, the
agency said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) lowered its
forecast for U.S. economic growth in 2011 on signs the recovery
in the world&#8217;s largest economy lost momentum. 
The U.S. will expand 1.5 percent this year, down from a
previous forecast of 1.7 percent, Goldman economists in New York
including Jan Hatzius said in a note published on Aug. 19.
Credit Suisse was also among banks lowering growth forecasts this 
month. 
Federal Reserve surveys showed manufacturing in
Philadelphia and New York contracted in August, while a Thomson
Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment
plunged to a three-decade low. Goldman&#8217;s change comes amid a
monthlong drop in global equities and as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke prepares to speak at the bank&#8217;s annual symposium in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming this week. 
The data &#8220;are pointing to even weaker growth ahead,&#8221; the
economists said. While Bernanke &#8220;is likely to be downbeat about
recent developments, we expect that he will still argue that the
conditions for an acceleration later this year and in 2012
remain in place.&#8221; 
Goldman forecasts third-quarter growth of 1 percent and a
fourth-quarter expansion of 1.5 percent, down from an earlier
projection for 2 percent growth in each quarter. 
Credit Suisse lowered its forecast for U.S. third-quarter
growth to 1.5 percent from from 3.3 percent, and for the fourth
quarter to 2.2 percent from 3.1 percent, according to a research
note dated Aug. 18. The bank cut its projection for global
growth to 3.9 percent in 2011 from 4.1 percent. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) predicts 1 percent growth in U.S.
gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, down from an
earlier projection of 2.5 percent, the bank said last week.
Citigroup Inc. (C) lowered its 2011 growth forecast to 1.6 percent
from 1.7 percent.

Charlotte Roche likes to shock. Her
first book, whose teenage heroine is hospitalized with an anal
lesion after an intimate shaving accident, sold more than 2
million copies in German. 
Roche, a sparky 33-year-old brunette who combines tattoos
and floral dresses, used to be a music and entertainment
television presenter. 
Her second novel, which entered Der Spiegel&#8217;s fiction
bestseller list at slot No. 1 this week, is also not for the
fainthearted. It&#8217;s titled &#8220;Schossgebete,&#8221; a made-up word that
is a play on Stossgebet -- a desperate prayer -- and Schoss,
which can refer to the female reproductive organs though more
generally means the lap area. 
&#8220;Schossgebete&#8221; opens with 15 pages of pornography,
describing a married couple having sex with the electric
blankets on and the windows closed, as the heroine prefers. 
Yet like its predecessor &#8220;Wetlands,&#8221; whose yuckiness
cloaks the story of a lost girl trying to reunite her divorced
parents, &#8220;Schossgebete&#8221; presents an exhaustively intimate
psychological portrait of a very disturbed young woman. 
The reader is forced into voyeurism -- and not just of the
sexual variety -- as Roche bares all in this relentlessly frank,
often funny novel about a troubled 33-year-old traumatized by a
tragedy in her past. The author admitted in an interview with
Spiegel that it is dangerously close to autobiography.

The cost to protect bonds of U.S.
companies fell from the highest level in 14 months as investor
speculation the Federal Reserve will act to spur the economy
overshadowed concern that banks will be forced to raise capital. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 1.3 basis points to a
mid-price of 125.5 basis points as of 5:27 p.m. in New York,
Markit Group Ltd. data show. The index earlier jumped as much as
4.9 basis points. Bank of America Corp. (BAC) credit swaps declined
after earlier soaring to a record. 
Corporate and financial company debt is being whipsawed
before central bankers meet this week in Jackson Hole, Wyoming.
The credit risk benchmark, which rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, dropped even after a
magnitude 5.9 earthquake struck Virginia and shook buildings in
Washington and New York. 
Investor confidence in corporate credit decreased earlier
on &#8220;concerns about the sovereign situation, concerns about our
own domestic macro situation,&#8221; John Guarnera, a financial
analyst at Societe Generale SA in New York, said in a telephone
interview. The rise signaled investors were &#8220;ignoring the fact
that the financials are fundamentally better-positioned than
where we were coming out of the credit crisis.&#8221; 
Credit-default swaps tied to Bank of America fell 2 basis
points to 378.5 as of 5 p.m. in New York, according to data
provider CMA. That pared an earlier surge to at least 445 basis
points, which exceeded the peak during the financial crisis in
March 2009, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts wrote in a report. 
&#8216;Irrational&#8217; Valuations 
Valuations are becoming &#8220;irrational,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts
Kabir Caprihan and Matthew Hughart based in New York wrote in
the report. They changed their view on the debt to &#8220;neutral&#8221;
from &#8220;underweight.&#8221; 
Bank of America credit swaps have more than doubled from
178 basis points at the end of July as concern mounts that the
lender may face larger losses tied to mortgages and will need to
raise additional capital. 
Henry Blodget, the former Internet stock analyst turned
blogger, wrote on Business Insider that charges and loan costs
may force the bank to raise as much as $200 billion. 
The bank has &#8220;no reason&#8221; to raise capital, Rochdale
Securities analyst Richard Bove said in an interview today on
Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InBusiness With Margaret Brennan.&#8221; 
&#8220;Bank of America has so much cash on its balance sheet
that it could pay back all of its short-term debt and a big
chunk of its long-term debt,&#8221; Bove said. 
Goldman Swaps 
Contracts on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, fell 10 basis points to 245, according to
data provider CMA. The swaps earlier rose to 283, the highest
level since April 2009. The contracts rose 40 basis points
yesterday, after Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and
others hired attorneys in relation to a U.S. probe of matters
raised by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. 
U.S. bank bonds are &#8220;very attractive&#8221; investments after
declining this month, according to Pacific Investment Management
Co.&#8217;s Mark Kiesel. 
&#8220;This is a sector that makes money, has improved
capital,&#8221; Kiesel, Pimco&#8217;s global head of corporate bond
portfolios, said today in a Bloomberg Television interview. 
Pimco, the Newport Beach, California-based manager of the
world&#8217;s largest bond fund, has been wagering on U.S. bank debt
since at least April 2008, when Kiesel said that big banks would
&#8220;slim down&#8221; by raising capital and cutting leverage. Lenders
have improved their balance sheets, making them a safe bet,
Kiesel told Scarlet Fu on the network&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop&#8221; program. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), leader of a
group of lenders owed $381.7 million on a bankrupt homebuilding
project in Henderson, Nevada, sued Meritage Homes Corp. (MTH) to
recover the builder&#8217;s share of a guarantee. 
JPMorgan and other lenders agreed in 2004 to advance as
much as $535 million to builders including Meritage and Beazer
Homes USA Inc. (BZH), taking repayment guarantees from each builder,
according to a complaint filed yesterday in Las Vegas. The share
of Meritage for the loans advanced to date is $13.3 million,
JPMorgan said in the filing as it asked a judge to compel
payment. 
&#8220;JPMorgan has made due demand under the repayment
guaranty, and the defendants have failed and refused to pay
their liabilities,&#8221; the bank said. 
South Edge LLC, which is owned by the builders, is in
bankruptcy court in Nevada. The bankruptcy triggered the
repayment guarantee, JPMorgan said. 
Meritage sued the bank Aug. 19 in state court in Ohio,
where the JPMorgan unit that is the trustee for the lenders is
based. Meritage asked a judge to rule the homebuilder doesn&#8217;t
have any obligations to the lenders and seeks $8 million in
damages. 
Meritage claims that it tried to pay the lenders in April
2008 but JPMorgan refused to accept the payment. 
Meritage&#8217;s claim for damages is based on losses related to
the drop in value of the property and legal fees, company Chief
Financial Officer Larry W. Seay said today in a telephone
interview. 
The case is JPMorgan v. Meritage Homes, 11-cv-01364, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas).

General Motors Co. (GM), the maker of the
plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt, and LG Group have agreed to form
a partnership to design and engineer future electric cars, a
high priority of Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson. 
GM, 32 percent owned by the U.S., brings expertise in
vehicles and Seoul-based LG knows how to develop and build
lithium-ion batteries. Closely held LG supplies batteries for
the Volt and the mechanically identical Opel Ampera sold in
Europe. The deal does not involve an exchange of equity, the
companies said today in a statement. 
The agreement should help Detroit-based GM stay current on
battery technology and ensure that the company has close
relations with a supplier that can help engineer electric-power
systems, said Michael Robinet, a Northville, Michigan-based vice
president of research firm IHS Automotive. 
&#8220;In tomorrow&#8217;s vehicles, customers will look at technology
as a differentiator,&#8221; Robinet said. &#8220;Vehicle manufacturers
will be looking to link up with major battery players to ensure
that they have new technology. There will be an interesting
round of musical chairs.&#8221; 
Akerson boosted Volt production plans for next year to
60,000 from 45,000 after exploring an increase to 120,000 of the
plug-in hybrids. This partnership will not make batteries for
the next-generation Volt, Kevin Kelly, a GM spokesman, said in a
telephone interview. 
GM slipped 11 cents to $22.26 at 12:02 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 33
percent since a $33 initial public offering in November.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Wells Fargo
 Co. (WFC) are among banks that made final bids to buy portions of
Anglo Irish Bank Corp.&#8217;s $9.65 billion of U.S. property loans,
according to three people with knowledge of the sales. 
The lenders are looking to acquire pieces of the $4.52
billion of performing loans the Dublin-based bank is shedding,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Investor groups led by private-equity firms
Blackstone Group LP (BX), working with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), and Lone
Star Funds also submitted offers for parts of the portfolio,
which include $5.13 billion of subperforming and non-performing
debt, the people said. 
&#8220;Banks like Wells and JPMorgan can afford to pay more than
a nonbank for the performing loans,&#8221; said Ben Thypin, director
of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics Inc., a property-
research firm in New York. &#8220;Private-equity firms like
Blackstone and Lone Star can bid aggressively on the
nonperforming pieces because they have a large workout
infrastructure in place.&#8221; 
Anglo Irish is seeking to unload loans after being seized
by the Irish government in January 2009 amid a surge in souring
debt. The offering includes loans backed buildings from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills, California. The competition
underscores the appetite for real estate loans by private-equity
firms and banks looking to grow their assets even amid signs
that the global economic recovery is stalling. 
Martha Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Anglo Irish, declined to
comment on the bids, as did spokesmen for New York-based
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. 
Board to Discuss 
Final bids were submitted this week and a winner is
expected to be chosen by early next week, according to the
people. Anglo Irish&#8217;s board of directors is likely to discuss
the final bids at a meeting today in advance of tomorrow&#8217;s
release of first-half results, according to a person familiar
with the matter, who asked not be identified because the
information is private. 
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may hold the loans for their own
books or package them for sale as bonds if investor demand for
commercial-mortgage backed securities, or CMBS, is sufficient,
said one of the people. Earlier this year, Wells Fargo bought a
$1.4 billion portfolio of 25 loans from Bank of Ireland Plc on
properties in Boston, New York and Washington, according to Alan Elias, a spokesman for the San Francisco-based bank. The lender
also bought part of Allied Irish Banks LLC&#8217;s $1 billion loan
portfolio, Elias said. Blackstone purchased the other piece. 
Financing Possible 
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo may finance the purchase of the
some pools, the people said. A syndicate of lenders including
Bank of America Corp., RBC Capital Markets, Citigroup Inc. and
Macquarie Bank Ltd. are also vying for the assignment, the
people said. 
Eastdil Secured LLC and FTI Consulting Inc. (FCN) are advising
Anglo Irish on the sale, the people said. The portfolio has been
divided into eight pools, according to an offering document from
Eastdil. 
Representatives of Blackstone, Lone Star, Deutsche Bank,
Citigroup, Bank of America, RBC Capital and Macquarie declined
to comment on the deal. Calls to Eastdil weren&#8217;t returned.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) and Lone Star Funds won the bidding for Anglo Irish Bank
Corp.&#8217;s $9.65 billion portfolio of U.S. real estate loans,
according to three people briefed on the auction&#8217;s results. 
JPMorgan and Wells Fargo each won pools of mainly
performing loans, said one of the people, who asked not to be
named because the results haven&#8217;t been made public. Lone Star,
the Dallas-based investor in distressed mortgages, will buy
subperforming and nonperforming loans that account for about
half of the portfolio, the person said. 
The auction, which included loans backed by buildings from
Manhattan to Beverly Hills, California, underscores the appetite
for property in higher-quality locations by private-equity firms
and banks seeking to expand their assets. The winning bids for
the loans averaged about 80 cents on the dollar, said two of the
people who were told of the results. 
&#8220;If you&#8217;re looking at quality assets in good, strong
markets, I&#8217;d say 80 cents on the dollar sounds pretty
reasonable,&#8221; said Tom Craig, founder of TSC Realty Partners, a
commercial-property broker in Seattle who wasn&#8217;t involved in the
sale. &#8220;One of the barriers to entry on a big deal like this is
how many people can put the capital together to buy this and
close quickly.&#8221; 
Blackstone Bid 
Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, and
Alan Elias, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo,
declined to comment, as did Andy Brimmer, a spokesman for Lone
Star. Martha Kavanagh, a spokeswoman for Anglo Irish in Dublin,
also declined to comment. 
A message for Martha Wallau, a spokeswoman for Eastdil
Secured LLC, the Wells Fargo unit that conducted the auction,
wasn&#8217;t returned. 
Blackstone Group LP (BX) was a final bidder for at least a
portion of the loans, according to people with knowledge of the
situation. Peter Rose, a spokesman for the New York-based
private-equity firm, declined to comment. 
Anglo Irish is seeking to unload loans after being seized
by the Irish government in January 2009 amid a surge in souring
debt. The U.S. loans are backed by properties including the
Apthorp apartments in Manhattan, Chicago&#8217;s Palmer House Hilton
hotel and the Two Rodeo Drive shopping center in Beverly Hills. 
Anglo Irish expects to complete the U.S. portfolio sale by
year&#8217;s end, Tom Hunersen, the bank&#8217;s head of corporate
development, said at a press briefing yesterday. 
&#8220;We had a large group of interested parties,&#8221; Hunersen
said, declining to disclose details of the auction. The bank
achieved &#8220;the best possible value,&#8221; he said.

Morgan Stanley is advising on the
sale of Portugal&#8217;s 1.65 billion euro ($2.4 billion) stake in
utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA, two people with knowledge
of the matter said. 
The sale is one of the measures that the government pledged
in exchange for a 78 billion-euro bailout from the European
Union and the International Monetary Fund. With the country&#8217;s
borrowing costs surging, Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in
April in seeking a rescue. 
Prime Minister Pedro Passos Coelho said on June 30 he
planned to sell the stake in EDP in the third quarter. Portugal
holds 25 percent of EDP, although only 20.9 percent of the
utility will be up for sale, as 4.14 percent has been exchanged
for bonds that mature in 2014, Joaquim Reis, chairman of
Portuguese state holding company Parpublica, said in a July 22
interview. The utility was valued at 7.9 billion euros at the
close of trading today. 
The utility&#8217;s shareholders in a meeting yesterday ended the
state&#8217;s &#8220;golden share&#8221; veto rights and changed the limits on
voting rights to 20 percent of the company&#8217;s stock. EDP&#8217;s rules
previously prevented any one investor from voting with more than
5 percent of shares. 
Newspaper Expresso reported in July that State Grid Corp.
of China, another Chinese company and Centrais Electricas
Brasileiras SA, a Brazilian electricity company known as
Electrobras, were interested in buying a stake in EDP. 
Eletrobras on March 31 had said it was in the technical and
economic analysis stage of a possible investment in EDP. 
Newspaper Diario Economico also reported in May that China
Power was interested in EDP. On Aug. 10, China Power
International Development Ltd. said its parent company currently
had no plan to acquire shares in the utility.

The U.S. Treasury Department
announced an $88.3 million settlement with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
for apparent violations of international sanctions programs,
including Cuban assets control and anti-terrorism regulations. 
The Treasury said that JPMorgan through its correspondent
banks maintained prohibited financial transactions with
sanctioned entities in countries including Cuba and Iran. 
The JPMorgan payment agreed upon by the Office of Foreign
Assets Control, known as OFAC, involves &#8220;egregious&#8221; violations
for five years, according to a Treasury Department statement. 
&#8220;The civil settlement resolves a number of OFAC
allegations dating back to 2005, none of which involved any
intent to violate OFAC regulations,&#8221; Jennifer R. Zuccarelli, a
JPMorgan spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;These
rare incidents were unrelated and isolated from each other. The
firm screens hundreds of millions of transactions and customer
records per day and annual error rates are a tiny fraction of a
percent.&#8221; 
The OFAC enforcement action covers actions from December
2005 to March 2011 involving multiple violations of sanctions
programs, the Treasury said. The violations include processing
1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million from December 2005
to March 2006 involving Cuban persons and a trade loan of $2.9
million with a blocked affiliate to the Islamic Republic of Iran
Shipping Lines. 
OFAC said the $88.3 million payment from JPMorgan is based
on the bank&#8217;s cooperation, transaction review and the absence of
an OFAC notice or finding of violation during the five years of
the transactions. 
Compliance Policy 
EPA Delays Mandate to Report Products Leading to Carbon Releases 
The Environmental Protection Agency said it would put off
reporting requirements for manufacturers and power plants on the
products they use that lead to greenhouse-gas emissions. 
In a Federal Register notice yesterday, the EPA said that
companies would have until at least 2013 to submit information
about the raw materials. Representatives of chemical makers, oil
refiners and other manufacturers have tried to scuttle the EPA&#8217;s
proposal, saying it would force them to disclose confidential
information. 
The rules were set to take effect this year. The EPA
proposed in December that they be deferred and yesterday&#8217;s
notice makes that decision final. The rules will be delayed
until March 31, 2013, for some substances and two years later
for others. 
Facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more a year of
greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, are required to submit
annual reports to the EPA on those releases. On Aug. 22, the EPA
started a new program that lets 7,000 power plants, refiners and
other manufacturers file their emissions data electronically.
The information must be submitted by the end of September. 
Employers Must Tell Workers of Right to Unionize, NLRB Says 
U.S. employers must post notices informing workers about
their legal rights to form a union and bargain on contracts, the
National Labor Relations Board said in a rule that may help
efforts to organize employees. 
Companies that use posters to tell employees about
personnel rules or policies must add a notice about their
collective bargaining rights, according to a statement yesterday
from the NLRB. The posting must be completed Nov. 14. 
&#8220;The notice does make it easier for labor to make
inroads,&#8221; Doreen Davis, a partner in the labor and employment
practice at Morgan, Lewis  Bockius LLP in New York and
Philadelphia, said in an interview. 
The board proposed the rule to spell out for employees
their rights under federal laws that let workers choose to form
and join a labor union. Business groups protested the proposal
and said the rule shows that the agency favors unions. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s arbitrary, it&#8217;s capricious,&#8221; Peter Schaumber, a
former NLRB chairman appointed by Republican President George W.
Bush, said in an interview. &#8220;It shows just how activist they&#8217;re
prepared to be.&#8221; 
&#8220;The NLRB rule simply brings the National Labor Relations
Act in line with other workplace laws that require employers to
post a notice in the workplace of their employees&#8217; rights,&#8221;
Peter Colavito, director of government relations at the 2.2
million-member Service Employees International Union, said in a
statement.

U.S. Banks Said to Seek Relief From Regulators as Deposits Swell 
U.S. regulators have asked some banks to take more deposits
from large investors even if it&#8217;s unprofitable, and lenders in
return are seeking relief on insurance premiums and leverage
ratios, according to six people with knowledge of the talks. 
Deposits are flooding into the biggest U.S. banks as
customers seek shelter from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and falling
stock prices. That forces lenders to raise capital for a growing
balance sheet and saddles them with the higher deposit insurance
payments. With short-term interest rates so low, it&#8217;s hard for
financial firms to reinvest the new money profitably. 
Regulators have asked banks to take the deposits anyway,
three people said, with one lender accepting $100 billion. The
regulators want lenders to take the deposits because it improves
the stability of the financial system, according to one of the
people, who said U.S. banks are viewed as places of strength. 
Some of the largest ones have talked with regulators about
softening rules for ratios that measure capital and assets,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
talks are private. At least one asked for a waiver on paying
higher premiums to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which is
less likely to be granted, one of the people said. 
&#8220;If the helicopter comes raining money on your bank and
it&#8217;s only temporarily there, it could be excessively costly and
disruptive,&#8221; said Robert Litan, a vice president of research
and policy at the Kansas City, Missouri-based Kauffman
Foundation, which promotes entrepreneurial business practices. 
The extra deposits are problematic because they&#8217;re subject
to withdrawal, so banks have to park the money in low-yielding
short-term investments, Litan said. With few other choices
available, banks have stashed their excess deposits at the Fed,
which means the cash gets counted as assets. 
This expands their balance sheets and thus pushes down
their leverage ratio, which measures Tier 1 capital divided by
adjusted average total assets; the lower the ratio, the weaker
the bank, at least in theory. In reality, regulators regard U.S.
lenders as relatively strong with sufficient capital cushions,
the people said. 
Lenders have held discussions with officials at the Fed,
FDIC, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Treasury
Department, according to four of the people. Spokesmen for the
four agencies declined to comment. 
Shannon Bell, a Citigroup spokeswoman, Howard Opinsky at
JPMorgan, Ancel Martinez at Wells Fargo and Bank of America&#8217;s
Jerry Dubrowski declined to comment. 
Relaxing the rules or enforcement could be a slippery
slope, said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP LLC,
a Jersey City, New Jersey-based unit of London-based ICAP Plc,
the world&#8217;s largest inter-dealer broker. 
&#8220;Asking for a free pass on the leverage ratio for bank
deposits by itself isn&#8217;t something that regulators would
consider,&#8221; Crandall said. &#8220;The question is whether banks
should be able to exclude reserve balances since they are a
risk-free asset.&#8221;

Facebook Faces Confusion From Multiple Privacy Agencies, EU Says 
Facebook Inc. and other Internet companies face legal
confusion from local and national European regulators with
different approaches to data protection, the European Commission
said. 
These differences &#8220;show the risk that the same company and
services will be treated in an inconsistent manner by different
authorities,&#8221; said Matthew Newman, a spokesman for the European
Commission, in an e-mail. The Brussels-based regulator will
propose draft rules later this year for all data protection
agencies across the 27-nation bloc to follow. 
Facebook&#8217;s like button and facial-recognition features were
criticized by two German regional regulators this month, with
officials in Schleswig-Holstein saying the like button may
violate European Union and German data protection law while
Hamburg&#8217;s data protection agency said the company may break
privacy rules by recording biometric data. 
Facebook is among U.S. companies that have faced scrutiny
in the EU for possible privacy breaches. Google Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and Yahoo! Inc. have been pushed by European data-
protection officials to limit the amount of time they store
online users&#8217; search records. The group of regulators, known as
the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party, has also
criticized Facebook for policy changes that could harm users&#8217;
privacy. 
Compliance Action 
National Century&#8217;s Poulsen Conviction, 30-Year Term Upheld 
A federal appeals court upheld the 30-year prison term of
Lance Poulsen, founder of National Century Financial Enterprises
Inc., as well as his convictions at separate trials on
obstruction of justice and fraud charges. 
Poulsen was found guilty by jurors in federal court in
Columbus, Ohio, in October 2008 of fraud, conspiracy and money
laundering for defrauding investors of $2.9 billion. Seven
months earlier, a separate jury convicted him of trying to bribe
the main witness against him. U.S. District Judge Algenon
Marbley sentenced him to 30 years in the fraud case. 
The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati
yesterday rejected Poulsen&#8217;s claims that Marbley made several
improper rulings at each trial and that his prison term was too
long. Poulsen had said he shouldn&#8217;t get a longer sentence than
the chief executive officers of WorldCom Inc. and Enron Corp.,
who got 25 and 24 years, respectively. 
&#8220;Poulsen cites a number of sentences given to those whom
he refers to as &#8216;the most notorious financial fraudsters in
corporate America,&#8217;&#8221; according to the opinion by a three-judge
panel of the appeals court. &#8220;Poulsen presents no coherent
argument as to why his sentence is substantively unreasonable.&#8221; 
Poulsen, 68, is incarcerated at the Williamsburg Federal
Correctional Institution in South Carolina, according to the
U.S. Bureau of Prisons website. His release date is listed on
the site as Dec. 4, 2033. 
The appeals panel ruled that Marbley properly determined
the loss to investors as $2.89 billion, even though prosecutors
had said once to jurors that the loss was only &#8220;over $2
billion.&#8221; 
Poulsen&#8217;s attorneys William Terpening and Peter Anderson
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment on the ruling. 
Poulsen&#8217;s 30-year term for the fraud case is concurrent
with his earlier 10-year term for the obstruction case. 
The appeals are U.S. v. Poulsen, 08-4218 and 09-3658, 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Cincinnati).

Drimal Should Get 70- to 80-Month Prison Term, U.S. Says 
Craig Drimal, the former Galleon Group LLC trader who
pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges, should get a prison
term of 70 to 80 months, which is within federal sentencing
guidelines, the U.S. said in a memo. 
Drimal pleaded guilty last month in federal court in New
York charges of conspiracy and securities fraud. Drimal admitted
that he and others at Galleon traded on inside information
obtained from lawyers working on transactions involving 3Com
Corp. and Axcan Pharma Inc. in 2007. Drimal said the information
was obtained from Arthur Cutillo and Brien Santarlas, lawyers at
Boston-based Ropes  Gray LLP. 
Drimal has suggested that the court impose community
service or home confinement in lieu of a &#8220;substantial&#8221; prison
term, prosecutors said. The request should be denied in order to
send a &#8220;strong message of deterrence to others in the hedge
fund community&#8221; and because the &#8220;nature and extent of his
criminal conduct doesn&#8217;t warrant community service,&#8221;
prosecutors said. 
Drimal is scheduled to be sentenced by U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan on Aug. 31. Drimal&#8217;s attorney, Jane Anne
Murray, said she filed a memorandum last week asking the judge
to impose a sentence below the federal guidelines. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not surprised by their position; it&#8217;s been
consistent,&#8221; Murray said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We
disagree with the government on a number of issues including the
applicable guidelines. And we&#8217;re seeking a sentence that is
substantially lower than the one the government is seeking.&#8221; 
Prosecutors also asked the court to obtain a judgment
against Drimal to recover the amount of the proceeds of his
crimes, which they said are at least $7 million. 
The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Courts 
Fuld, Lehman Executives to Settle Lawsuit for $90 Million 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ) executives including former
Chairman Richard Fuld will settle an investor lawsuit using a
$90 million payment from the defunct firm&#8217;s insurers, according
to a court filing. 
The investors blamed Lehman officers and directors for
losses on Lehman stock and options from June 12, 2007, to Sept.
15, 2008, according to the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. Fuld, 65, was chief executive officer of New York-
based Lehman, once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank,
before its 2008 bankruptcy. 
A bankruptcy examiner said Lehman foundered because of too
much debt, which it tried to hide from investors, and risky real
estate investments. 
Patricia Hynes, a lawyer for Fuld, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment. 
Lehman said in November that Fuld would get $10 million
from insurers as part of an officers-and-directors program
paying for the costs of lawsuits. It also said insurers would be
asked to pay as much as $90 million in costs for unidentified
defendants in civil, criminal and regulatory proceedings. 
Lehman has asked the judge to modify bankruptcy law on nine
previous occasions to tap its directors-and-officers insurance,
according to the Aug. 24 filing. 
The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
New Suits 
Bank of America Depressed Libor Rates, Schwab Says in Suit 
Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW), the largest independent brokerage by
client assets, sued Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
other banks claiming they manipulated the London interbank
offered rate, or Libor, starting in 2007 in violation of U.S.
antitrust law. 
The lawsuit filed Aug. 23 in federal court in San
Francisco, where Schwab is based, claims the banks conspired to
depress Libor rates by understating their borrowing costs,
thereby lowering their interest expenses on products tied to the
rates. The banks &#8220;reaped hundreds of millions, if not billions,
of dollars in ill-gotten gains,&#8221; Schwab wrote. 
In separate suits in April, three European asset-management
firms and the Carpenters Pension Fund of West Virginia sued the
banks claiming they manipulated Libor. U.S. and U.K. officials
are cooperating in a probe of possible Libor manipulation, a
person close to the investigation said in March. 
The Schwab suit seeks unspecified damages, which may be
tripled under antitrust law. It also includes claims for
racketeering and securities fraud. 
Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
spokeswoman for New York-based Citigroup, didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls for comment. 
The case is Schwab Money Market Fund v. Bank of America
Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-4186, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Francisco). 
Guaranty Financial Trustee Suit Accuses KBW of Short Sales 
The liquidation trustee for Guaranty Financial Group Inc. (GFGFQ)
sued KBW Inc. (KBW), claiming that the investment bank used inside
information about the Texas lender to short its stock before KBW
collapsed. 
Kenneth Tepper, the trustee, is seeking to recover $20
million in fees KBW obtained as Guaranty Financial&#8217;s investment
banker, profit it received from betting against the company&#8217;s
shares and other damages, according to a suit filed Aug. 24 in
New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
&#8220;KBW&#8217;s disregard of its contractual obligations and
illegal and improper use of GFG&#8217;s and the bank&#8217;s material, non-
public, confidential, inside information undermined GFG&#8217;s
efforts to raise capital, one of the very purposes for which KBW
had been engaged,&#8221; Tepper alleged. 
Guaranty Financial, based in Austin, Texas, filed for
bankruptcy protection in 2009. 
Krista Eccleston, a spokeswoman for New York-based KBW,
declined to comment. 
The trustee on Aug. 22 sued cardboard-box maker Temple-
Inland Inc., which spun off Guaranty Financial in 2007. 
The case is Tepper v. Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc.,
652349-2011, New York State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, is waiving some late fees for
customers affected by Hurricane Irene. 
JPMorgan won&#8217;t charge people in New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut for late payments of credit cards, business and
consumer loans, or overdraft-related fees from today through
Sept. 4, according to an e-mail sent to customers by the New
York-based bank. The message was sent to millions of people this
morning, said spokesman Thomas Kelly. 
The bank also will waive early withdrawal fees on
certificates of deposit &#8220;to help customers with their cash
flow&#8221; if needed, according to the e-mail. It won&#8217;t charge
consumers for using another bank&#8217;s automated teller machine and
will extend hours at branches in affected areas this week, the
e-mail said. 
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the largest U.S. bank, will help
customers facing financial hardship on a case-by-case basis,
Kelli Raulerson, a spokeswoman for the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based company, said in an e-mail. &#8220;Mobile ATM units
are being deployed to support customers where most significant
needs exist due to storm impacts,&#8221; Raulerson said. 
Citigroup Inc. (C) offers different financial recovery
assistance options and the bank will work with customers
depending on individual circumstances, said Sean Kevelighan, a
spokesman for the New York-based bank.

Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) will waive fees for customers in New

use another bank&#8217;s ATM, according to an e-mail from Kevin
Friedlander, a spokesman. Customers of Wells Fargo and JPMorgan
may incur fees from the other banks operating the ATMs. Wells
Fargo, based in San Francisco, also won&#8217;t charge early
withdrawal fees on CDs, Friedlander said. 
The average ATM fee charged by a bank for going outside its
network is $1.41, according to Greg McBride, senior financial

surcharge assessed by the bank operating the ATM on non-
accountholders is $2.33, McBride said in an e-mail. 
Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) is encouraging its customers
affected by the hurricane to reach out in person at a branch,

McLean, Virginia-based lender, said in an e-mail. 
&#8220;We have policies in place to assist those customers on a

Rouse Properties Inc., the mall
owner that will be spun off from General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP),
plans to spend $230 million on improvements to its malls through
2015 as rents and occupancies fall. 
Rouse expects the investment will lift its occupancy rate
to 93 percent and annual net operating income to more than $200
million, the Chicago-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. The occupancy rate was 87.7 percent at the end of June,
down from 88.2 percent at the end of 2010. Average rent fell to
$39.09 a square foot from $39.74. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, said Aug. 1 it planned a spinoff of 30 malls to
shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse. General Growth
spent $11.3 billion to buy commercial-property developer Rouse
Co. in 2004. 
&#8220;Our mission is to own and manage dominant Class B
regional malls in secondary and tertiary markets, and to
reposition Class B regional malls in primary markets,&#8221; Rouse
said in the filing. &#8220;We plan to increase the value of our
properties by executing tailored business plans designed to
improve their operating performance.&#8221; 
Some of the malls that will be included in the Rouse
portfolio need to be redeveloped to attract tenants, according
to the filing. Some are in one-mall markets in smaller U.S.
cities.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley and Deutsche Bank AG are among 13 financial institutions
that submitted bids to advise Vietnam Joint Stock Commercial
Bank for Industry  Trade on its planned $500 million overseas
bond sale, according to Deputy General Director Le Duc Tho. 
Others that sent in bids include HSBC Holdings Plc,
Standard Chartered Plc, Australia  New Zealand Banking Group
Ltd. and BNP Paribas SA, Tho said in a telephone interview
today. 
The sale would be the first international offering of
Vietnamese notes this year and will test investor confidence in
the country, which has struggled to damp Asia&#8217;s fastest
inflation as its currency slid to the worst-performing in Asia. 
&#8220;They need a good, recognizable name to help them with the
bond sale,&#8221; said Francois Chavasseau, Ho Chi Minh City-based
head of fixed income research at Sacombank Securities Joint
Stock Co. &#8220;Vietnam is still viewed as quite a risky place at
the moment by foreign investors. Whether a big name will be
enough to win more confidence, I&#8217;m not sure.&#8221; 
The country&#8217;s second-largest listed lender by market value,
commonly known as VietinBank, has sought approval from the
country&#8217;s central bank to sell $500 million of bonds overseas
later this year, Tho said earlier this month. The sale would be
the first of dollar-denominated notes for the bank, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Non-Performing Loans 
Vietnam&#8217;s banking system is weak and non-performing loans
are &#8220;heavily understated&#8221; in official data, Fitch Ratings said
in an Aug. 8 note. The extra yield investors demand to own
dollar debt sold by Vietnam instead of similar-maturity
Treasuries has risen 110 basis points this quarter to 445 basis
points, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Asia Credit Index. 
VietinBank is rated at B by Fitch, the fifth-highest non-
investment grade rating, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Tho said in May the lender planned to sell between
$500 million and $1 billion of bonds late in the third quarter
or early in the fourth quarter of the year. It opted for a lower
amount after reassessing its financial needs and due to global
market conditions, Tho said Aug. 22. 
The lender&#8217;s shares gained 2 percent to 25,900 dong at
close on the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange today. The dong,
has slid 6.4 percent this year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It was devalued by about 7 percent in February, the
most since at least 1993. 
Vietnam&#8217;s inflation accelerated to 23 percent this month,
the highest rate among 17 Asian economies tracked by Bloomberg. 
VietinBank has the equivalent of $374 million of bonds and
loans outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) has replaced BP
Plc in a partnership with Russia&#8217;s OAO Rosneft to drill in the
Arctic, one of the last untapped oil frontiers in the world. 
In exchange for access to potentially billions of barrels
of crude in the Arctic Ocean, Exxon will grant Rosneft stakes in
Texas shale fields and deep-water projects in the Gulf of
Mexico, the companies said today in a statement. 
Exxon and Rosneft plan to spend an initial $3.2 billion
exploring Russia&#8217;s Arctic offshore and the Black Sea. In turn,
Rosneft may become the first major Russian oil producer to
develop U.S. deposits, gaining experience in deep-water and
shale oil. 
Russia is seeking access to more international technology
to help it exploit complex crude deposits in increasingly harsh
environments as traditional resources, such as western Siberian
fields, are declining. The Exxon agreement will help Rosneft
meet Putin&#8217;s challenge that Russian producers maintain the
country&#8217;s world-leading output of 10 million barrels a day for
at least a decade. 
Russia&#8217;s government will support the Exxon-Rosneft alliance
&#8220;in every way,&#8221; said Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who
presided over the deal today in Sochi on Russia&#8217;s Black Sea
coast. 
&#8216;Life Blood&#8217; 
Exxon beat out its biggest international oil rivals to win
a piece of the Russian Arctic. Exxon replaces BP Plc (BP/) as
Rosneft&#8217;s partner in the Arctic Kara Sea after the U.K.
explorer&#8217;s billionaire partners in the TNK-BP Holding (TNBP) venture
blocked the agreement this year. 
&#8220;Access to new resources is the life blood of oil
companies,&#8221; said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.
in New York. &#8220;Russia is one of the largest resources that&#8217;s
still available. It&#8217;s like Exxon is now dating the girlfriend BP
had a few months ago.&#8221; 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. also have said they
wanted to explore partnerships with Rosneft in the Arctic. 
The world&#8217;s biggest oil companies are competing for new
reserves as crude-rich countries shut out foreign operators and
the easiest-to-reach hydrocarbons are exhausted. 
Mark Salt, spokesman for London-based BP, declined to
comment on the agreement. 
100 Billion Barrels 
The three blocks in the Kara Sea fields that are part of
this agreement are about the size of the U.K. North Sea and may
hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil equivalent, according
to BP. 
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson attended the
signing with Neil Duffin, the company&#8217;s president for
development, and Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov. Duffin oversaw
Exxon&#8217;s deepwater Angolan projects, such as Kizomba, which have
been big some of the company&#8217;s biggest producers in the past
decade. 
&#8220;I take it as a strong statement of Russian intentions to
create competitive conditions to attract investments,&#8221;
Tillerson told reporters. 
The agreement allows Rosneft a chance to participate in
Exxon&#8217;s unconventional fields in the U.S., where oil and gas are
extracted by cracking open rocks with sand, water and chemicals.
The two companies said they&#8217;ll study the potential for similar
fields in western Siberia. 
Deep Pockets 
As one of the largest oil companies in the world, Exxon
brings experience and deep pockets to the alliance, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis who has a
&#8220;hold&#8221; on Exxon shares and owns none. 
&#8220;To partner up with a AAA-rated energy company makes sense
for Rosneft as they seek to diversify outside of Russia,&#8221;
Youngberg said. Credit agencies rate Exxon AAA, their highest
grade. 
Putin said the investment needed to develop all the fields
involved and associated infrastructure may reach as much as $500
billion. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s scary to utter such huge figures,&#8221; he said. Exxon,
based in Irving, Texas, will be a &#8220;reliable, strategic and good
partner,&#8221; he said. 
Exxon and Rosneft on Jan. 27 signed a preliminary accord
for a $1 billion exploration project in the Black Sea&#8217;s

Shell, Chevron 
Shell, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, was described by Putin
in May as a potential &#8220;comfortable partner&#8221; to replace BP in
the Kara Sea. Shell, which works with state-controlled OAO
Gazprom in Siberia and Sakhalin Island, agreed to further expand
cooperation with the gas producer in June. 
Chevron pulled out as Rosneft&#8217;s partner in the Val
Shatskogo exploration project in Russia&#8217;s Black Sea this year.
Chevron is &#8220;looking to partner with Rosneft on other
opportunities in the Arctic or elsewhere in Russia,&#8221; said Kurt
Glaubitz, a company spokesman.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the largest U.S.
oil company, will spend as much as $76.3 million to explore and
develop shale oil and natural gas in Argentina with Americas
Petrogas Inc. (BOE) 
Exxon will gain a 45 percent stake in Americas Petrogas&#8217;s
Los Toldos blocks, which cover 163,500 acres in the Neuquen
Basin, Calgary-based Americas Petrogas said in a statement
today. 
Americas Petrogas plans to drill a well in the fourth
quarter at its blocks, targeting the unconventional Vaca Muerta
formation, which may hold as much as 240 trillion cubic feet of
recoverable gas, according to the U.S. Energy Information
Administration. 
&#8220;We believe the next major shale development outside of
North America will be in the Neuquen Basin,&#8221; Guimar Vaca Coca,
managing director for Americas Petrogas in Argentina, said in
the statement. 
Vaca Muerta has characteristics similar to reservoirs such
as the Eagle Ford and Haynesville formations in North America,
the company said. YPF SA, Argentina&#8217;s largest crude producer,
announced in May it discovered the nation&#8217;s biggest oil find in
two decades at Vaca Muerta. 
&#8220;From a geological resource point of view, I think
Argentina&#8217;s future is positive,&#8221; Jorge Pinon, a research fellow
at Florida International University in Miami, said in a
telephone interview. 
Regulatory uncertainty and a lack of continuity in fiscal
terms and conditions are larger concerns for foreign oil
companies working in Argentina, said Pinon. 
Looking For Niches 
&#8220;I think some of the major oil companies are looking for
niche areas in which they can position themselves to take
advantage of future opportunities,&#8221; he said. 
Exxon will have more than 310,000 net acres in the Neuquen
Basin following its deal with Americas Petrogas, Patrick McGinn,
a spokesman for the Irving, Texas-based company, said in an
interview. 
Americas Petrogas climbed 40 cents, or 24 percent, to
C$2.10 on the TSX Venture Exchange, Canada&#8217;s junior stock
exchange, at 3:59 p.m. Exxon fell 21 cents to $73.91 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m.

develop a wind turbine that generates as much as six times more
power than its largest land-based model. 
GE Global Research plans to spend $3 million from the U.S.

will generate as much as 15 megawatts using superconducting
magnets and lightweight materials, Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE said today in a statement.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it would

video-game system. 
Datel redesigned its controllers and stopped importing
versions known as TurboFire2 Xbox 360 Wireless that were at the

Commission in Washington, Microsoft said in a filing yesterday
that sought to withdraw the case. The software maker said it
still will pursue cash compensation for past infringement
through a civil lawsuit lodged against Datel last year. 
&#8220;Datel&#8217;s voluntary exclusion of the accused products from

claiming the company seeks to monopolize the markets for

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) formed an alliance
with OAO Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil producer, to drill from
the Texas plains and Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. 
Exxon and Rosneft plan to spend an initial $3.2 billion
exploring Russia&#8217;s Arctic offshore and the Black Sea, the
companies said today in a statement. In turn, Rosneft may become
the first major Russian oil producer to develop U.S. deposits,
gaining experience in deep-water and shale oil. 
Exxon replaces BP Plc (BP/) as Rosneft&#8217;s partner at three blocks
in the arctic Kara Sea after the U.K. explorer&#8217;s billionaire
partners in the TNK-BP venture blocked that agreement this year.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who presided over the Exxon deal
today in Sochi on Russia&#8217;s Black Sea coast, said it may generate
as much as $500 billion of investments. 
&#8220;Access to new resources is the life blood of oil
companies,&#8221; said Fadel Gheit, an analyst at Oppenheimer  Co.
in New York. &#8220;Russia is one of the largest resources that&#8217;s
still available. It&#8217;s like Exxon is now dating the girlfriend BP
had a few months ago.&#8221; 
The world&#8217;s biggest oil companies are competing for new oil
and gas reserves as countries such as Saudi Arabia shut out
foreign operators and the easiest-to-reach hydrocarbons are
exhausted. The Kara Sea fields are about the size of the U.K.
North Sea and may hold as much as 100 billion barrels of oil
equivalent, according to BP. 
London-based BP spokesman Mark Salt declined to comment on
the deal. 
Reliable Partner 
Russia&#8217;s government will support the Exxon-Rosneft alliance
&#8220;in every way,&#8221; Putin said. The Texas-based company will be
a &#8220;reliable, strategic and good partner.&#8221; 
The agreement allows Rosneft a chance to participate in
Exxon&#8217;s unconventional fields in the U.S., where oil and gas are
extracted by grinding rocks with sand, water and chemicals. The
two companies said they&#8217;ll study similar fields in western
Siberia. 
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson attended the
signing between Neil Duffin, the company&#8217;s president for
development, and Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov. 
&#8220;I take it as a strong statement of Russian intentions to
create competitive conditions to attract investments,&#8221;
Tillerson told reporters. 
&#8216;Scary&#8217; $500 Billion 
Putin said the investment need to develop all the fields
involved may reach as much as $500 billion once all the
associated infrastructure is built. &#8220;It&#8217;s scary to utter such
huge figures,&#8221; he said. 
Exxon and Rosneft on Jan. 27 signed a preliminary accord
for a $1 billion exploration project in the Black Sea&#8217;s
deepwater Tuapse Trough. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, may
have let the opportunity slide, after Putin said in May that it
would be a &#8220;comfortable partner&#8221; to replace BP in the Kara
Sea. Shell, which works with state-controlled OAO Gazprom in
Siberia and Sakhalin Island, agreed to further expand
cooperation with the gas producer in June.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stands to lose
its top spot among takeover advisers this year if ATT Inc. (T)
isn&#8217;t able to complete its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., the biggest deal of 2011. 
A collapse would move Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) into the No.
1 ranking with $346.8 billion in deals this year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan has $341.5 billion,
excluding the ATT transaction, the data show. 
ATT said today it will &#8220;vigorously contest&#8221; the U.S.
government&#8217;s lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition of T-
Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom AG. If those efforts fail,
ATT&#8217;s advisers, JPMorgan, Greenhill  Co. and Evercore Partners
Inc. (EVR), aren&#8217;t likely to get any significant fees for their work,
according to estimates by New York-based research firm Freeman 
Co. 
Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s advisers, Morgan Stanley (MS), Deutsche Bank
AG (DBK), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Citigroup Inc., may have to share
as little as $7 million to $9 million, or about one-tenth of an
original $70 million to $90 million in estimated fees, said Lam Nguyen, a Freeman vice president. It&#8217;s also possible, though
unlikely, that the Deutsche Telekom advisers could collect as
much as $60 million, or 1 percent of the estimated value of a $6
billion reverse breakup fee, Nguyen said. 
JPMorgan, Greenhill and Evercore would get $60 million to
$80 million in fees only if ATT is able to proceed with the
purchase, according to Nguyen. JPMorgan and other lenders are
still getting $20 million from committing to provide ATT a $20
billion loan to finance the purchase, Nguyen said. 
Spokesmen for the banks advising Dallas-based ATT and
Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom declined to comment. 
Greenhill Falls 
Greenhill, which draws most of its revenue from providing
advice, fell 3.5 percent to $35.53 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the day&#8217;s worst performance in
the 75-company Standard and Poor&#8217;s Midcap Financials Index.
Evercore gained 1.6 percent to $26.23. 
Goldman Sachs had been an adviser to Sprint Nextel Corp.,
which had been in talks to buy T-Mobile USA before ATT agreed
to a takeover, people familiar with the matter said in March.
The New York-based bank held the top spot in global MA advisory
every year from 2001 to 2008, Bloomberg data show. 
Excluding transfers of government assets, the ATT deal is
the largest takeover proposed anywhere in the world since BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company, offered $40
billion for Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan last August. BHP&#8217;s bid
was blocked by the Canadian government.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said it won a $96 million judgment against
Ecuador in an international arbitration case stemming from a
1990s oil-export dispute with the Latin American nation. 
The ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The
Hague resolved seven commercial claims over crude sales by the
Ecuadorian government from 1991 to 1993 from wells operated by
Texaco Inc., Kent Robertson, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said today in a telephone interview. 
Ecuador overstated domestic crude demand to boost its share
of production from the Texaco-operated wells, and then sold the
oil on the international market, depriving Texaco of profits,
Robertson said. Texaco was acquired by Chevron in 2001. 
&#8220;Ecuador rejects the final sentence given by the
arbitration court and considers that it has no legal validity
and represents a grave injustice,&#8221; Diego Garcia, Ecuador&#8217;s
attorney general, said today to reporters in Quito. 
Garcia said the panel didn&#8217;t have jurisdiction to decide
the case because a bilateral investment treaty between the U.S.
and Ecuador wasn&#8217;t in effect when Texaco quit the country. 
Ecuador plans to ask a district court in the Netherlands
within 90 days to invalidate the arbitration ruling, Garcia said.
Ecuador is prepared to appeal the case all the way to the
Netherlands&#8217;s highest court, he said. 
In a separate case, Chevron is awaiting a ruling from the
Permanent Court of Arbitration on whether it&#8217;s liable for
environmental damage in Ecuador&#8217;s Amazon River basin. The
company was ordered in February by an Ecuadorian court to pay
$18 billion in damages and penalties for chemical-laden
wastewater dumped in the river when Texaco operated there from
1964 to 1992.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s

from its XTO Energy unit for $182.5 million to Dynamic Offshore
Resources LLC. 
The XTO assets, located in the Gulf of Mexico, will add the

Dynamic said in an e-mailed statement today. Dynamic, a closely
held oil explorer backed by Riverstone Holdings LLC, filed a
prospectus last week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for an initial share sale. 
The properties produce the equivalent of 7,000 barrels of

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, settled a patent-infringement lawsuit with the Indian
generic-drug maker Dr. Reddy&#8217;s Laboratories Ltd. over the
cholesterol treatment Lipitor. The terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
Pfizer, based in New York, sued Dr. Reddy&#8217;s in December
2009 to block generic copies of Lipitor from coming out before
Pfizer&#8217;s patent for the tablets expires in 2017. The companies
settled on Aug. 19, and U.S. District Judge Leonard P. Stark in
Wilmington, Delaware, dismissed the case Aug. 29, according to
court records. 
&#8220;We have closed our litigation with Pfizer, but the date
of entry into the market is not yet confirmed,&#8221; Kedar Upadhye,
a spokesman for Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, said in a statement. 
Dr. Reddy&#8217;s, of Hyderabad, India, announced the settlement
today in a statement. The agreement is subject to review by the
U.S. Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, the
company said. 
&#8220;We can confirm that we have reached an agreement with Dr.
Reddy&#8217;s regarding a patent case involving Lipitor,&#8221; Christopher Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Terms
of the agreement are confidential.&#8221; 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Mylan Inc. also
have reached settlements with Pfizer to sell generic forms of
Lipitor, known chemically as atorvastatin. 
Ranbaxy Plans 
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY), the first company to seek
regulatory approval for its version, had planned to enter the
market on Nov. 30 -- with Teva, Mylan and other generic makers
beginning sales six months later as part of its deal with
Pfizer. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration investigation into
quality standards at two Ranbaxy plans and a federal probe of
its testing practices have delayed approval. 
Analysts including Edward J. Kelly of Credit Suisse AG have
said that Ranbaxy may have to sell its rights to be the only
approved generic on the market if it can&#8217;t pass regulatory
muster by November. 
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI) has a separate agreement with
Pfizer that would let it sell Lipitor without the brand label as
a so-called authorized generic beginning Nov. 30. The Watson-
sold drug doesn&#8217;t require FDA approval and wouldn&#8217;t be affected
by the Ranbaxy deal.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OAO Rosneft,
Russia&#8217;s biggest oil producer, will announce joint international
projects by early next year, an official for the Moscow-based
company said today during a conference call. 
&#8220;We will be entering on friendly terms, on a non-
discriminatory basis,&#8221; Ruslan Svirshchevsky, Rosneft&#8217;s head of
business development, said on a conference call with investors
today. &#8220;We will complement our reserve base by quite
significant number.&#8221; 
Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest company by market value, and
state-run Rosneft yesterday agreed on an alliance that would
give the U.S. company access to Russia&#8217;s Arctic resources by
exploring three blocks in the Kara Sea, while allowing Rosneft
to gain experience in deep-water and tight oil deposits in the
U.S. and other areas. 
Rosneft and Exxon agreed to get access to &#8220;several select
high-quality exploration and production opportunities&#8221; in the
U.S., Canada and other countries, Svirshchevsky said, declining
to identify any projects. These include areas in the Gulf of
Mexico and onshore Texas, deep-water and tight oil fields, and
some projects are in the development stage, he said. 
&#8220;It was one of the aspects why the proposals from Exxon
Mobil was especially attractive to us,&#8221; Svirshchevsky said.
Exxon&#8217;s Hibernia project was listed in a presentation on
Rosneft&#8217;s website today. The Kommersant newspaper reported
earlier today that Rosneft may enter that development. 
BP Deal Collapsed 
Rosneft&#8217;s original plan to develop its Kara Sea blocks in
the Arctic with BP Plc collapsed after the British oil
producer&#8217;s local billionaire partners blocked the deal, which
also involved a $7.8 billion share swap. 
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland described
the deal, which she valued at $3.2 billion, as &#8220;another example
of the expanding relationship&#8221; between the U.S. and Russia.
Nuland said that President Barack Obama and President Dmitri Medvedev have been working on broadening economic and trade
ties. 
She declined to comment on whether the deal would draw
scrutiny from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United
States, the inter-agency government group that reviews
transactions that may affect U.S. national security.

Human behavior is increasing the
frequency and severity of natural disasters, according to
Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying Hurricane Irene is an example of that, but
I am saying that when you look around the planet, every month
you are seeing more shocks, more frequently, more severe than at
any time in modern history,&#8221; Sachs said in a &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; radio interview with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt.
&#8220;We are definitely in the midst of human-made natural
disasters.&#8221; 
Hurricane Irene killed at least 40 people as it moved from
the Caribbean through New England, left an estimated $2.6
billion in damage and cut power to almost 8 million homes and
businesses along the U.S. East Coast. Tropical Storm Katia,
about 1,100 miles (1,770 kilometers) from the southernmost Cape
Verde Islands, may be declared a hurricane later today,
according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. 
&#8220;Can one say that Katrina, or Irene or the massive floods
in Pakistan or drought in the horn of Africa are examples in
that instance of the long-term human induced change?&#8221; Sachs
said. &#8220;That is extremely difficult but on occasion it can be
done because the event is so extreme that one can say with a
very high assurance that that is human induced -- like the
massive heat waves that hit Europe a few years ago.&#8221; 
Prices of raw materials will not spur investors to finding
alternatives to commodities that cause climate change, said
Sachs, the director of Columbia&#8217;s Earth Institute and the
Quetelet Professor of Sustainable Development at the New York-
based university. 
&#8216;Odd Reality&#8217; 
&#8220;We have the odd reality that we can dig up enough coal or
shale gas to wreck the planet before price scarcity itself is
going to choke this off,&#8221; Sachs said. &#8220;So we&#8217;re going to have
to make real, conscience choices rather than letting the market
itself decide.&#8221; 
The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm
of the U.S. Energy Department, estimates global coal reserves at
909 billion tons, a 129 year supply. Benchmark European coal
prices rose 50 cents or 0.4 percent, to $129.50 a metric ton
today in London. The five-year average price is $100.48 per
metric ton. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve transitioned globally into a human-led environment
where human&#8217;s effects on carbon flows, energy flows, water flows
are so dominant now that we have changed the probability
distribution of when extreme droughts or hurricanes or heat
waves are hitting the planet,&#8221; he said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), federal
regulators and investors are seeking more information about Bank
of America Corp.&#8217;s effort to resolve mortgage liabilities with
an $8.5 billion settlement. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Federal Housing
Finance Agency, Goldman Sachs and pension funds are among those
who have objected to the agreement, saying they don&#8217;t have
sufficient information to evaluate the deal. 
Goldman Sachs can&#8217;t determine whether &#8220;all investors who
are similarly situated will be treated equally&#8221; under the
settlement, the company said in a court filing late yesterday in
federal court in Manhattan. A group of homeowners separately
sued Bank of America in federal court, seeking to block the
accord, claiming terms related to the servicing of mortgage
loans will accelerate home foreclosures. 
The objections create more obstacles for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America as it seeks court approval for
the settlement to resolve claims from investors in Countrywide
Financial Corp. mortgage bonds. It acquired Countrywide in 2008. 
The deal was negotiated with a group of institutional
investors, including BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment
Management Co., and would apply to investors outside that group. 
The Trustee 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), the trustee for the
mortgage-securitization trusts covered by the agreement, asked a
New York state judge to approve the settlement. A hearing on the
matter was initially scheduled for November. New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman asked the judge to reject the accord
and said in court papers that he has potential claims against
Bank of America. An investor group is seeking to move the case
to federal court. 
&#8220;We believe that the trustee acted reasonably in entering
into the settlement, and that there are compelling reasons why
the agreement should receive judicial approval.&#8221; Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman for Bank of America, said in an e-mail. He
declined to comment on the homeowner lawsuit. BNY Mellon
spokesman Kevin Heine declined to comment on the objections. 
The agreement, which must be approved by a judge, is
important for Bank of America to put its mortgage liabilities
behind it, Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said
in an interview. 
&#8220;I think there&#8217;s a possibility it gets thrown out,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know to handicap that.&#8221; 
Filed Objections 
Those filing objections include American International
Group Inc. (AIG), the Federal Home Loan Banks of Boston, Chicago and
San Francisco, the Maine State Retirement System, and the
National Credit Union Administration, a federal agency that is
the liquidating agent for five corporate credit unions. 
&#8220;Investors are unable to evaluate the fairness of the
allocation of the settlement proceeds,&#8221; the Maine retirement
system said. 
The FDIC, the receiver for failed banks, said it owns
securities covered by the settlement. Andrew Gray, an FDIC
spokesman, said in an e-mail that the filing is a notice to
preserve its right to make claims as a part of the settlement
and seeks additional information. 
&#8220;It is not an evaluation or opinion on the settlement
itself,&#8221; he said. 
The FHFA, which regulates mortgage finance companies Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac, said in a statement that it was also
seeking more information and &#8220;is aware of no basis upon which
it would raise a substantive objection to the proposed
settlement at this time.&#8221; 
Federal Judge 
Yesterday, Nevada asked a federal judge in Reno to
terminate an earlier settlement with Bank of America which
involved home-loan modifications tied to its Countrywide unit,
saying the company hasn&#8217;t complied with terms of the accord. 
Bank of America increased consumer interest rates and
monthly payments in violation of a consent decree and required
homeowners to provide extensive documentation to qualify for
modifications even though the settlement calls for a
&#8220;streamlined&#8221; approach, the state said yesterday in a
statement. 
The state is seeking to file an amended complaint against
the bank with additional claims. 
&#8220;After two and a half years of lost implementation -- of
borrowers denied modifications, discouraged by repeated and
futile efforts to obtain help, or already subject to foreclosure
-- the state no longer can get the benefit of its original
settlement with defendants,&#8221; Nevada Attorney General Catherine Cortez Masto said yesterday. 
The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The homeowner lawsuit is Iesu v. Bank of New York
Mellon, 11-6078, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The Nevada case is State of Nevada v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 11-cv-00135, U.S. District Court, District of
Nevada (Reno).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
pay future Federal Reserve penalties and write down $53 million
of mortgage loans in New York to gain approval for its sale of
Litton Loan Servicing LP. 
The Fed ordered Goldman Sachs to conduct an independent
review of Litton&#8217;s foreclosures in 2009 and 2010 to address a
&#8220;pattern of misconduct and negligence,&#8221; the regulator said
today in a statement. Litton&#8217;s sale to Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) was
completed today after reaching accords with the Fed and New York
state regulators, according to a Goldman Sachs statement. 
Goldman Sachs leaves mortgage servicing after Litton was
accused of robo-signing, in which foreclosure documents are
signed by company officials who vouch for their accuracy without
personally verifying the contents. The practice raised concern
that some borrowers may have been wrongfully evicted and
triggered calls for more staffing and oversight. 
&#8220;Our agreement sets a new higher standard for the
residential mortgage-servicing industry, whose troubling
foreclosure and servicing practices we have been investigating
along with other regulators across the country,&#8221; Benjamin Lawsky, superintendant at the New York State Department of
Financial Services, said in a statement. 
Mortgage servicers send out bills, collect payments and
handle foreclosures. New York-based Goldman Sachs acquired
Houston-based Litton with 1,000 employees in 2007, took a
writedown of about $200 million earlier this year and agreed in
June to sell the unit to Ocwen for $263.7 million. The value of
mortgage servicing companies has been eroded as record U.S.
foreclosures and delinquencies drove up costs. 
Review Findings 
Ocwen, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, will also pay
about $337.4 million to retire some of Litton&#8217;s debt. 
Goldman Sachs agreed to provide the Fed with findings of
the independent review as well as its plans to reimburse
customers for fees or losses stemming from improper
foreclosures, according to the settlement. The firm also agreed
to improve compliance and borrower communications should it re-
enter the business. 
&#8220;The review is intended to provide remediation to
borrowers who suffered financial injury as a result of wrongful
foreclosures or other deficiencies identified in a review of the
foreclosure process,&#8221; according to the Fed&#8217;s statement. 
Future Penalties 
Goldman Sachs also agreed to pay any penalty the Fed
imposes on Litton based on today&#8217;s enforcement action. The
regulator said it plans penalties for Litton as well as other
large servicers, including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), which received enforcement actions in April. 
Attorneys general from all 50 states last year announced
their investigation into bank foreclosure practices after
reports that faulty or manufactured documents were being used to
seize homes. Since then, a group of attorneys general and
officials from federal agencies, including the Justice
Department, have been negotiating a settlement with the nation&#8217;s
five largest mortgage servicers. 
The New York agreement requires the companies to withdraw
pending foreclosures with robo-signed affidavits and compensate
borrowers whose homes were wrongfully foreclosed, according to
the statement. The $53 million represents 25 percent of unpaid
principal for all 60-day delinquent home loans serviced by
Litton. 
Ocwen is getting a portfolio of loans with about $41.2
billion in unpaid principal balance as of March 31, most of them
non-prime home mortgages, according to a June filing. 
Possible Pattern 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s agreement to reduce unpaid principal in the
New York accord is &#8220;the most specific we&#8217;ve seen,&#8221; said Guy
Cecala, publisher of Bethesda, Maryland-based trade publication
Inside Mortgage Finance. While the need for sale approval and
small size of Litton may limit the comparability with other
potential settlements, the deal may give some insight to how
future deals could be structured, he said. 
&#8220;In Goldman&#8217;s case, this is a cost of doing business in
terms of getting this deal done,&#8221; Cecala said. &#8220;This is a
blueprint for what the states are looking for: potentially some
lump sum that they can use to help out borrowers who are in
trouble, regardless of whether or not they&#8217;ve suffered any
foreclosure abuse.&#8221;

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said its Windows
Phone operating system may capture more than 20 percent of the
smartphone market over the next two to three years with the help
of hardware manufacturers and increased marketing efforts. 
Forecasts by researchers Gartner and IDC, which expects a
market share of about 20 percent in 2015, are conservative, said
Achim Berg, head of Windows Phone marketing, in Berlin today. 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, is betting
that Windows Phone will retake market share lost to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s
iPhone and handsets running Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android software. The
company will start offering the enhanced &#8220;Mango&#8221; version of
its operating system, with functions including better social-
media offerings, for the first time in Europe on two HTC Corp.
phones, set to go on sale by Oct. 1. 
HTC and other partners will run advertisement campaigns for
the Titan and Radar phones, and the company has joined Microsoft
in training &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of salesmen worldwide to better
demonstrate the product, Berg said at the IFA consumer
electronics fair. Microsoft plans to build on Windows Phone&#8217;s
initial success with female consumers as well as with young and
first-time users to win market share, he said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing an extremely positive response&#8221; to the
Windows Mobile system, HTC&#8217;s President for Europe, the Middle
East and Africa, Florian Seiche, said in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;re
now thinking that this year is a great time to get that momentum
accelerated, to reach out to a broader group of customers.&#8221; 
The Titan, which has an 8-megapixel camera with dual-led
flash and a wide-angle lens, will sell for 599 euros ($855),
while the Radar costs 399 euros. HTC is in talks with retailer
and operators, Seiche said, adding that the phones will be
broadly available in Europe. 
New Functions 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, announced Windows
Phone in February 2010, jettisoning an earlier system called
Windows Mobile. The newest version, announced in May, adds more
functions such as face detection in photos, extended voice
recognition for writing, and support for 15 additional European
and Asian languages. Mango also lets users synchronize Microsoft
Office documents with cloud versions in Microsoft&#8217;s Office 365
and SkyDrive, and improves integration with corporate
directories and e-mail systems. 
Nokia Oyj, the world&#8217;s biggest mobile-phone maker by
volume, adopted Windows Phone 7 as its primary smartphone
platform in February, saying that it will give the Finnish phone
company and its developers more opportunities to produce
distinctive products than Google&#8217;s Android, which was also
considered. Microsoft on May 24 announced handset agreements
with Acer Inc., Fujitsu Ltd. and ZTE Corp., as well as 500
features to be added in the fall release of Windows Phone 7. 
&#8216;It Takes Times&#8217; 
&#8220;This is a completely new platform, it takes time,&#8221; said
Berg. &#8220;It took time with Android, it took time with Apple. We
have to show that we&#8217;re very capable and that we have the
fastest and easiest phone.&#8221; 
In April, Gartner forecast that the Android operating
system will have the largest smartphone market share during the
next four years, rising from 23 percent in 2010 to 49 percent in
2015. Apple&#8217;s iOS is predicted to grow from 16 percent to 17
percent, while Microsoft&#8217;s share will go from 4.2 percent in
2010 to 19.5 percent in 2015. IDC in June predicted that
Microsoft may hold a 20.3 percent market share in 2015. 
Windows Phone&#8217;s base of application developers will also
increase following Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)&#8217;s decision to stop
selling devices with its WebOS software, Berg said. Hewlett-
Packard said last month that it&#8217;s considering licensing or
selling off WebOS, which it acquired in its purchase of Palm
Inc. last year. 
Third-party applications helped make Apple&#8217;s iPhone the
most profitable smartphone as users flocked to a handset with a
slick touch screen and an online store that has grown to more
than 425,000 games and other programs. Google&#8217;s Android system,
supported by dozens of manufacturers, also lured developers and
became the best-selling smartphone system this year.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) was sued by a mobile
phone user claiming the company illegally tracks location
information from mobile devices in violation of state and
federal privacy laws. 
The company has designed its mobile operating software
Windows Phone 7 to track users&#8217; location deceptively even after
users choose to disable the feature, according to a complaint
filed in federal court in Seattle today. The software is in
mobile devices made by Samsung Electronics Co., HTC Corp. (2498) and LG
Electronics Inc. (066570), and transfers the location data to company
server computers, the complaint shows. 
Michigan resident Rebecca Cousineau filed the lawsuit on
behalf of tens of thousands of consumers who use phones with the
Microsoft software and had their location data tracked after
they disabled the feature. The complaint seeks a court order
barring the company from tracking users&#8217; phone locations, $1,000
for each violation, and unspecified punitive damages. 
Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment about the lawsuit. 
The case is Cousineau v. Microsoft, 11-1438, U.S. District
Court, District of Washington (Seattle).

Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said the slow pace of hiring recently in the U.S. led them
to cut their August payroll forecast to a 25,000 gain. 
The new estimate is down from a prior projection of a
50,000 increase, the economists said. Their forecast for the
unemployment rate was unchanged at 9.1 percent. 
&#8220;The main reason is the accumulation of evidence of weak
hiring in late July and August,&#8221; the economists, led by Jan Hatzius, wrote in a note to clients today. &#8220;The recent pickup
in layoff announcements is a concern.&#8221; 
Among the reports citing weak employment figures are the
Conference Board&#8217;s consumer confidence survey and its separate
gauge of online help-wanted advertising for August, yesterday&#8217;s
ADP Employer Services report that measures private payroll data
and today&#8217;s employment component in the Institute for Supply
Management&#8217;s factory index, the New York-based economists wrote. 
The cut in the payrolls forecast contrasts with Moody&#8217;s
Analytics Inc. economists, who raised their estimate today to an
increase of 50,000 from a previous projection of a 30,000 gain.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) has agreed to buy Algorithmics, a supplier of risk
analytics software, for $387 million. 
The purchase will add 900 employees to IBM&#8217;s team of more
than 8,000 consultants in the business analytics unit, Armonk,
New York-based IBM said in a statement today. Algorithmics,
based in Toronto, is a member of Fitch Group, which is majority
owned by Paris-based holding company Fimalac (FIM) SA. 
IBM said its analytics offerings are backed by more than
$14 billion spent on acquisitions in the past five years,
including OpenPages Inc., a maker of compliance and risk
management systems. IBM has forecast its business analytics and
optimization activities will reach $16 billion in revenue by
2015 as companies sift their data for insights. Chief Executive
Officer Sam Palmisano last year said he would spend $20 billion
on acquisitions within five years. 
&#8220;Combining Algorithmics&#8217; expertise with IBM&#8217;s deep
analytics portfolio will allow clients to take a more holistic
approach to managing risk and responding to economic change
across their enterprises,&#8221; said Rob Ashe, IBM&#8217;s general manager
of business analytics.

Executives from Morgan Stanley and
Catalyst Capital Investors are among new members of an advisory
panel for the Climate Bonds Initiative, formed to help put
together a new $300-million bond by an unspecified issuer. 
The new bond, issued in Australian dollars, will probably
be a refinancing of a group of wind-energy loans and will use a
standard being established by the London-based Climate Bonds
Initiative, said Sean Kidney, chairman of the initiative. He
declined to be more specific because the bond was not yet public
knowledge. 
The initiative is seeking to encourage investors to use the
new standard to help encourage projects that curb emissions
blamed for climate change, Kidney said today by phone. 
The four new advisory panel members are Imtiaz Ahmad,
carbon trader and executive director at Morgan Stanley in
London, Jonathan C. Bianco, Houston-based managing director of
Catalyst Capital Investors, Henry Derwent, chief executive
officer of the Geneva-based International Emissions Trading
Association, and Anthony Hobley, Sydney-based global head of
climate change at lawfirm Norton Rose LLP, Kidney said. 
&#8220;Public and private sector partnerships for climate
finance initiatives will be of growing importance as we
approach&#8221; United Nations climate talks in Durban, South Africa,
in November, Ahmad said today by e-mail. 
Leveraging private-sector finance in an environment of
&#8220;scarce public-sector resources&#8221; is crucial in order to
achieve the large-scale of investment needed to protect the
climate, he said. 
Morgan Stanley in May last year urged developing nations to
consider selling green bonds to spur investment in climate-
protection policies and projects. 
A lack of certainty on regulation of greenhouse-gas
emissions worldwide may otherwise result in a &#8220;massive scaling
down&#8221; of spending, Ahmad said at the time.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) may get a reprieve from
generic competition to its $11 billion Lipitor cholesterol pill
as Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RBXY) fights regulatory breaches that 
threaten to derail its push to produce the first U.S. copies. 
Ranbaxy, India&#8217;s third-largest drugmaker by revenue, plans
to introduce its copy of Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling
medicine, on Nov. 30. It must first persuade the Food and Drug
Administration that its copy is equivalent to the original and
that approval shouldn&#8217;t be thwarted by violations cited in 2009
at a plant identified in Ranbaxy&#8217;s drug application. 
Failure to resolve the issue could prevent the FDA from
clearing Ranbaxy&#8217;s Lipitor version by that date, said Ira Loss,
an analyst with Washington Analysis. A delay also may stall
plans by other generic-drug companies to introduce their
versions of the $11 billion-a-year medicine, he said. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember another case where timely approval of
the first generic on a big drug appears dependent upon cleaning
up a mess in their manufacturing situation,&#8221; said Loss, who has
followed the FDA for more than three decades. &#8220;Ranbaxy has
repeatedly expressed confidence that this will all get resolved
in time, but I&#8217;m not sure I believe them.&#8221;

General Motors Co. (GM) retained former
Vice Chairman Bob Lutz, who helped lead each U.S. automaker
during the past 48 years, as a part-time consultant. 
Lutz, 79, will be available to senior executives effective
immediately, the Detroit-based company said today in a statement
on its website. 
The former U.S. Marine fighter pilot worked two stints at
the largest U.S. automaker, the first ending in 1970. In the
second, he led GM&#8217;s global product development and held other
management roles during a nine-year stretch until May 2010. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;ll ever retire until he&#8217;s in a coffin,&#8221;
Dave Sullivan, a product analyst at Tustin, California-based
AutoPacific Inc., said in a phone interview. &#8220;He&#8217;s a true car
guy and he was born to do this. It&#8217;s hard for him to cut the
cord.&#8221; 
Lutz already has informally consulted with senior leaders
including Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson and Mary Barra,
who was named head of global product development in January,
said Jay Cooney, a GM spokesman. 
&#8220;This simply formalizes those discussions,&#8221; Cooney said
in a phone interview. &#8220;He would be available to speak with any
senior leader at General Motors about any topic. His knowledge
and experience runs the gamut.&#8221; 
Cooney declined to comment on Lutz&#8217;s compensation. 
Lutz&#8217;s Models 
Lutz rejoined GM in September 2001 and later championed the
Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car, which began selling late last
year. He previously held executive posts at Ford Motor Co. (F),
where he helped develop the Ford Explorer sport-utility vehicle,
and the former Chrysler Corp., where he oversaw the Dodge Viper
sports car and Ram pickup, and PT Cruiser wagon. 
He also worked at Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) starting in
1972, after his first GM stint. Lutz&#8217;s GM career began in 1963. 
&#8220;His impact at GM is probably bigger than maybe any other
automaker he&#8217;s been at,&#8221; said Sullivan, who is based in Troy,
Michigan. &#8220;Their product line right now is probably the best
it&#8217;s ever been. Everything that GM&#8217;s coming out with that&#8217;s new
seems to be doing very well.&#8221; 
Lutz has said he delayed his retirement from GM in 2009
when he was asked to stay as head of sales and marketing. Then-
Chairman Ed Whitacre changed his role to adviser for global
design and product development in December 2009, and GM
announced three months later that Lutz would leave the company. 
Akerson, 62, picked Barra to lead product development
earlier this year after she spent about 19 months as vice
president of global human resources. Before leading human
resources, Barra worked with Lutz as vice president of global
manufacturing engineering. 
&#8220;She has a lot of people that are still upset with GM over
getting bailed out by the government,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a lot riding on her shoulders to prove people wrong. It&#8217;s going
to be up to her to continue what has brought about GM&#8217;s recent
success with the next generation of vehicles.&#8221; 
GM fell 96 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $22.07 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) were among 17 banks sued by the U.S. to recoup $196
billion spent on mortgage-backed securities bought by Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac. 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency, on behalf of Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, filed 17 lawsuits yesterday in New York state
and federal courts and in federal court in Connecticut. The FHFA
accuses the banks of misleading Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about
the soundness of the mortgages underlying the securities. 
&#8220;The loans had different and more risky characteristics
than the descriptions contained in the marketing and sales
materials provided to the enterprises for those securities,&#8221;
the FHFA said in a statement. 
FHFA is seeking to rescind the transactions plus other
damages, including civil penalties and punitive damages in cases
alleging misconduct. 
In addition to JPMorgan and Bank of America, the agency
filed complaints in federal court in Manhattan yesterday against
Citigroup Inc. (C), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), Merrill Lynch  Co.,
Barclays Plc (BARC), Nomura Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), Societe
Generale SA, Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and First
Horizon National Corp. (FHN) 
The FHFA sued Ally Financial Inc., Countrywide Financial
Corp., General Electric Co. (GE) and Morgan Stanley in state court in
Manhattan, according to the agency. It sued Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc (RBS) in federal court in Connecticut. 
Fannie and Freddie 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have operated under U.S.
conservatorship since 2008, when they were seized amid subprime
mortgage losses that pushed them toward insolvency. 
The FHFA said in its filings that Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac bought $6 billion in mortgage-backed securities from Bank of
America; $24.8 billion from Merrill Lynch, which Bank of America
took over in 2008, and $26.6 billion from Countrywide, which
Bank of America acquired the same year. 
The FHFA claims Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bought $33
billion in securities from JPMorgan and $30.4 billion from Royal
Bank of Scotland. According to the complaints, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac also bought $14.2 billion from Deutsche Bank, $14.1
billion from Credit Suisse, $11.1 billion from Goldman Sachs,
$10.6 billion from Morgan Stanley, $6.2 billion from HSBC, $6
billion from Ally, $4.9 billion from Barclays, $3.5 billion from
Citigroup, $2 billion from Nomura, $1.3 billion from Societe
Generale (GLE), $883 million from First Horizon and $549 million from
GE. 
UBS Suit 
The FHFA sued UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, in July
over $4.5 billion in residential mortgage-backed securities sold
to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming the bank misstated the
risks of the investments. 
&#8220;The claims brought by the FHFA are unfounded,&#8221; said
Frank Kelly, a spokesman for Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank.
&#8220;Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the epitome of a sophisticated
investor.&#8221; 
Ally, based in Detroit, said in a statement that it
believes FHFA&#8217;s claims are meritless and the company intends to
defend its position. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac &#8220;acknowledged that their losses
in the mortgaged-backed securities market were due to the
unprecedented downturn in housing prices and other economic
factors,&#8221; said Larry DiRita, a spokesman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America. 
Kim Cherry of Memphis, Tennessee-based First Horizon said
the company would defend itself. 
Knew the Risks 
The firms claimed to understand the risks, and continued
buying, even after their regulator said they lacked adequate
risk-management capabilities to do so, DiRita said. 
Company representatives who declined to comment on the
suits yesterday included Danielle Romero-Apsilos of New York-
based Citigroup, Kerrie Cohen of London-based Barclays, Kristin Lemkau of JPMorgan in New York and Russell Wilkerson of
Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE. 
Mark Lake of New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS), Jonathan Hodgkinson of Tokyo-based Nomura, Michael DuVally, of Goldman
Sachs in New York, Steven Vames, of Zurich-based Credit Suisse,
Neil Brazil of London-based HSBC, and Jim Galvin of Paris-based
Societe Generale, also declined to comment. 
Edinburgh-based Royal Bank of Scotland Plc will defend the
claims. &#8220;We believe we have substantial and credible legal and
factual defences to these claims and will defend them
vigorously,&#8221; the bank said in an e-mailed statement. 
Some of the complaints described mortgages that were
already performing worse than investors were told at the time
securitizations were sold. Disclosures by some firms overstated
home values or misrepresented the number of homes occupied by
borrowers, according to the FHFA. 
&#8216;Under Water&#8217; 
An instrument underwritten by an affiliate of Merrill Lynch
was reported to have no loans larger than the value of the
house, known as the loan-to-value ratio. In reality, about 20.7
percent of the mortgages had an LTV ratio above 100 percent,
meaning they were already under-secured or &#8220;under water&#8221; from
the start, according to the FHFA&#8217;s complaint. Some pools
packaged by GE or its affiliates were said to have no loans with
an LTV over 100 percent, when about 13 percent did, according to
another suit. 
In the complaint against Goldman Sachs, the FHFA claimed
the bank securitized many mortgages that failed to meet
underwriting standards even after outside firms it hired
reported &#8220;high percentages of defective or at least
questionable loans.&#8221; 
&#8220;Goldman simply ignored and did not disclose the red
flags,&#8221; the FHFA claimed. 
The cases are Federal Housing Finance Agency v. Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), 11-CV-6195; FHFA v. Barclays Bank Plc., 11-CV-
6190; FHFA v. Citigroup, 11-CV-6196; FHFA v. Credit Suisse

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) returned workers to some oil and natural gas platforms
as Tropical Storm Lee accelerated to the east-northeast, out of
the Gulf of Mexico. 
Crews are resuming production in the western Gulf after
inspecting equipment for damage, David Eglinton, a spokesman for
Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas-based said today in an e-
mail. Exxon moved about 140 employees to shore from
approximately 20 structures ahead of Lee. Shell, based in The
Hague, confirmed it began returning staff after evacuating as
many as 858 workers. 
About 60 percent of oil production from the Gulf,
equivalent to 843,223 barrels per day, remained shut as of 11:30
a.m. New York time, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Gas curtailments totaled
2.35 billion cubic feet, or 44 percent, down from 2.9 billion
cubic feet, or 55 percent, yesterday. The bureau said 239 of the
617 platforms in the Gulf were evacuated and 25 of the 70 rigs
currently drilling in the ocean. 
The interruptions will be brief, said James Williams, an
economist at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. &#8220;We&#8217;re not
talking about Hurricane Gustav here, moving pipelines up and
down Louisiana like it was spaghetti,&#8221; Williams said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;This one isn&#8217;t a big story. It&#8217;s a wet
story.&#8221; Gustav struck in 2008. 
Production Resumes 
Production resumed at Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)&#8217;s Nansen,
Boomvang and Gunnison platforms, the operator said today on its
website. Its Constitution, Marco Polo, Independence Hub, Neptune
and Red Hawk installations will be staffed and started as soon
as possible, The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko said. 
Platforms become accessible as weather clears west to east,
Mike Hurst, chief pilot of PHI Inc. in Lafayette, Louisiana.
It&#8217;s the largest provider of helicopters to Gulf of Mexico oil

Normal flights may resume tomorrow over western and central
platforms with service to eastern platforms Tuesday, he said. 
Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, is
operating normally, Katherine W. Swetman, a spokeswman, said
today in an e-mail. The unit can process as much as 360,000
barrels per day. More than 10 inches of rain fell in the area
the past four days, the National Weather Service said. 
All Exxon Mobil refineries were operating normally today,
spokeswoman Claire Hassett said in an e-mail.

Opel spokesman Stefan Weinmann said, confirming comments by GM&#8217;s

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
theme-park operator, said consumer products Chairman Andrew P. Mooney resigned to seek a leadership role at another company
after running the division for 12 years. 
&#8220;I believe this is the perfect time to take that
experience into a leadership role with another organization and
corporate boards,&#8221; Mooney, 56, said today in a statement from
Burbank, California-based Disney. He wasn&#8217;t more specific. 
The unit Mooney leaves, Disney&#8217;s second smallest ahead of
interactive media, has been a steady source of sales and profit
growth with toys and merchandise from Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Cars&#8221; movies
and Marvel films. Earnings in the division jumped 32 percent in
the June quarter on a 13 percent revenue gain. 
A native of Scotland, Mooney is credited with
reinvigorating the Disney chain of stores and leading the
division that introduced the Disney Princesses and Disney
Fairies brands. He has led the unit since 1999 and has been
chairman since 2003. 
Disney fell 68 cents to $31.78 at 2:06 p.m. in New York

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Credit Suisse Group AG landed lead roles managing the
initial share sale for Carlyle Group LP, taking one of the last
major private-equity firms public in a faltering market. 
The mandate may give the banks a boost among underwriters
as companies and their bankers struggle to complete deals.
JPMorgan currently ranks third for U.S. IPOs, while Citigroup
ranks fourth and Credit Suisse is eighth, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
U.S. listings have slowed almost to a halt because of
investors&#8217; concerns about the economy, eroding fee income at
investment banks. U.S. IPOs have been shelved or scrapped at a
faster rate in the past three months than the comparable period
of any year since 2004, Bloomberg data show. Only five offerings
were completed last month. 
&#8220;They should be doing cartwheels and jumping in the air to
get any kind of revenue in the door right now,&#8221; said Tom Jalics, a senior investment analyst at the private-banking unit
of KeyCorp in Cleveland, which oversees $22 billion. &#8220;From what
we&#8217;re hearing anecdotally, this quarter is going to be
extraordinarily weak, and estimates across the board are coming
down for investment banks.&#8221; 
The three banks all have a track record for taking private-
equity firms public. Citigroup helped lead the February 2007 IPO
of Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), as well as Blackstone Group
LP (BX)&#8217;s in June 2007 along with Credit Suisse. JPMorgan, Credit
Suisse and Citigroup all helped lead Apollo Global Management
LLC&#8217;s share sale in March. Washington-based Carlyle is the
second-biggest private-equity firm after Blackstone. 
Average Fees 
Absent from Carlyle&#8217;s filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission was Morgan Stanley (MS), which shared the lead
role with Citigroup on Blackstone&#8217;s offering. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), which helped manage both Apollo&#8217;s share sale and the
Fortress IPO, also wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the filing. 
Barclays Plc is the top-ranked underwriter for U.S. IPOs
this year, and Morgan Stanley is ranked second, according to
Bloomberg data. Banks have earned underwriting fees averaging
5.4 percent of the total IPO size for U.S. deals this year, the
data show.

The increase in pricing of corporate
credit risk is unjustified even by &#8220;lower growth expectations and
higher recession risks,&#8221; according to Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;Although a U.S. recession or Eurozone sovereign shocks
are risks, we think risk premiums are too elevated and unlike
&#8216;normal&#8217; cycles we have not seen a deterioration in balance
sheet quality,&#8221; analysts Viktor Hjort, Kelvin Pang and Nishant
Sood wrote in a report today. &#8220;We are constructive on global
credit,&#8221; the analysts wrote. 
The cost to protect U.S. company debt jumped today on
concern that the European debt crisis is worsening. The Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, rose 9.6 basis points from Sept. 2 to a mid-
price of 129.6 as of 8:06 a.m. in New York, according
to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. That&#8217;s the biggest
increase since Aug. 8. 
The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has climbed
from 96.3 since the end of July.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest
software maker, is adding features to its Internet display-
advertising products to keep from losing customers to Google
Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. in the $12.3 billion U.S. market. 
Microsoft is unveiling tools and partnerships with AppNexus
Inc. and MediaMath this month designed to help customers more
effectively tailor ads and measure their impact. Sales of
graphical display ads, including banners and videos, are poised
to climb 25 percent in the U.S. this year. 
The company aims to reassure customers such as Publicis
Groupe SA that have questioned its commitment to display ads and
the Atlas software it acquired with the $6 billion AQuantive
Inc. deal. As Microsoft shifted its focus to search-related ads,
some marketers have devoted more display-ad dollars to Facebook
and Google. 
&#8220;We have continued to invest behind Microsoft and behind
Atlas,&#8221; said Curt Hecht, chief executive officer of VivaKi
Nerve Center, the unit that oversees technology for Publicis
Groupe SA (PUB)&#8217;s digital ad agencies. &#8220;We need a partner that&#8217;s as
committed as we are. Microsoft is at a point where they need to
show it&#8217;s important to them.&#8221; 
Microsoft is adding personnel and dollars to bolster
display and Atlas, which is used to place ads on websites and
help advertisers measure performance of ad campaigns. Atlas vies
with DoubleClick, acquired by Google in a $3.1 billion purchase
announced a month before the AQuantive deal.

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a producer of
steelmaking coal in southern Appalachia, jumped as much as 30
percent after the London-based Times said Anglo American Plc (AAL) may
be considering a takeover bid. 
Anglo is said to be weighing a $120-a-share offer, the
Times said in its market report without citing anyone. BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) is also interested in Walter, the Times said. 
Walter rose $15.99, or 21 percent, to $90.98 as of 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
pared gains after Walter said in a statement it isn&#8217;t aware of
any &#8220;corporate developments&#8221; to account for the price
increase. The stock earlier touched $97.30, the biggest intraday
gain since March 8, 1995. 
Walter, based in Birmingham, Alabama, hasn&#8217;t hired a
permanent chief executive officer since Keith Calder resigned
June 30. He stepped down about two months after he was appointed
to the position, following Walter&#8217;s takeover of Canada&#8217;s Western
Coal Corp., where he was the CEO. Investor Audley Capital
Advisors LLP said in July that the company should explore a
sale. 
&#8220;Met coal assets are still in high demand,&#8221; Jeremy Sussman, an analyst with Brean Murray Carret  Co., wrote in a
research note today. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking
coal, is used to produce steel while utilities use thermal coal
to generate electricity. 
Takeover Bids 
Walter said it issued the statement in response to a
request from the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of
Canada on behalf of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company said
it doesn&#8217;t intend to comment further. 
Surging demand from steelmakers in China and flood-related
supply disruptions in Queensland, Australia, have driven prices
for coking coal to record highs. Low-volatility metallurgical
coal rose to $291 a ton, Energy Publishing Inc. said in its
latest weekly report, published Sept. 2. It touched $330 a ton
in February. 
There were $20.15 billion of takeover bids for coal-mining
companies valued at $100 million or more in the first nine
months of this year, compared with $7.06 billion in the year-
earlier period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU), the biggest U.S. coal producer, and
ArcelorMittal, the world&#8217;s largest steelmaker, in August agreed
to buy Macarthur Coal Ltd., a Brisbane, Australia coking-coal
producer, for A$3.64 billion ($3.88 billion). Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) became the world&#8217;s third-largest producer of
coking coal with a $7.1 billion takeover of Massey Energy Co. in
January. 
Offer Unlikely 
Anglo isn&#8217;t likely to make an offer for Walter, mainly
because the U.S. company&#8217;s coal reserves aren&#8217;t in a suitable
location for export by sea, London-based investment bank Liberum
Capital said today in a note. 
Citigroup Inc. also saw an offer as unlikely, &#8220;due to
limited potential synergies,&#8221; and because the multiple of 5.5
times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is low compared with recent deals in the sector,
Brian Yu, a San Francisco-based analyst wrote in a note today. 
Anglo, which is based in London, also declined to comment
in an e-mail. Kelly Quirke, a spokeswoman for Melbourne-based
BHP, also declined to comment.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
compensation plan, which almost doubled top executive Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s pay last year, unfairly rewards the investment
bank&#8217;s employees at shareholders&#8217; expense, a lawyer for
investors said. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
lost $50 billion in market value since 1999 while the company
has paid out billions in compensation to the firm&#8217;s 31,000
employees, including Blankfein, its chairman and chief executive
officer, John Harnes, an attorney for investors who have sued
over the pay plan, argued today. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, &#8220;is being run for the
benefit of employees rather than shareholders,&#8221; Harness told
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock III. The judge heard
arguments on whether shareholders&#8217; suits seeking to recoup
executive compensation should be thrown out and said he&#8217;d rule
later. 
The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis. In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year, according to its website. That was 9 percent less
than in the same period in 2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent. 
$19 Million Compensation 
Blankfein&#8217;s $19 million compensation for 2010, which
included a $5.4 million cash bonus, was almost double the prior
year&#8217;s award even as Goldman Sach&#8217;s profits fell. Blankfein and
other firm executives agreed to forgo cash bonuses in 2009 and
take restricted stock grants as compensation to mute criticism
of the firm&#8217;s pay practices. 
Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argue the firm&#8217;s
lucrative compensation system is wasteful and rewards employees
for taking risks that hurt the firm&#8217;s stock price. 
Harness noted Goldman officials received billions in pay
and bonuses last year while the firm settled claims by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that executives misled
investors in collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime
mortgages. 
The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators&#8217; claims that marketing materials about the
investments had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; 
CDOs in 2007 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing a hedge fund
helped pick the underlying securities and then bet against the
investment vehicles, the SEC said in the suit Goldman settled.
The bank didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing as part of the accord. 
Such &#8220;wrongful conduct has cost shareholders billions to
date and is likely to cost billions more,&#8221; Harnes argued on
behalf of Septa. Philadelphia-based Septa is the nation&#8217;s fifth-
largest public transportation system, according to its website. 
Investors should be permitted to move forward with their
suit, which seeks to hold Goldman Sachs directors responsible
for the firm&#8217;s flawed pay plan and for not properly overseeing
the company&#8217;s employees, he added. 
Any recovery as a result of Septa&#8217;s so-called derivative
suit will be returned to the company&#8217;s coffers rather than given
to the transportation authority. 
Risk-Taking 
Gregory Varallo, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s lawyer, countered
investors haven&#8217;t provided any evidence that directors engaged
in wrongdoing by creating the pay plan or encouraged excessive
risk-taking by the firm&#8217;s traders and bankers. 
Shareholder court filings seek to paint the investment bank
as some kind of &#8220;vast criminal enterprise,&#8221; Varallo told
Glasscock. Yet, investors can&#8217;t point to one illegal act
committed by a Goldman Sachs director or employee, he said. 
The investors want the judge to decide &#8220;how much risk&#8221; an
investment bank should take and &#8220;how much is too much&#8221;
compensation for taking those risks on behalf of shareholders,
Varallo added. 
&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s a judge&#8217;s job,&#8221; the lawyer
added. Delaware Chancery Court judges decide cases without a
jury. 
The case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Shareholder
Litigation, 5215, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chief Executive
Officer John Watson urged President Barack Obama to cut
regulations and expand offshore oil drilling rather than use
subsidies to create jobs. 
The administration should abandon efforts to repeal about
$4 billion a year in oil and gas tax breaks and reconsider an
Environmental Protection Agency rule on greenhouse-gas emissions
to control climate change, Watson said today at a conference in
Washington. The EPA regulation will raise energy costs and
hinder growth, he said at the meeting sponsored by The Hill
newspaper and American Petroleum Institute industry group. 
&#8220;I would be delighted to invest more in the oil and gas
industry,&#8221; Watson said. The industry responds to the &#8220;fiscal
and regulatory environment we are given,&#8221; he said. 
Obama is set to outline his proposals to help lower
unemployment from 9.1 percent in an address to Congress tomorrow
night. Payroll growth stalled last month, the Labor Department
reported Sept. 2.

Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), one of
Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s largest franchise bottlers, said it made a
mistake in threatening to reconsider a 17 million-euro ($24
million) manufacturing investment in southern France because of
a sugar-related tax proposal. 
&#8220;I would like to set the record straight,&#8221; Hubert Patricot, president of the Atlanta-based company&#8217;s European
group, said today in a statement. &#8220;We are re-confirming our 17
million euro investment to our Les Pennes-Mirabeau facility.&#8221; 
The company had said in a statement hours earlier that it
was re-evaluating the planned investment and had canceled a
Sept. 19 ceremony with Chief Executive Officer John Brock. The
threat was in protest of a government plan to tax sugared
beverages as part of an austerity measure. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises declined to comment beyond the
follow-up statement. Patricot in his statement stood by the
company&#8217;s opposition to the tax proposal. 
&#8220;We remain strongly opposed to a tax that unjustly targets
the purchasing power of the French people and one category of
beverages under the pretext of addressing public health
concerns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consumer information and education around
increased exercise and balanced diets, not discriminatory taxes,
must be part of any comprehensive proposal.&#8221; 
France&#8217;s government announced last month a plan to raise 12
billion euros in 2011 and 2012 to fight mounting deficits.
Parliament is voting through tomorrow on 2011 measures that
include raising taxes on alcohol and cigarettes and creating a
new levy on sodas. 
Euro Disney Protest 
Coca-Cola Enterprises is the latest company to challenge
elements of the government&#8217;s plan. Euro Disney SCA (EDL)&#8217;s Disneyland
Paris and French theme parks opposed a planned increase in the
value-added tax on its business to 19.6 percent from 5.5
percent. The tax was scrapped yesterday after the parks won
support from former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. 
When he presented the plan, Prime Minister Francois Fillon
justified the new levy on sugared drinks, saying it was aimed at
reining in &#8220;the development of obesity that eventually will
represent a health cost.&#8221; The levy would yield about 100
million euros a year, according to the government. 
Coca-Cola Enterprises protested earlier today saying there
are &#8220;no studies in France&#8221; linking sodas and higher obesity
rates. The company said then that its investment in the factory
in Pennes-Mirabeau was on hold pending the vote.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s experimental pill for
rheumatoid arthritis was as effective as Humira from Abbott
Laboratories (ABT) and showed no new side effects in study results the
company plans to submit for U.S. approval this year. 
Nine study summaries were released today and will be
presented at the American College of Rheumatology conference in
Chicago in November. In one trial, both doses of Pfizer&#8217;s drug,
called tofacitinib, were slightly more effective than Humira
across six categories of improvement in symptoms and patient
mobility, though the study wasn&#8217;t big enough to establish the
pill&#8217;s superiority. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, designed tofacitinib
to compete with injectable drugs that dominate the market, led
by Humira from Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott, Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Remicade and Amgen Inc. (AMGN)&#8217;s Enbrel, which New York-based
Pfizer shares. The new drug may bring in more than $2.6 billion
a year, said Catherine Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG in New York. 
&#8220;This is a game-changing drug,&#8221; Arnold said. &#8220;Our peak
sales of $2.6 billion are likely conservative.&#8221; 
Humira will reach peak sales of about $8.5 billion in 2013
before sales decline as doctors grow comfortable with
tofacitinib and other new drugs, said Arnold, who has an
&#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Pfizer&#8217;s stock and a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating
for Abbott. 
Pfizer fell 19 cents, or 1 percent, to $18.82 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Abbott declined 86
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.44. 
Helps Application 
&#8220;Pfizer believes the risk-benefit profile supports
regulatory submission for both the 5- and 10-milligram dose,&#8221;
Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;We are looking forward to filing in the U.S., EU and Japan by
the end of the year.&#8221; 
Tofacitinib is the most-advanced pill in a family of
experimental drugs to target a protein, called JAK, which leads
to joint destruction in 1.3 million Americans with rheumatoid
arthritis. Three biotechnology companies are trying to catch up
to Pfizer with similar treatments: Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RIGL),
Incyte Corp. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) Pfizer&#8217;s pill is
the only one to complete the third and final stage of tests
generally needed for U.S. regulatory approval. 
Unexpected Results 
Humira performed unexpectedly poorly in the study, which
may not represent the true effectiveness of the drug, said
Elizabeth Hoff, a spokeswoman for Abbott. The proportion of
Humira patients showing a 20 percent improvement after six
months was 47 percent, compared with a typical proportion of 65
percent of patients with such improvement. Patients with 50
improvement only accounted for 28 percent of those studied,
compared with past studies showing 52 percent of patients. 
&#8220;Looking at the scores, this isn&#8217;t what we typically
see,&#8221; Hoff said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;These are
very similar patient populations. You see a pretty significant
difference.&#8221; 
The safety of tofacitinib was similar to what was seen in
previous studies, and deaths and side effects were toward the
lower end of a range of results from similar drugs, the company
reported. Much of the data from the individual studies was
reported previously. 
Twelve deaths were reported among 3,030 patients who took
the drug, compared with 1 death among 681 taking a placebo and 1
death among 204 patients on Humira across the Phase 3 studies
completed by Pfizer. Patients spent more time on tofacitinib
than Humira or placebo and deaths per amount of time spent on
the drugs were statistically similar. 
Serious Infections 
Patients taking tofacitinib were more likely to have
serious infections compared with Humira or placebo. There were
0.029 infectious for every year a patient was taking the Pfizer
pill, compared with 0.015 infections for placebo and 0.017 on
Humira. In at least one trial, infection rates were greater for
those taking the higher of two possible doses of tofacitinib. 
Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease in which the
immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing
inflammation in and around joints. Treatments suppress the
immune system and can increase vulnerability to infection. 
Shots known as anti-TNF therapy are standard care for the
80 percent of patients who don&#8217;t respond to methotrexate, a
generic drug that can block cell growth in people with certain
cancers and immune disorders. 
Tofacitinib would add to Pfizer&#8217;s recently expanded
offerings in pain and inflammation. The company gained the
arthritis remedy Enbrel in the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in
2009. The medicine was Pfizer&#8217;s second-best seller last year
with $3.3 billion in revenue. The drugmaker bought King
Pharmaceuticals Inc. last year for about $3.3 billion to add
additional painkillers to its range of products. 
Pfizer is counting on revenue from its arthritis pill to
help offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol
drug, with $10.7 billion in annual sales, faces competition
beginning in November from cheaper copies in the U.S.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. said selling
Italian and Spanish bonds along with bank stocks and debt, and
buying dollars and gold may provide the best protection against
the &#8220;very unlikely&#8221; risk of a euro-area collapse. 
&#8220;There are formidable barriers to break-up, which make it
less likely, but also mean it would be more disruptive if it did
occur,&#8221; Seamus Mac Gorain, a strategist in London, wrote in an
investor report yesterday. &#8220;The financial turmoil and economic
impact would be most pronounced in the euro area, arguing for
broad underweight euro-area equity and credit.&#8221; 
Yields on U.S. and German 10-year bonds fell to records
this week and gold reached a fresh high as investors sought the
safest assets amid concern policy makers aren&#8217;t doing enough to
prevent the spread of financial-market tension from the euro
area. That&#8217;s prompting economists to study worst-case scenarios,
with UBS AG saying two days ago that the euro doesn&#8217;t work under
its current structure. 
Sales of Italian and Spanish bonds versus benchmark German
bunds may provide an &#8220;efficient hedge,&#8221; along with betting the
euro will fall against the dollar and buying gold, JPMorgan&#8217;s
Mac Gorain wrote. Owning less euro-area bank equities and credit
securities than benchmarks used to track performance would also
offer protection, he said. 
Italian 10-year bonds rose a third day, pushing the yield
down five basis points to 5.21 percent as of 11:03 a.m. in
London. The rate fell to as low as 4.87 percent on Aug. 18 as
the European Central Bank was said to begin purchasing the debt
last month. 
&#8220;The only way to hedge against a euro break-up scenario is
to own no euro assets at all,&#8221; UBS economists including
Stephane Deo wrote in their Sept. 6 report. The cost of a
potential collapse makes it &#8220;close to zero probability,&#8221; and
&#8220;the growth consequences are awful in any break-up scenario,&#8221;
they wrote.

The European Central Bank, the
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan may take concerted action
to tackle weak growth and falling equity prices as soon as this
week&#8217;s Group of Seven meeting, according to Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;The negative feedback loop between weak growth and soggy
asset markets makes a coordinated monetary-policy easing move
more likely,&#8221; London-based economists Manoj Pradhan and Joachim Fels said yesterday in a note to investors. &#8220;The burden of
propping up markets and the economy&#8221; falls on central banks. 
Central banks are facing calls to loosen monetary policy as
threats from Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis and a weakening U.S.
recovery intensify and roil financial markets. The Fed, the ECB
and the Bank of England took concerted steps along with four
others in 2008 to slash interest rates as the fallout from the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. became evident. 
Morgan Stanley said central banks can now reprise joint
action and roll out a mix of rate cuts and quantitative easing. 
&#8220;Strategic complementarity -- the willingness and ability
to ease if others are doing the same -- makes it easier for
banks to act jointly rather than unilaterally,&#8221; the two
economists said in the e-mailed note. 
The ECB and the Bank of England, which meet today, are
expected to keep their main policy rates on hold. At the same
time, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet faces calls for a rate
cut and the BOE may consider additional stimulus. 
Policy makers from the Group of Seven nations will convene
for talks in the French city of Marseilles tomorrow, providing a
forum where joint action may be approved. 
The Fed, the ECB, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England
will all participate in any coordinated move, according to
Morgan Stanley. 
&#8220;The Fed could lower its interest rate on excess reserves
to zero and announce some balance sheet measures,&#8221; the
economists said. &#8220;The ECB could cut its deposit rate and/or the
refi rate and announce additional term funding for banks. The
Bank of Japan and the Bank of England could both respond with
additional quantitative-easing measures.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley (MS), the top global
merger adviser last year, named three new heads of its media and
communications investment-banking group to replace Stuart J. Epstein, who left to become chief financial officer of NBC
Universal. 
Jean Abergel, Max Herrnstein and Adam Shepard will serve as
global co-heads of the group, according to a internal memo
obtained today by Bloomberg News. Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for
the New York-based firm, confirmed the contents of the memo. 
NBC Universal, the entertainment company controlled by
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), announced Epstein&#8217;s hire on Sept. 7. Epstein
played a key role in creating the venture that gave Comcast, the
largest U.S. cable service, a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal,
owner of the broadcast network, movie studio and cable channels
Bravo and USA, according to a statement. 
&#8220;Stuart&#8217;s contributions to the division and the firm have
been tremendous and he will be greatly missed,&#8221; Paul J.
Taubman, co-president of the Institutional Securities Group, and
Franck Petitgas, global co-head of investment banking, said in
the memo. &#8220;We are confident that Jean, Max and Adam will
provide the strong leadership necessary to continue to build on
the strength and positive momentum in our Global Media 
Communications business.&#8221; 
Abergel, a 12-year veteran of the firm, is currently head
of the media and communications team in Europe, while Herrnstein
is head of media in North America and Shepard runs the telecom
group in that region, according to the memo. Herrnstein has been
with the firm for 13 years, and Shepard is an 11-year veteran,
according to the memo. 
The New York Times reported the promotions earlier.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) were among four banks chosen to manage Nikko Asset
Management Co.&#8217;s initial public offering, said three people with
knowledge of the proposed sale. 
Nikko Asset and its largest shareholder, Sumitomo Trust 
Banking Co., may sell about 50 billion yen ($645 million) of
shares in the IPO, said the people, declining to be identified
before a public announcement. The asset manager plans to list on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange as early as this year and targets a
market value of about 200 billion yen, they said. 
The share offer may be the biggest IPO in Japan this year,
and would be the country&#8217;s first by a major asset manager in a
decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The nation&#8217;s
equity capital market has begun to recover, with nine initial
share offers from the end of May following an 11-week hiatus in
the aftermath of a record earthquake and tsunami on March 11. 
&#8220;Overseas investors will be interested because a Japanese
asset manager&#8217;s sale is a rarity and gives them access to the
country&#8217;s 1,500 trillion yen worth of household financial
assets,&#8221; said Kazumi Tanaka, an IPO analyst at TC Financial
Research Inc. in Tokyo. &#8220;The IPO market will be more aggressive
next year as Japanese firms improve performance and recover from
the earthquake.&#8221; 
Megumi Yoshizawa, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Nikko
Asset, declined to comment. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Hiroko Matsumoto,
Nomura&#8217;s Keiko Sugai, UBS&#8217;s Eiko Noda and SMBC Nikko&#8217;s Tadataka
Ishida also declined to comment. All are based in Tokyo. 
Four-Bank Management 
New York-based Goldman Sachs will be the global coordinator
for the IPO, while UBS AG (UBSN) and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. will
help manage the sale, the people said. 
Nikko Asset began choosing managers for the offering in
July. The firm hasn&#8217;t decided the terms of the sale or details
for the underwriters&#8217; roles, the people said. 
Citigroup Inc. (C), which acquired Nikko Asset from Nikko
Cordial Corp. in 2008, sold the company to Sumitomo Trust as
part of a transaction valued at 120 billion yen in October 2009. 
Nikko Asset, founded in 1959, employs more than 500 staff
including 72 fund managers, and has 12.8 trillion yen under
management, according to its website. The investment management
firm, run by Chief Executive Officer Timothy McCarthy, has
subsidiaries in London, New York, Singapore and Sydney. 
Sumitomo Trust and Nikko Asset agreed to buy DBS Asset
Management from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS), Southeast Asia&#8217;s
biggest bank, for S$137 million ($113 million) to tap business
from the expanding ranks of wealthy Asians, the companies said
in December.

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) promoted Walter J. Scheller III to chief executive officer two months after

Scheller, 50, was president of the company&#8217;s U.S.

in a statement. He joined the company in June 2010 from Peabody
Energy Corp., where he worked for four years. He has also worked

replaces interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard. 
Calder, who resigned as CEO on June 30, assumed the
position in April. He told the board of directors in a letter

&#8220;management philosophy.&#8221; Calder was the CEO of Western Coal

A unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
was fined by the Central Bank of Ireland for breaching rules on
counterparty risk assessment. 
Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) Plc was fined 160,000 euros
($218,000), the Dublin-based central bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company incorrectly calculated its
regulatory capital requirements between July 16, 2008 and Dec.
17, 2010, the central bank said. 
&#8220;The reliance on automated systems should be tempered by
adequate oversight to ensure that systems and controls are, and
continue to be, comprehensive and proportionate,&#8221; Peter Oakes,
director of enforcement at the central bank, said in an e-mail. 
The error in working out the counterparty risk capital
requirement didn&#8217;t result in any breach of the capital adequacy
ratios, the central bank said. No counterparties were impacted.
Goldman Sachs has taken remedial action to fix the breaches and
the matter is closed, the central bank said. 
The firm disclosed the errors in calculations to the
central bank on Dec. 13, according to today&#8217;s statement. 
&#8220;We are pleased this matter has been resolved,&#8221; Joanna Carss, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, in London, said today.

Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam said the punishment sought by the government for his
insider-trading convictions is &#8220;grotesquely severe&#8221; and should
be rejected by the court. The U.S. said a long prison sentence
is warranted. 
Rajaratnam, 54, on Sept. 9 asked U.S. District Judge
Richard Holwell in Manhattan for a sentence &#8220;substantially
below&#8221; what is called for by federal guidelines. The
government&#8217;s requested sentence of 19 1/2 to 24 1/2 years
&#8220;would guarantee Mr. Rajaratnam&#8217;s death in prison,&#8221; he said in
a court filing. 
&#8220;This court&#8217;s role is not to validate a prosecutorial
public relations effort, nor is it to single out one man to
serve as the whipping boy for Wall Street misdeeds,&#8221; Rajaratnam
argued. 
Rajaratnam was convicted in May of all 14 criminal counts
of conspiracy and securities fraud he was charged with. He&#8217;s
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 27. Rajaratnam argued that the
government&#8217;s requested sentence is more than the average
sentence imposed for kidnapping and hostage-taking, sexual
abuse, robbery, arson and child pornography. 
Assistant U.S. Attorneys Reed Brodsky and Jonathan
Streeter, who prosecuted the case, asked Holwell in a filing
Sept. 9 to reject Rajaratnam&#8217;s pleas for leniency based on his
poor health and charitable contributions. 
&#8220;In arguing for leniency because of his health, Rajaratnam
overlooks that he committed his crimes for years after he knew
about his medical problems and thus he is in no position to seek
leniency now based on them,&#8221; they said. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
ATT Fights U.S. Suit, Calls T-Mobile Deal Good for Public 
ATT Inc. (T) said its proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-
Mobile USA Inc. is good for mobile-phone customers and that the
U.S. lawsuit seeking to block the deal &#8220;fails to come to
grips&#8221; with its benefits. 
ATT filed its response Sept. 9 to the U.S. Justice
Department&#8217;s complaint in federal court in Washington. The
company said the merger would lead to better service, fewer
dropped calls and lower prices for consumers. ATT cited fierce
competition from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S), MetroPCS Communications Inc., Leap Wireless International
Inc., U.S. Cellular Corp. and Cellular South Inc. 
&#8220;The Department does not and cannot explain how, in the
face of all these aggressive rivals, the combined ATT/T-Mobile
will have any ability or incentive to restrict output, raise
prices, or slow innovation,&#8221; ATT said in the filing. 
ATT described T-Mobile as &#8220;the only major carrier to have
actually lost subscribers in a robustly growing market&#8221; with a
business model that has it trapped between large providers and
lower-priced competitors. 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. 
Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman in Washington, said in an
e-mail that the company remains &#8220;interested in a solution that
addresses the DOJ&#8217;s issues with the T-Mobile merger.&#8221; 
Hernan Daguerre, a T-Mobile spokesman, declined to comment
on the filing. 
&#8220;This transaction as currently proposed is anticompetitive
and harmful to consumers,&#8221; Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the
antitrust division of the Justice Department, said in an
interview. &#8220;We will respond further in our court filings.&#8221; 
Sprint, which has filed its own lawsuit opposing the
merger, said ATT&#8217;s filing doesn&#8217;t change its position on the
deal. 
&#8220;The proposed takeover would create a clear wireless
duopoly that could raise prices, stifle innovation and cost
American jobs,&#8221; Sprint spokesman John Taylor said in an e-mail. 
U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 and told the parties to be prepared to discuss
settlement options. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
Banks May Fight Banks as Investors Pursue Class Status 
Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) may pay more to resolve claims over their alleged roles in
the collapse of a $2.3 trillion mortgage-backed securities
market if sophisticated investors are allowed to sue as a group
along with less savvy ones, Thom Weidlich of Bloomberg News
reports. 
Class-action status allows investors to pool financial and
legal resources, giving them greater leverage to win larger
settlements or verdicts. The banks, however, have a court ruling
on their side that may help fend off such blockbuster cases. It
says class status is barred because some investors are too
sophisticated -- in fact, because some of them are other banks,
including JPMorgan. 
&#8220;It is possible to be both an alleged perpetrator and
victim at the same time,&#8221; said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer now in private
practice in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;It&#8217;s unprecedented that you
have the most sophisticated institutions as victims, to be in a
position where their losses are so great that they have sued.&#8221; 
The ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. in
Manhattan, favoring defendants Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)
and Ally Financial Inc., held that investors may not sue as a
class in part because some of them are being sued over the same
claims. Last month, that ruling was countered by two judges in
Baer&#8217;s courthouse, both of whom ruled that investors in home-
loan backed securities may sue as a class. 
Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that, once burst, helped push the
U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. Investors have
filed class-action, or group, lawsuits against at least 16
private issuers of securities backed by mortgages.

KKR, Blackstone Deal-Rigging Antitrust Suit Expanded by Judge 
Plaintiffs in a case accusing 11 firms, including KKR  Co.
and Blackstone Group LP (BX), of conspiring to rig the market for
leveraged buyout deals can expand their investigation, a federal
judge ruled. 
The plaintiffs, including a Detroit police and fire pension
fund, can seek information on 10 additional deals, U.S. District
Judge Edward F. Harrington said in a ruling Sept. 7. He didn&#8217;t
identify the transactions, which are described in a fifth
amended complaint filed under seal. The firms argued that adding
the deals would be &#8220;unduly burdensome and prejudicial,&#8221;
according to court papers. 
The lawsuit, initially filed in 2007, claims the firms
conspired to drive down prices in the largest leveraged buyout
deals in violation of federal antitrust laws. The case
previously was limited to 17 transactions. Harrington gave the
plaintiffs until April 17 to seek the information. 
Among the deals in question is Neiman Marcus Group Inc.&#8217;s
$5.1 billion buyout by Warburg Pincus LLC and TPG Capital Inc.,
SunGard Data Systems Inc.&#8217;s $11.3 billion takeover by seven
private-equity firms and Aramark Corp.&#8217;s roughly $8.3 billion
purchase in January 2007. Three plaintiffs are also shareholders
of Freescale Semiconductor Inc., which was taken private by a
group including Blackstone and Carlyle Group. TPG and Carlyle
are also defendants in the suit. 
The firms allegedly formed &#8220;bidding clubs,&#8221; referred to
in the private-equity industry as &#8220;consortia&#8221; or &#8220;teams&#8221; to
rig the bidding, according to a redacted fourth amended
complaint made public Sept 9. Use of the clubs limited the
number of bidders, depressing prices at target companies, the
plaintiffs said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to have any comment on that,&#8221; Owen
Blicksilver, a spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG, said
in a telephone interview Sept. 9. 
Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for New York-based KKR, said
the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. Blackstone
spokeswoman Christine Anderson and Chris Ullman of Carlyle Group
didn&#8217;t return phone messages seeking comment on the ruling. 
The case is Dahl v. Bain Capital Partners LLC, 07-12388,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). 
Madoff Trustee Sets $272 Million Payout, Sept. 15 Record Date 
The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm is planning an
initial distribution of $272 million to investors holding
allowed claims as of Sept. 15, according to a court filing. 
The trustee, Irving Picard, intends to issue payments by
the end of the third quarter, after reviewing allowed claims
against the jailed confidence man, he said in July. The average
check, arriving almost three years after the Ponzi scheme
collapsed, will be $222,551, he said. 
Holders of claims against Madoff that were sold or
transferred will only receive distributions from Picard if the
21-day notice-and-objection period on the transfer has expired
by Sept. 15, according to the filing. 
Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 lawsuits seeking
money for Madoff investors, in May allotted $2.6 billion to a
fund for victims of the Ponzi scheme. Because of court
challenges, most of the $8.6 billion he has raised isn&#8217;t
currently available to put in the customer fund or distribute to
claimholders who lost an estimated $17.3 billion in principal,
he has said. 
Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in North Carolina,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. Picard and his law
firm, Baker  Hostetler LLP, have made about $179 million in
fees since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. 
The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Dow Chemical, Sasol Win Dismissal of Greenpeace Lawsuit 
Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and Sasol North America Inc. won the
dismissal of a lawsuit alleging the chemical companies illegally
spied on an affiliate of Greenpeace International, the
environmental advocacy group. 
Greenpeace Inc. sued under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act. A federal judge in Washington
ruled Sept. 9 that the nonprofit organization failed to
establish a direct connection between corporate espionage and
civil racketeering allegations and any injury the group
suffered. 
&#8220;The direct victim of this alleged wire fraud was not
Greenpeace, but a third party, and, therefore, the link between
Greenpeace&#8217;s injuries and defendants&#8217; alleged racketeering
activity is too attenuated to be actionable under RICO,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer wrote in her ruling. 
Greenpeace claimed that Dow, closely held Sasol and two
public relations firms from 1998 to 2000 conspired to infiltrate
and steal confidential information to thwart its environmental
campaigns. 
Greenpeace said the spying included breaking into locked
trash bins outside its Washington headquarters and infiltrating
meetings and electronic communications. 
The injured third party the judge referred to was Calcasieu
League for Environmental Action Now, described in the ruling as
an ally of Greenpeace. 
Molly Dorozenski, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, declined to
comment immediately, saying the group&#8217;s lawyers were reviewing
the ruling. 
&#8220;As we have said from the beginning, the case totally
lacked merit and should have never been filed by Greenpeace,&#8221;
said Gregory Baldwin, a spokesman for Midland, Michigan-based
Dow, the largest U.S. chemical maker, in an e-mail. &#8220;No Dow
employee did anything improper.&#8221; 
Matthew Kirtland, a Washington lawyer representing Houston-
based Sasol North America Inc., said his client is pleased with
the court&#8217;s decision. 
The case is Greenpeace Inc. v. Dow Chemical Co., 10-cv-
02037, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
Lorillard Label Challenge Should Be Rejected, U.S. Says 
The U.S. asked a judge to reject a bid by Lorillard Inc. (LO),
the maker of Newport cigarettes, and three other tobacco
companies to stop the government from putting new warnings on
cigarette packs. 
The U.S. Justice Department, in a filing Sept. 9 in federal
court in Washington, said the Food and Drug Administration has
the authority to require labels warning of the health risks of
smoking. The companies are seeking a preliminary injunction
delaying the rule, scheduled to take effect Sept. 22, 2012. 
The FDA regulation mandates that cigarette packs, cartons
and advertising display graphic warning labels. The warnings
will be accompanied by pictures of rotting teeth or damaged
lungs to deter smokers. 
&#8220;The public interest strongly mitigates against delaying
health warnings that more effectively convey the extraordinary,
undisputed health risks created by the use of plaintiffs&#8217;
products,&#8221; the Justice Department said. 
Lorillard, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Commonwealth Brands
Inc. and Liggett Group LLC sued last month saying the regulation
violates the First Amendment. 
Ronald Milstein, Greensboro, North Carolina-based
Lorillard&#8217;s senior vice president and general counsel, didn&#8217;t
return a telephone message after normal business hours seeking
comment on the filing. 
Representatives in the public relations department of
Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), R.J. Reynolds&#8217;s parent, didn&#8217;t reply to
a phone message seeking comment. 
The case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 11-cv-1482, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington).

Trials/Appeals 
Ford Asks Court to Reverse $2 Billion Award to Truck Dealers 
Ford Motor Co. (F) asked an Ohio appeals court to reverse a $2
billion judgment awarded in June to a class of commercial truck
dealers who claimed the company overcharged them for 11 years. 
The dealers sued Ford in 2002, claiming the company broke
an agreement to sell trucks at published prices, which forced
them to pay more from 1987 through 1998 and cut into profits.
Cuyahoga County Judge Peter J. Corrigan in June upheld a $4.5
million verdict awarded to one Ohio dealer in February by a
Cleveland jury. The Cleveland judge also said Ford had to pay
similar damages and interest to a class of about 3,000 other
dealers. 
The judge improperly found Ford liable before trial for
breach of franchise agreements and prevented the company from
defending itself on damages, the automaker said in a Sept. 2
filing with the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County in
Cleveland. Ford also said Corrigan shouldn&#8217;t have applied his
findings on one dispute across hundreds of thousands of
transactions involving other dealers. 
&#8220;The trial court&#8217;s grant of summary judgment on liability
exemplifies the court&#8217;s repeated and erroneous election to take
away from the jury key questions on liability and damages,&#8221;
Ford said in court papers. &#8220;The trial court deprived Ford of
its rights to due process and a trial by jury.&#8221; 
The total $2 billion award is five times higher than the
amount of the largest-ever jury award against Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford in a lawsuit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. 
The court&#8217;s judgment was the largest of any type in Ohio
history, Ford said in its appeal. &#8220;That staggering judgment was
as unwarranted as it was unprecedented,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;It
resulted from a series of serious errors by the trial court, any
one of which compels reversal.&#8221; 
Ford wasn&#8217;t denied any rights, James Lowe, the dealers&#8217;
lawyer, said in an interview Sept. 9. Corrigan&#8217;s treatment of
the suit by awarding damages to the class was &#8220;perfectly
appropriate,&#8221; he said. 
The case is Westgate Ford Truck Sales Inc. v. Ford Motor
Co., CV 02-483526, Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio
(Cleveland).

Health-Care Ruling May Delay Final Answer From U.S. High Court 
A federal appeals court decision cast doubt on the prospect
that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality
of President Barack Obama&#8217;s health-care overhaul before the 2012
elections. 
The three-judge panel said Sept 8 that it didn&#8217;t yet have
the power to consider a challenge to the law&#8217;s requirement that
Americans, by 2014, either acquire health insurance or pay a
penalty. The court ruled that judicial review must wait for the
assessment of a fine -- something that wouldn&#8217;t occur until the
following year. 
The health-care law, which has divided courts around the
country, was already in line for possible Supreme Court review
early next year, with a ruling likely in June. The Sept. 8
ruling adds a new legal wrinkle, raising a procedural issue that
might delay the ultimate outcome. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still the case that we will get some decision from
the United States Supreme Court the last week of this coming
June,&#8221; said Walter Dellinger, the former U.S. solicitor general
who filed a brief backing the law on behalf of congressional
Democrats. &#8220;But it is possible that ruling could be that no one
has the right to challenge this law until they&#8217;ve declined to
pay the penalty or sought a refund.&#8221; 
Three federal appeals courts have now considered the law,
each reaching a different conclusion. A Cincinnati-based appeals
court upheld the law in June, calling it a valid use of
Congress&#8217;s power to regulate interstate commerce. An appeal in
that case is now before the Supreme Court. 
An Atlanta-based court disagreed, upholding arguments by 26
states that Congress had exceeded its power under the commerce
clause. The U.S. Justice Department is scheduled to say by the
end of the month whether it will seek Supreme Court review of
that ruling or instead ask a larger panel of appellate judges to
reconsider. 
The latest ruling, from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, took a third approach. The panel
focused on a law, known as the Anti-Injunction Act, barring
lawsuits that seek to block the collection of federal taxes. The
measure says that &#8220;no suit for the purpose of restraining the
assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any
court by any person.&#8221; 
Writing for herself and one other panel member, Judge Diana
Gribbon Motz, said the law meant the court couldn&#8217;t hear a suit
filed by Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg,
Virginia, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. 
The cases are Liberty University v. Geithner, 10-02347, and
Commonwealth of Virginia v. Sebelius, 11-01057, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Richmond).

Verdicts/Settlement 
Ex-Industrial Enterprises CEO Gets Up to 21 Years for Fraud 
Former Industrial Enterprises of America Inc. (IEAM) Chief
Executive Officer James W. Margulies was sentenced to seven to
21 years in prison for his role in a $110 million securities
fraud. 
New York State Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro handed
down the sentence in Manhattan Sept. 9. Margulies, of Cleveland,
was convicted in July of grand larceny, scheming to defraud,
conspiracy, violation of general business law and falsifying
business records in what prosecutors called a &#8220;massive&#8221; pump-
and-dump scheme. 
&#8220;This is basically a case of greed,&#8221; Carro said. He said
he wanted the sentence to serve as &#8220;a general deterrent that
will scream out from this courtroom that people like you are
going to be treated harshly.&#8221; 
Margulies and another former Industrial Enterprises CEO,
John D. Mazzuto, were indicted in May 2010. Mazzuto pleaded
guilty and testified against Margulies, a lawyer, at trial.
Mazzuto hasn&#8217;t been sentenced. 
&#8220;My actions were well-intended at the time,&#8221; Margulies
told Carro Sept. 9. &#8220;By the time I recognized the potential
harm of my actions, it was too late.&#8221; 
He asked for probation, telling the judge that he needed to
be at home with his family, including a child who has special
needs. Carro rejected that request. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not my sentence that&#8217;s going to devastate these
children,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;It is your actions.&#8221; 
The case is People v. Margulies, 2503-2010, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan.) 
Former Taiwan Semiconductor Manager Seeks 12-Month Sentence 
A former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. manager who
pleaded guilty to being part of an insider-trading scheme
involving Primary Global Research LLC is seeking a 12-month
sentence. 
Manosha Karunatilaka, who pleaded guilty in May to taking
about $35,000 to pass inside tips about the company&#8217;s orders
while working as a Primary Global consultant, asked the
sentencing judge Sept. 9 to give him a split term of six months
in jail and six months of home confinement. 
&#8220;I am a good person that made a terrible mistake and fell
from grace,&#8221; Karunatilaka said in a letter to U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff, which was attached to the sentencing request
filed in Manhattan federal court Sept. 9. 
Prosecutors argued in a court filing that Karunatilaka
should get from 37 to 46 months in prison. 
An analyst at an unnamed New York-based hedge fund which
used Primary Global&#8217;s services spoke to Karunatilaka frequently
from 2008 to 2010, prosecutors said in court papers. In May
2009, acting on Karunatilaka&#8217;s recommendation to bet that Taiwan
Semiconductor shares would fall, the fund made a profit of about
$1.7 million, the U.S. said. 
The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-CR-32, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Alliance One, Deltafina Lose EU Appeals of Antitrust Fine 
Universal Corp.&#8217;s Italian unit Deltafina and Alliance One
International Inc. (AOI) lost European Union court appeals against
antitrust fines totaling 54 million euros ($75 million) for
colluding on prices they paid tobacco growers. 
The EU General Court, the 27-nation region&#8217;s second-highest
tribunal, ruled Sept. 9 that the penalties were valid. 
The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
fined four companies, including two Alliance One units, 56
million euros for unlawfully rigging prices for more than six
years in a cartel that ended in 2002. Deltafina was fined 30
million euros while Alliance One was held jointly liable with
its two units for a 24 million-euro penalty. 
The ruling follows decisions by the court in a similar case
concerning the Spanish market last year in which Deltafina won a
reduction in an 11.9 million-euro antitrust fine for fixing the
prices it paid Spanish growers for tobacco. Alliance One last
October lost an appeal over its fine in the cartel. 
Representatives of the companies in the U.S. didn&#8217;t respond
to calls outside normal office hours. 
The cases are: T-12/06, Deltafina v. European Commission;
T-25/06, Alliance One v. European Commission.

On The Docket 
Ex-Bear Stearns Fund Managers&#8217; SEC Trial Set for February 
Former Bear Stearns Cos. hedge-fund managers Ralph Cioffi
and Matthew Tannin, acquitted in 2009 of criminal charges they
misled investors who lost $1.6 billion, are set to face trial in
February in a related civil case brought by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. 
U.S. District Judge Frederic Block in Brooklyn, New York,
set the trial date for Feb. 13 at a conference Sept. 9. 
A federal jury in November 2009 found Cioffi and Tannin not
guilty of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud in the first
criminal trial stemming from a federal probe of the collapse of
the subprime-mortgage market. Cioffi, 55, was portfolio manager
for the hedge funds and Tannin was their chief operating
officer. 
&#8220;We have had no discussions of substance,&#8221; John D.
Worland, a lawyer for the SEC, told Block when the judge asked
about the possibility of a settlement, which would make a trial
unnecessary. 
Kevin Callahan, an SEC spokesman, and Marc Weinstein, a
lawyer for Cioffi at Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP in Manhattan,
declined to comment on the case. Nina Beattie, a lawyer for
Tannin at Brune  Richards LLP in Manhattan, also declined to
comment. 
Cioffi and Tannin were indicted in June 2008, a year after
their hedge funds failed. Bear Stearns collapsed less than a
year after the funds failed, and was purchased by New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) 
The SEC claims the two men misled investors about the
funds&#8217; deepening financial troubles and their own holdings in
the investment pools. The regulator&#8217;s case requires a lower
standard of proof than a criminal conviction. 
The civil case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Cioffi, 08-cv-2457, and the criminal case is U.S. v. Cioffi, 08-
CR-00415, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn).

Morgan Stanley said it may lower
its year-end forecast for the euro after the currency declined
to less than the bank&#8217;s $1.36 prediction, as the European
Central Bank damped the outlook for interest rate increases. 
The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to suffer from
&#8220;reputational issues&#8221; after Juergen Stark quit its executive
board last week and this will likely be &#8220;unhelpful&#8221; for the
single currency, analysts including Hans Redeker, head of
foreign-exchange strategy, wrote in a client note today. 
Europe&#8217;s common currency may slump to about $1.3055 if it
weakens to less than a &#8220;support level&#8221; at $1.3440, the
analysts wrote. A support level is a price where bids may be
clustered.  
The euro lost 0.4 percent to $1.3603 as of 10:12 a.m. in
London, after falling to $1.3495, the weakest since Feb. 16. It
slumped 3.9 percent last week, the biggest drop since the five
days through Aug. 13, 2010.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled an
upcoming version of its Windows operating system that can run
handheld touch-screen computers, aimed at narrowing the lead of
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad in the market for tablets. 
Software developers will be able to download a preview of
the program, called Windows 8, tonight, the company said. The
product lets users display favorite applications, people and
information in tiles on the main screen. It will allow ultra-
thin personal computers and tablets to turn on instantly and run
all day on a single charge. 
Microsoft is under pressure to put out a new version of
Windows capable of running smaller, thinner tablet computers
with battery life to rival that of the iPad. In the meantime,
Windows sales have missed analysts&#8217; estimates for three straight
quarters and personal-computer sales have stalled as consumers
favor tablets over notebook computers running the software. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s very important for them to get this right,&#8221; said
Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen, who suggests
buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;They can&#8217;t compete with what&#8217;s out
there today in tablets.&#8221; 
Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft took the wraps off
Windows 8 today at a conference for developers in Anaheim,
California, without saying when it will go on sale. The product,
previewed in June, is an attempt to vault Microsoft into a fast-
growing market controlled by Apple and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
software. 
Tablet Market 
Sixty million media tablets will ship in 2011, and 74
percent of those will be Apple&#8217;s iPads, according to an August
forecast by IHS Inc. The global market is expected to rise to
275.3 million units in 2015, with Apple forecast to claim 43.6
percent of the market at that point. 
In the quarter that ended in June, Apple sold 9.3 million
iPads. About 20 percent of them went to customers who would have
otherwise bought a Windows PC, estimated Colin Gillis, an
analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. 
The need to compete has led Microsoft for the first time to
offer a Windows computer operating system that runs on chip
technology from ARM Holdings Plc. (ARM) The program is the biggest
operating-system change Microsoft has made since Windows 95,
Microsoft Vice President Julie Larson-Green said in June. 
Windows 8&#8217;s design resembles Microsoft&#8217;s software for
mobile phones in its use of digital tiles instead of icons to
help users move between programs. 
&#8216;Re-imagined Windows&#8217; 
&#8220;From the chipset to the experience, Windows 8 re-imagines
what Windows can be,&#8221; Sinofsky said in a keynote address today.
Developers at the conference will get a prototype tablet
computer with the Windows 8 preview software. The machine was
made by Samsung Electronics Co. and runs an Intel Corp. (INTC) chip. 
Like Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 7, the new software has touch-
controlled tiles that can be automatically updated to display
information from applications on the computer&#8217;s start screen.
For example, a weather application can tell users that the
forecast is sunny without requiring them to open the app. 
The software also will run on desktop and laptop computers
via a touch screen, mouse or keyboard. Windows 8 will run
&#8220;virtually all&#8221; of the existing Windows applications, the
company said in today&#8217;s statment. 
Besides the new design, called Metro, the software also
offers the option of switching to the regular desktop look
available in Windows now. By switching to that mode, users can
employ Windows 7 apps and devices. 
Windows Store 
The software will have a Windows Store for selling apps,
and apps can work together and share information. 
Microsoft first released a version of Windows for tablet
computers in 2002, though the devices used a stylus and had few
programs tailored to the new form. Many were as large as regular
notebooks and had similar battery life. 
Tablets caught on in 2010 when Apple released the iPad,
promising 10 hours of battery life. Since then, companies
including Samsung Electronics Co. and Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc. have started selling touch-screen tablets running Google&#8217;s
Android software. 
Microsoft also said it&#8217;s approaching 450 million copies
sold of its current operating system, Windows 7.

named a new chief executive officer as it announced a new 850
million-euro ($1.16 billion) financing package.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said trading
revenue will drop about 30 percent this quarter from the prior
three months as the economy weakened and volume declined. 
Corporations pulled back from the market, particularly in
August, James Staley chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, said today at a Barclays financial-services
conference in New York. Debt and equity sales were down across
the board as were mergers and acquisitions, Staley said. 
The company earned $5.5 billion in equity and fixed-income
trading during the second quarter. Third-quarter fees from
investment banking will fall by about half, Staley said,
projecting about $1 billion in total fees compared with $1.92
billion in the second quarter. 
JPMorgan will report a &#8220;modest loss&#8221; in its private-
equity unit of about $100 million, Staley said. 
The bank&#8217;s exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and
Spain is about $14 billion, a figure that includes loans and
derivatives contracts and is mostly a mix of sovereign and bank
debt, Staley said. 
&#8220;The issue really is if there is an uncontrolled default
in Europe, to define the contagion of that is very difficult,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;What we learned in 2008 is that we are
interconnected. I don&#8217;t think any of us have been able to figure
out what the ultimate impact would be of a default in Greece.&#8221;

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, is likely to raise its dividend 19
percent as early as this week, frustrating investors who are
clamoring for a bigger payout from its $52.8 billion cash hoard. 
The projected increase -- to 19 cents a share per quarter,
from 16 cents, based on data compiled by Bloomberg -- would be
similar to last year&#8217;s rise. While Microsoft&#8217;s board is aware of
the shareholder demands, it will probably stick with the usual
increase, a person familiar with the board&#8217;s thinking said. 
Microsoft&#8217;s cash and short-term investments swelled 43
percent in the past fiscal year. With the shares losing more
than 7 percent of their value in 2011, more investors want the
company to boost its payout. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has said that Microsoft&#8217;s dividend policy is to raise
payments in line with annual gains in operating income, which
climbed 13 percent in the year that ended in June. 
&#8220;That cash is better in our hands than theirs,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker
Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.2 billion in assets,
including Microsoft shares. &#8220;I&#8217;d hope they&#8217;d raise it more.&#8221; 
In light of investor sentiment, Microsoft is considering a
larger increase, said the person familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be named because the decision is private. Still,
the board is more likely to retain its policy of raising the
payout in line with operating income, the person said. 
Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. 
Smaller Than Average? 
Microsoft has paid out about 25 percent of earnings as
dividends since starting the payments in 2003, according to
Bloomberg data. Dividend-paying companies with similar market
valuations to Microsoft are paying closer to 40 percent to 50
percent, the data show. 
Returning more cash to investors also may be hindered by
Microsoft&#8217;s overseas holdings. About $45 billion, or 85 percent,
of Microsoft&#8217;s cash and short-term investments is outside the
U.S., the company said a July 28 regulatory filing. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft would have to pay taxes if the
company brings it into the U.S. to use for dividends. 
About half of the company&#8217;s annual cash flow from
operations is generated outside the U.S., Heather Bellini, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York, said in a Sept.
6 report. That leaves about $15 billion to $17 billion available
for dividends and share repurchases in the current fiscal year,
she said. Bellini anticipates that the dividend will rise to 18
cents to 20 cents. 
Microsoft shares rose 15 cents to $25.89 yesterday on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has declined 7.2 percent this
year. 
Technology Peers 
Among technology company peers, Microsoft&#8217;s payout falls in
the middle. Intel Corp. (INTC), Sage Group Plc and SAP AG are paying a
larger portion of earnings, while Oracle Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and CA Inc. pay less, Bloomberg data show. 
Bloomberg dividend forecasts look at seven criteria,
including dividend history and public estimates. A payout
increase to 19 cents would boost the yield to 2.9 percent from
2.5 percent currently, according to Bloomberg data. 
&#8220;If Microsoft were to match its peers on payout ratios, it
would equate to a dividend yield increase to 6 percent from the
current 2.6 percent, and include an approximate doubling of the
company&#8217;s dividend,&#8221; said Neil Herman, an analyst at
Ticonderoga Securities, in a research report last month. 
The shares might surge past $35 if the board decided to
&#8220;majorly boost the company&#8217;s dividend,&#8221; Herman said.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said developers
have downloaded 500,000 copies of the preview version of Windows
8 since its debut yesterday, evidence of interest in an
operating system that will vie with Apple Inc. (AAPL) software. 
&#8220;While it&#8217;s clear we have a long way to go still with
Windows 8, we&#8217;ve been gratified by the reactions and the
interest,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today at
a conference for developers in Anaheim, California. One area
needing more work: a Windows 8 version that runs on chips with
technology from ARM Holdings Plc, which is &#8220;very, very
important to us,&#8221; Ballmer said. 
Microsoft is rushing to complete Windows 8 because the
company wants an operating system capable of running thinner,
lighter tablet machines with battery power that can rival
Apple&#8217;s iPad. That need has led the world&#8217;s largest software
maker to make its Windows personal-computer operating system
compatible with ARM-based chips for the first time. ARM
processors typically run smartphones and other mobile gadgets. 
At the conference, Microsoft gave attendees a prototype
machine running an Intel Corp. (INTC) chip rather than an ARM model, a
sign that version is farther along. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t said when
Windows 8 devices will go on sale. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 46 cents to
$26.50 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have lost 5.1 percent of their value this year. 
&#8216;Re-Imagining&#8217; Company 
While Microsoft Windows President Steven Sinofsky yesterday
said that Windows 8 &#8220;re-imagines&#8221; what Windows can do, Ballmer
today said that the effort -- as well as Microsoft&#8217;s push into
Internet-based cloud services and new types of hardware --
represent a &#8220;re-imagining&#8221; of the entire company. 
Even as it focuses on tablets, phones and cloud computing,
the company will keep Windows at the heart of its strategy,
Ballmer said. 
&#8220;Windows is at the center,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People question
whether that is a good idea. I think it&#8217;s an exceptionally good
idea.&#8221; 
Windows Phone, the mobile-phone software that Microsoft
released last year, hasn&#8217;t performed as well as Ballmer would
have liked, he said. Still, positive reception from those who
have bought the devices, as well as the support from handset
makers, gives him hope for the future, he said. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying I love where we are, but I am very
optimistic on where we can be,&#8221; Ballmer said. 
When asked if Microsoft&#8217;s Internet-search partnership with
Yahoo was at risk, given the company&#8217;s ouster of CEO Carol Bartz, Ballmer said he&#8217;s not worried. 
&#8220;The partnership will remain strong no matter where they
want to take their business or whoever they happen to install
next as CEO,&#8221; he said.

&#8220;Windows is at the center,&#8221; Ballmer said at Microsoft&#8217;s

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it
lowered forecasts for the euro versus the dollar as fiscal
tensions in the region increase. 
The shared currency will trade at $.140 at the end of the
year, down from $.145, the New York-based firm said in note to
clients today. It also reduced its six- and 12-month outlooks to
$1.45 and $1.50, from $1.50 and $1.55 respectively. Analysts led
by Thomas Stolper, chief foreign exchange strategist in London,
&#8220;continue to expect euro-dollar to rise again, albeit from a
slightly lower starting point.&#8221; 
Failure of euro area governments to calm market concern
over Greek default and contagion, relatively little additional
fiscal tightening in the U.S. and weaker-than-expected global
economic data contributed to the revisions, according to the
report. 
&#8220;The extent of the friction and the relative weakness of
the policy response was not our core scenario,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. 
The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.3754 at 4:55 p.m. in New
York from $1.3678 yesterday.

Producers of electric-car batteries
such as LG Chem Ltd. (051910) and Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) are building new
plants at such a pace that capacity will grow to almost double
automakers&#8217; demand, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report shows. 
While manufacturers will have capacity to make 35 gigawatt
hours of batteries by 2013, carmakers have committed to produce
as many as 839,000 plug-in electric vehicles needing a total of
18 gigawatt-hours of storage, the London-based researcher said. 
&#8220;The larger, mainly Asian, conglomerates can cope with
limited demand and compete by lowering prices but smaller pure-
play battery makers will be left vying for an increasingly
limited number of supply contracts,&#8221; said Ali Izadi-Najafabadi,
an energy technologies analyst at New Energy Finance. 
The glut of factories may push smaller manufacturers out of
the running for orders and into areas such as energy storage for
surplus power from electricity grids, according to today&#8217;s
report. Battery prices may also decline to $350 per kilowatt-
hour in 2020 from $800 to $1,000 now, New Energy Finance said. 
Among Asian companies best able to cope with the surplus
are LG Chem, South Korea&#8217;s biggest chemicals maker, Seoul-based
SK Innovation Co., Toshiba Corp. (6502) in Tokyo and SB LiMotive, a
joint venture between Samsung Electronics Co. and Robert Bosch
GmbH, said Shu Sun, another analyst at the research group. 
Nissan, GM 
LG Chem in April said it aims to spend 2 trillion won ($1.8
billion) by 2013 to expand its battery capacity for electric
cars. Nissan Motor Co. plans to make 500,000 batteries a year by
2015 through its Automotive Energy Supply Corp. venture. 
Nissan, based in Yokohama, Japan, and Detroit-based General
Motors Co. (GM) both began selling new electric cars in December.
Battery making has surged in the U.S., where spending under the
government&#8217;s Recovery Act has channeled about $2.4 billion into
the products, their components and charging infrastructure for
vehicles, according to U.S. Department of Energy figures. 
The U.S. is set to hold as much as 40 percent of capacity
by 2015, up from 2 percent before the stimulus, according to the
energy department. Of companies receiving funding, Ener1 Inc. (HEV)&#8217;s
EnerDel unit is expected to struggle the most, Sun said. It
received a grant of $118.5 million for a plant in Indianapolis. 
Brian Sinderson, a spokesman for Ener1, didn&#8217;t immediately
reply to an e-mail and voicemail seeking comment. 
The department also provided $299.2 million for a Johnson
Controls factory in Holland, Michigan, the largest grant under
the program. Waltham, Massachusetts-based A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) got
$249.1 million for plant at Romulus and Brownstown in the state.

fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will shut its Global Alpha
fund after clients pulled money from the quantitative trading
pool that was once the firm&#8217;s largest hedge fund. 
Global Alpha will stop charging fees at the end of this
month and aims to finish liquidating most assets by mid-October,
according to a letter that Goldman Sachs Asset Management sent
to clients Sept. 14. The fund, which managed $11 billion of
assets in 2007, had less than $1.7 billion at the end of June,
according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the numbers aren&#8217;t public. 
Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, has been shrinking Global Alpha since
2007 when it lost 40 percent because of bad bets on currencies,
equities and bonds worldwide. The fund&#8217;s co-managers Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski quit in March 2009, and Katinka Domotorffy took charge of the quantitative investment strategies
unit, which uses computers to pick securities and oversees $56
billion. 
Reuters reported yesterday that the Global Alpha fund was
down 12 percent through the end of August, and the Wall Street
Journal reported that it was being shut. Ed Canaday, a spokesman
for the New York-based bank, confirmed the letter&#8217;s contents and
said he couldn&#8217;t comment on the performance. 
Lehman Claims 
Domotorffy is leaving at year-end and being replaced by new
managers, including Armen Avanessians, a partner who has served
on the securities division&#8217;s executive committee since 2003,
according to a separate letter to investors Sept. 14. Ron Hua,
who oversaw $12 billion of equity assets at PanAgora Asset
Management Inc., was hired as chief investment officer and head
of the quantitative equity alpha business. 
Goldman Sachs wrote in the letter that it aims to
distribute 85 percent to 90 percent of the total proceeds from
the fund&#8217;s assets to clients by the end of October. The fund&#8217;s
claims against Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which declared
bankruptcy three years ago, may take longer and the fund may
have liabilities to Lehman as well, according to the letter. 
&#8220;We have extensively reviewed the fund&#8217;s claims against,
and potential liabilities to, Lehman Brothers and intend to
vigorously pursue a resolution with Lehman Brothers that is in
the best interests of investors in the fund,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
wrote. &#8220;We cannot predict when the fund will be able to make
final distributions, if any, to investors in the fund.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs is aiming to build the fund-management unit
and improve its performance. The overall business had $844
billion under management at the end of June and generated 13
percent of the firm&#8217;s revenue in this year&#8217;s first six months. 
Asset Management Moves 
Avanessians, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and became a
partner in 1994, is the latest executive to move into asset
management from other parts of the bank. Jim O&#8217;Neill, the chief
economist, was appointed chairman of asset management last year.
The investment unit&#8217;s co-heads, Timothy J. O&#8217;Neill and Edward C. Forst, came from other divisions. 
Bill Fallon, who became chief investment officer and head
of alpha strategies when Domotorffy took over, will cede the
equity business to Hua and focus on quantitative macro funds,
according to the letter. Don Mulvihill will remain chief
investment officer and head of customized beta strategies,
Goldman Sachs said. Both will report to Avanessians, who will be
based in New York. He will report to O&#8217;Neill and Forst, who
signed the letter. 
Domotorffy joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 as a portfolio
manager and researcher with the quantitative global macro and
fixed-income teams, according to the letter. She became head of
strategy for the quantitative investment strategies group in
2007 before taking the leadership role two years later. 
Carhart is now running Kepos Capital Management LP, which
has $150 million under management and has made a 9 percent
return so far this year, before fees, according to a person
familiar with the matter.

John Mack will cede his chairman
role at Morgan Stanley to Chief Executive Officer James Gorman
on Jan. 1, capping a 35-year career at the firm that included
record losses and a government bailout. 
Mack, 66, is completing the two years he promised to serve
in the job when he ceded the CEO title to Gorman, 53, at the end
of 2009. He will leave the board to become a senior adviser, the
New York-based company said yesterday in a statement. 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, more
than tripled net income last year, boosted by gains in both the
investment bank where Mack spent most of his career and the
retail brokerage that Gorman ran when he joined in 2006. 
&#8220;From the board&#8217;s point of view, Gorman has proved himself
as an executive,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. who recommends buying Morgan Stanley (MS) stock and
once served as its treasurer. &#8220;He&#8217;s embraced both sides of the
firm, and the firm doesn&#8217;t have the internal dissension issues
that existed before.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley was the world&#8217;s largest securities firm when
Mack returned after a four-year absence in June 2005 to replace
CEO Philip J. Purcell, who left under pressure from investors
and employees. Mack&#8217;s efforts to boost trading revenue as well
as businesses including private equity and mortgage-bond
underwriting backfired when the company posted its first
quarterly loss in 2007 and the global credit crunch toppled
smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
Taxpayer Bailout 
The company sold stakes to China Investment Corp. and
Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to raise capital
and converted to a bank in 2008. Morgan Stanley also took $107
billion of Federal Reserve emergency loans, more than any other
company, during the financial crisis. 
&#8220;His contributions to the firm are innumerable, but none
was more critical than the leadership he provided in guiding
Morgan Stanley through a financial crisis that claimed many of
our peers,&#8221; Gorman said in the statement. &#8220;For more than 30
years, he has helped to define the firm&#8217;s distinctive culture
and build our franchise across the globe.&#8221; 
Mack said in 2009 that he considers his own greatest
accomplishment to be leading the firm through the 2008 crisis,
which wiped out Lehman Brothers and led Bear Stearns Cos. and
Merrill Lynch  Co. to be sold to larger companies. 
&#8220;I said to my wife, when things were really crazy, &#8216;You
know, there&#8217;s a chance I will lose this firm,&#8217;&#8221; Mack said in a
2009 interview. &#8220;But I would rather be doing this than sitting
on a beach reading a book.&#8221; 
Strategy Shift 
Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz,
Florida, said that Mack changed strategy too many times at
Morgan Stanley as he reacted to circumstances. 
&#8220;It created a company which had no clear vision of where
it was going,&#8221; Bove said. &#8220;Overall, I would have to say his
tutelage of the company was not effective.&#8221; 
In giving Gorman the chairman job, Morgan Stanley is ending
a two-year experiment in separating the two positions. Bank of
America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the biggest- and third-biggest
U.S. banks by assets, have separated the two jobs. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the second- and fifth-
largest U.S. banks, have a single executive serving both roles. 
The company gained $1.11, or 7.2 percent, to $16.59 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. and was the
second biggest gainer in the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Financials Index after Lincoln National Corp. Morgan Stanley
stock is still down more than 40 percent this year. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what his legacy will be,&#8221; said Kenneth Crawford, a senior portfolio manager at Argent Capital
Management LLC in St. Louis, which oversees about $1.2 billion
and doesn&#8217;t own Morgan Stanley stock. Mack &#8220;came back and then
allegedly resurrected Morgan Stanley and then took enough risk
that his company was on the brink.&#8221;

Carolina Lightcap resigned
unexpectedly as president of Disney Channels Worldwide after
less than two years on the job. 
Gary Marsh was named president and chief creative officer
of the unit, Burbank, California-based Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said
today in an e-mailed statement. 
The move puts children&#8217;s networks including Disney Channel
and Disney XD into the hands of the creator of some of its
biggest shows, including &#8220;Hannah Montana&#8221; and &#8220;High School
Musical.&#8221; Lightcap, plucked from Disney Channels&#8217; Latin
American operations in November 2009, said she was leaving with
some Disney cable channels&#8217; ratings at their highest ever. 
&#8220;I readily embrace change as a good thing, and really look
forward to the next chapter of my career,&#8221; Lightcap said in a
letter to her staff. 
The departure by Lightcap, an 11-year Disney veteran who
had headed marketing in Latin America, is the second high-level
resignation at Disney this month. 
On Sept. 6, Andrew P. Mooney resigned as chairman of the
consumer products unit to seek a larger executive role. 
The Disney Channel&#8217;s ratings were up by 10 percent in the
company&#8217;s most recent quarter, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said in a Aug. 9 earnings conference call. Ratings at XD
channel, which is targeted at boys, increased by 24 percent. 
For the period ended July 2, the worldwide Disney Channel
operation contributed to the company&#8217;s 11 percent increase in
operating earnings for its media networks unit, which includes
the ESPN sports channel, Disney said on Aug. 9. 
&#8216;Phineas and Ferb&#8217; 
Marsh, who was president of entertainment and chief
creative officer at Disney Channels, most recently developed the
&#8220;Phineas and Ferb&#8221; franchise. A movie based on the characters,
&#8220;Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension,&#8221; was cable TV&#8217;s
most-watched movie this past summer, Disney said on Aug. 6. 
Disney, the world&#8217;s largest theme-park company and the
owner of Pixar and Marvel movie studios, rose 65 cents to $32.94
today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have declined 12 percent this year.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s David Kostin slashed his year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index by 11 percent to 1,250, citing continued uncertainty
in the global markets due to Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. 
Kostin, the equity strategist at the firm, previously
predicted the benchmark equity index would climb to 1,400. This
was Kostin&#8217;s second SP 500 forecast reduction in the past two
months, following his shift from 1,450 on Aug. 5. 
&#8220;The unstable macro environment is likely to persist for
the foreseeable future because Europe currently lacks both the
institutional structure and policy tools to solve the festering
sovereign debt crisis,&#8221; the New York-based strategist wrote in
a report dated yesterday. &#8220;Investors believe a nontrivial
probability exists that the crisis will trigger a global
financial dislocation similar to 2008.&#8221; 
Investors have fled risky assets since July amid concern
European officials may fail to contain the region&#8217;s debt crisis
and the U.S. economy will slip into a recession, sending yields
on 10-year Treasuries to a record low and pushing the SP 500
down as much as 18 percent from its April high. Goldman Sachs is
the third Wall Street firm to cut its forecast for stocks this
week, following Wells Fargo  Co. and Barclays Plc. 
Kostin kept his estimates on earnings by companies in the
SP 500 at $96 a share this year and $102 in 2012. The index
rose 1.7 percent to 1,209.11 at 4 p.m. New York time, the fourth
straight day of gains amid optimism Europe is working to tame
the credit crisis. The European Central Bank said today it will
lend dollars to euro-area banks in a series of three-month loans
to ensure they have enough of the U.S. currency through the end
of the year.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMC Mortgage
unit was sued by Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the trustee for a mortgage
portfolio, for refusing to buy back more than 800 defective home
loans. 
EMC rejected &#8220;repeated repurchase demands&#8221; for the loans
in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in a public version of the
complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. The case was initially filed under seal. 
&#8220;The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of
defaults and foreclosures,&#8221; Wells Fargo said in the complaint.
&#8220;Approximately three-quarters of the loans in the trust have
been modified or liquidated, or are now seriously delinquent.&#8221; 
The complaint is the second Wells Fargo has filed as
trustee against EMC. The trustee settled a suit brought in
January after EMC agreed to turn over files for more than 2,000
underlying mortgages in the trust. 
Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. 
A review of 948 loan files revealed that at least 840, or
about 89 percent, failed to comply with EMC&#8217;s representations
and warranties, according to the complaint. As many as 1,503
mortgage loans are subject to repurchase, Wells Fargo said. 
Of those 1,503 loans, 49 percent already have been
liquidated, according to a letter filed as an exhibit to the
complaint. Principal losses on those loans, including accrued
interest, total about $214.4 million, according to the letter. 
About 51 percent of the loans are still held by the trust,
with an outstanding balance of about $344.5 million, according
to the letter. 
The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage LLC, CA6861,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said new managers will run
the quantitative funds unit and that Katinka Domotorffy is
retiring after 13 years at the firm. 
Armen Avanessians, a partner who has served on the
securities division&#8217;s executive committee since 2003, will head
the global quantitative business within asset management, the
New York-based company said in a letter to clients yesterday.
Ron Hua, who oversaw $12 billion of equity assets at PanAgora
Asset Management Inc., was hired as chief investment officer and
head of the quantitative equity alpha business. 
Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is aiming to build the firm&#8217;s fund-management
unit and improve its performance. The business had $844 billion
under management at the end of June and generated 13 percent of
the firm&#8217;s revenue in the first six months of this year. 
Avanessians, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and became a
partner in 1994, is the latest executive to move into asset
management from other parts of the bank. Jim O&#8217;Neill, the chief
economist, was appointed chairman of asset management last year.
The investment unit&#8217;s co-heads, Timothy J. O&#8217;Neill and Edward C. Forst, came from other divisions. 
Domotorffy took charge of the quant-funds unit, which uses
computer models to pick securities to trade, after co-heads Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski quit in March 2009. Carhart and
Iwanowski had managed Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Global Alpha fund, which
was the firm&#8217;s largest hedge fund before sustaining losses and
client redemptions in 2007 and 2008. 
Beta Strategies 
Bill Fallon, who became chief investment officer and head
of alpha strategies when Domotorffy took over, will cede the
equity business to Hua and focus on quantitative macro funds,
according to the letter. Don Mulvihill will remain chief
investment officer and head of customized beta strategies,
Goldman Sachs said. Both will report to Avanessians, who will be
based in New York. 
Avanessians will report to O&#8217;Neill and Forst, who signed
the letter. Its contents were confirmed by Ed Canaday, a company
spokesman. The moves were reported yesterday by Reuters. 
Domotorffy joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 as a portfolio
manager and researcher with the quantitative global macro and
fixed-income teams, according to the letter. She became head of
strategy for the quantitative investment strategies group in
2007 before taking the leadership role two years later. 
Goldman Sachs gained $3.25, or 3.1 percent, to $107.79 at
1:18 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock had fallen 38 percent this year through yesterday.

Wall Street banks seeking to unload
commercial mortgages amassed before Europe&#8217;s sovereign crisis
deepened and a slowing economy rattled markets are getting a
reprieve from rising yields after Morgan Stanley sold bonds
yesterday that demonstrated demand for the debt. 
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. sold the top-
ranked 10-year portion of a $1.5 billion bond offering at 185
basis points more than the benchmark swap rate yesterday after
marketing the debt earlier at as much as 215, a person familiar
with the offering said. Similar debt that Deutsche Bank AG and
UBS AG sold last month paid a spread of 200. 
Relative yields on securities tied to offices, hotels and
shopping centers have been hovering at about the highest levels
since June 2010 as investors shun riskier assets amid concern a
Greek default may infect European lenders and as economists
lower U.S. growth forecasts. Banks have pulled back from making
new loans to package into bonds as price swings erode profit
margins on the deals. 
&#8220;This momentum certainly would encourage banks, but it
takes a few more pricings to demonstrate a trend,&#8221; said Jeffrey Berenbaum, a commercial-mortgage debt analyst at Citigroup Inc.
in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a matter of taking a step back to see how
things settle before looking to continue lending.&#8221; 
Barren Pipeline 
While lenders are poised to sell as much as $6 billion of
stockpiled debt through October, the rest of the year may have
no offerings, Bank of America analysts said in a Sept. 9 report.
More than $24 billion of the debt has been raised in 2011,
following $11.5 billion last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. 
JPMorgan is marketing a $1 billion issue, according to
people familiar with the sale. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo  Co., Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc and Deutsche Bank AG are also arranging transactions, the
people said. 
Elsewhere in credit markets, a benchmark gauge of U.S.
corporate credit risk fell for a third day from a two-year high.
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 2.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 126.4 basis points as of 12:03 p.m. in New York,
according to Markit Group Ltd. 
The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has decreased from 135.9
basis points on Sept. 12, its highest level since July 2009.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt. 
Commercial Paper 
U.S. commercial paper outstanding declined $22.6 billion
to $1.043 trillion in the week ended Sept. 14, the Federal
Reserve said today on its website. That&#8217;s the lowest level since
the market, which has fallen for nine straight weeks, reached
$1.042 trillion in the period ended Feb. 16, according to Fed
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The commercial-mortgage bond offering from Morgan Stanley
and Bank of America is composed of 63 loans on 76 properties,
the person said. Retail property debt accounts for 46.3 percent
of the offering and office debt is about 30 percent. Loans in
Texas and California account for 31.2 percent of the pool. 
Wider Spreads 
The securities were priced as German and French leaders
expressed support for Greece remaining in the euro monetary
union and speculation that China may help the region&#8217;s most-
indebted nations. 
Political and economic turmoil drove relative yields on
top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds to 303 basis points more
than Treasuries on Aug. 25, the most since June 2010, before
narrowing to 291 yesterday, according to Barclays Plc index
data. 
Spreads climbed from this year&#8217;s low of 178 on April 26 as
Fed auctions of mortgage securities assumed in the rescue of
American International Group Inc. weighed on credit markets. The
selloff was exacerbated in July as the sovereign-debt crisis
engulfed Italy and lawmakers in Washington clashed over raising
the U.S. debt ceiling, leading SP to cut America&#8217;s top credit
grade on Aug. 5. 
Economists are lowering their growth forecasts for the U.S.
Gross domestic product will expand 1.7 percent this year, less
than the May forecast of 2.8 percent, according to a survey by
the National Association for Business Economics issued Sept. 12
in Washington. 
Delinquencies Fall 
Commercial-mortgage bond sales have tumbled from a record
$234 billion in 2007. A dropoff in new lending may make it
harder for some borrowers to refinance maturing loans, according
to the Bank of America analysts led by Alan Todd. 
&#8220;Borrowers with less capital or less attractive properties
will obviously have fewer options,&#8221; the New York-based analysts
wrote. &#8220;It is likely that the trend of liquidating smaller
loans and modifying and extending larger loans will persist.&#8221; 
Delinquencies, which climbed to a record 9.01 percent in
July, fell 36 basis points last month, according to Fitch
Ratings. 
Banks have increased the so-called credit enhancement,
which protects AAA bondholders from losses, to 30 percent on
deals offered since last month as investors pushed back on terms
and demanded higher yields. That compares with 16.875 percent on
a $1.48 billion transaction from Wells Fargo and Royal Bank of
Scotland in July. 
&#8216;Nice Pickup&#8217; 
The additional investor protection coupled with property
valuations in recent deals compares favorably with bonds sold in
2005, while offering a &#8220;nice pickup&#8221; in spread and yield, said
James Grady, a managing director at Deutsche Asset Management in
New York, including commercial-mortgage debt. 
&#8220;This is a trade that makes sense and you will see
investors take advantage of this opportunity while it lasts,&#8221;
Grady said. 
The slide in the safest classes of commercial-mortgage
bonds has made the debt attractive relative to other fixed-
income investments, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Timothy J. Sloan said in a Sept. 12 conference call with analysts. 
&#8220;Spreads blew out pretty significantly over the past few
months,&#8221; Sloan said, referring to the most senior portions of
commercial-mortgage securities. &#8220;That&#8217;s not the only class that
we think is attractive, but we definitely want to be able to
take advantage of opportunities.&#8221;

Brent crude and copper may rally as
global economic growth led by emerging markets remains adequate
to drive an expansion in raw-materials demand, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) said, sticking with forecasts for price gains. 
&#8220;We remain constructive on commodities,&#8221; Allison Nathan,
an analyst at Goldman for more than a decade, said in an
interview today. Still, &#8220;risks to our bullish views have
risen,&#8221; said Nathan, citing Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt problems
and a &#8220;mixed bag&#8221; of economic data from the United States. 
Goldman&#8217;s position contrasts with the outlook from Societe
Generale SA&#8217;s global asset-allocation team, which said
commodities are in a &#8220;danger zone&#8221; as growth slows, according
to a report distributed yesterday. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
Spot Index of 24 commodities has shed 14 percent since April 11
on speculation that the global recovery is faltering. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen emerging-markets demand for key commodities,
including oil, holding up well,&#8221; Nathan said in Singapore.
There haven&#8217;t yet been signs that the economic woes in developed
markets are spreading to emerging economies, she said. 
Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April, then turned bullish in May before prices rebounded.
Last month, the bank forecast gains for Brent crude, zinc, and
other commodities over the next 12 months, analysts led by
Jeffrey Currie said in an Aug. 8 report. 
Copper may climb to $11,000 per metric ton, while Brent
gains to $130 a barrel, the report said. Three-month copper on
the London Metal Exchange, which reached a record $10,190 per
ton in February, traded at $8,660 per ton at 4:10 p.m. in
Singapore, while Brent was at $112.60 per barrel. 
Greek Rescue 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said yesterday that they are &#8220;convinced&#8221; Greece
will stay in the euro area, boosting equity and metals prices.
European governments are aiming to ratify a July 21 accord to
bolster a bailout fund and extend a second rescue to Greece. 
Investor skittishness over the spread of Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis combined with signs that U.S. growth may be slowing have
roiled markets worldwide. Recent data have shown U.S. retail
sales were unchanged in August, while the economy generated no
jobs and earnings fell. 
&#8220;If we see weakness spreading on a global basis, that
would be a catalyst to expect a weaker demand environment and
potentially weaker prices relative to our forecast,&#8221; Nathan
said in the interview. &#8216;If there was a crisis in the European
banking sector, a crisis akin to 2008 could occur and that would
have a large impact on commodity prices.&#8221; 
China Forecasts 
Still, Goldman economists forecast that China&#8217;s economic
growth may be 9.2 percent next year, compared with an estimate
of 9.3 percent for this year, according to Nathan. The nation is
the world&#8217;s largest user of metals and energy. 
Low inventories of aluminum, copper and steel in China are
an indicator that demand in the country &#8220;isn&#8217;t that bad,&#8221;
Julian Zhu, a Goldman analyst, said at a media briefing in
Singapore today. Traders and investors have been concerned that
rising interest rates and a credit-tightening policy in the
nation may lead to slower consumption of raw materials. 
&#8220;The Chinese government is very flexible and if they need,
they can reverse the tightening policy very fast,&#8221; said Zhu.
&#8220;This could be very supportive to demand for commodities
because investment by local governments at all levels will see a
Rebound,&#8221; said Zhu. 
Societe Generale&#8217;s report said that there may be a
&#8220;meaningful drop&#8221; in prices of so-called cyclical commodities
such as oil and copper. Gold may rally from an increase in risk
aversion, according to the report.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) was hired to advise Huawei Technologies Co. on branding
strategy as the Chinese telecommunications gear supplier expands
into tablet computers, smartphones and cloud computing. 
The project involves 25 consultants from the world&#8217;s
biggest computer-services provider and is expected to be
completed by the end of November, Ross Gan, a Huawei spokesman,
said in an interview today. Harriet Ip, a spokeswoman for
Armonk, New York-based IBM in Singapore, confirmed the
arrangement by phone today. Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not a traditional branding project where they tell
us how the brand should be positioned,&#8221; Gan said in a phone
interview from Huawei&#8217;s headquarters in Shenzhen, southern
China. &#8220;It&#8217;s more from the management-of-the-process point of
view: How do I manage the brand function within the
organization? Who is responsible for what?&#8221; 
Huawei is expanding its 13-year relationship with IBM as it
seeks to more than triple sales to $100 billion in the next 10
years by expanding into consumer digital devices and enterprise
computing. The thrust requires closely held Huawei to promote to
consumers, businesses and government agencies, including those
in the U.S., where efforts to buy rivals have been rebuffed amid
allegations the company threatens national security. 
The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.
in February told Huawei, founded in 1988 by former Chinese army
officer Ren Zhengfei, to divest its purchase of 3Leaf Systems
after lawmakers said the deal threatened national security. 
Bids Thwarted 
3Leaf, founded in 2004, developed technology for cloud
computing that lets businesses and government agencies move
applications and programs such as e-mail to remote networks
owned and operated by a third party. Huawei was also thwarted in
bids to buy 2Wire and Motorola Inc.&#8217;s wireless business last
year, and 3Com Corp. in 2008. 
Huawei has said its employees own the company and China&#8217;s
government and military don&#8217;t hold any shares. Ren has had no
connection to the military since he retired from service more
than two decades ago, according to Huawei. 
Huawei in April unveiled plans for the thrust into consumer
devices, including tablets, smartphones and &#8220;enterprise
computing,&#8221; setting up computer and communication networks for
businesses and government agencies. 
Enterprise Computing 
The company said at the time it expects enterprise
computing revenue to grow to as much as $20 billion within five
years, from $2 billion last year. Sales of mobile devices may
rise to $20 billion in the same period from $5 billion last
year. 
Huawei&#8217;s relationship with IBM started in 1998 when Ren
began traveling to the U.S., Europe and Japan to learn
international best practices as his company expanded globally. 
In 1999, the Chinese company added collaboration on
research and development and supply chain management to IBM&#8217;s
roles. Human resources management was added in 2005 and
financial management in 2007. The new contract is the first for
work on brand strategy from Huawei, Ip of IBM said. 
&#8220;IBM has a very strong branding strategy,&#8221; Ip said.
&#8220;After several rounds of doing this ourselves, we have the
expertise to help clients as well. That&#8217;s something we can share
with Huawei and our other clients.&#8221; 
Huawei won its first contract outside China in 1997. It
achieved international sales of more than $100 million by 2000,
and overseas business exceeded contracts in China for the first
time in 2005, according to data supplied by the company.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
exited a money losing bet that the dollar would weaken against a
basket of currencies after turmoil in European markets and
broader risk aversion added to the greenback&#8217;s refuge appeal.  
The trade was &#8220;stopped out&#8221; after a loss of 2.3 percent,
the New York-based securities firm said in a note today. On Aug.
10, Goldman recommended betting against the dollar with a basket
of currencies comprised of the New Zealand dollar, Russian
ruble, Swedish krona, South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit and
Chilean peso.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) plan to offer $1.7 billion in securities tied to
commercial mortgages, resuscitating a deal that was withdrawn
after Standard  Poor&#8217;s withdrew its ratings. 
The debt will be marketed to investors next week, according
to people familiar with the offering who declined to be
identified because the deal hasn&#8217;t been announced. The issue was
originally $1.5 billion. 
The transaction was pulled after it was placed with buyers
in July, rankling investors and bankers in the $600 billion
market. The banks canceled the issue on July 28 after SP said
it was halting its ratings of commercial-mortgage bonds because
of potential flaws in its models. The New York-based rating
company resumed grading the securities on Aug. 5, saying the
impact on ratings of the inconsistencies would be &#8220;generally
modest.&#8221; 
The offering adds to more than $24 billion of the debt
issued in 2011, following $11.5 billion last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its
forecasts for the euro versus the dollar amid signs the European
Central Bank&#8217;s focus on inflation has faded and as leaders
disagree over approaches to the region&#8217;s debt crisis. 
The 17-nation currency will trade at $1.38 at year-end,
compared with an earlier forecast of $1.45, strategists John Normand and Thomas Anthonj wrote today in a client note. The
euro will fetch $1.40 in June 2012, compared with the previous
estimate of $1.48, they wrote. 
JPMorgan lowered its projections &#8220;to reflect ECB&#8217;s
dovishness and internal dissent over bond purchases,&#8221; the
London-based strategists wrote. 
The euro weakened 0.6 percent to $1.3792 today in New York,
paring a weekly advance to 1 percent. 
The New York-based financial firm joined banks including
BNP Paribas SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and
Nomura Holdings Inc. in lowering year-end targets for the euro
this month. 
JPMorgan disagrees &#8220;with the emerging consensus that the
euro will trend lower over the next year,&#8221; Normand and Anthonj
wrote in their note. 
While Europe faces an &#8220;enormous&#8221; funding challenge next
year, authorities also have put programs in place to manage the
debt crisis in peripheral countries, they wrote. There is
potential for the Federal Reserve to buy more Treasuries, and
the U.S. fiscal position will likely deteriorate if even parts
of President Barack Obama jobs program are approved, they wrote. 
Inflation Risks Eased 
The ECB said yesterday in its monthly bulletin that threats
to euro-area growth have intensified and inflation risks have
eased, signaling policy makers may take further action should
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis worsen. They raised they benchmark rate to
1.5 percent in July. 
The central bank has purchased 143 billion euros ($197
billion) of bonds to curb the euro region&#8217;s debt crisis,
starting with Greece, Portugal and Ireland last year and
widening to Italy and Spain in August. Germany&#8217;s Juergen Stark
resigned from the ECB&#8217;s board last week in protest of the bond
program, which he said blurs the line between monetary and
fiscal policy.

Kweku Adoboli, the UBS AG (UBSN) trader
arrested in London yesterday, admitted to causing losses while
the bank&#8217;s risk-control officers were examining his trades, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. 
UBS said yesterday it suffered a loss of about $2 billion
from &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; trading. 
Adoboli hired lawyers at Kingsley Napley in London to
represent him, a spokeswoman said today in a phone interview. 
The firm previously advised Nick Leeson, who caused the
collapse of Barings Plc with $1.4 billion in losses in 1995.
Leeson, a former derivatives trader, caused the demise of
Britain&#8217;s oldest merchant bank after losses on the futures and
options markets in Singapore and Osaka, Japan, were uncovered. 
UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, asked British police at 1
a.m. to arrest Adoboli before notifying the U.K. financial
regulator or prosecutors, according to two people familiar with
the matter. 
The Financial Services Authority was notified shortly after
police. Prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office, which also
handles white-collar crime, weren&#8217;t contacted at all, according
to the people, who declined to be identified because the
investigations are private. 
The investigation highlights the fragmented financial crime
enforcement agencies in the U.K. with jurisdictions that often
overlap. That UBS went straight to police after learning about a
$2 billion loss on trades indicates that the 31-year-old Adoboli
may have been a flight risk, or that the bank wanted to distance
itself from any crime, said Lindsay Thomas, a financial
regulation adviser at Sustainable Risks. 
UBS wants &#8220;to suggest that it was a terrible criminal act,
and that they were a victim,&#8221; Thomas said in a phone interview
in London. 
The City of London police arrested Adoboli at a business
address in London at 3:30 a.m. on suspicion of fraud and abuse
of position in connection with unauthorized trading at UBS&#8217;s
investment bank. Police declined to identify the address.
Adoboli remains in custody during the probe, Commander Ian Dyson
said yesterday. 
UBS is still investigating the matter, the Zurich-based
bank said in a statement. No client positions were affected, and
it may be unprofitable in the third quarter because of the loss,
UBS said, declining to comment further.

New Suits 
ETF Securities Sued by Former Executive in U.K. Over Bonus 
ETF Securities Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest provider of
exchange-traded commodity funds, was sued in London by a former
employee who says he is owed a stake in the company tied to a
2006 bonus award. 
Stefan Garcia, now an executive at another ETF firm, said
the bonus gave him options to buy 1,000 shares of the company at
49.99 pounds ($79) with no time limit, according to U.K. court
documents filed in July. 
ETF Securities, based in Jersey, is considering selling as
much as $1 billion in shares through an initial public offering
amid growing investor demand for exchange-traded products,
according to a May report in the Wall Street Journal that cited
unidentified bankers familiar with the matter. 
Graham Tuckwell, chairman and chief executive officer of
ETF Securities, said in a phone interview the case was
&#8220;absolutely without merit.&#8221; He said the claim was based on a
&#8220;small administrative error&#8221; and the options had expired. 
Garcia was awarded the options because at that early stage
the company had &#8220;limited cash to fund its growth,&#8221; according
to documents filed by his lawyers. Tuckwell sent Garcia an e-
mail in May refusing to allow him to exercise the options. 
Mark Levine, a partner at London law firm Mishcon de Reya
who is representing Garcia, said his client had a multimillion-
pound claim and declined to comment further. 
The case is Cherrin v. ETF Security Ltd., HQ11X02645, High
Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division. 
JPMorgan Unit Must Buy Back $558 Million in Loans, Suit Says 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMC Mortgage unit was sued by Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), the trustee for a mortgage portfolio, for refusing
to buy back more than 800 defective home loans. 
EMC rejected &#8220;repeated repurchase demands&#8221; for the loans
in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in a public version of the
complaint filed Sept. 14 in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. The case was initially filed under seal. 
&#8220;The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of
defaults and foreclosures,&#8221; Wells Fargo said in the complaint.
&#8220;Approximately three-quarters of the loans in the trust have
been modified or liquidated, or are now seriously delinquent.&#8221; 
The complaint is the second Wells Fargo has filed as
trustee against EMC. The trustee settled a suit brought in
January after EMC agreed to turn over files for more than 2,000
underlying mortgages in the trust. 
A review of 948 loan files revealed that at least 840, or
about 89 percent, failed to comply with EMC&#8217;s representations
and warranties, according to the complaint. 
Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. 
The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage LLC, CA6861,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). 
U.K. to Sue ECB Over Planned Restrictions on Clearing Houses 
Britain will sue the European Central Bank over plans to
prevent some euro-denominated securities from being cleared
outside the 17 countries that share the currency, in the first
such move by a government. 
The U.K. planned to present a legal challenge against the
ECB over its location policy for clearing houses at the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the Treasury in London said in
an e-mailed statement Sept. 14. 
&#8220;It does seem to indicate a possible change in the
approach that the U.K. is taking to Europe,&#8221; Darren Fox, a
financial services lawyer at Simmons  Simmons LLP, said in a
telephone interview in London. &#8220;There has been a perception in
the City that the U.K. hasn&#8217;t been doing as much in Europe as it
could have done to protect the interests of the U.K. financial-
services industry. Perhaps this is a sign that the worm is
turning.&#8221; 
It&#8217;s the first time any European government has sought to
sue the ECB, the Treasury said. The U.K. is accusing the central
bank of going against principles of the European Union single
market and contravening European law amid wider international
efforts to regulate derivatives markets. 
A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based ECB declined to
comment.

Express Scripts Sues Walgreen Over Medicare Patients 
Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) sued Walgreen Co. for what it called a
&#8220;campaign to disparage&#8221; the pharmacy-benefits manager in an
illegal attempt to wrest away customers. 
Walgreen, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, is using false
advertising to encourage Medicare patients to leave Express
Scripts in violation of a contract that expires Dec. 31, St.
Louis-based Express Scripts said in a Sept. 7 complaint filed in
federal court in Chicago. Express Scripts said it will suffer
&#8220;irreparable damage&#8221; unless the court issues an injunction
stopping Walgreen&#8217;s action. 
Walgreen, of Deerfield, Illinois, said in June that it will
not participate in Express Scripts&#8217; pharmacy network next year
because negotiations collapsed on renewing the contract worth
more than $5 billion in annual drug sales. A website sponsored
by Walgreen says Medicare recipients who remain with Express
Scripts won&#8217;t be able to fill Part D prescriptions after Dec.
31. 
&#8220;This is false and highly misleading because nothing will
prohibit Walgreen from continuing to fill valid prescriptions
for such members after Dec. 31, 2011, even if Walgreen is not a
part of Express Scripts&#8217; pharmacy network,&#8221; Express Scripts
said in the complaint. 
Walgreen has asked the court to stay the proceedings,
saying in a Sept. 12 motion that Express Scripts brought its
claims in the wrong forum because the contract requires the
parties to resolve such disputes through binding arbitration. 
&#8220;We think that it is important to inform our patients and
the public how this may impact their ability to fill
prescriptions at Walgreen next year if Express Scripts serves as
the pharmacy-benefit manager for their particular health care
plans, and we regret that Express Scripts has resorted to
litigation in an effort to stop us,&#8221; Michael Polzin, a
spokesman for Walgreen, said Sept. 14 in an e-mail. &#8220;We
obviously intend to vigorously defend against their suit.&#8221; 
The case is Express Scripts Inc. v. Walgreen Co. (WAG), 11-cv-
06223, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
BP Investors&#8217; Derivative Spill Suits Dismissed by U.S. Judge 
BP Plc (BP/) won&#8217;t have to face some lawsuits in the U.S. brought
by institutional investors on behalf of the company over last
year&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico drilling-rig explosion and oil spill, a
federal judge ruled. 
U.S. District Judge Keith P. Ellison in Houston agreed with
BP&#8217;s arguments that the claims should be filed in U.K. courts
because the company is based in London. Ellison said he may
reverse this dismissal if English courts &#8220;refuse to accept
jurisdiction&#8221; for reasons other than the plaintiffs&#8217; failure to
comply with procedural requirements. 
&#8220;Because this derivative lawsuit involves the internal
governance of an English corporation, the convenience of the
parties and the interests of justice favor England as a more
convenient forum,&#8221; Ellison said yesterday in a 31-page
decision. 
Investors sued BP claiming that the company&#8217;s management
and board caused the spill by knowingly putting profits ahead of
safety. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April 2010 while
drilling a BP well off the Louisiana coast, killing 11 and
spilling more than 4.1 million barrels of oil. 
The investors&#8217; suits, so-called derivative claims brought
on behalf of the company, are combined with other shareholder
actions before Ellison in Houston. Lawsuits seeking money for
economic and personal injuries from the spill are consolidated
before a different U.S. judge in New Orleans. 
&#8220;The primary concern of this derivative litigation is the
internal affairs of an English corporation, and the suit seeks
to recover damages for the benefit of BP only,&#8221; Ellison said in
his ruling. &#8220;English law governs this dispute and will
determine whether the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary duties and harmed BP in the process.&#8221; 
BP spokesmen Scott Dean and Daren Beaudo didn&#8217;t immediately
return phone or e-mail messages seeking comment on the ruling
after regular business hours. Mark Lebovitch and Lewis Kahn,
investor attorneys, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking
comment. 
The case is In re BP Shareholder Derivative Litigation,
4:10-cv-03447, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). 
Lions Gate Suit Against Carl Icahn Voluntarily Dismissed 
Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)&#8217;s lawsuit against
billionaire investor Carl Icahn in Manhattan federal court was
voluntarily dismissed by both sides. 
Lions Gate, an independent producer of films including
&#8220;Precious&#8221; and &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; and the &#8220;Mad Men&#8221;
television series, sued Icahn in October, claiming he tried to
interfere with the studio&#8217;s plan to merge with Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer Inc. 
In papers filed with the court yesterday, both sides said
the case is being dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can&#8217;t be
reinstituted. The papers didn&#8217;t say whether the dismissal is
part of any settlement in the case. 
In March, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer dismissed most of
Lions Gate&#8217;s allegations, permitting it to go forward with a
claim that Icahn paid a special price for Dallas Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban&#8217;s 5.4 percent stake in Lions Gate, which the studio
said wasn&#8217;t fair to other investors. 
William Savitt, a lawyer for Lions Gate, and Joseph
DiBenedetto, who represents Icahn, didn&#8217;t return messages
seeking comment on the court filing. 
The case is Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. V. Icahn, 1:10-
cv-08169, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
ATT, U.S. Offer Plan for Confidential Data in T-Mobile Case 
ATT Inc. (T) and the U.S. Justice Department agreed on a plan
for handling confidential data in the government&#8217;s antitrust
lawsuit seeking to block the company&#8217;s purchase of wireless
carrier T-Mobile USA Inc. 
A filing by the department yesterday in federal court in
Washington sets definitions for what will be deemed confidential
and how that information will be disclosed in the case. ATT
didn&#8217;t oppose the department&#8217;s proposed order, the government
said. 
The two sides haven&#8217;t addressed the issue of how much
access ATT&#8217;s in-house lawyers will have to confidential
materials submitted by &#8220;non-parties&#8221; in the case, according to
the filing. The non-parties should have a chance to be heard in
court regarding how their confidential information will be
handled, the department said. 
&#8220;Defendants wish to designate up to 10 (total) in-house
lawyers to have access to confidential information,&#8221; the
department said in the filing. 
Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman in Washington, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a telephone message and an e-mail message
seeking comment on the filing. 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. 
ATT, in a filing last week, said the T-Mobile deal is good
for mobile-phone customers because it would lead to better
service, fewer dropped calls and lower prices for consumers. 
U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 and told the parties to be prepared to discuss
settlement options. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington).

Trials/Appeals 
Fleishman Doesn&#8217;t Take Stand as U.S. Rests in Insider Trial 
James Fleishman, the former Primary Global Research LLC
executive on trial over charges he participated in an insider-
trading scheme, didn&#8217;t take the stand in his own defense after
prosecutors finished their case. 
Fleishman, of Santa Clara, California, is charged with two
counts of conspiracy for his role in what prosecutors said was a
scheme in which technology-company employees, working as
consultants for the company passed secret tips to hedge fund
managers. 
&#8220;The government has rested and the defense has rested,&#8221;
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan told jurors
yesterday. &#8220;On Monday, we will have closing arguments and you
will get the case then.&#8221; 
Rakoff said Fleishman&#8217;s lawyers may submit some written
evidence without calling witnesses to testify. After court,
Ethan Balogh, Fleishman&#8217;s lawyer, said his client wouldn&#8217;t
testify. If convicted, Fleishman faces as long as 25 years in
prison. 
The Mountain View, California-based firm, also known as
PGR, matches employees of public companies with fund managers
for a fee. Of the 15 people charged in the probe, 12 have
pleaded guilty. Fleishman and Winifred Jiau, a former PGR
consultant convicted in June, were the only ones who have gone
to trial. 
Also yesterday, former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. manager Manosha Karunatilaka was sentenced to 18 months in
prison for his role in the scheme involving PGR. 
Balogh yesterday cross-examined Suk-Joo Hwang, a former
Samsung Electronics Co. manager who said he worked as a
consultant for PGR for seven years. Hwang said he sometimes
passed confidential information to PGR clients. 
The case is U.S. v. Fleishman, 11-cr-00032, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Blame for 2010 Gulf Spill Will Be Decided by Trial Judge 
Which companies share the blame for the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill and will have to pay for it will be decided in a non-jury
trial set to begin Feb. 27, a federal judge in New Orleans said. 
BP Plc (BP), which owned the subsea well that exploded off
Louisiana in April 2010, claims Transocean Ltd. (RIG), Halliburton
Co. (HAL), Cameron International Corp. (CAM) and other contractors involved
in the offshore drilling operation share responsibility for
mistakes that caused the disaster. 
&#8220;The trial will address all allocation of fault issues
that may properly be tried to the bench without a jury,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Carl Barbier said Sept. 14 in a written order.
This includes &#8220;the negligence, gross negligence, or other bases
of liability of, and the proportion of liability allocable to
the various defendants, third parties, and non-parties,&#8221; he
said. 
The Macondo blowout and the explosion that followed killed
11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
history. The accident and spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against London-based BP and its partners and contractors. The
lawsuits over economic losses and personal injuries have been
combined before Barbier in New Orleans. 
The lawsuits also name as defendants Transocean, the
Switzerland-based owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that exploded; Houston-based Halliburton, which
provided cementing services to the well; and Cameron
International, which provided blowout-prevention equipment. BP&#8217;s
minority partners in the well, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) and
Mitsui  Co.&#8217;s Moex Offshore LLC unit, were also sued. 
The first test trial on damages is scheduled for July. 
The case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).

Verdicts/Settlement 
Bridgestone to Pay $28 Million Fine Over Bribes, U.S. Says 
Bridgestone Corp. (5108), the world&#8217;s biggest tire maker, agreed
to pay $28 million to settle criminal allegations it conspired
to bribe government officials in Latin America, the U.S. Justice
Department said. 
Bridgestone will plead guilty to charges of plotting to rig
bids and make corrupt payments related to the sale of products
including marine hose, used to transfer oil between tankers and
storage facilities, Sharis A. Pozen, acting chief of the Justice
Department&#8217;s antitrust division, said yesterday in a statement.
The company said it will withdraw from the marine hose business. 
From as early as January 1999 until late May 2007, Tokyo-
based Bridgestone conspired to fix prices and allocate market
shares of marine hose in the U.S. and elsewhere, Pozen said. The
company allegedly conspired to make payments to Latin American
government officials to obtain and retain business. 
As part of the agreement, Bridgestone will cooperate with
the department&#8217;s investigation, according to the statement. The
agreement requires court approval. 
Bridgestone has dismantled its international engineered
products department, closed its Houston office and terminated
many of its third-party agents, the company said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement. 
&#8220;We are committed to the efforts to further enhance and
expand our remediation measures, and to conduct business in
compliance with the competition and anticorruption laws around
the world,&#8221; Bridgestone said. 
Hermes Executive Says Takeover Win Locks in Independence 
Hermes International (RMS) SCA&#8217;s founding family&#8217;s ability to set
up a holding company is &#8220;a decisive step&#8221; in the fight to
defend against a takeover, the luxury-goods maker&#8217;s deputy
managing director said. 
A Paris court yesterday rejected an appeal by minority
investors who opposed a decision by the French market authority
waiving rules to allow the family to set up a holding company.
The family sought the structure to protect the Birkin-bag maker
after LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC), the world&#8217;s largest
luxury-goods maker, began building what is now a 21.4 percent
stake. 
&#8220;When the holding company is in place, it will become
completely obvious that the claims of unity that have taken
place for months and have been questioned will be impossible to
challenge anymore,&#8221; Deputy Managing Director Patrick Albaladejo
said in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;This is a decisive
step.&#8221; 
The Autorite des Marches Financiers was right to grant the
family permission to pool a 50.2 percent Hermes stake into a
holding company without bidding for the rest of the business, as
the regulator would normally require for a group with that large
a stake joining together, the Paris appeals court said. 
The court rejected the objections of minority investors
represented by a shareholder advocacy group Adam, which had
sought to have AMF force the family to make an offer for all
outstanding shares. 
While LVMH has said it isn&#8217;t seeking control or a board
seat, its stake has prompted takeover talk. LVMH won&#8217;t be a
passive shareholder in Hermes and can provide its Paris-based
rival with strategic and operational help, LVMH Chairman Bernard
Arnault has said. 
&#8220;All the statements from the family have been very precise
and decisive on this, that they don&#8217;t want to engage in
discussions,&#8221; Albaladejo said, adding that he isn&#8217;t aware of
any contact with Arnault. 
Hermes wants LVMH to reduce its stake by more than half to
free shares on the open market, according to Bertrand Puech, who
heads the bag maker&#8217;s founding family. Even if LVMH doesn&#8217;t
reduce the holding, Hermes will run the company as it sees fit,
Puech has said.

Watson, Sandoz Pay $145 Million to Settle Drug-Price Case 
Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI), the generic-drug maker, will
pay $79 million and Novartis AG (NOVN)&#8217;s Sandoz unit will pay $66
million to resolve claims they defrauded U.S. and state
governments by causing Medicaid to overpay for drugs. 
Both lawsuits were filed under the U.S. False Claims Act by
Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys Inc., a specialty pharmacy. The
settlements resolved portions of the U.S. false claims cases and
similar claims by various states. The law allows whistle-blowers
to file on behalf of the government and share in any recovery. 
Ven-A-Care has settled at least 18 lawsuits since 2000 that
have allowed state and federal governments to collect at least
$2.2 billion. Ven-A-Care has reaped more than $380 million in
whistle-blower fees during that period. James Breen, an attorney
for Ven-A-Care, declined to comment on the latest settlements. 
The settlements by Watson and Sandoz were filed Sept. 14 in
federal court in Boston, where U.S. District Judge Patti Saris
is overseeing the so-called Average Wholesale Price litigation
against drugmakers. 
Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson, declined to comment on the settlement. He referred to
the company&#8217;s last annual report, filed in February, that said
the company reached a settlement with Ven-A-Care for $79 million
in December. 
The claims were &#8220;unfounded,&#8221; and Sandoz settled &#8220;to end
the uncertainty of protracted litigation,&#8221; Eric Althoff, a
spokesman for Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;Sandoz is committed to conducting business in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as our own
high ethical standards,&#8221; he said. 
The case is In Re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale
Price Litigation, MDL No. 1456, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). 
SABMiller&#8217;s Grolsch Wins EU Court Appeal of Antitrust Fine 
Grolsch, a unit of SABMiller Plc (SAB), the world&#8217;s second-
largest brewer by volume, won a European Union court appeal of a
31.7 million-euro ($43.8 million) fine levied for colluding on
beer prices in the Netherlands. 
Antitrust officials didn&#8217;t give sufficient proof to
&#8220;establish the direct participation of Grolsch&#8221; in the cartel
and &#8220;failed to explain&#8221; why the company should be held liable
for the conduct of a Dutch subsidiary, the EU General Court, the
region&#8217;s second-highest tribunal, said in a ruling yesterday. 
The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
fined Royal Grolsch NV, Heineken NV (HEIA) and Bavaria NV in 2007 for
fixing prices in the Netherlands from at least 1996 to 1999.
InBev NV, which has since merged with Anheuser-Busch Cos. to
become the world&#8217;s largest brewer, escaped a fine after tipping
off EU officials. Grolsch was bought by SABMiller in a takeover
completed in 2008. 
Heineken won a cut to its fine to 198 million euros from
219.3 million euros in a ruling by the EU court in June. Bavaria
had its penalty trimmed to 20.7 million euros from 22.8 million
euros, after the court said the European Commission failed to
prove the extent of the cartel. 
The commission will &#8220;analyze the ruling carefully&#8221; and
will then consider whether to appeal the judgment or readopt the
cartel decision, Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the EU
regulator, said in an e-mail. 
The case is: T-234/07, Koninklijke Grolsch v. Commission. 
New York &#8216;Boiler-Room&#8217; Salesman Anderson Gets Two Years 
Baldwin Anderson was sentenced to two years in prison for
taking part in a &#8220;boiler-room&#8221; investment-fraud scheme on New
York&#8217;s Staten Island. 
Anderson, 57, a former salesman for Gryphon Holdings Inc.,
was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in
Brooklyn, New York. He&#8217;s been in custody since June 14, when he
admitted to participating in the crime during the second day of
his trial. He was the last of 18 defendants in the Gryphon case
to plead guilty and the only one to go to trial. 
Gryphon misled investors into paying for phony stock tips
and investment advice, defrauding them of $20 million,
prosecutors charged. Gryphon told victims its office was on Wall
Street or even in the New York Stock Exchange when it was in a
strip mall on Staten Island, according to prosecutors in the
office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch. 
&#8220;I lost sight of the truth, I lost sight of what was good
and I lost sight of the laws that govern this great country,&#8221;
Anderson told Weinstein at a Sept. 13 hearing. 
Anderson&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Padden, declined to comment
after the sentencing. 
Kenneth Marsh, 44, who ran Gryphon, was the last defendant
before Anderson to plead guilty, on April 14. He hasn&#8217;t received
his prison sentence yet. 
The criminal case is U.S. v. Marsh, 10-cr-00480, and the
SEC case is SEC v. Gryphon Holdings Inc., 10-cv-01742, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn).

General Motors Co. (GM) and the United
Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement on a four-year labor
contract that improves profit sharing and will create jobs, the
company and the union said in separate statements. 
The accord goes to 48,500 GM hourly workers for a
ratification vote in the next seven to 10 days, GM said. The
union typically uses the first accord to set a pattern for pay
and benefits for the other two U.S. automakers. UAW negotiators
will seek a deal with Chrysler Group LLC next and then go to
Ford Motor Co. (F), three people familiar with the talks have said. 
The UAW, while declining to provide details, said the
agreement includes improved health care and enhanced profit
sharing with &#8220;far greater transparency.&#8221; GM will also invest
in its plants, hire back laid-off members and return work to the
U.S. from overseas, UAW President Bob King said in a statement. 
&#8220;This is a contract negotiated in tough times, when the
economy is uncertain and a battered industry is still in
recovery,&#8221; said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the
University of California at Berkeley. &#8220;The union is saying,
&#8216;Look, we&#8217;ve addressed job security when that is vital to our
members and to the whole economy.&#8217;&#8221; 
The union said it rebuffed efforts to weaken health-care
coverage and won &#8220;significant improvements.&#8221; 
&#8216;New Strategies&#8217; 
&#8220;The UAW approached these negotiations with new strategies
and fought for and achieved some of our major goals for our
members, including significant investments and products for our
plants,&#8221; King said. &#8220;This contract will get our members who
have been laid off back to work and will create new jobs in our
communities.&#8221; 
The agreement positions GM for long-term success, Cathy Clegg, GM vice president for labor relations, said in a
statement. 
&#8220;We worked hard for a contract that recognizes the
realities of today&#8217;s marketplace, enabling GM to continue to
invest in U.S. manufacturing and provide good jobs to thousands
of Americans,&#8221; she said. 
The UAW will probably turn its attention next to Chrysler,
majority-owned by Fiat SpA (F), said Shaiken. The GM accord, he said
&#8220;defines competitiveness for Detroit going forward.&#8221; 
&#8220;The details will be critical because the union&#8217;s goals of
job security and sharing in the success of the company can be in
conflict,&#8221; he said in a telephone interview, noting that he
hasn&#8217;t been briefed on those details. &#8220;The results will not
make everyone happy.&#8221; 
Non-Union Competition 
King, 65, has pledged to organize a foreign automaker this
year to expand the UAW&#8217;s bargaining power beyond GM, Ford and
Chrysler. He said the union has &#8220;recommitted to that goal.&#8221; 
&#8220;As long as unionized workers are being forced to compete
with nonunion workers who in most cases receive lower pay and
benefits -- many in temporary jobs -- there will continue to be
a downward pressure on the wages and benefits of all
autoworkers,&#8221; he said in the statement. 
Contracts covering 113,000 workers at GM, Ford and Fiat
SpA-controlled Chrysler were set to expire Sept. 14 and have
been extended while negotiations continued. 
The UAW proposed a signing bonus of $8,000 to $10,000 for
each member, five people familiar with discussions said last
week. A large bonus may help sell the deal to union members
looking to be repaid for what King has estimated as $7,000 to
$30,000 in concessions they each gave since 2005. 
Workers at Detroit-based GM, Ford and Chrysler received
signing bonuses of $3,000 after they ratified the current
contract in 2007. Prior to that, signing bonuses had been around
$1,000, Shaiken said last week. 
Past Concessions 
Previous concessions included surrendering raises, bonuses
and cost-of-living adjustments as well as agreeing to a two-tier
wage system, where new hires are paid about half as much as
senior employees. With GM and Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford
profitable, workers have said they want to recover what they
gave up. 
Workers at Ford have filed an &#8220;equality of sacrifice&#8221;
grievance against the automaker for restoring raises and bonuses
to salaried workers last year. An arbitration hearing on that
dispute started Sept. 15. 
UAW members agreed to a no-strike pledge at GM and Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler as part of their U.S.-backed
bankruptcies in 2009. Unsettled disputes at the automakers are
to be decided through binding arbitration. Ford didn&#8217;t receive a
U.S. bailout and UAW members there went against the wishes of
union leaders and rejected a strike ban and arbitration.

Klaus Doerrzapf, who has solar
panels on his home, has no plans for an emission-free car in his
garage. He&#8217;s one of the reasons why automakers like Nissan Motor
Co. won&#8217;t recoup investments in electric vehicles anytime soon. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s too early,&#8221; the 50-year-old manager at an electrics
company said at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt.
&#8220;Range and price are a problem. Battery life and charging times
are also concerns,&#8221; Doerrzapf said, while looking at an
electric-powered Focus from Ford Motor Co. (F) 
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), Volkswagen AG (VOW) and Nissan
partner Renault SA (RNO) talked up their electric vehicles at the
Frankfurt motor show as they rolled out a record number of
models and began the search for a return on their development
spending. Nissan, the maker of the all-electric Leaf, is
investing 4 billion euros ($5.5 billion) together with Renault
to build electric cars. 
Following the introduction last year of the Leaf,
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)&#8217;s i MiEV, and General Motors Co. (GM)&#8217;s
Chevrolet Volt, the new models will test consumer appetite for
electric vehicles, which cost more than double the price of
conventional models. Consumers are balking at paying up,
concerned that their own investment will be wiped out in a few
years because the batteries may not last. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re about to find out what happens when several big
manufacturers try to sell electric vehicles to real people,&#8221;
said Ian Fletcher, a London-based analyst with IHS Automotive.
&#8220;The signs aren&#8217;t all good.&#8221; 
Sales Targets 
Nissan has delivered 12,000 of the Leaf model since its
introduction in December, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn
said in Frankfurt. PSA Peugeot Citroen, which beat Renault to
the market with two electric city cars last December, targeted
7,000 combined deliveries of the iOn and C-Zero models for 2011.
It has sold 3,000 since Jan. 1. 
Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan said last November it planned
to sell as many as 25,000 units of the $32,780 Leaf in the U.S.
during the model&#8217;s first year. Through August, U.S. sales of the
model totaled just 6,168. 
The Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles per charge,
costs 25,990 pounds ($40,776) in the U.K., even after the
deduction of a 5,000-pound government incentive, while the
brand&#8217;s similarly sized Note starts at 11,200 pounds. In France,
the 5,000-euro government contribution lowers the starting price
of Peugeot&#8217;s iOn to 35,350 euros, compared with 9,700 euros for
the gasoline-burning Peugeot 107. 
Battery Barrier 
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t buy one just yet,&#8221; said Jean-Pierre Ahtuam,
38, who runs a juice bar in central Paris. &#8220;I&#8217;d be worried
about where I&#8217;d plug it in and whether it will be worth anything
in a couple of years -- that&#8217;s got to be a concern with any new
technology the first time around.&#8221; 
Costly batteries and limited driving range remain the key
sticking points for the technology. Public charging stations are
also conspicuously absent in most markets. Even the technology&#8217;s
strongest advocates recognize that success hinges on years of
generous subsidies from increasingly cash-strapped governments. 
&#8220;As things stand, it&#8217;s only with this support that we can
make the cars affordable for consumers,&#8221; said Thomas Orsini,
electric-vehicle business development director at Renault, which
is predicting a 10 percent global market share for battery cars
by 2020. &#8220;If the subsidies disappear too soon, the market won&#8217;t
get off the ground.&#8221; 
Subsidies help to absorb the 7,000-euro cost of a battery
that will propel a compact car about 100 miles on flat terrain
between charges -- providing that heating and other energy-
draining functions are used sparingly or not at all. 
&#8216;Sudden Death&#8217; 
The batteries&#8217; price and limited lifespan will combine to
make electric vehicles depreciate faster than combustion-engine
models in the used-car market, according to research by the
University of Greenwich in London. 
&#8220;Electric cars suffer from the certainty, not just risk,
of a large fixed cost a few years down the line,&#8221; said Michael Wynn-Williams, a business professor and author of the study.
&#8220;This is sudden death, the point where an otherwise attractive
vehicle is worth nothing.&#8221; 
To get around this problem, Daimler AG (DAI) plans to follow
Renault&#8217;s lead by initially leasing the batteries with its cars.
The electric-powered Smart city car will start at less than
16,000 euros, with the battery costing an additional 60 euros a
month. 
Ghosn, chief executive officer of both Renault and Nissan,
remains bullish. Demand for Nissan&#8217;s Leaf has outstripped
expectations, he said Sept. 12. 
&#8220;When we first predicted a 10 percent market share, people
said we were being extremely optimistic,&#8221; the CEO said. &#8220;Since
then, it&#8217;s the experts who have increased their forecasts.&#8221; 
&#8216;Nice to Drive&#8217; 
Not all industry analysts got Ghosn&#8217;s memo. Fletcher at IHS
expects battery-powered cars to claim about 1 percent of global
production in 2020, while rival research firm J.D. Power and
Associates puts their market share below 2 percent. The
forecasts exclude cars with range extenders, like GM&#8217;s Volt,
which use a small on-board gasoline generator to recharge the
battery on the move. 
Even some of the auto executives showing pure electric
models in Frankfurt sounded skeptical about their future. 
Peugeot Citroen sees three times more global demand for hybrids,
which combine electric propulsion with a combustion engine. 
&#8220;Everything we&#8217;re seeing today confirms that vision,&#8221;
said CEO Philippe Varin. 
Consumers like Doerrzapf, who owns a VW Passat and works
for a company supplying the type of electronics equipment needed
to recharge the vehicles, may yet change their minds. 
&#8220;They are nice to drive,&#8221; he said.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) paid over 1 million
pounds ($1.57 million) to buy the silence of a female executive
unfairly passed over for the job of managing director for the
software company&#8217;s U.K. operations, the Daily Telegraph
reported, citing unidentified people at Microsoft. 
Natalie Ayres worked at Microsoft for 15 years and was
widely tipped to become U.K. managing director in 2006; her
interview process was still under way when Microsft named Gordon
Frazer, general manager of Microsoft South Africa, to the post,
the newspaper said. 
Ayres received a seven-figure payoff when she left at the
end of 2006; Microsoft said it didn&#8217;t comment on individual
employees and placed great importance on the core values of
diversity, the Telegraph reported.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, raised its quarterly dividend 25 percent
to 20 cents, providing investors with a payout at the upper end
of forecasts. 
The new dividend is a penny more the 19 cents a share
projected by Bloomberg data and compares with the 18 cents to 20
cents estimated by Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in New York. The change, announced in a statement
today, boosts the yield to 2.97 percent from 2.37 percent. 
Microsoft generally has a policy of boosting the dividend
in line with operating income. While the increase exceeded the
13 percent growth in operating income in the past fiscal year,
investors were seeking more, Bellini said. The company&#8217;s cash
and short-term investments surged 43 percent last year, and
shareholders wanted a bigger piece of that hoard. 
Microsoft&#8217;s ability to return cash to shareholders is
hampered by the fact that much of that money is held
internationally and would require the company to pay taxes to
bring it back into the country for the purpose of paying a
larger dividend. 
About $45 billion, or 85 percent of the company&#8217;s cash and
short-term investments, is held outside the U.S., the company
said in a July 28 regulatory filing. Around half of annual cash
flow from operations is generated abroad, Bellini estimated,
which gives the company about $15 billion to $17 billion to
spend on dividends and share repurchases this year. 
Double It 
Even so, Neil Herman, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities
LLC, suggested in an August report that the company should
double its dividend in order to boost its share price. The
shares, which have declined 3.3 percent this year, might surge
past $35 with an increase of that magnitude, he wrote. 
Shares of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 23
cents to $26.98 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They rose to
$27.10 in late trading after the increase was announced. 
Before today, Microsoft has paid out about 25 percent of
earnings as dividends since starting the payments in 2003,
according to Bloomberg data. Dividend-paying companies with
similar market valuations to Microsoft are paying closer to 40
percent to 50 percent, the data show. 
The company also said today it will continue its $40
billion stock buyback plan begun in 2008. The program, which
expires in 2013, had about $12.2 billion remaining as of June
30, Microsoft said.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
biggest theme-park operator, unveiled plans for attractions
based on the top-grossing 3-D movie &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; starting at its
Animal Kingdom in Florida. 
James Cameron, who directed Fox&#8217;s 2009 science-fiction
thriller, will serve as a creative consultant in development of
&#8220;Avatar&#8221; lands at the parks, officials of Burbank, California-
based Disney said today at a press conference. 
The company has increased spending in its resorts division,
including a new theme park in Shanghai, a vacation project on
the Hawaiian island of Oahu and an expansion of California
Adventure in Anaheim. Investments in parks, resorts and other
properties totaled $2.56 billion through nine months of the
fiscal 2011, almost double the year earlier tally. 
&#8220;With this agreement, we have the extraordinary
opportunity to combine James&#8217;s talent and vision with the
imagination and expertise of Disney,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger said in a statement. 
Construction is scheduled to begin by 2013 and take five
years, said Disney, which licensed worldwide theme park rights
to &#8220;Avatar&#8221; from Cameron&#8217;s Lightstorm Entertainment and News
Corp.&#8217;s Twentieth Century Fox studio. 
The project is expected to cost about $400 million,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation who wasn&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. Cameron&#8217;s first &#8220;Avatar&#8221; film
sequel is scheduled for release in 2014. 
Disney fell 20 cents to $32.31 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 14 percent
this year. 
Box-Office Sales 
&#8220;Avatar&#8221; has collected $2.78 billion in worldwide
theatrical sales, the most of any film, according to Box Office
Mojo, an industry researcher. That eclipsed the previous record
of $1.84 billion for &#8220;Titanic,&#8221; also directed by Cameron. 
The film took place on a moon called Pandora, where humans
leading a mining effort were pitted against the native Na&#8217;vi
people. 
Theme parks accounted for 28 percent of Disney&#8217;s $38.1
billion in sales in the year ended in September 2010 and
contributed $1.32 billion in operating income, or 17 percent of
the total. 
Locations for other &#8220;Avatar&#8221; themed lands will be
determined by Disney and its international theme park partners,
the company said.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, is
offering a new software product that automates marketing and
speeds up sales to entice businesses to use its servers. 
If all of a company&#8217;s product and customer data is on IBM&#8217;s
servers, IBM&#8217;s analytics can help it sell more efficiently to
other businesses and consumers, the company said in a statement.
For example, sales campaigns could be based on where products
are geographically located and marketing campaigns could be
automatically generated based on the tone of a customer&#8217;s
Twitter post about a product. 
The new product, which is the next step in IBM&#8217;s Smarter
Commerce initiative, is part of a push to make $7 billion by
2015 from cloud computing, which allows a company to store and
access data from IBM&#8217;s servers, the company said. IBM, based in
Armonk, New York, has made &#8220;heavy investments&#8221; in the area,
including $2.5 billion in acquisitions and hundreds of millions
of dollars in research, said Craig Hayman, who oversees Smarter
Commerce as general manager of IBM Industry Solutions. 
The product &#8220;clarifies what these acquisitions in the fall
were about, and gives a clear example of one of the ways IBM
plans to pursue the cloud,&#8221; said Josh Olson, a Des Peres,
Missouri-based analyst for Edward Jones  Co. 
Acquisitions, Competitors 
Last year, IBM acquired Unica Corp. and Coremetrics, which
use analytics for online marketing, and Sterling Commerce, which
helps companies manage their relationships with partners and
suppliers. The company has said it plans to spend about $20
billion on acquisitions through 2015, after ending last year
with $10.7 billion in cash. 
Competitors Oracle Corp. (ORCL), SAP AG (SAP) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) have
not gone as far as IBM in using cloud technology for business
services, Gene Alvarez, a Stamford, Connecticut-based analyst
for Gartner Inc., said. IBM&#8217;s technology could attract
industries like health care and telecommunications by doing for
business-to-business transactions what Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) does on
its website, providing individualized marketing, he said. 
&#8220;We now have organizations that you never would have
thought of as e-commerce organizations, wanting a system like
that,&#8221; Alvarez said.

Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin
America&#8217;s largest Coke bottler, said it will account for half of
Mexico&#8217;s Coca-Cola sales after completing an agreement to buy
the bottling operations of Grupo Cimsa with new shares. 
The transaction, valued at 11 billion pesos ($837 million)
in stock and assumed debt, tops the acquisition of Mexican
bottler Grupo Tampico for 6.55 billion pesos of shares and 2.75
billion pesos of debt announced by the Mexico-City based company
in June. Tampico was Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s largest purchase since it
bought Panamerican Beverages Inc. for $3.6 billion in 2003. 
The acquisition announced yesterday of Cimsa, a closely
held company that sells Coca-Cola products mostly in the central
states of Morelos and Mexico, marks the second transaction this
year in which Coca-Cola Femsa offered shares instead of cash.
That&#8217;s designed to reduce resistance by family-owned companies
to sell out and exit the soft-drink business completely. 
The consolidation of Coke bottlers in Mexico &#8220;is likely to
continue as third-generation owners of smaller Coke bottling
operations swap their controlling equity stakes for minority
positions in a larger bottler,&#8221; Alan Alanis, a New York-based
analyst with JPMorgan Chase  Co., said in a report today. 
Coca-Cola Femsa rose 1.89 pesos, or 1.5 percent, to
124.87 pesos in Mexico City trading at 12:05 p.m. New York time.
The shares gained 20 percent this year before today. 
The agreement with Cuernavaca, Mexico-based Cimsa
&#8220;confirms that our company represents an attractive,
transparent and diversified investment vehicle for families that
have been in the beverage industry for a long time,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said in a statement. 
Mexico Consolidation 
The Cimsa and Tampico transactions follow the merger,
completed in June, of Mexico&#8217;s second-largest and third-largest
Coke bottlers to form Arca Continental SAB. There are now eight
family-owned Coca-Cola bottlers left in Mexico that may be
targets for Coca-Cola Femsa or Arca Continental, said Alanis,
the JPMorgan analyst. He rates Coca-Cola Femsa &#8220;neutral.&#8221; 
Shareholders of Cimsa, whose bottling operations are called
Corporacion de los Angeles SA, will receive 75.4 million newly
issued Coca-Cola Femsa shares valued at 118 pesos each, the
companies said yesterday. Coca-Cola Femsa will absorb net debt
of 2.1 billion pesos. 
Cost Savings 
Cimsa, which also has operations in the states of Guerrero
and Michoacan, is forecast to sell 159 million unit cases this
year, Coca-Cola Femsa said. A 13.2 percent stake in Promotora
Industrial Azucarera SA, a Mexican sugar company, is included in
the acquisition. Cimsa&#8217;s bottling unit is forecast to have 2011
revenue of 4.79 billion pesos and earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow
known as Ebitda -- of 1.1 billion pesos, Coca-Cola Femsa said. 
The 2011 estimated Ebitda margin for Cimsa is 23 percent,
higher than 20 percent for Coca-Cola Femsa in this year&#8217;s first
half, Luis Miranda, an analyst at the Mexican unit of Banco
Santander SA, wrote in a report today. He recommends buying
Coca-Cola Femsa shares. 
&#8220;We view this news as positive,&#8221; Miranda wrote. &#8220;The
operation is accretive from the operating side.&#8221; 
The company expects to achieve annual cost savings of more
than 260 million pesos from Cimsa&#8217;s bottling unit because it
touches Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s territories on three sides, Hector Trevino, the company&#8217;s chief financial officer, said in a
telephone interview. The amount of &#8220;synergies&#8221; allowed the
company to pay 10 times annual Ebitda, compared with 9.6 times
for Tampico, he said. Cost savings with Tampico will be in a
range of 180 million pesos to 270 million pesos, Trevino said. 
&#8216;Very Achievable&#8217; 
&#8220;We&#8217;re very sure that the 260 million pesos of annual
synergies is very achievable and perhaps a bit conservative
because of the proximity,&#8221; he said. 
After the issue of new shares for the acquisition, Cimsa
will own 3.8 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa. Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s stake
in the company will drop to 29.4 percent from 30.6 percent and
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB will have about 50 percent, down
from 51.9 percent. Tampico will hold 3.2 percent, and the
remaining 13.6 percent of the shares trade publicly. 
Cimsa operates three bottling plants and 18 distribution
centers and has 4,600 employees. 
Coca-Cola Femsa and Cimsa will seek shareholder approval in
special meetings. The transaction also requires approval from
Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency and Coca-Cola Co., according to Coca-
Cola Femsa&#8217;s statement. Coca-Cola Femsa will hold a conference
call tomorrow at 11 a.m. New York time to discuss the deal.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) offered to resolve a European Union investigation into
claims the company blocked competition from rival providers of
maintenance services for mainframe computers. 
The European Commission, the Brussels-based EU antitrust
regulator, today asked for comments on IBM&#8217;s commitments to
ensure the availability of spare parts and technical data. The
commission also closed a separate probe over IBM&#8217;s mainframe
computers after three competitors dropped complaints. 
The commission in 2010 opened investigations into Armonk,
New York-based IBM over possible conduct that may have blocked
competitors in mainframe software and maintenance contracts by
restricting access to parts. While IBM has shifted its focus
away from hardware toward its more profitable software and
services businesses, the mainframe operations have high gross
margins and help pull in revenue for other divisions. 
&#8220;It seems that IBM has taken a pragmatic approach and
determined that these commitments do not constitute a
significant issue for them and that it&#8217;s preferable to get a
settlement and put this probe behind them instead of fighting
till the end,&#8221; Christian Riis-Madsen, an antitrust partner in
Brussels at law firm O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, said by telephone. 
Non-Discriminatory Terms 
IBM offered commitments to resolve concerns it may have
imposed unreasonable conditions for supplying competing
mainframe maintenance-service providers in breach of EU
antitrust rules. IBM will ensure that third-party providers
receive technical information &#8220;under reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms,&#8221; the regulator said. 
The company said in an e-mailed statement that it
&#8220;welcomes&#8221; the commission&#8217;s decision &#8220;to close the
investigation of IBM&#8217;s mainframe and associated intellectual
property rights.&#8221; The company said it also looked forward to
providing the basis for the final resolution of the probe into
maintenance practices. 
IBM rose 1.8 percent to $176.30 in New York Stock Exchange
trading at 4:32 p.m. London time. 
&#8220;IBM does not agree with the commission&#8217;s preliminary
assessment&#8221; that the company may have abused &#8220;a dominant
position on the market for certain inputs necessarily required
for the maintenance of IBM mainframe hardware and software,&#8221;
the commission said in an EU document published today. 
Comments on IBM&#8217;s practices can be submitted to the
commission within a month. After that, the agency will either
make the commitments legally binding, without saying whether
there was an infringement, or start another round of market
testing if there are substantial changes to the remedies. 
Google Probe 
Google Inc. (GOOG) is another U.S. technology company under EU
scrutiny, with a focus on whether the world&#8217;s largest Web search
company has a dominant position that allows it to influence the
behavior of Internet users. 
EU Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week
that he is investigating whether Mountain View, California-based
Google is a gate keeper and able to influence the behavior of
Internet users. A string of antitrust probes against technology
companies by Almunia&#8217;s predecessor, Neelie Kroes, resulted in
1.68 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in fines against Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and a record 1.06 billion-euro penalty against Intel Corp. (INTC)
Intel has an appeal pending. 
IBM began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and
1950s and is now among the few companies selling the systems. 
&#8220;I commend IBM&#8217;s readiness to address our concerns about
fair competition in the market for large computers,&#8221; Almunia

A U.S. senator known on Wall Street
for taking on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has a new target -- a tax
benefit for derivatives traders that has also been derided by
Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and tax-code critic. 
The special congressional committee set up to cut $1.5
trillion from the federal deficit should consider taxing futures
and other derivatives at ordinary income rates, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, wrote in a letter to the panel.
The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that a similar
administration proposal could raise about $2.8 billion in
revenue. 
Futures, non-equity options and other types of derivatives
transactions are currently taxed at a top rate of 23 percent;
ordinary income is taxed up to 35 percent. 
The tax system &#8220;encourages bets on derivatives over direct
capital investments that are key to economic growth,&#8221; Levin
said in a Sept. 15 letter. &#8220;Closing this tax loophole would put
a stop to that market distortion.&#8221; 
Levin&#8217;s reputation for expertise in financial matters was
enhanced by his committee&#8217;s investigation of the 2008 credit
collapse, which was released in April and criticized Goldman
Sachs for its role.

Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the
state oil company, and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) are negotiating an
arbitration settlement of about $6 billion for assets seized by
President Hugo Chavez in 2007. 
Venezuela will pay any ruling issued by the World Bank&#8217;s
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or
ICSID, that is in Exxon&#8217;s favor, Carlos Escarra, the country&#8217;s
prosecutor general, told reporters today in Caracas. 
&#8220;They started asking for $20 billion,&#8221; Escarra said,
referring to Exxon&#8217;s original demands for compensation. &#8220;Talks
dropped to around $12 billion, and now they are around $6
billion. Venezuela has to pay -- we are clear on that. The
problem now is how much we will pay.&#8221; 
Chavez, since coming to power in 1999, has nationalized
parts of the oil, metals, cement and utilities industries. In
2007, he forced foreign oil producers into joint ventures as
minority partners. Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil and
ConocoPhillips (COP) rejected the revised terms and instead entered
into international arbitration. 
&#8220;Exxon Mobil does not comment on media reports,&#8221; said
Patrick McGinn, a Houston-based spokesman. Exxon, the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, reduced the amount it&#8217;s seeking for the
takeover of its Cerro Negro venture in the Orinoco heavy crude
belt to $7 billion from $12 billion last year, PDVSA said in a
bond prospectus at the time. 
&#8220;Venezuela is evaluating the amount that we would consider
to be a triumph,&#8221; Escarra said. 
Venezuela Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said the country
proposed paying Exxon $1 billion in compensation, Reuters
reported. Phone calls after business hours to PDVSA, as the
state oil company is known, were not returned. 
Arbitration Results 
&#8220;As the figure for the settlement has been coming down
with the passage of time, that is good news for the sovereign
and PDVSA,&#8221; Boris Segura, a Latin America strategist with
Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York, said today in
an interview from New York. &#8220;But most importantly, Mr. Escarra
was unequivocal in saying that Venezuela will abide by the
results of the arbitration.&#8221; 
The Washington-based ICSID ruled on June 10 that it has
jurisdiction over any disputes after Feb. 21, 2006, for the
Cerro Negro project, according to documents posted on the
agency&#8217;s website. PDVSA previously argued that the matter should
be resolved in Venezuelan courts. 
The Cerro Negro joint venture refined tar-like crude into
synthetic oil from wells in the Orinoco belt. 
Regional Arbitration 
Exxon initially won an order in the U.K. blocking PDVSA
from selling $12 billion of assets anywhere in the world. The
order was overturned by a U.K. court in March 2009. 
Escarra, who was sworn into office as state prosecutor on
Aug. 30, said he previously advised Chavez to withdraw Venezuela
from the World Bank investment dispute unit when he was a
lawmaker in Venezuela&#8217;s National Assembly. 
&#8220;In my opinion, we should leave. Ecuador and Bolivia have
already pulled out, and Argentina is pushing for a Latin
American arbitration court,&#8221; Escarra said. &#8220;But as the
prosecutor, I follow instructions from Chavez.&#8221; 
Exxon fell 2.8 percent to close at $71.97 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. 
The extra yield investors demand to own Venezuelan
government bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 17 basis
points, 0.17 percentage point, to 1,315 basis points today at
5:21 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan  Chase Co.&#8217;s
EMBI+. 
Yields on the government&#8217;s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds
maturing in 2027 rose 31 basis points to 14.84 percent. The
price fell 1.4 cents on the dollar to 66.17 cents. 
&#8220;As risky assets worldwide were under pressure today,
don&#8217;t expect a positive day for Venezuelan assets, not even with
this news,&#8221; Segura said.

Morgan Stanley plans to alter the
way it brings orders together in dark pools, trying to encourage
bigger trades for institutional customers after a three-year
decline in the number of shares per transaction industrywide. 
The bank, which operates venues in the U.S., Europe, Hong
Kong, Japan and Australia that match buyers and sellers without
showing bids and offers, will give priority to larger orders at
a specified price instead of those that arrived first, Bill Neuberger, co-head of Morgan Stanley Electronic Trading, said in
a phone interview. MS POOL, which is adopting a model similar to
one used by a Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) exchange, is among the first
dark pools to offer the protocol in the U.S. 
&#8220;We want to reward size and de-emphasize speed,&#8221;
Neuberger said. MS POOL had the second-smallest average trade
size in July among venues tracked by Rosenblatt Securities Inc.
They averaged 209 shares in August, Neuberger said. &#8220;Fewer 100-
share prints in dark pools may be a good thing,&#8221; he said. 
Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s changes are part of an effort to portray
its venues as places where sophisticated users employing high-
frequency strategies have less influence. Larger trade sizes may
connote less interaction with proprietary trading firms, whose
ability to sniff out and exploit the intentions of investors was
one of the reasons dark pools gained popularity in the latter
half of the last decade. 
Getting Smaller 
Trades in most dark pools average 200 shares to 300 shares,
down from 300 shares to 400 shares in 2008 and 2009, Justin Schack, managing director for market structure analysis at
Rosenblatt Securities, a New York-based broker that analyzes
dark pool volume and trends, said in a phone interview. The
decline may have resulted from more high-frequency penetration
in venues that don&#8217;t display quotes, increased stock volatility,
or algorithms reacting to trades they receive, he said. 
U.S. dark pools followed by Rosenblatt accounted for 12.3
percent of U.S. volume in July, compared with 10.9 percent a
year earlier. There are about 40 U.S. pools, with data from the
largest included in Rosenblatt&#8217;s tally. A category of hidden
orders on equity exchanges such as Nasdaq Stock Market and the
New York Stock Exchange totaled 3.4 percent. More than 9 percent
of volume on the main exchange run by Lenexa, Kansas-based Bats
Global Markets was in dark or hidden orders, Rosenblatt said. 
Market Share 
MS POOL traded 61 million shares daily on average last
month, or 0.6 percent of U.S. equity volume, according to data
compiled by Morgan Stanley and Bloomberg. The broker had 0.7
percent of volume in July, Rosenblatt data showed. Credit Suisse
Group AG&#8217;s Crossfinder, the largest dark pool, had 2.2 percent
of U.S. volume, followed by New York-based Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)&#8217;s Sigma X with 1.5 percent. Zurich-based Credit Suisse&#8217;s
venue had the smallest average trade size in July, with 188
shares, according to Rosenblatt data. 
U.S. stock exchanges match orders submitted to them against
incoming buy and sell requests based on when they were received,
a system called price-time priority. Among markets run by larger
exchange operators, only the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE
Amex allow certain firms -- brokers working on the exchange&#8217;s
floor and so-called designated market makers -- to jump ahead
and execute alongside those next in line to trade. Nasdaq OMX
PSX, which relies on price-size priority, began last year. 
Order Size 
Existing orders at a given price in MS POOL will trade
based on the number of shares they initially represented. If a
firm wants to buy 1,000 shares and another subsequently bid for
5,000 shares, the second one would move ahead of the 1,000-share
order. Even if smaller orders trade against the 5,000 shares and
500 shares remained, the order retains its priority because it
initially was bigger, Neuberger said from New York. 
Nasdaq OMX PSX has a different version of price-size
priority. Existing orders trade based on the number of shares
they represent, with incoming orders distributed proportionally.
In the last example, an incoming order for 600 shares would
trade 500 shares against the 5,000-share bid and 100 against the
smaller one. Nasdaq OMX chose this method to avoid hurting the
senders of smaller orders that are publicly displayed who might
otherwise not send bids or offers. 
Sapna Patel, head of market structure and liquidity
strategy for the Americas for Morgan Stanley, said a customer in
a dark pool isn&#8217;t revealing his intentions because bids and
offers aren&#8217;t public. &#8220;Since it&#8217;s a different model,&#8221; the
trader may opt to supply larger orders, she said. 
The new rules are expected to become effective in MS POOL
in the U.S. and Europe next week and in Asia later this year,
she said. 
Customer Curiosity 
Investment Technology Group Inc.&#8217;s Posit dark pool uses
price-size priority to match buy and sell orders, according to
J.T. Farley, a spokesman. Other dark pools employ versions of
the protocol. Bids Trading LP gives users a choice about how to
execute their trade requests, Tim Mahoney, chief executive
officer of the dark pool operator, wrote in an e-mail. Both
companies are in New York. 
Whit Conary, chief executive officer of Level ATS, a
Boston-based dark pool operator, said investors have asked
venues that don&#8217;t display quotes for more information about what
kind of traders are on their system, what kind of orders are
available and how rules on the platforms work. The information
helps users make better decisions about where they want to send
orders, he said. More brokers are also reporting trading volume
to Rosenblatt to increase transparency in the market. Level
traded almost 49 million shares in July, Rosenblatt data showed. 
&#8216;Electronic Way&#8217; 
&#8220;More broker-dealers are finding it&#8217;s efficient to have an
electronic way to match internal sources of order flow,&#8221; Conary
said in a phone interview. The result is that more dark pools
are finding customers, he said. 
Morgan Stanley introduced MS POOL in the U.S. in 2006 and
in Europe in 2008. It runs another network called MS Trajectory
Cross in countries where MS POOL operates. That system matches
pieces of bigger algorithmic orders according to the stock&#8217;s
average price weighted by volume over a period of time. 
Morgan Stanley hasn&#8217;t allowed some types of trading that
other dark pools encourage to attract orders. The firm doesn&#8217;t
let traders to submit orders that must be executed immediately
or canceled. It doesn&#8217;t send messages called indications of
interest to other pools or venues to solicit orders. Users must
also keep orders in MS POOL for at least a second before
withdrawing them -- a long time for many high-frequency traders.
That discourages short-term players, Neuberger said. 
Minimum-Share Requirements 
Some customers are asking whether dark pools aggregate
orders from users to get around minimum-share size requirements
that some investors place on orders. Such a restriction might be
sought to avoid trading against automated firms that prefer 100-
share transactions. 
Schack said he asked dark pools several months ago to count
orders aggregated to meet a minimum-share size imposed by the
counterparty as separate trades in their reporting. &#8220;Bulking&#8221;
inflates the average trade size, which some investors use to
assess the type of liquidity in a venue, he said. 
Conary said Level, which is used by about 185 broker-dealer
customers, lets members choose whether to allow minimum-share
sizes they impose to be met by multiple orders. 
Changes at MS POOL come as regulators in Canada and Europe
are considering rules to limit trading in dark pools that don&#8217;t
give investors better prices or larger executions than what&#8217;s
publicly available. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has raised the prospect of a similar restriction,
called a trade-at rule, many institutional investors and retail
brokers have said they wouldn&#8217;t support that since it would hurt
their transactions. 
Trade Transparency 
Separately, the SEC in October 2009 proposed rules that
would increase transparency for trades in dark pools and reduce
the amount of daily volume in a company&#8217;s shares that can be
executed on the systems before prices must be made public. The
agency hasn&#8217;t acted on that proposal, in part because of dozens
of new rules it has had to write related to the Dodd-Frank Act,
the financial overhaul enacted in July 2010. 
&#8220;The SEC may be more likely to address the October 2009
proposal first,&#8221; Schack said. &#8220;The trade-at rule is incredibly
controversial. It has many organized, vocal opponents and very
few organized and vocal supporters.&#8221;

     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, closed below $100 for the
first time since March 2009 as financial stocks fell amid
concerns about the European debt crisis. 
The shares fell $4.75, or 4.6 percent, to $97.86 at 4:03
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest
closing price since March 20, 2009. The stock dropped briefly
below $100 earlier this month before climbing back above $100 by
the end of the trading session. Goldman Sachs has declined 42
percent this year. 
Goldman Sachs fell amid an overall decline in U.S.
financial stocks, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index dropping 4.9 percent. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service lowered
credit ratings on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
and reduced Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s short-term rating today. 
&#8220;Most of it is still Europe and the uncertainty about what
the resolution of the sovereign debt problems will be,&#8221; said
David Hilder, an analyst at New York-based Susquehanna Financial
Group. &#8220;The Moody&#8217;s downgrades certainly didn&#8217;t help.&#8221; Hilder
has a &#8220;positive&#8221; rating on Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and
Wells Fargo and a &#8220;neutral&#8221; on Citigroup. 
Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
sustained the biggest decline in the SP 500 Financials Index as
the stock fell $1.30, or 8.6 percent, to $13.82.

Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) and
Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), two U.S. producers of coal used in
steelmaking, tumbled after they respectively cut output and
sales forecasts because of mining disruptions. 
Shares of Alpha fell $4.62, or 17 percent, to $22.30 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Walter
declined $8.75, or 12 percent, to $66.25. 
Alpha&#8217;s full-year production will be 102.5 million to 109.5
million tons, compared with a previous prediction of 104 million
to 112 million tons, the Abingdon, Virginia-based company said
today in a statement. Alpha cited &#8220;unexpectedly curtailed
customer activity&#8221; in Asia and lower-than-expected output from
some mines. 
Walter&#8217;s second-half sales will be &#8220;similar&#8221; to the 5.2
million metric tons recorded for the first half, the Birmingham,
Alabama-based company said in a statement. Its previous forecast
for second-half sales was 5.9 million tons. 
Alpha and Walter are both trying to integrate mines bought
earlier this year in separate acquisitions. Alpha bought Massey
Energy Co. for $7.1 billion in June and said today output from
some Central Appalachian Massey mines has disappointed. Walter
purchased Western Coal Corp. for C$5.3 billion ($5.31 billion)
in April, giving it production in British Columbia. Rainfall in
the Canadian province has curbed output, Walter said today. 
&#8216;Difficult&#8217; Geology 
Walter said third-quarter earnings will be $1 to $1.16 a
share. The average of 15 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for $3.24. Walter forecast fourth-quarter earnings
of $2.63 to $2.95 a share. The average from the analysts&#8217;
estimates was for $3.17. 
The company said it&#8217;s dealing with &#8220;difficult&#8221; geology at
its Mine Number 7 in Alabama. 
&#8220;It is possible these challenges could tempt a large
company to look to buy Walter&#8217;s world-class assets &#8216;&#8216;on the
cheap,&#8217;&#8217; Jeremy Sussman and Lucas Pipes, analysts at Brean
Murray Carret  Co. in New York, said in a note today. They
maintained their &#8216;&#8216;hold&#8217;&#8217; rating for Walter and &#8216;&#8216;buy&#8217;&#8217;
recommendation for &#8216;&#8216;Alpha.&#8217;&#8217; 
Walter jumped 21 percent on Sept. 7 after the London-based
Times said Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. may be
considering takeover bids. Walter investor Audley Capital
Advisors LLP said in July that the company should explore a
sale. 
The company said Sept. 12 it appointed Walter J. Scheller
III as chief executive. Keith Calder resigned as CEO on June 30,

When Carol Perkins arrives at the
office, she checks e-mails, organizes files, and calls
corporations as part of a fund-raising effort. 
Perkins, 60, works at the Urban League of Essex County in
New Jersey through a U.S. senior-citizen jobs program that used
to pay for an average of 20 hours a week of training and work.
In April, Congress sliced tens of millions of dollars in
funding, and Perkins&#8217; schedule was cut by at least half --
forcing her to turn to welfare to pay the rent after her monthly
take home fell more than $100. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m devastated,&#8221; said Perkins, of Montclair, New Jersey,
who said her previous administrative support jobs at New York-
based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bear Stearns Cos. were
eliminated. &#8220;We need jobs. It&#8217;s as if they have forgotten about
us seniors and we&#8217;ll wind up out on the street. I just want to
work.&#8221; 
The funding cut illustrates the conflict between the need
to put people back to work and the mandate of a 12-member
congressional supercommittee to cut $1.5 trillion from the
deficit. Scaling back the job training for U.S. seniors will
mean fewer work opportunities as President Barack Obama pushes a
job stimulus plan, unveiled Sept. 8, aimed at easing
unemployment that has been 9 percent or higher for five straight
months. 
It also shows how cuts to federal spending can exacerbate
the jobless situation and shift seniors into other public
assistance programs, negating some of the savings, according to
groups that help run the training. Organizations said they&#8217;ve
reduced paid training, work hours, and in some cases are turning
away seniors seeking the job-based training. 
Homeless Seniors 
Many in the program, which is aimed at unemployed, low-
income people who are 55 or older, need the paid training and
work: Almost 40 percent were homeless or at risk of being
homeless in 2009, according to the Labor Department. 
The unemployment rate for people age 55 and older is at
levels not seen since at least 1948, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. It peaked at 7.3 percent in 2010 and was at
6.6 percent in August. 
In 2000, the seniors&#8217; rate was below 3 percent. 
Older Americans are more likely than any other age group to
remain out of work for 99 weeks or more, according to a December
2010 report by the Congressional Research Service, which
provides policy and legal analysis to lawmakers. 
45% Funding Cut 
Funding for the Senior Community Service Employment Program
was cut 45 percent, to about $450 million for the year that ends
June 2012, from $825 million approved in 2010, under an April
budget deal forged by Congress and Obama. The previous year
included $225 million from federal Recovery Act money, and
excluding that appropriation the drop was 25 percent, according
to the Labor Department. 
The Obama administration in proposing the cut found
&#8220;little evidence&#8221; that spending on seniors&#8217; job training
&#8220;successfully promotes unsubsidized employment or provides
cost-effective community service.&#8221; 
Cutting the program is necessary as the government seeks to
close the deficit, Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against
Government Waste, a Washington-based advocacy group, said in an
interview. 
&#8220;There are ways to help people find work without spending
a lot of money,&#8221; Schatz said. &#8220;The objective has to be to help
as many as possible with the least cost.&#8221; 
Program Merits 
Shrinking the seniors jobs program shows how efforts to
curb the deficit by slashing spending can exacerbate the jobless
situation, said Lita Levine Kleger, a spokeswoman for Arlington,
Virginia-based Experience Works Inc., which helps low-income
seniors with employment. 
&#8220;I understand there&#8217;s this conversation in Congress about
making tough choices, but there has to be some discussion on the
merits of what actually works,&#8221; Levine Kleger said in an
interview. &#8220;This program gets people jobs.&#8221; 
Experience Works cut about 140 staff positions and closed a
customer-service center in Waco, Texas, Levine Kleger said.
They&#8217;re turning away interested applicants, she said. 
Participants in the U.S. program generally earn minimum
wage and work an average of 20 hours a week. The goal is to help
participants get paying jobs, according to the Labor Department. 
&#8216;Unnecessary Spending&#8217; 
Cutting the training and work effort makes little fiscal
sense, according to lawmakers such as U.S. Representative
Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat. 
&#8220;If you take away this, what other problems are you
creating?&#8221; Rangel said in an interview. &#8220;What are seniors
supposed to do if they can&#8217;t find a job and are on a limited
income? When you talk about taking away money from seniors who
are fragile economically, that has an effect. I wish when people
talked about spending, they&#8217;d talk about cutting unnecessary
spending.&#8221; 
Republican Representative Michael Simpson of Idaho, a House
Appropriations committee member who sits on three panels, said
the senior training service is an employment initiative that
simply fell victim to the deficit-reduction drive. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody is going to be pleased,&#8221; Simpson
said in an interview. &#8220;The reality is that as we try to reduce
spending, it&#8217;s taken a larger budget reduction.&#8221; 
To qualify, a seniors&#8217; income must be 125 percent of
federal poverty guidelines, or $13,613 a year for a family of
one, in most states. 
Participation is expected to fall to 70,537 people in the
year ending June 30, 2012, according to an agency report. That&#8217;s
down almost half from 130,223 the agency estimated for 2010. 
&#8216;It&#8217;s Absurd&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s absurd,&#8221; Marc Morial, chief executive officer of
the National Urban League Inc., a New York-based civil rights
group that focuses on economic issues, said in an interview.
&#8220;Obama is talking about jobs, and this is a jobs program. The
best deficit reduction program is a jobs program.&#8221; 
Cutting the funds also worsens the U.S. deficit as seniors
have less disposable income to spend, pay less in taxes, and
rely more on government aid such as food stamps, he said. 
Valerie Farrer, 77, of Verona, Wisconsin, in September 2009
qualified for the aid, working in the town library and
eventually teaching jobs skills at Experience Works. 
Her schedule has been scaled back to 22 hours a week from
28 hours following the budget cuts, she said, and her income has
dropped $200 a month. Farrer said she doesn&#8217;t turn on the air
conditioner, has cut back on groceries and limits herself to
necessities to help save money. 
She gets some help from Social Security. That income is
drained on such expenses as supplemental Medicare insurance and
car insurance, she said. 
&#8216;It&#8217;s Devastating&#8217; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s devastating when the hours are cut,&#8221; Farrer said in
an interview. &#8220;You feel as though you&#8217;re trapped. With the
program, there&#8217;s a reason to get up every day. Then the hours
are cut and it turns back into depression.&#8221; 
Fallout is being felt at the Urban League of Essex County
in Newark, New Jersey, which lost about $1.2 million in funding
on June 30, Vann Holland, director of workforce operations, said
in an interview. That left enough money to help 132
participants, said Holland, not enough for the 500 seniors
currently being aided. To help stretch dollars, training hours
were reduced to 10 hours from 20 hours a week, he said. 
&#8220;We may run out of money end of December or January,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We may have to end the program.&#8221; 
The National Caucus and Center on Black Aged Inc. in
Washington, which assists low-income seniors, fired nine full-
time staffers, and the 1,800 participants in D.C. and eight
states now train 15 hours a week, down from 20 hours, Karyne
Jones, chief executive officer, said in an interview. 
Food Stamps 
&#8220;Some participants have lost their apartments or have gone
to agencies to get food stamps,&#8221; Adrienne Wiggins, the
program&#8217;s coordinator for the group, said an interview. 
Barbara Oliphant, 65, of Washington, earned about $660 a
month for 20 hours of training as a job counselor through the
program. With a reduction in hours, she said in an interview
that she now gets about $500 for 15 hours. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s had a big impact,&#8221; said Oliphant, who lives with
her son and pays for utilities and her groceries. &#8220;With the
cutbacks, it&#8217;s just enough to get by. It&#8217;s very stressful.&#8221; 
For Perkins, the reduced training hours have left her
worried about paying her rent, she said. She no longer buys
vision contacts and she scrimps on groceries. Some weeks she
skips doing her laundry, she said. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what Congress is doing,&#8221; Perkins said
in an interview. &#8220;You&#8217;re older now but you still have skills.
This program gives you hope.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said
investors should keep buying commodities because &#8220;supply
disappointments&#8221; will support prices even as the sovereign-debt
crisis and slowing economies threaten demand. 
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index of 24
raw materials will climb 20 percent in the next 12 months, said
Jeffrey Currie, Goldman&#8217;s London-based head of commodity
research. Copper will jump 43 percent to a record $11,000 a
metric ton, while crude oil in New York surges 62 percent to
$131 a barrel, he forecast. The bank correctly advised investors
to sell oil and copper in April and turned more bullish the
following month as metals and energy rebounded. 
Commodities erased their gains for the year today, leaving
the SP GSCI spot index down 3.9 percent in 2011, after the
Federal Reserve said there are &#8220;significant downside risks&#8221; to
the economic outlook. The gauge has still jumped 31 percent in
the past two years, outperforming global equities and
Treasuries, as adverse weather threatened global crops and
China&#8217;s demand for copper, cotton and soybeans surged. 
&#8220;Despite the recent macroeconomic uncertainty, commodity
prices have been remarkably resilient,&#8221; Currie said in a report
today. &#8220;Driving this resiliency and substantially less
volatility has been continued evidence of a relatively stronger
fundamental picture due to a combination of supply
disappointments and significant demand&#8221; from emerging markets. 
The SP GSCI spot index fell 4.9 percent to 607.49 at 3:57
p.m. in New York, bringing the gauge down more than 20 percent
from this year&#8217;s high and heading for a so-called bear market. 
Hedge Funds 
In the week ended Sept. 13, hedge funds and other money
managers cut their bullish bets on raw materials for the time in
five weeks, U.S. government data show. Investors placed 29
percent less cash in commodity exchange-traded products in the
first seven months of the year, Barclays Capital said on Sept.
14. Societe Generale SA&#8217;s global asset-allocation team went
&#8220;underweight&#8221; on commodities last week, saying that the asset
class is in the &#8220;danger zone.&#8221; 
&#8220;We believe that a global recession and/or financial
crisis would be required to derail our constructive commodity
views,&#8221; Currie said. &#8220;We continue to recommend an overweight
positioning in commodities.&#8221; 
Copper Shortage 
In the six months ended in June, copper supplies trailed
demand by 130,000 tons, the International Copper Study Group
said yesterday. The most-expensive drought in Texas history has
parched pastures, prompting ranchers to cull the most breeding
cows ever and driving livestock prices to a record. The hottest
July since 1955 in the U.S. Midwest eroded corn yields and will
leave inventories before next year&#8217;s harvest at the lowest level
since 1996 as a percentage of consumption, government data show. 
Energy commodities in the GSCI Enhanced Index will advance
almost 26 percent in the next 12 months, and industrial metals
will jump 23 percent, Goldman said. Agriculture will climb 4.8
percent and precious metals by 4 percent, according to the
report. The bank lowered its three-month forecast for New York
oil by 15 percent to $97.50 a barrel. 
&#8220;We believe that the recent sell-off presents a relatively
good opportunity for longer-dated purchases,&#8221; Currie said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued mutual
fund firm American Century Cos. over claims it was shortchanged
in an $848 million optioned-share sale to Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce. 
American Century failed to disclose material information
regarding the sale and the shares weren&#8217;t purchased at their
fair market value, lawyers for JPMorgan said in a public version
of the complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court. The
complaint was initially filed under seal. 
&#8220;The allegation that American Century breached an option
agreement is without merit and the edited complaint filed in
Delaware yesterday is an inaccurate and incomplete
representation of the facts,&#8221; American Century said in a
statement e-mailed by Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the firm. 
CIBC, Canada&#8217;s fifth-largest bank, announced in July that
it agreed to buy a 41 percent stake in American Century from
JPMorgan. The cash acquisition is the third-largest purchase by
the Toronto-based bank. 
JPMorgan purchased a roughly 45 percent interest in Kansas
City, Missouri-based American Century for about $900 million in
January 1998, according to the complaint. Under a 2009 option
agreement between American and JPMorgan, American could buy all
of the shares JPMorgan owned in the firm and resell them to a
third party. 
JPMorgan, based in New York, said in its complaint that it
learned of the share sale through a public announcement. The
transaction was completed on Aug. 31. 
Withheld Information 
&#8220;American Century improperly withheld information
regarding the CIBC stock sale from JPMorgan&#8217;s director designee
on American Century&#8217;s board,&#8221; lawyers for the bank said in the
redacted complaint. 
American Century &#8220;understated its financial position&#8221; to
an independent adviser, causing a report that served as the
basis for the share repurchase to understate the firm&#8217;s fair
market value, according to the complaint. 
JPMorgan is seeking a trial to determine unspecified
damages. 
American Century accused JPMorgan of filing the complaint
as a &#8220;tactical reaction to an adverse result&#8221; in another
matter recently concluded in favor of the firm. Doyle declined
to identify that matter. 
&#8220;The heavily edited complaint removes information that
reflects negatively on JPMorgan&#8217;s conduct in the other matter,&#8221;
American Century said in the statement. &#8220;We believe that the
information JPM removed from the complaint is not confidential
and we will soon be taking appropriate action to have the
redacted information unsealed.&#8221; 
The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. American Century
Companies Inc., CA6875, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the

Gregg Lemkau to become head of mergers and acquisitions in
Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, a newly created position. 
Lemkau, 42, who has been co-head of technology, media, and
telecommunications since 2008, will keep responsibilities for
many of his current clients, the New York-based bank said in an
internal memorandum to employees obtained by Bloomberg News.
Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
confirmed the contents of the memo. 
Lemkau, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1992, became a partner
in 2002. He previously worked as chief operating officer of the
investment banking division. He will join a global mergers team
overseen by co-heads Yoel Zaoui and Gene T. Sykes, with Richard Campbell-Breeden as head of mergers for Asia outside Japan and
Dusty Philip and Michael Carr as co-heads for the Americas. 
Goldman Sachs has advised on 208 announced transactions for
a total value of $405 billion so far this year, second only to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $428 billion, according to data compiled

     Sept. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will
probably report a third-quarter loss as market tumult prevents
the bank from generating a profit for only the second time in 12
years as a public company, Barclays Capital analysts estimated. 
Goldman Sachs may lose 35 cents a share in the three months
ended Sept. 30, down from a prior estimate of $2.40 in earnings
per share, the analysts, led by Roger Freeman, said in a note to
clients today. They cut their earnings-per-share estimate for
Morgan Stanley to 12 cents from 43 cents. 
Declines in asset prices will cause losses on some of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s principal investments, which include stakes in
companies and real estate, the analysts wrote. Trading revenue
and investment banking fees have also been reduced amid falling
equity and credit markets and concerns that the European
sovereign debt crisis is worsening. 
&#8220;Nearly every line is being marked down from our prior
forecasts, which were not particularly optimistic to begin
with,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;Some revenue lines are being
reduced by more than half and, due to the equity- and debt-
market decline, we are now incorporating large principal
investment losses.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs was the most profitable U.S. securities firm
in Wall Street history before converting to a bank in September
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. The fourth quarter of 2008 was the only time since
Goldman Sachs went public in 1999 that the firm has reported a
quarterly loss. Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second-biggest
securities firm after Goldman Sachs, also converted to a bank in
2008 and has expanded its retail brokerage business. 
Stocks Fall 
Goldman Sachs fell $5.28, or 5.4 percent, to $92.58, at
12:08 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
lowest level since March 2009. Morgan Stanley fell $1.16, or 8.4
percent, to $12.66, the lowest level since December 2008. 
The two companies are dropping amid an overall decline in
U.S. financial stocks, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index declining 3.4 percent. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service yesterday
lowered long-term credit ratings on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and reduced Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s short-term
rating. 
Barclays Capital is the investment-banking unit of Barclays
Plc (BARC), Britain&#8217;s second-largest bank by assets.

An ex-Galleon Group LLC trader and
expert-networking consultant were sentenced yesterday to 10
years and four years in prison for their roles in a nationwide
insider-trading scandal, just three weeks before Raj Rajaratnam,
the man at the center of the investigation, is to learn his
fate. 
Zvi Goffer, the trader, and Winifred Jiau, who worked for
Primary Global Research LLC, were convicted in June in separate
Manhattan federal court trials. Jiau was sentenced yesterday to
four years after the government asked for as long as 10 years.
Goffer received a 10-year term following a U.S. request that he
serve almost 13 years. 
Rajaratnam, 54, co-founder of Galleon, was found guilty in
May of directing the largest hedge-fund insider-trading ring. He
should be given a prison term of as long as 24 1/2 years when
sentenced, prosecutors said. His sentence was postponed
yesterday from Sept. 27 to Oct. 13. 
The sentences for Goffer and Jiau are more severe than in
typical insider-trading cases where a defendant gets and trades
on information only once, said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor
at Columbia Law School in New York. 
&#8220;These were professionals engaging in this as their
regular course of business,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;They went about it
systematically.&#8221; 
Dozens of people have been charged with participating in
overlapping insider-trading rings by the office of U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The Goffer and Rajaratnam trials
featured phone conversations secretly recorded by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The two, along with Jiau, were
convicted based partly on the testimony of co-conspirators
cooperating with prosecutors. 
Jurors at Jiau&#8217;s trial saw instant electronic messages that
a hedge fund analyst sent his boss while they were on the phone
with her. The analyst also recorded the calls. 
Goffer, who co-founded Incremental Capital LLC after he was
fired from Galleon in 2008, was convicted of all 14 criminal
counts against him. Goffer&#8217;s brother, Emanuel, and Michael
Kimelman were convicted at the same trial. Prosecutors said Zvi
Goffer headed a ring that made more than $10 million trading in
3Com Corp., Axcan Pharma Inc., Kronos Inc. and Hilton Hotels
Corp. based on information misappropriated by two lawyers. 
Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan
to send Goffer to prison for as long as 12 years and seven
months. 
Goffer, 34, claimed he&#8217;s a changed man who deserves a
lesser sentence. 
Jiau, 43, of Fremont, California, was convicted of one
count each of conspiracy and securities fraud. A jury found her
guilty of passing earnings and other information about Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to Noah Freeman, a
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager, and Samir
Barai, founder of New York-based Barai Capital Management LP. 
Prosecutors argued Jiau should get eight to 10 years in
prison in papers filed with U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff.
Jiau&#8217;s lawyers downplayed her role in the chain of inside-traders and called the government&#8217;s suggested sentence
&#8220;draconian.&#8221; 
&#8220;If Ms. Jiau was at the &#8216;heart&#8217; of anything in this case,
it was of the gang that couldn&#8217;t shoot straight,&#8221; they said. 
The cases are U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, and U.S. v.
Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
ATT Says It Wants Trial of U.S. Suit to Block T-Mobile Deal 
ATT Inc. (T) is eager for a trial of the U.S. Justice
Department&#8217;s lawsuit challenging its proposed acquisition of
wireless carrier T-Mobile USA Inc., a lawyer for the company
said. 
There was no talk of settlement yesterday in federal court
in Washington as Mark Hansen, an attorney for ATT, told U.S.
District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle that the company wants to get
to trial as quickly as possible. Huvelle, who had earlier told
the parties to come prepared to discuss settlement prospects,
set a trial date for Feb. 13. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re seeking a prompt trial because we&#8217;re very
interested in closing this transaction,&#8221; Hansen, of Kellogg,
Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans  Figel PLLC in Washington, said
during the hour-long hearing. &#8220;We need to have the cloud of
uncertainty removed. We&#8217;re already a month beyond where we want
to be.&#8221; 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. Last week, seven states joined the government&#8217;s
case seeking to stop the $39 billion deal. 
ATT is still &#8220;hopeful&#8221; it can address the Justice
Department&#8217;s antitrust concerns and reach a settlement, Michael
Balmoris, an ATT spokesman, said in an e-mail after the
hearing. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington).

Servier Founder Charged in Deaths Granted 4 Million-Euro Bail 
Jacques Servier, chairman of France&#8217;s second-largest
drugmaker, must post bail of 4 million euros ($5.51 million) and
his freedom may be restricted as he faces charges that he helped
hide the risks of a drug suspected of causing the deaths of as
many as 2,000 people. 
Servier and five affiliated companies of Laboratoires
Servier, which he founded, were charged yesterday by French
magistrates, the company said in a statement. Servier must
provide a financial guarantee of 6 million euros by Dec. 15,
according to the release. 
Servier, 89, was charged with involuntary manslaughter,
aggravated deception and fraud, the newspaper Le Monde reported,
citing his lawyer. The company remains innocent until proven
guilty and will &#8220;finally be able to defend itself in a judicial
setting,&#8221; it said in the statement. 
Mediator, the diabetes drug at the root of the case, was
sold in France for 33 years until it was withdrawn in November
2009 on safety concerns. It was widely used as an appetite
suppressant. 
JPMorgan, Citigroup Seek Dismissal of Thornburg Lawsuit 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C) and other banks asked
a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by defunct Thornburg Mortgage Inc.,
saying the complaint didn&#8217;t adequately show that fraud occurred. 
Trustee Joel Sher sued the banks for $2 billion in April,
alleging they helped push Thornburg, now called TMST Inc., into
a &#8220;free-fall&#8221; bankruptcy. Making &#8220;unjustified&#8221; margin calls,
the banks extracted more than $700 million of margin and
interest payments from Thornburg, then sold their collateral and
left the company to file for Chapter 11 protection during the
credit crisis in May 2009, Sher claimed. 
The banks, including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc and UBS AG (UBSN), or their affiliates, were trading
partners of Thornburg&#8217;s in repurchase and swap transactions used
to finance its mortgage business, the banks said in a Sept. 20
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore. Under the repo
agreements, they could make margin calls at any time if the
counterparty had a margin deficit, they said. 
Sher didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call seeking comment
on the banks&#8217; filing. He has updated the suit since it was
initially filed. 
JPMorgan was named in the TMST suit because it bought
assets from Bear Stearns Cos., a lender to Thornburg. Sher filed
at least eight lawsuits from April 28 to April 30, seeking money
from Barclays Plc (BARC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and other companies. 
The bankruptcy case is Thornburg Mortgage Inc., 09-17787,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore). 
UBS Moved Executive in FSA Risk-Management Case to Zurich 
A UBS AG executive accused of risk-management failures and
facing a potential fine by the U.K. finance regulator was moved
as early as 2008 from London to Zurich by Switzerland&#8217;s biggest
bank. 
John Pottage, the former chief executive officer of UBS&#8217;s
wealth-management division in London, will challenge the
Financial Services Authority at a court hearing in November over
its attempt to fine him for not ensuring the unit had controls
to prevent unauthorized trades that began in 2006, according to
three people familiar with the case. He now works in risk
management, two people with knowledge of his role said. 
The FSA fined UBS 8 million pounds ($12.5 million) in 2009,
at the time the third-largest penalty imposed by the regulator,
for failing to prevent employees in the international wealth-management business from making as many as 50 unauthorized
trades a day with funds from at least 39 customer accounts. The
case is an example of UBS failing to police errant trading in
London years before the bank said this week it lost $2.3 billion
from unauthorized trades. 
&#8220;Now that the machine has got going, every single bad
thing is going to come out,&#8221; said Fred Ponzo, a capital markets
adviser at Greyspark Partners in London. 
Pottage was authorized by the FSA until Dec. 15, 2008,
according to the watchdog&#8217;s website. He had authorization for
roles including chief executive, significant management,
director, apportionment and oversight, investment adviser and
insurance mediator. 
Pottage declined to comment when reached at a UBS number in
Zurich. Yves Kaufmann, a UBS spokesman in Zurich, also declined
to comment. 
Chris Hamilton, an FSA spokesman, declined to comment.
Tobias Lux, a spokesman at the Swiss regulator, declined to
comment on the case. Pottage&#8217;s lawyer, John Fordham, also
declined to comment.

Madoff Trustee Loses Bid to Quash Request for Rehearing 
The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm lost a bid to quash
investors&#8217; request for a new hearing on how he calculates who
gets compensated for losses in Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. 
The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York said Aug. 16 that
trustee Irving Picard can ignore fictitious profits on money
Madoff never invested when calculating losses and who is
entitled to be repaid. Some investors who wouldn&#8217;t get paid
under the formula asked for a &#8220;rehearing,&#8221; saying the appeals
court ruled differently in a previous case. 
Picard&#8217;s move to strike the request was denied, according
to a court filing Sept. 20. 
A group of Madoff investors had urged the court to require
Picard to use their final account statements, which included
fictitious profits on money Madoff never invested, to determine
losses. Picard&#8217;s formula limits the number of investors who can
claim money, and cuts the size of many claims. 
Asking the court earlier this month to refuse to rehear the
issue, Picard said in a filing the investors failed to follow
the court&#8217;s rules. Some investors filed a 24-page petition
without asking for permission to file an oversized brief, he
said. Told by the court to shorten it, &#8220;the petitioners seek to
dodge the court&#8217;s order,&#8221; Picard said. 
&#8220;They split the arguments into two 15-page petitions, put
some of the appellants on one petition and the rest on the
other, and ask the court to consider the petitions as one,&#8221;
Picard said. &#8220;The court should strike the newly filed
petitions.&#8221; 
Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in North Carolina,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. 
The case is In re Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC, 10-2378, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan). 
Google Says Oracle Seeking $2 Billion in Android Dispute 
Google Inc. (GOOG) said Oracle Corp. (ORCL) lowered its damages request
to at least $2 billion in a patent and copyright dispute over
Android software, according to a court filing. 
Google, which said the estimate includes $1.2 billion in
damages for unjust enrichment in 2012 alone, asked a federal
judge to exclude parts of the calculation that it says aren&#8217;t
supported by the evidence. 
In July, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco
threw out Oracle&#8217;s earlier estimate that it&#8217;s entitled to as
much as $6.1 billion in damages in a lawsuit claiming Google
infringed its Java patents when it created the Android operating
system, now running on more than 150 million mobile devices. 
Oracle&#8217;s new damages report &#8220;ignores governing law and the
guidelines of this court&#8217;s July 22, 2011, order,&#8221; Google lawyer
Robert Van Nest said in a letter to Alsup Sept. 20. 
Alsup ruled in July that a new estimate should start as low
as $100 million, a figure that Mountain View, California-based
Google was offered in 2006 to license Java from Sun Microsystems
Inc. Google rejected that offer by Sun, which Oracle later
acquired. 
Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Redwood City,
California-based Oracle, the largest maker of database software,
declined to comment on the Google filing. 
The two companies have made little headway this week in
negotiations aimed at resolving the lawsuit, a person briefed on
the talks said. Google Chief Executive Larry Page and Oracle CEO
Larry Ellison participated in a settlement conference that
lasted as long as 10 hours on Sept. 19 and returned to federal
court in San Jose, California, yesterday for further meetings
with a magistrate judge. 
The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 10-03561,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco)

Trials 
Rambus Was &#8216;Dethroned&#8217; by Intel, Micron Attorney Tells Jury 
Rambus Inc. (RMBS)&#8217;s computer memory failed to become an industry
standard because it was &#8220;dethroned&#8221; by Intel Corp. (INTC), not as a
result of collusion by rivals, a lawyer for Micron Technology
Inc. (MU) told a jury. 
In closing arguments at a state-court trial in San
Francisco, William Price, a lawyer for Micron, said yesterday
that Rambus was aware of technical problems with its version of
dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, when it signed a 1996
contract to work with Santa Clara, California-based Intel Corp.,
the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker. The jury began deliberating
yesterday. 
The relationship was &#8220;conceived in fraud,&#8221; Price told
jurors. &#8220;Intel lived with Rambus&#8221; in an attempt to develop
Rambus-designed memory, or RDRAM, into a product, he said. 
&#8220;What Intel concluded at the end was RDRAM was not the
product they thought it was, and that Rambus was not the company
they thought it was,&#8221; Price said. Intel &#8220;selected Rambus to
become king, and Intel dethroned Rambus.&#8221; 
Rambus contends that Boise, Idaho-based Micron and Ichon,
South Korea-based Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) colluded to cut the
prices of their own DDR, or double data rate, memory chips and
deserted their commitment to produce RDRAM, relegating it to a
niche role. 
Rambus, which doesn&#8217;t make the chips it designs, said it
would have made $3.95 billion in royalties without the alleged
conspiracy. Under California law, a jury finding of damages in
that amount would be automatically tripled to $11.9 billion. 
The case is Rambus Inc. v. Micron Technology Inc., 04-0431105, California Superior Court (San Francisco).

Banks Don&#8217;t Provide Swap Costs, JPMorgan Executive Tells Court 
Banks don&#8217;t typically disclose what they&#8217;re charging
municipalities to arrange derivatives, a practice that isn&#8217;t
required, Antonia Creanza, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker on
trial for fraud, told a Milan court. 
&#8220;Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, &#8216;How does the bank make money?&#8217;&#8221; Creanza
told the court yesterday under questioning by her lawyer. &#8220;I
would explain that we would retain a margin. Never has a legal
adviser told me, &#8216;Look you need to detail the gross margin,&#8217;&#8221;
she said. 
JPMorgan, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa Bank Plc are
on trial on charges of mis-selling swaps to Milan, derivatives
that adjusted payments on a 1.7 billion-euro ($2.4 billion) bond
offering from 2005. Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo said the banks
misled Milan by telling the city it could save about 55 million
euros with the bond sale and a series of swaps. Robledo says the
banks earned 101 million euros in hidden fees. The banks deny
the charges. 
After selling swaps to municipalities for UniCredit SpA and
a unit of Dexia SA, Creanza told the court she joined JPMorgan&#8217;s
interest-rate derivatives team in 2004, then headed by Antonio
Polverino. JPMorgan was one many banks that courted Milan, she
said. 
From December 2004 to March 2005, before Milan&#8217;s public
tender for the financing, JPMorgan discussed various financing
scenarios with the city, Creanza told the court.

Lehman to Drop Appeal of Ruling in $11 Billion Barclays Suit 
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which is gathering creditor
support for a $65 billion liquidation plan before a November
vote, said it will drop its attempt to collect $11 billion from
Barclays Plc in a dispute over the sale of Lehman operations in
2008. 
Lehman also won&#8217;t appeal a Sept. 14 ruling by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in Manhattan rejecting its claim
that Barclays owed about $500 million for allegedly unpaid
bonuses. Peck previously ruled against Lehman in the larger suit
against London-based Barclays. 
&#8220;While there are aspects of the decisions with which we do
not agree, we are also cognizant of the burdens that continued
litigation of these issues would place on the court and the
assets of the estate,&#8221; the defunct firm said in a statement
yesterday. 
After appealing Peck&#8217;s ruling in the bigger suit, Lehman
said yesterday it &#8220;respects the time and effort the court has
devoted to the serious issues raised by the estate.&#8221; Because of
the cost of continuing the litigation, Lehman said, &#8220;we have
determined that we will not pursue these issues through appeals,
believing that the resources of the court and the estate will be
better employed at this point to move the bankruptcy toward a
conclusion.&#8221; 
Lehman, once the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest investment bank,
has spent about $1.4 billion on lawyers and managers since its
2008 bankruptcy filing, the largest in U.S. history, with assets
of $639 billion. 
The New York-based firm&#8217;s bankruptcy became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the $757
million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.&#8217;s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by Lynn LoPucki, a
bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California, Los
Angeles. 
Lehman&#8217;s creditors range from banks and hedge funds to the
New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Lehman filed for bankruptcy
on Sept. 15, 2008. 
The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Verdicts/Settlements 
BofA&#8217;s $8.5 Billion Mortgage-Bond Deal Defended by Investors 
A lawyer for a group of investors that includes BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) defended their $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement with
Bank of America Corp., saying a delay in getting court approval
costs them money. 
&#8220;They believe this is a very positive settlement,&#8221; Robert
Madden, who represents 22 institutional investors, told a
federal judge in Manhattan at a court hearing yesterday. 
U.S. District Judge William Pauley heard arguments about
whether the settlement should be considered for approval in
federal court or returned to state court in New York, where it
was originally filed. 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the mortgage-bond trustee
that sought approval for the settlement, opposes moving the case
to federal court. The removal by an investor group -- Walnut
Place LLC and related entities -- threatens to &#8220;significantly
delay&#8221; the state-court proceeding, the bank said in a court
filing. 
&#8220;Delay hurts investors,&#8221; Madden said in an interview
after the hearing. When Bank of New York filed the proceeding in
state court, a judge set a November hearing to consider
approval. 
The proposed settlement resolves a fight with the
institutional investors, which wanted Bank of America to buy
back home loans that were packaged into bonds by Countrywide
Financial Corp. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North
Carolina, acquired Countrywide in 2008. 
The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Liberty Media Fends Off Bank of New York Challenge to Spinoff 
Liberty Media Corp. (LINTA) fended off Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Co.&#8217;s legal challenge to its splitoffs of the Liberty
Capital and Liberty Starz tracking stocks. 
The Delaware Supreme Court yesterday upheld a ruling that
clears the way for Liberty, controlled by billionaire John
Malone, to transfer assets of the two tracking stocks to
shareholders. 
The splitoffs are part of Malone&#8217;s efforts to simplify
Liberty&#8217;s financial structure and make it more attractive to
investors, Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets
Ltd. in New York, said last year. 
Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman, declined to
comment on the court ruling in an e-mailed statement. Liberty
Media executives plan to complete the splitoff of the units
tomorrow, Courtnee Ulrich, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. 
As part of the deals, officials of Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty want to redeem outstanding shares of the units in
exchange for shares in a newly formed company. 
Liberty Starz holds Liberty Media&#8217;s interest in television
company Starz Entertainment, according to the parent company&#8217;s
website. Liberty Capital holds assets, including production and
distribution company Starz Media LLC, and investments in Time
Warner Inc. (TWX), Time Warner Cable Inc. and Sprint Nextel Corp. (S)

Litigation Departments 
AIG Hires Ex-IRS Deputy Counsel Potter to Protect Tax Assets 
American International Group Inc. (AIG), the bailed-out insurer,
hired Clarissa Potter, former deputy chief counsel of the
Internal Revenue Service, to help protect tax assets accumulated
by the firm. 
Potter will be deputy tax director, reporting to Tal
Kaissar, director of tax, the insurer said yesterday in a
statement. 
Losses at New York-based AIG and its subsidiaries helped
rack up more than $25 billion of so-called deferred tax assets
as of Dec. 31 that may lower obligations to governments. Chief
Executive Officer Robert Benmosche, 67, said last month the
insurer is assembling a &#8220;world-class team&#8221; to manage the
assets and that they may be used for buybacks when AIG is
prepared to repurchase stock. 
&#8220;The complexity of AIG&#8217;s global structure requires a
holistic approach to compliance with domestic and international
tax law,&#8221; Kaissar said in the statement. Potter&#8217;s &#8220;first-hand
understanding of tax policy makes her uniquely positioned to
help AIG in this regard.&#8221;

Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) won U.S. approval
for an expanded use of Remicade to treat children with a chronic
inflammatory bowel disease who don&#8217;t respond to traditional
therapy. 
The Food and Drug Administration cleared the medicine
chemically known as infliximab for pediatric ulcerative colitis,
the company said today in a statement. 
Remicade was approved in 1998 as the first anti-tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha treatment in the U.S. It is used in
Crohn&#8217;s disease in adults and children, and ulcerative colitis,
rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis in adults. Most children with
ulcerative colitis are first treated with anti-inflammatory
drugs and with steroids, according to the Pediatric IBD
Foundation. 
&#8220;Ulcerative colitis can be a devastating disease and
previously, there had been no approved therapeutic options for
pediatric patients who had an inadequate response to
conventional therapy,&#8221; Jeffrey Hyams, head of digestive
diseases and nutrition at Connecticut Children&#8217;s Medical Center,
said in the statement from New Brunswick, New Jersey-based JJ. 
Hyams, also a professor of pediatrics at the University of
Connecticut School of Medicine, was the lead investigator in a
company-sponsored study that showed 73 percent of children with
ulcerative colitis responded to the drug within eight weeks. 
About 150,000 children younger than age 17 are living with
the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease, JJ said. Ulcerative
colitis can slow growth in children and delay sexual maturation,
according to the Mayo Clinic based in Rochester, Minnesota. 
Serious Risks 
While the drug&#8217;s approval provides a new treatment option
for children with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, there
are &#8220;serious risks&#8221; associated with its use because it
suppresses the immune system, Donna Griebel, director of the
FDA&#8217;s Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products,
said in a statement. 
The drug carries a boxed warning, the FDA&#8217;s strongest
caution, for increased risks of cancer and viral, fungal or
bacterial infections. 
A rare, often fatal type of cancer called Hepatosplenic T-
cell Lymphoma is among malignancies that have been reported in
adolescent and young adult patients using TNF blockers, the
agency said in the statement. 
An FDA advisory panel on July 21 backed Remicade for
pediatric ulcerative colitis to induce and maintain clinical
remission and induce mucosal healing. The panel didn&#8217;t recommend
the therapy to maintain mucosal healing or eliminate
corticosteroid use. The medicine generated $4.6 billion in
revenue last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Credit-default swaps on Morgan
Stanley (MS) surged to the highest level in more than two years amid
concern the global economic recovery is fading. 
The cost to protect the New York-based bank&#8217;s debt for five
years climbed 30.1 basis points to 435 basis points, the highest
level since March 10, 2009, according to data provider CMA. One-
year contracts jumped 55.5 basis points to 505.8, signaling that
traders are pricing in a greater probability of credit
deterioration in the short term. 
&#8220;An inverted curve for a financial services firm is never
a good thing,&#8221; said Bonnie Baha, head of global developed
credit group at DoubleLine Capital LP, which has $16 billion in
assets under management. &#8220;I&#8217;m still pretty concerned about the
banks.&#8221; Morgan Stanley lacks the deposit bases of many of its
peers, she said. 
Five-year credit-default swaps on New York-based Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) increased for a sixth day, adding 9 basis
points to 297, the data show. 
Contracts on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) eased 2.3 basis points to
150.4, those on Citigroup Inc. (C) were little changed at 280.5, and
those on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) fell 2.8 basis points to 153.2,
the data show. Contracts on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) dropped from
the highest level since March 2009, declining 9.4 basis points
to 390.6, the data show. 
&#8216;Very Volatile&#8217; 
Swaps on Morgan Stanley pared an earlier jump to as high as
a mid-price of 470 basis points, according to broker Phoenix
Partners Group, on signs policy makers will act to prevent the
debt crisis from worsening. The swaps typically rise as investor
confidence deteriorates and fall as it improves. 
&#8220;Today the market in general is just very, very volatile,
and we&#8217;ve seen some as much as 50 wider and back to unchanged,&#8221;
John Guarnera, a financial analyst at Societe Generale SA in New
York, said in a telephone interview. 
The Markit Group Ltd. CDX North America High Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence deteriorates, climbed 0.2
percentage points to 91.8 percent of face value as of 5:20 p.m.
in New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.
Earlier it fell as much as 0.8 percentage points. It&#8217;s decreased
for four of six days, and it fell to 91.3 on Sept. 12, which was
the least since September 2009. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s credit rankings were
cut by Fitch Ratings for failing to pay off more of its debt
since the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker acquired Wyeth in 2009. 
The London-based rating service reduced Pfizer to an A+
from AA- saying its leverage level &#8220;is still not commensurate
with&#8221; the higher rating. Fitch expected the New York-based
company to reduce its debt to 1.3 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, said Michael Zbinovec, a Fitch analyst based in Chicago. Instead, the New
York-based company cut its debt to 1.5 times Ebitda, he said. 
Zbinovec said Pfizer had tripled its debt load after the
$68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. A combination of the
debt and a reduction in revenue growth prevented the drugmaker
from reaching the target, he said. 
&#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s ability to pay its debt obligation is somewhat
constrained,&#8221; Zbinovec said. &#8220;But the new rating should be
good for the next year and a half even with the acceleration in
patent expirations that will affect Pfizer.&#8221; 
The patent on Pfizer&#8217;s best-selling drug Lipitor expires in
November. The cholesterol medicine generated $10.7 billion in
2010. 
Fitch also revised its outlook to stable from negative.

Morgan Stanley (MS), gained the most
among the biggest U.S. banks in New York trading as concern
eased that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would expose the firm to losses
from French lenders. 
Morgan Stanley climbed 66 cents, or 5 percent, to $13.72 at
4:15 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
It was the biggest increase among the 81 companies on the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index. 
Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst, wrote in
a note to clients that the New York-based lender faces less than
$2 billion of risks linked to France. Potential losses connected
to French banks wouldn&#8217;t exceed 65 cents a share, according to
Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC. 
Having $2 billion at risk &#8220;is not good, but it&#8217;s not
threatening in any fashion,&#8221; Bove, who expects Morgan Stanley
to rise to $31 over the next 12 to 18 months, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s no certainty that the French
banks are going to fail, and No. 2, if they do fail, there&#8217;s no
certainty that all $2 billion will go down with the French
banks.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
in a filing last year that it had about $39 billion at risk with
French lenders, which are falling on concern that the sovereign-
debt crisis will spur losses. The figure exaggerates actual
risks because it includes all funds in French accounts, such as
client holdings, and excludes collateral posted to Morgan
Stanley, Bove and Hintz said. 
Morgan Stanley has declined about 50 percent this year. The
MSCI All-Country World Index of 45 nations fell into a bear
market this week for the first time in more than two years. 
Management at Morgan Stanley has increased capital to
contend with Europe&#8217;s crisis, Hintz wrote. Mark Lake, a company
spokesman, declined to comment on analysts&#8217; estimates of Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s foreign risks.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Priceline.com
Inc. (PCLN) are among 26 stocks JPMorgan Chase  Co. says may return
more than the market if U.S. equities drop like they did after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
The list includes companies with high price-to-book and
price-to-earnings ratios that are also liked by analysts and are
considered growth stocks, Thomas Lee, the New York-based firm&#8217;s
chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note today. Stocks that
meet the criteria may perform better than benchmark gauges in
two scenarios: if the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index plunges like
it did in 2008 after Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy, or if it rallies,
which is what happened following the Asian crisis, he said. 
The benchmark gauge for American equities is down 17
percent from its high in April after the U.S. lost its AAA
credit rating from SP and concern about the European debt
crisis grew. Since the beginning of August, the index has traded
between about 1,100 and 1,300. While U.S. equities reacted in
opposite directions after the two previous crises, Lee said the
valuation levels and fundamentals of the 26 stocks may mean
they&#8217;re poised to outperform no matter which direction the SP
500 moves. 
&#8220;What worked both post-Asia &#8217;98 and post-Lehman failure
&#8217;08?&#8221; Lee wrote in the note. &#8220;It is not entirely a surprise
that &#8216;growth&#8217; outperformed, but the fact these other style
attributes outperformed is less obvious.&#8221; 
Lee considered companies in the SP 500 Pure Growth Index
and corporations with an enterprise value at least 8.8 times 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
He looked for price-to-book values higher than 2.89 and price-
to-earnings ratios above 13.9. 
The following is the list of 26 stocks that met the
criteria, according to Lee.

AppNexus Inc., the online
advertising company backed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), has turned
profitable and may go public late next year, founder and Chief
Executive Officer Brian O&#8217;Kelley said. 
The New York-based company has raised $65.5 million since
it was founded in 2007, with the last round of $50 million led
by Microsoft in October. AppNexus had its first profitable month
in August, O&#8217;Kelley said in an interview. 
&#8220;The financials, the revenue, the profit and the growth
are all strong enough that we could be going public as soon as
late next year,&#8221; said O&#8217;Kelley, 34. &#8220;That&#8217;s really the path.&#8221; 
AppNexus provides technology, data and analytics that
companies such as Microsoft and EBay Inc. use to buy and sell
online display-advertising. The market for graphical display ads
is set to climb 25 percent in the U.S. in 2011, and will almost
double to $22 billion in 2015 from this year&#8217;s level, according
New York-based EMarketer Inc., which tracks digital marketing. 
&#8220;The idea of real-time bidding is going to become
increasingly important,&#8221; said David Hallerman, an analyst with
EMarketer in New York. &#8220;There is sheer growth of display-ad
inventory as people spend more time online.&#8221; 
AppNexus said its revenue has grown fourfold this year
compared with 2010. The company hasn&#8217;t hired investment banks
and the IPO timing depends on market conditions, O&#8217;Kelley said.
Newly issued stocks during their first publicly traded year are
performing the worst since July 2009, according to the Bloomberg
IPO Index. 
Right Media, DoubleClick 
O&#8217;Kelley said he prefers an IPO to a sale as the management
team wants to be in charge of building AppNexus into a global
company. 
&#8220;It would be hard to see a sale as the right outcome,&#8221;
O&#8217;Kelley said. &#8220;I feel immense loyalty to the team we&#8217;ve built.
As a public company we can control our destiny.&#8221; 
Many of O&#8217;Kelley&#8217;s top employees came from companies that
were bought. He and co-founder Mike Nolet worked at online
advertising company Right Media Inc., and left when Yahoo! Inc.
purchased it in 2007. Michael Rubenstein, now AppNexus
president, was at DoubleClick Inc. when Google Inc. (GOOG) purchased it
in 2008 for about $3.1 billion. AppNexus began with 20 employees
and projects to be at 200 at end of this year. 
For the next few months, O&#8217;Kelley will build the business
through acquisitions in Europe. His management team has talked
to more than 80 European companies on a trip this week,
including customers and potential takeover targets, he said. 
The company, which opened an office in London this summer,
was drawn to Europe through partnerships with Hi-Media SA (HIM), a
Paris-based electronic payments company, and Microsoft, the
world&#8217;s largest software maker, O&#8217;Kelley said. 
Microsoft, the fourth-biggest seller of display ads in the
U.S., unveiled partnerships this month with AppNexus and
MediaMath. Microsoft&#8217;s share is less than one-third of
Facebook&#8217;s and about half of Google&#8217;s, according to EMarketer. 
AppNexus&#8217;s investors also include Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway, First Round Capital, Venrock Associates, Kodiak Venture
Partners and Khosla Ventures. Bloomberg LP, the parent company
of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen&#8217;s venture-
capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz.

Morgan Stanley (MS), whose shares
dropped yesterday on concern French losses will mount, faces
less than $2 billion of risks linked to the country, according
to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst. 
&#8220;There is solid evidence that shows Morgan Stanley has
been taking action to limit risk in preparation for potentially
difficult market conditions ahead,&#8221; Hintz, who is based in New
York, wrote in a note to clients today. &#8220;We estimate that total
risk to France and its banks is less than $2 billion net of
collateral and hedges.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley said in a filing last year that its exposure
was about $39 billion to French lenders, which are falling on
concern Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis will spur losses. That
figure exaggerates the value of the New York-based bank&#8217;s actual
risks because it includes all funds in French accounts, such as
client holdings, and excludes collateral posted to Morgan
Stanley, Hintz wrote. 
Morgan Stanley management has increased capital and boosted
its liquidity pool to contend with Europe&#8217;s crisis, Hintz wrote. 
Shares of the company dropped 52 percent this year through
yesterday as global equities fell into a bear market this week
for the first time in more than two years. Morgan Stanley
climbed 33 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $13.39 in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange at 9:39 a.m.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said the global financial system risks
repeating the crisis of 2008 if Europe&#8217;s debt crisis escalates
and spreads to the U.S. banking industry. 
&#8220;This is where the parallels with 2008 are relevant, even
though I think they are being over exaggerated,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said
in an interview on CNBC today. &#8220;It was when the financial
system really imploded that financial firms stopped extending
credit to anybody that the corporate world had to destock and we
know what happened after that. We are not far off the same sort
of thing.&#8221; 
More than $3.4 trillion has been erased from equity values
this week, driving global stocks into a bear market, as the
Federal Reserve&#8217;s new stimulus and a pledge by Group of 20
nations fails to ease concern the global economy is on the brink
of another recession. O&#8217;Neill said the Fed&#8217;s plan to shift $400
billion of short-term debt into longer term Treasuries hasn&#8217;t
convinced investors it will strengthen growth. 
&#8220;The fear that it&#8217;s all dependent on the Fed, together
with this mess in Europe, is really getting people more and more
worried as this week comes to an end,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;The
markets have taken the latest FOMC move rather badly, which adds
a whole new angle to it. It&#8217;s the first time since the global
rally started in early 2009 that the markets have rejected a Fed
easing.&#8221; 
Stocks Decline 
The decline in U.S. stocks after the announcement on Sept.
21 of the Fed&#8217;s announcement contrasts with the reaction to the
second round of quantitative easing. The SP 500 Index rose 24
percent from the day Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first signaled the
policy in August 2010 to its conclusion in June. 
European stocks fell for a third day today, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slipping 1.5 percent as of 1:52 p.m. in London.
The FTSE 100 Index declined 1.2 percent. U.S. stock futures also
fell. 
&#8220;The solution for the U.S. is not more tinkering by the
Fed, but doing things like micro-policies to get U.S. companies
to spend more money on investment and jobs,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. 
Group of 20 finance chiefs late yesterday promised to
address rising risks to the global economy and pushed Europe to
contain its debt crisis. The European Central Bank may act to
tackle risks to growth as soon as next month should economic
data disappoint, Governing Council member Luc Coene said. 
&#8220;As the problem in Europe spreads from Greece to more and
more other countries and in particular Italy, the exposure that
so many people bank-wise have to Italian debt means the systems
can&#8217;t cope easily with that and it would spread way beyond
Europe&#8217;s borders,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;This is why the policy
makers need to stop being so sleepy and get on and lead.&#8221;

Bank of America Corp. (BAC) is among a
group of lenders that may face a wave of new lawsuits claiming
cash-strapped counties were cheated out of millions of dollars
by a system used for more than a decade to register mortgages. 
Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said state
attorneys general and county officials across the U.S. have
expressed interest in his lawsuit against Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems Inc. and Bank of America, filed in Texas
state court on Sept. 21. Dallas County could be owed as much as
$100 million in filing fees, he said. 
&#8220;This is a big new front,&#8221; said Christopher L. Peterson,
associate dean and professor at the University of Utah S.J.
Quinney College of Law. &#8220;This case is scary because if Dallas
wins then there are a lot of other counties around the country
that are going to follow.&#8221; 
MERS, a unit of Reston, Virginia-based Merscorp Inc., says
on its website that its aim is to place every mortgage in the
country on an electronic, rather than a paper, system that
allows members to buy and sell mortgages. 
MERS acts as the lender&#8217;s nominee and remains the mortgagee
of record as long as the note promising repayment is owned by a
MERS member. Dallas County claims this allows banks to buy and
sell loans without properly recording transfers with counties
and paying the fee. 
&#8220;The MERS business model and practices are legal and
comply with the recording statutes and regulations of Texas,&#8221;
Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Merscorp, said in an e-mail. The
claims in the lawsuit &#8220;are without legal or factual merit.&#8221; 
Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender by
assets, declined to comment on the suit. 
Liability in the Dallas case could exceed $1 billion, based
on the number of mortgages in the county, Peterson said. Local
laws impose substantial penalties, as well as back payments of
fees and taxes, if false documents were filed in land
transactions, said Peterson, who has advised private plaintiffs
making similar claims. 
Faulty mortgages and foreclosures have already cost the
five biggest home lenders $66 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America&#8217;s credit rating was cut
on Sept. 21 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in part because the
bill for mortgage disputes may climb past the $39 billion
committed since 2007. County clerks in Kentucky have also sued
MERS, while officials in Massachusetts and Michigan say they are
exploring the possibility. 
The Texas case is Dallas County v. Merscorp Inc., CC-11-
06571-E, County Court at Law, Dallas County, Texas. The Kentucky
case is Christian County Clerk v. Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems Inc., 5:11-cv-00072, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Kentucky (Louisville).

New Suits 
JPMorgan Sues American Century Over $848 Million Share Sale 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued mutual fund firm American Century
Cos. over claims it was shortchanged in a $848 million optioned
share sale to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. 
American Century failed to disclose material information
regarding the sale and the shares were not purchased at their
fair market value, lawyers for JPMorgan said in a public version
of the complaint filed Sept. 21 in Delaware Chancery Court. The
complaint was initially filed under seal. 
&#8220;The allegation that American Century breached an option
agreement is without merit and the edited complaint filed in
Delaware yesterday is an inaccurate and incomplete
representation of the facts,&#8221; American Century said in a
statement e-mailed by Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the firm. 
CIBC, Canada&#8217;s fifth-largest bank, announced in July that
it agreed to buy a 41 percent stake in American Century from
JPMorgan. The cash acquisition is the third-largest purchase by
the Toronto-based bank. 
JPMorgan purchased a roughly 45 percent interest in Kansas
City, Missouri-based American Century for about $900 million in
January 1998, according to the complaint. Under a 2009 option
agreement between American and JPMorgan, American could purchase
all of the shares JPMorgan owned in the firm and resell them to
a third party. 
JPMorgan, based in New York, said in its complaint that it
learned of the share sale through a public announcement. The
transaction was completed on Aug. 31. 
&#8220;American Century improperly withheld information
regarding the CIBC stock sale from JPMorgan&#8217;s director designee
on American Century&#8217;s board,&#8221; lawyers for the bank said in the
redacted complaint. 
The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. American Century
Companies Inc., CA6875, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington.)

Madoff Trustee Sues Atlantic Security Bank for $120 Million 
The trustee overseeing the liquidation of Bernard L.
Madoff&#8217;s firm sued Atlantic Security Bank for $120 million. 
The lawsuit is one of several filed by Irving Picard to
recoup what he said is &#8220;customer property&#8221; from companies that
invested with Fairfield Sentry Ltd., a so-called feeder fund
that placed money in the con man&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. Atlantic
Security Bank is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and has
offices in Panama, according to Picard&#8217;s suit filed yesterday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. A phone number for the bank
couldn&#8217;t be immediately located. 
The case is Picard v. Atlantic Security Bank, 11-02730,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Madoff Family Wins Partial Dismissal of $198 Million Suit 
Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s family won dismissal of part of a $198
million lawsuit by the liquidator of the con man&#8217;s firm, while
the judge left Irving Picard free to pursue most of his claims. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland struck Picard&#8217;s
claims for some transfers of money out of the jailed Ponzi
scheme operator&#8217;s firm. Picard, who sued Madoff&#8217;s brother, two
sons and niece, is free to amend his suit, the judge said in a
court filing yesterday. 
Picard&#8217;s 2009 lawsuit against the brother, Peter Madoff,
sons Andrew and Mark Madoff and niece Shana Madoff Swanson, all
of whom held senior positions at the defunct money-management
firm, claimed they spent more than $198 million of investors&#8217;
money and treated the con man&#8217;s investment firm as their
&#8220;family piggy bank.&#8221; 
Peter Madoff was chief compliance officer at Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Madoff&#8217;s sons, Andrew and
Mark, were co-directors of trading at the investment firm, and
Shana Madoff was compliance director, according to Picard. 
Mark Madoff committed suicide in December. 
&#8220;Mark and Andrew Madoff had no prior knowledge of Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s crimes and contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and
the SEC immediately after their father told them he had
defrauded his investment advisory clients,&#8221; Martin Flumenbaum,
a lawyer for Andrew Madoff and Mark Madoff&#8217;s estate, said in an
e-mail yesterday. &#8220;Whether or not the trustee amends his
complaint to reassert some or all of the claims that were
dismissed today, we fully expect to prevail on the merits.&#8221; 
Charles Spada, who has been representing Peter Madoff, had
no comment on the ruling. 
Mark Smith, a lawyer for Shana Madoff, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment yesterday. 
Refusing to dismiss the entire suit, Lifland said the
family&#8217;s failure to stop Madoff&#8217;s fraud was &#8220;unsurprising given
their close familial relationship with Madoff and proximity&#8221; to
his firm. However, Picard&#8217;s suit contains &#8220;some correctable
pleading deficiencies&#8221; that need to be amended, he said. 
The case is Picard v. Peter Madoff, 09-1503, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

UBS Trader Adoboli Faces Added Fraud Charge, Prosecutor Says 
Kweku Adoboli, the UBS AG (UBSN) trader charged with fraud and
false accounting that may have resulted in a $2.3 billion loss,
said through his lawyer that he was &#8220;sorry beyond words&#8221; after
facing an additional fraud charge at a court hearing yesterday. 
The 31-year-old, who holds a Ghanaian passport, didn&#8217;t
apply for bail when he appeared at a magistrate&#8217;s court in
London. Prosecutor David Levy said the alleged loss may exceed
$2.3 billion. Adoboli wasn&#8217;t required to enter a plea yesterday
and another hearing was scheduled for Oct. 20. 
The trader is &#8220;sorry beyond words for what happened
here,&#8221; said Patrick Gibbs, Adoboli&#8217;s lawyer. He apologized for
his &#8220;disastrous miscalculations,&#8221; Gibbs said. 
Adoboli, who appeared yesterday wearing a dark grey suit,
white shirt and navy tie, has been in police custody since he
was arrested Sept. 15 on suspicion of making the unauthorized
trades. 
Prosecutors charged him Sept. 17 with fraud and false
accounting dating back to 2008. The prosecution yesterday added
a charge to extend the fraud allegations to 2008 as well. 
If convicted, he faces as many as 10 years in prison,
according to sentencing guidelines. Time spent in custody
beforehand would be deducted from any sentence. 
Louise Hodges, another of Adoboli&#8217;s lawyers, declined to
comment after the hearing. Yves Kaufmann, a spokesman for UBS in
Zurich said &#8220;the loss arising from the unauthorized trades is
$2.3 billion, as we have stated&#8221; previously.

Smith Barney Lead Plaintiff Thrown Out, Never Owned Shares 
Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s Smith Barney unit can&#8217;t be sued by the
lead plaintiff in a six-year-old shareholder fraud class action
because the fund never owned any shares that are the basis of
the lawsuit, a judge said. 
U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III, citing &#8220;epic
failures&#8221; by the lawyers on both sides of the case, yesterday
dismissed the lead plaintiff, Operating Local 649 Annuity Trust
Fund. The fund&#8217;s attorneys told the judge that their client
owned more than 75,000 shares of a similarly named security and
not those involved in the case. 
Pauley called the effect of the error &#8220;seismic,&#8221; and said
it has caused &#8220;considerable waste of time and resources.&#8221; 
&#8220;After six years of litigation, including extensive motion
practice, an appeal to the Second Circuit, remand, more motion
practice, and discovery, lead counsel learned that the lead
plaintiff never purchased any of the securities at issue in this
action,&#8221; Pauley, in Manhattan, wrote in yesterday&#8217;s decision. 
Bernstein Liebhard partner Stanley Bernstein said the
lawyers relied on the union&#8217;s certification that it had bought
the mutual fund shares and brokerage statements that mistakenly
reflected the mutual fund shares along with their ticker symbol. 
&#8220;We did not just rely on somebody&#8217;s word,&#8221; Bernstein said
in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;We had the underlying core
documentation from the broker. And it was wrong.&#8221; 
Charles Platt, a partner in the New York office of Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, which represents Citigroup,
declined to comment on Pauley&#8217;s opinion yesterday. 
The mistake will require several motions to be rebriefed, 
The case is In re Smith Barney Transfer Agent Litigation,

(Manhattan).

Deutsche Bank Swap Ruling May Apply to Other Cases, Judge Says 
A German top court ruling on swaps that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
lost in March may also apply in cases involving other
derivatives, a judge said. 
The Frankfurt Regional Court will review to what extent the
top court ruling governs currency options as well, Presiding
Judge Bruno Menhofer said yesterday at a hearing in a lawsuit
against the lender seeking 30 million euros ($40 million) in
damages. The court&#8217;s assessment is preliminary, he said. The
case was brought by travel company Schauinsland-Reisen GmbH. 
The Federal Court of Justice, Germany&#8217;s highest civil
court, ruled in March that Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank must
cover losses caused by a derivative it branded a &#8220;CMS Spread
Ladder Swap,&#8221; because the bank didn&#8217;t disclose the product had
a initial negative market value. Deutsche Bank is arguing that
ruling only applies to the same kind of product. Former
customers are hoping to capitalize on the ruling to collect
damages for other bets that went sour. 
&#8220;The top court has used very, very strong language as
regards disclosure duties the bank has,&#8221; said Menhofer. &#8220;The
ruling is a leading precedent setting clear standards and we
have to see how they apply to the product at issue here.&#8221; 
Yesterday&#8217;s case is LG Frankfurt, 3-04 O 50/10.

Saad Group&#8217;s Al-Sanea Wins End to $9.2 Billion Asset Freeze 
Maan al-Sanea, founder of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Saad Group, won
dismissal of a $9.2 billion asset freeze in the Cayman Islands
after Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi  Brothers Co. admitted failing to
disclose evidence. 
Algosaibi agreed it &#8220;breached its duty of full and frank
disclosure&#8221; when it won the asset freeze against al-Sanea in
2009, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands ruled Sept. 21.
Algosaibi applied last month to voluntarily dismiss the freeze
after it found new evidence that should have been revealed
earlier. Al-Sanea still faces a fraud lawsuit filed by Algosaibi
in New York and probes in Bahrain and Switzerland. 
&#8220;Since AHAB started its litigation scheme over two years
ago, I have been resolute in my complete rejection of its
desperate claims that I somehow defrauded the Algosaibis,&#8221; al-
Sanea said yesterday in a statement, using Algosaibi&#8217;s initials. 
The asset freeze was part of a global legal dispute between
the companies after they defaulted in 2009 on a total of about
$15.7 billion in loans from more than 100 banks. Al-Sanea, one
of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s richest men who married into the Algosaibi
family before founding Saad Group, faces claims he forged
signatures to take out as much as $10 billion in fake loans
through Algosaibi&#8217;s Money Exchange unit, which he ran. 
The dismissal of the asset freeze doesn&#8217;t prove al-Sanea&#8217;s
innocence or reduce his legal troubles, said Eric Lewis, a legal
coordinator for the Algosaibi family. Al-Sanea has refused to
appear in court in the Cayman Islands, Lewis said. 
Algosaibi &#8220;voluntarily withdrew the freezing order and did
not seek a new one, despite all the essential allegations of
fraud and forgery having been proven correct,&#8221; Lewis said.
&#8220;Maan al-Sanea has spent two years in procedural maneuvers to
avoid a court from considering his vast fraud.&#8221;

Boeing, General Dynamics Seek End to $3 Billion Claims Case 
Boeing Co. (BA) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) urged a federal
claims court judge to end the companies&#8217; 20-year-old dispute
with the U.S. in which the government sought $3 billion over a
canceled Navy aircraft contract. 
Lawyers for the companies asked U.S. Federal Claims Judge
Robert Hodges during a hearing yesterday to find that the case
over the A-12 bomber can no longer be litigated because of
classified data, noting that the parties, with their cross
claims, &#8220;have fought to a draw&#8221; after two decades. 
&#8220;We have come the conclusion that it&#8217;s time for the Boeing
Company to lay down its sword,&#8221; said Boeing&#8217;s lawyer, Charles
Cooper of Cooper  Kirk in Washington. 
The fight has moved back and forth among courts since it
began in 1991, reaching the U.S. Supreme Court in September
2010. In May, the high court set aside a ruling that put the
U.S. in line to recover $3 billion from the companies. The case
was sent back to a lower court to determine whether the
government had a responsibility to disclose classified
information vital to the performance of the contract. 
The Justice Department said yesterday that it will continue
to pursue the claim, arguing that the justices had an
opportunity to dismiss the case and didn&#8217;t. 
&#8220;If the Supreme Court had wanted that outcome, it could
have ordered that outcome,&#8221; Justice Department lawyer Bryant
Snee said. 
In August, lawyers for Boeing, which also filed claims
against the government, sent a letter to the department urging
it to drop the case. 
&#8220;The time has come for all parties to step back, to
reflect on where we are after two decades of contesting this
matter, and to finally do what we should have done years ago:
agree to bring this litigation to an end,&#8221; the Boeing lawyers
wrote, submitting the letter to U.S. Court of Federal Claims in
a Sept. 20 filing. 
The case is Boeing Co. v. U.S., 91-cv-1204, U.S. Court of
Federal Claims (Washington).

Trials 
Galleon Sentencing Scorecard: Average Prison Term Is 3 Years 
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam will be
sentenced on Oct. 13 for insider trading after being convicted
by a jury in Manhattan federal court. 
Prosecutors say Rajaratnam, who was convicted in May,
should serve as long as 24 1/2 years in prison, calling him the
&#8220;modern face of insider trading.&#8221; On Sept. 21, judges in
Manhattan sentenced two other convicted insider traders -- Zvi
Goffer and Winifred Jiau -- to prison terms of 10 years and four
years, respectively. 
Since Rajaratnam&#8217;s arrest in October 2009, judges in
Manhattan federal court have sentenced 12 defendants in cases
linked to Galleon. All but two pleaded guilty. The average
prison term has been 35.75 months, or almost three years behind
bars. 
Typically, those convicted at a trial get longer prison
terms than those pleading guilty. In addition to the two Galleon
defendants who took their cases to a jury, Manhattan judges
since 2003 have imposed sentences in three other cases where the
main charge was insider trading and a jury returned a guilty
verdict. The average sentence has been six years and two months. 
About two dozen others are waiting to be sentenced in the
Galleon cases. They include Emanuel Goffer, a former trader and
brother of Zvi Goffer, who was convicted at a trial, and Anil
Kumar, a former McKinsey  Co. executive who pleaded guilty and
testified against Rajaratnam in a bid for leniency. 
The Rajaratnam case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184,

Verdicts/Settlements 
Judge Approves Madoff Trustee Settlement With Tremont Funds 
A judge approved a $1 billion settlement of a lawsuit by
liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm and hedge-fund firm Tremont
Group Holdings Inc. 
In the deal approved yesterday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland, trustee Irving Picard will accept a cash payment
of more than $1 billion from funds associated with Tremont. In
exchange, the Tremont funds will be allowed to make claims on
the Madoff estate of about $3 billion, according to court
filings. 
The settlement is &#8220;fair and reasonable,&#8221; Lifland said. 
Among the parties settling were Oppenheimer Acquisition
Corp., an affiliate of the Oppenheimer mutual funds that bought
Tremont, and Oppenheimer&#8217;s parents, MassMutual Holding LLC and
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. 
Earlier this month, New York Life Insurance Co. and six
other insurance companies assailed the settlement. As limited
partners of the hedge-fund firm&#8217;s Opportunity III fund, they
said they would lose if a court rules that the Ponzi scheme&#8217;s
so-called net winners should be compensated, because they
wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to recalculate their claims. A U.S. appeals
court yesterday denied Picard&#8217;s move to strike a request by
Madoff investors for a second hearing on the issue. 
Picard sued Tremont and related entities for $2.1 billion,
saying they ignored warnings that Madoff could be running a
Ponzi scheme and profited from it, according to a complaint
unsealed in March. The payment from Tremont, the second-biggest
so-called feeder into Madoff&#8217;s multibillion-dollar fraud, will
add to the $2.6 billion in the fund for Madoff customers, Picard
has said. 
The case is Picard v. Tremont Group Holdings Inc., 10-5310,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan.)

PharmAthene Wins Rights to Profit From Siga Smallpox Drug 
Siga Technologies Inc. (SIGA) must share with PharmAthene Inc. (PIP)
profit from sales of a smallpox drug that may total more than
$400 million, a judge ruled. Trading in shares of both companies
was halted. 
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr. in
Wilmington said yesterday New York-based Siga breached its
obligation to negotiate in good faith on ST-246, an antiviral
drug for use in case of a biological attack. Parsons rejected
PharmAthene&#8217;s claim that Siga breached a binding license
agreement. He also denied claims for a lump sum award and
instead ordered the companies to share the profits. 
&#8220;The plaintiff is entitled to share in any profits
realized from the sale of the drug in question,&#8221; Parsons said
yesterday in a 118-page opinion. 
Lewis Goldberg, a Siga spokesman, said the company couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment on the ruling. Siga was preparing a
statement, he said. 
Stacey Jurchison, a spokeswoman for Annapolis, Maryland-
based PharmAthene, said the ruling appears to have granted the
company a &#8220;50 percent profit split.&#8221; 
&#8220;We think it is a very good outcome,&#8221; Jurchison said in a
phone interview. 
The case is PharmAthene Inc. v. Siga Technologies Inc.,
CA2627, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Ford Wins Reversal of $43 Million Award in Fatal Crash Case 
Ford Motor Co. (F) won reversal of an Illinois jury&#8217;s $43
million damage award in a lawsuit filed after a 2003 crash
killed a 73-year-old man and severely burned his wife. 
The Illinois Supreme Court yesterday threw out the verdict
rendered after a 2005 trial concluding that Dora Jablonski and
the estate of her husband, John, failed to prove the gas tank of
their 1993 Lincoln Town Car had been defectively designed. 
Their car burst into flames after being hit in the rear by
another vehicle traveling at an estimated 55 to 65 miles per
hour while they were stopped at a highway construction zone in
southwest Illinois, causing an item in the trunk to pierce the
tank. 
&#8220;Plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence from which a
jury could conclude that Ford breached its duty of reasonable
care&#8221; on three negligent design theories, the court said. It
rejected a fourth argument as not viable under state law. 
Bradley M. Lakin, the Wood River, Illinois, attorney who
took the case to trial, didn&#8217;t immediately reply to telephone
messages seeking comment on yesterday&#8217;s ruling. 
&#8220;Ford is gratified by the court&#8217;s decision,&#8221; Marcey
Evans, a spokeswoman for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker,
said in an e-mail. 
&#8220;The 1993 Town Car exceeded all federal crash safety
standards,&#8221; she said. &#8220;While the Jablonskis were victims of a
tragic accident caused by a distracted driver who rear-ended
them at 60 miles per hour, it was unfair to blame Ford for their
injuries.&#8221;

Litigation Departments 
Richard Zabel Said to Get Deputy U.S. Attorney Post in N.Y. 
Richard Zabel, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, was
promoted to deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, a person familiar with the matter said. 
Zabel served as co-head of litigation at Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer  Feld LLP from 1999 until 2009, when he rejoined the
prosecutor&#8217;s office in Manhattan. He replaces Boyd Johnson III,
who is leaving to join the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale
 Dorr LLP, according to the firm. 
A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School,
Zabel worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan from
1991 to 1999, holding positions including chief of the office&#8217;s
narcotics unit. He co-wrote two reports published in 2008 and
2009 by the group Human Rights First, &#8220;In Pursuit of Justice,
Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in the Federal Courts.&#8221; 
He twice won the Attorney General&#8217;s Award for Distinguished
Service for his role in the prosecutions of a violent criminal
organization known as the Latin Kings and members of the Gambino
organized crime family. 
Johnson, a graduate of Hamilton College and Cornell Law
School, has been a prosecutor in the office since 1999, holding
positions including chief of the public corruption unit and head
of the international narcotics trafficking unit. 
He is scheduled to start work with Washington-based Wilmer
Hale&#8217;s litigation and white-collar practices on Oct. 1. 
Under the supervision of both men, prosecutors in the

The trade was stopped at a &#8220;theoretical loss&#8221; of 4.2
percent including interest, the New York-based company said in a
note today. 
&#8220;The recent sharp increase in risk aversion, much of this
originating in Europe, and upward pressure on the dollar across
a wide range of currencies lately, has pushed the cross below
our 1.35 closing stop,&#8221; Goldman said in the note written by
analysts including chief strategist Thomas Stolper. 
The euro rose 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.3551 at
9:42 a.m. in London. The single European currency has weakened
1.8 percent against the dollar from last week.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) chief
Economist Bruce Kasman said Greece is insolvent and headed
toward a depression that will cause catastrophic damage across
Europe. 
&#8220;We have a social contract that&#8217;s been broken between
Greece and the rest of the region,&#8221; Kasman said today during a
panel discussion at the Institute of International Finance
annual meeting in Washington. &#8220;Greece is insolvent and the
European Union needs to deal with that. It hasn&#8217;t yet come to
terms with that.&#8221; 
Kasman said the uncoordinated and sporadic response from
the region&#8217;s political leaders has &#8220;fed fears&#8221; in the markets
that they don&#8217;t have the wherewithal to deal with the region&#8217;s
fiscal problems. The lack of clarity in solving Greece&#8217;s credit
problems has exacerbated the problem. 
&#8220;Damage is done,&#8221; Kasman said. &#8220;Europe in our mind is
entering recession.&#8221; Greece is heading toward a depression, he
said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said poor risk-management, not sophisticated products,
is to blame for financial-company losses and failures. 
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t invest in risk-management, it doesn&#8217;t matter
what business you&#8217;re in, it&#8217;s a risky business,&#8221; Cohn said
today at a panel discussion in Washington sponsored by the
Institute of International Finance. 
The cause of financial-company collapses dating back to
Barings Plc or Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has &#8220;never been
sophisticated products, it&#8217;s been a risk-management issue or a
separation of duties problem&#8221; in which a trader was able to
manipulate operational controls in the back office, Cohn said. 
Goldman Sachs has a &#8220;robust separation of duties in our
organization&#8221; between traders and back-office administrators so
that traders can&#8217;t manipulate operational controls, he said.
&#8220;We have just continuously reiterated a farther divide in how
those people interact to make sure we&#8217;re protecting the assets
of the firm.&#8221; 
While Goldman Sachs allows employees to change jobs and
move into the trading business from the back office, Cohn said
the New York-based company ensures that those traders lose
access to administrative processes they had in the back office.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
dismissal of suits over employee bonuses filed in New York by
shareholders who called the awards a waste of assets. 
Security Police  Fire Professionals of America Retirement
Fund and Judith A. Miller sued the investment bank in December
2009, accusing directors and executives of breaching their
fiduciary duties by reserving half of the company&#8217;s net revenue
for employee compensation. Shareholders Ken Brown and Central
Laborers Pension Fund filed similar suits the following month. 
New York State Supreme Judge Bernard J. Fried ordered the
lawsuits dismissed on Sept. 21, according to court documents
filed today. The plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal in January
2010, after New York-based Goldman Sachs said its ratio of
compensation and benefits to net revenue for 2009 was its
&#8220;lowest as a public company,&#8221; Fried said in his ruling. 
Fried denied the plaintiffs&#8217; request for attorney fees and
expenses, and rejected a request from Brown -- who died in
December 2010 -- for an incentive fee award of $25,000. Brown&#8217;s
attorney, Lynda J. Grant, didn&#8217;t immediately return a voice-mail
message seeking comment on Fried&#8217;s ruling. 
Pay Record 
The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis. 
Goldman had a 2007 compensation and benefits expense of
$20.2 billion, or 43.9 percent of revenue, that came to an
average of $661,490 per employee, according to company reports.
The pay expense dropped to $10.9 billion, or 48 percent of
revenue, in 2008 and was $16.2 billion, or 36 percent of
revenue, in 2009. 
In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year. That was 9 percent less than in the same period in
2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent. 
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s
$19 million compensation for 2010, which included a $5.4 million
cash bonus, was almost double the prior year&#8217;s award even as
Goldman Sach&#8217;s profits fell. 
Blankfein and other firm executives agreed to forgo cash
bonuses in 2009 and take restricted stock grants as compensation
to mute criticism of the firm&#8217;s pay practices. Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year while the firm settled claims by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. 
The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators&#8217; claims that marketing materials about the
investments had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; 
Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. 
The cases are Brown v. Blankfein, 650003/2010, and Central
Laborers&#8217; Pension Fund v. Goldman Sachs, 600036/2010, both in
New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan).

Chevron Corp. (CVX) expects to make a
final decision in 2013 about how much more to invest in an
effort to add as many as 6 billion barrels of crude reserves to
an oil field shared by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. 
The second-largest U.S. energy company is moving ahead with
a pilot project by injecting steam into the Wafra field in a
border area between the neighboring countries after early work
showed &#8220;very promising&#8221; results, Kenneth Sniffen, a spokesman
for Saudi Arabian Chevron, said today in an interview in Manama,
Bahrain. Saudi Arabian Chevron is a fully owned subsidiary of
California-based Chevron Corp. 
&#8220;The Wafra field is mature, and it&#8217;s producing at a
declining rate,&#8221; Sniffen said. &#8220;We want to add 500,000 barrels
a day to whatever amount the field will be producing once
injecting steam is applied on a large scale.&#8221; 
Wafra will be the world&#8217;s largest project for recovering
oil through steam injection once Chevron applies the technique
to the entire field. The company hopes to be injecting steam
into most, if not all, of the deposit by 2017, Sniffen said. 
Chevron has injected steam to help produce crude at a field
in Bakersfield, California, for almost 50 years and at a deposit
in Indonesia for almost 30 years. Wafra yields about 240,000
barrels a day of light and heavy crudes, he said. 
Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, has 264.5
billion barrels of total proved crude reserves, according to the
BP Statistical Review of World Energy, published in June. Kuwait
has 101.5 billion barrels in reserves, according to the same
review.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drinks maker, plans to spend $3 billion to expand in Russia
in the next five years, doubling its investment in the country,
said Ahmet Bozer, president of the company&#8217;s business in Eurasia
and Africa. 
Coca-Cola will expand production and sales capacity
countrywide after first-half volume rose 16 percent in Russia,
Bozer said today by phone from the southern Rostov region, where
the company opened a plant today. Bozer is Coca-Cola&#8217;s president
for its Eurasia and Africa unit. 
Russians drink about 69 eight-ounce servings of Coca-Cola
products a year, compared with an average 89 worldwide. The
company has sought sales growth from Russia since the collapse
of the Soviet Union in 1991. U.S. consumers each guzzled 394
servings last year on average. 
&#8220;Russia has a long time to go before reaching any
ceiling,&#8221; Bozer said. He is visiting the carbonated-beverage
factory with Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. 
The Atlanta-based company, which acquired Russian juice
makers Nidan and Multon in the past six years, doesn&#8217;t have
acquisitions targeted in Russia now, Bozer said. 
PepsiCo Inc. bought Wimm-Bill-Dann, Russia&#8217;s biggest food
and beverage company, this year, taking the lead in Russia&#8217;s
juice and dairy market over Coca-Cola.

Hedge fund Oasis Management LLC
sued Morgan Stanley for C$9.5 million ($9.3 million) over
options in Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) bought before the Toronto-listed
timber company&#8217;s stock plunged 71 percent in two days in June. 
Morgan Stanley failed to settle the options contracts in an
effort to &#8220;limit its liability,&#8221; Oasis said in a lawsuit filed
in London in July. Hong Kong-based Oasis bought options to sell
Sino-Forest at C$19 on May 12, three weeks before shares fell to
C$5.22 on allegations it had overstated forestry holdings. 
Shares in Sino-Forest have fallen 74 percent since June 1,
the day before short-seller Carson Block&#8217;s Muddy Waters LLC
research firm said the company had overstated its holdings.
While investors including hedge fund manager John Paulson and
billionaire Richard Chandler took losses when Sino-Forest shares
sank, holders of put contracts could reap returns from selling
stock at prices far above the present value. 
The Oasis deal will cost Morgan Stanley (MS) C$7.5 million to
settle, the hedge fund said in its court filing. The put options
are valued at C$9.5 million, compared with C$2 million for the
equivalent shares, it said in the lawsuit. Oasis paid Morgan
Stanley a premium of C$770,000 for the options in May. 
New York-based Morgan Stanley claimed the options were
terminated because trading in Sino-Forest&#8217;s shares was
suspended, Oasis lawyers said in the filing. The bank offered
Oasis C$3.8 million to cancel the deal, the hedge fund said in
the lawsuit. 
Morgan Stanley spokesman Michael Wang declined to comment
Sept. 23. Katie Bolton, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Oasis,
declined to comment.

Citigroup Sued by IKB Over $4.2 Million in Mortgage Notes 
Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-largest U.S. bank, was sued for
fraud by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG over a sale of $4.2
million in residential mortgage-backed securities. 
An IKB unit took part in the purchase of million of notes
in a transaction underwritten and sold by New York-based
Citigroup, according to court papers filed Sept. 22 in New York
State Supreme Court in Manhattan. 
IKB, based in Dusseldorf, accused Citigroup of fraud,
negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment and breach of
contract in the one-page filing. The German lender asked a judge
to rescind the sale and award unspecified punitive damages. 
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a spokeswoman for Citigroup,
declined to comment on the complaint. 
The case is IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (IKB) v. Citigroup
Inc., 652609/2011, Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York (Manhattan). 
Ex-NBA Player Tate George Charged in $2 Million Ponzi Scheme 
Tate George, a former player with the National Basketball
Association&#8217;s New Jersey Nets and Milwaukee Bucks, was charged
with running a $2 million Ponzi scheme that targeted former
professional athletes. 
George, 43, raised more than $2 million for his company,
The George Group, after telling investors his real-estate
development portfolio was worth $500 million, according to a
Federal Bureau of Investigation complaint charging him with wire
fraud. 
&#8220;In reality, The George Group had virtually no income
generating operations,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a
statement. 
George used the money he raised to pay early investors in
his company and to fund living expenses such as mortgage and
child-support payments, restaurant meals, clothing and gas,
according to the FBI complaint. 
George faces as many as 20 years in prison for the scheme,
which prosecutors said ran from 2005 to March. His attorney,
Thomas Ashley, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment.

Silvercorp Sues Chinastockwatch.com Over Stock Manipulation 
Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM), a Canadian miner of silver in
China, sued two websites and their operators for allegedly
spreading false information in an effort to drive down the
company&#8217;s stock price. 
Chinastockwatch.com, a New York-based website that posts
reports on public companies, and operator Jerry Katz published
&#8220;false, defamatory and fraudulent statements,&#8221; Silvercorp said
in the complaint filed Sept. 22 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan. 
Alfredlittle.com, website operator Alfred Little and an
editor, Simon Moore, also were named as defendants in the
lawsuit. Silvercorp seeks punitive damages of at least $10
million and compensatory damages of more than $1 million. 
The defendants sought &#8220;to artificially drive down the price
of Silvercorp common stock in order to obtain illicit profits on
short sales,&#8221; the Vancouver-based company said in the
complaint. Short investors sell borrowed shares with plans to
buy them back later at a lower price. 
No contact information was listed on Chinastockwatch.com
and Katz couldn&#8217;t be immediately reached to comment on the
lawsuit. The complaint is &#8220;frivolous&#8221; and Alfredlittle.com has
&#8220;nothing to do with&#8221; Chinastockwatch.com, Moore said. 
&#8220;Every statement that was made in every single report that
was published on Silvercorp from Alfredlittle.com is completely
factual,&#8221; Moore said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Absolutely
nothing in any of our previous reports on other companies that
we&#8217;ve published on including Silvercorp has ever been
exaggerated.&#8221;

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
ATT Judge Sets Expert Reports Deadlines in Antitrust Case 
The judge overseeing the U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s
antitrust lawsuit seeking to block ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s $39 billion
takeover of T-Mobile USA Inc. gave both sides until Dec. 28 to
file reports by expert witnesses. 
Responses to those reports must be filed by Jan. 9,
according to the order issued Sept. 23 by U.S. District Judge
Ellen Segal Huvelle. Rebuttal reports must be delivered by Jan.
16, according to the order. 
The judge&#8217;s order resolved a dispute between the government
and ATT over deadlines for the expert reports. On Sept. 23 the
U.S. Justice Department asked Huvelle to give it until Jan. 5 to
prepare its reports, while ATT had pressed for a Nov. 15
deadline. The trial is set to begin Feb. 13. 
The expert reports will likely be central to the case, said
Howard University law professor Andrew Gavil. 
&#8220;The government will have to lay out how the merger will
be anticompetitive and the only way to present those models is
with economists,&#8221; Gavil said in a phone interview. &#8220;To the
extent there is a difference of opinion between the government
and ATT, this is the area that is likely to heat up and be
critical ground for discussion.&#8221; 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. Last week, seven states joined the government&#8217;s
effort to block the deal. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
Madoff Trustee Renews $91 Million Sterling Partner Suit 
The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm filed a revised
lawsuit against money management firm American Securities LP
that demanded $91.9 million dollars of funds taken out of the
con man&#8217;s firm since January 2000. 
American Securities, after meeting Fred Wilpon and Saul
Katz, owners of the New York Mets Major League Baseball team,
joined with their Sterling Equities Inc. in 1991 to create a
$4.5 billion-asset real estate investment company, Sterling
American Property Inc., according to Madoff trustee Irving
Picard. Madoff was among the investors, Picard said in a court
filing Sept. 23. 
Closely held American Securities and its executives had
access to the con man and should have responded to so-called red
flags warning of fraud, Picard said in an amended complaint
filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
Of the money Picard is demanding, about $10 million was
fake profit, he said. 
A call seeking comment on the complaint from Charles Klein,
a founder and managing director of American Securities, wasn&#8217;t
immediately returned. 
Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina. 
The case is Picard v. American Securities, 1:10-ap-05415,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
News Corp. (NWSA) to Be Sued in U.S. by Victims of Phone Hacking 
News Corp. (NWS) directors will be sued in the U.S. by victims of
phone hacking by reporters at the News of the World tabloid, a
lawyer said. 
Legal action will be started in the U.S. within 10 days,
Mark Lewis, a lawyer representing phone-hacking victims in
London, said in an interview broadcast on Sky News Sept.23. 
Lewis represents phone-hacking victims including the family
of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Revelations that Dowler&#8217;s
mobile-phone messages were deleted while she was missing in 2002
led to the closure of the News of the World and forced News
Corp. to drop a takeover bid for British Sky Broadcasting Group
Plc. (BSY) 
U.S. lawyers will make the final decisions on the
defendants to include in the lawsuit, Lewis said in a separate
interview on BBC News. He said that lawyers are looking at areas
that should have been part of the knowledge of directors of a
large corporation. Lawyers would seek to speak with News Corp.
Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Deputy Chief Operating Officer James
Murdoch, Lewis said. 
Miranda Higham, a spokeswoman for News Corp. in London,
declined to comment on the U.S. lawsuits. Lewis didn&#8217;t return a
call from Bloomberg News seeking comment.

Trials/Appeals 
Obama Health-Care Law Leaves Appeals Court With Questions 
President Barack Obama&#8217;s health-care law got a mixed
reception in its fourth review by a federal appeals court as
three judges grappled with questions about the law&#8217;s
constitutionality and their own authority to rule on it. 
In a two-hour argument Sept. 23 in Washington, two judges
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit said a ruling upholding the law, which requires that
most Americans buy insurance or face a tax penalty, could leave
the government with unprecedented power over its citizens. 
&#8220;In 220 years there has been a whole lot of laws and a lot
of crises, yet Congress has never once mandated a purchase,&#8221;
said Judge Brett Kavanaugh, adding that the &#8220;lurking next
step&#8221; might be a law requiring investment in private retirement
accounts. 
Kavanaugh also questioned whether federal courts could rule
on the law before any taxpayer had been assessed a penalty. 
The Washington appellate panel may be the last to rule on
the law before it reaches U.S. Supreme Court. The Obama
administration must signal next week whether it will seek high
court review of another court&#8217;s opinion declaring the insurance
mandate unconstitutional. 
Two federal appeals courts have ruled on the insurance
mandate. A Cincinnati panel in June decided Congress&#8217;s authority
to regulate interstate commerce extended to enacting the
insurance mandate. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta threw
out the mandate on Aug. 12, concluding Congress can&#8217;t compel
people to buy a product for their entire lives. 
An appeals panel in Richmond, Virginia, decided on Sept. 8
that it was blocked by a statute that generally bars challenging
taxes before they&#8217;re collected or assessed. 
The case argued Sept. 23 was brought in June 2010 by five
individuals who claimed they and their families could face
collective penalties of more than $27,000 for failing to obtain
insurance. 
U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler in February dismissed
their suit, finding the mandate constitutional. 
The U.S. calls the insurance mandate the linchpin of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, claiming that
without expanding the pool of younger, healthier customers the
insurance industry can&#8217;t meet its obligations for coverage under
the law. 
The case is Seven-Sky v. Holder, 11-5047, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington).

A Pennsylvania appeals court ruling has raised questions
about who can claim ownership of natural gas embedded in the
Marcellus shale formation, potentially putting in doubt the
legitimacy of thousands of drilling leases, Bloomberg News&#8217; Jim
Polson and Mike Lee report. 
The state&#8217;s Superior Court said Pennsylvania law governing
ownership of oil and gas rights isn&#8217;t clear and a lower-court
judge should solicit expert opinions in a case pitting current
landowners against the heirs to an 1881 deed. 
&#8220;Dozens of energy companies have invested billions of
dollars in leasing shale gas production rights in
Pennsylvania,&#8221; Larry Nettles, an attorney with the Houston-
based law firm Vinson  Elkins LLP, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;This opinion calls into question whether they have
those rights.&#8221; 
For more than a century, Pennsylvania has required
landowners to consider oil and gas rights separate from more
general &#8220;mineral rights&#8221; when transferring ownership of
resources beneath the surface of their property. The defendants
in the title dispute argued shale gas is different and should be
considered part of the mineral rights because it is contained
inside rock. 
The Superior Court, the second-highest court in the state,
ruled Sept. 7 that current law doesn&#8217;t sufficiently address
whether &#8220;Marcellus shale constitutes a mineral,&#8221; the question
that&#8217;s now to be hashed out by the lower court. 
Until the case is decided, oil and gas companies will face
uncertainty about whether they&#8217;ve signed drilling leases with
the right people, legal experts say. Owners of oil and gas
rights who signed leases with gas producers could find that they
don&#8217;t own the gas after all. 
&#8220;If, somehow, shale gas is different, that would be a sea
change in Pennsylvania law,&#8221; David Fine, a Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania-based attorney for KL Gates LLP, said Sept. 22 in
a telephone interview. &#8220;The issue is whether they&#8217;ve entered
into a lease with someone and somebody else is going to find a
problem with the title.&#8221; 
The case may take as long as two years to wind through the
courts, Fine said. 
The case is John E. and Mary Josephine Butler v. Charles
Powers Estate et al, 1795-mda-2010, Superior Court of
Pennsylvania.

Verdicts/Settlements 
Potash Producer Civil Antitrust Suit Rejected by U.S. Court 
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and six other producers
of the fertilizer chemical won a U.S. appeals court ruling
rejecting purchaser claims they were conspiring to fix prices in
violation of federal antitrust laws. 
The buyers sued in 2008, claiming violations of the U.S.
Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, which can extend the
reach of American antitrust law to foreign anticompetitive
conduct that affects U.S. imports. 
The Chicago-based court ruled that Minn-Chem Inc. and its
co-plaintiffs failed to state a plausible &#8220;direct, substantial
and reasonably foreseeable,&#8221; link between the allegedly anti-
competitive activity of the producers -- all of whose mining
operations are based in Canada, Russia or Belarus -- and the
U.S. market for their product. 
&#8220;All of the anticompetitive conduct identified in the
complaint is alleged to have occurred outside the United
States,&#8221; U.S. Circuit Judge Diane Sykes wrote in the court&#8217;s
unanimous 27-page decision. 
Also named as defendants in the case were Calgary-based
Agrium Inc. (AGU), Plymouth, Minnesota-based The Mosaic Co. (MOS), as well
as Russian and Belarussian companies. As of 2008, they accounted
for about 71 percent of the world&#8217;s supply of potash, according
to the Sept. 23 court ruling. 
&#8220;We are evaluating the opinion and making decisions
about what we will be doing,&#8221; San Francisco attorney Bruce
Simon, who argued the case for the purchasers on June 3, said
Sept. 23 in a phone interview. He declined to comment further. 
&#8220;We believe the court made the right ruling,&#8221; Rob Litt, a
spokesman for The Mosaic Co., said in a phone interview. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re certainly very pleased with the decision of the
court,&#8221; said Bill Johnson, a spokesman for Saskatoon-based
Potash Corp. 
The case is Minn-Chem Inc. v. Agrium Inc., 10-1712, U.S.
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Chicago). 
Emanuel Goffer Seeks Prison Term of Less Than 46 Months 
Emanuel Goffer, convicted of insider trading with his
brother Zvi Goffer, is seeking a prison term of less than 46
months, saying he plays a critical role in raising a 3-year-old
son with developmental problems. 
Emanuel Goffer is set to be sentenced Oct. 7 before U.S.
District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan, who imposed a 10-
year prison term on his brother this week. 
In court papers filed Sept. 23, Emanuel Goffer asked for a
&#8220;tempered sentence&#8221; shorter than the 46- to 57-month federal
sentencing guidelines range calculated by U.S. probation
officials. Goffer said in the filings that his son isn&#8217;t meeting
&#8220;age appropriate gross motor milestones.&#8221; 
Goffer also disputes a U.S. finding that he earned more
than $2 million by insider trading. 
Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for the office of U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara, declined to comment. 
The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) and Intel Corp. (INTC) will invest $4.4 billion over five years
to create a hub for next-generation computer chip technology in
New York, the state&#8217;s Governor Andrew Cuomo, said. 
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, will
spend $3.6 billion to develop computer chips using 22-nanometer
and 14-nanometer process technology, said Michael Loughran, a
company spokesman. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter and
measures the size of transistors in a chip. Lower numbers
indicate more advanced technology. 
Intel Corp., IBM, Globalfoundries Inc., Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. will
focus on transforming 300-millimeter wafer technology into 450-
millimeter technology, which will produce twice the number of
chips, according to a statement from Cuomo&#8217;s office. 
&#8220;This is really all about the computing systems IBM and
others will construct using advanced technologies,&#8221; John Kelly,
senior vice president and director of research at Armonk, New
York-based IBM, said at a press conference in Albany. &#8220;This
will create computers that will help doctors diagnose advanced
diseases.&#8221; 
The investment will retain and create 6,900 jobs in the
state, including 2,500 new technology roles, according to the
statement. 
To support the project, the state will make a $400 million
investment in the State University of New York College of
Nanoscale Science and Engineering in Albany, the statement said. 
&#8216;Unprecedented Investment&#8217; 
Research and development facilities located in Canandaigua,
Utica, East Fishkill and Yorktown Heights also will receive
cash, according to the statement. 
&#8220;This unprecedented investment in New York&#8217;s economy will
create thousands of jobs and make the state the epicenter for
the next generation of computer chip technology,&#8221; Cuomo said in
the statement. 
IBM rose $3.20, or 1.8 percent, to $177.71 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are up 21
percent this year. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California,
gained 30 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $22.54 in trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.

The Italian city of Cassino was
ordered by a court to disclose the terms of a settlement it
reached with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to terminate a derivative that
cost taxpayers as much as 2 million euros ($2.7 million). 
An administrative court published a ruling yesterday saying
Bloomberg News should be granted access to the swaps contracts
and settlement after a lawsuit under the country&#8217;s freedom-of-
information laws. The central Italian city and the bank agreed
to end the swaps contract in 2009 without disclosing the terms. 
Faced with shrinking income and growing expenses, cities
throughout Italy bought swaps to cut their short-term interest
expenses, while putting them at the risk of rising interest
costs. About 300 were losing a total of 912 million euros on
derivatives as of March, Bank of Italy data show. 
&#8220;This ruling will create a precedent,&#8221; said Elio Lannutti, a senator and member of the opposition Italian Values
party, who also heads the Adusbef consumer group. &#8220;This ruling
re-establishes the law, which was violated by the obscure
dealings that prohibit taxpayers from choosing and judging their
local administrations and their relations with banks.&#8221; 
The city of 33,000, and site of heavy fighting during World
War II, sought to keep the settlement secret, citing a
confidentiality clause in its agreement with JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. lender by assets. 
The city will comply with the court order once received,
said Enzo Salera, Cassino&#8217;s finance chief. The city can still
appeal to the country&#8217;s highest administrative court, the
Council of State. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. 
&#8216;Greater Transparency&#8217; 
&#8220;The taxpayers of Cassino deserve to understand how the
government managed to lose millions of dollars in their
interest-rate swap with JPMorgan,&#8221; said Matthew Winkler,
editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News. &#8220;We continue to seek greater
transparency, accountability and disclosure of the financial
terms in this case to shed light on how taxpayer money is being
used.&#8221; 
In 2003, Cassino entered a seven-year swap with Bear
Stearns Cos., which JPMorgan bought in 2008, to adjust payments
on about 22 million euros of debt. The swap switched the city&#8217;s
4.7 percent fixed interest rate payment for a variable rate,
according to a June 2009 report by Italy&#8217;s financial police. 
The city paid a floating rate based on the U.S.-dollar
London interbank offered rate, an &#8220;extremely risky&#8221; bet given
that Libor was at a record low, police said in testimony to the
Italian Senate. 
Dollar Libor 
Three-month U.S. dollar Libor was at a 1 percent in June
2003 and by January 2006 had surpassed 4.7 percent, according to
data compiled by the British Bankers&#8217; Association. The measure
climbed as high as 5.7 percent in September 2007 as credit
markets began to seize up, before declining to a record low of
0.25 percent by December 2009 after policy makers cut rates. 
JPMorgan was named an interested party in the lawsuit
because of the potential impact on the firm. The bank is
separately on trial in Italy in the first European criminal case
involving swaps. Together with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Depfa Bank Plc
and UBS AG, JPMorgan faces charges in Milan for fraud for
tricking the municipal government into buying the contracts. The
lenders deny the allegations. 
In a judgment published earlier this month, Italy&#8217;s highest
administrative court ruled that Pisa&#8217;s provincial government has
the right to annul swaps contracts with Dexia Crediop SpA and
Depfa Bank Plc. 
Bloomberg News also sued the European Central Bank in
December to make it release documents showing how Greece used
derivatives to hide its fiscal deficit and helped trigger the
region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. The case is pending.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) says it will be
able to book oil and gas reserves it finds in an Arctic and
Black Sea venture with OAO Rosneft even though its Russian
state-run partner owns the licenses. 
&#8220;We see this as one of the most prospective areas for
exploration in the whole world,&#8221; Glenn Waller, Exxon&#8217;s head of
Russia, told reporters today at the Sakhalin Oil and Gas 2011
conference in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. &#8220;That is what is driving us.
Access to new resources.&#8221; 
Exxon agreed to form a venture with Rosneft on Aug. 30,
pledging to spend $3.2 billion exploring for oil and gas in
Russia&#8217;s Arctic Kara Sea and deep-water Black Sea. Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin is encouraging partnerships with
international explorers to maintain output at a world-leading 10
million barrels a day for the next decade. Putin said the Exxon-
Rosneft alliance may lead to $500 billion in investment. 
The west Siberian basin that&#8217;s the source of more than half
Russia&#8217;s oil output extends north under the Kara Sea, according
to Waller. Rosneft selected Exxon for the Arctic blocks after a
planned venture and share swap with BP Plc collapsed in May. 
Exxon Confident 
&#8220;We are confident that we will be able to book those
reserves that belong to us&#8221; under stock exchange rules,
following the exploration period, Waller said. Rosneft holds the
license, and almost 67 percent of the exploration venture, while
Exxon has 33 percent. 
Exxon and Rosneft aim to drill the first exploration well
in 2015, according to a Rosneft presentation. 
The partners will hold &#8220;step-by-step&#8221; talks with the
state as they seek tax incentives to make the challenging
project profitable, Waller said. The Kara Sea is icebound for
much of the year, and projects in its Arctic waters will need to
contend with nuclear waste from former test sites and dumps,
according to Waller&#8217;s presentation at the conference. 
The government understands it needs to change some taxes to
make the projects effective, Waller said. 
Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil producer, will decide in the
first half on an offer from Exxon to join projects in areas
including Texas, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, he said. Rosneft
and Exxon don&#8217;t plan to bring in other partners for now, he
said.

Morgan Stanley (MS) said Brent oil will

because of increasing supply and a weaker demand outlook. 
Production capacity in the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries will climb almost 800,000 barrels a day in
2012, led by the return of Libyan fields, Morgan Stanley
analysts led by New York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report
today. Non-OPEC output will rise 225,000 barrels. 
Slowing global economic growth will result in reducing
demand growth, the analysts said. Consumption will advance
600,000 barrels a day in 2012, down from a 950,000 gain this
year and 2.7 million barrel advance in 2010. 
Brent oil for November settlement fell $3.33, or 3.1

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) passed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in market value based on closing
share prices to become the world&#8217;s second-most valuable
technology company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
IBM rose $1.62 to $179.17 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange, giving it a market value of $214 billion. Microsoft
fell 13 cents to $25.45 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, giving it a
market value of $213.2 billion. 
It&#8217;s the first time since 1996 that IBM closed ahead of
Microsoft, though IBM had passed the software company on an
intraday basis in May. Microsoft was worth three times as much
as IBM in 2000. 
IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano divested the
company&#8217;s PC business six years ago, calling it commoditized, to
invest in software and services. Microsoft, whose Windows and
Office software are used primarily on PCs, lost its spot as the
most valuable technology company last year to Apple Inc. (AAPL), as
sales of iPad tablets and iPhones crimped PC demand. Apple is
now the world&#8217;s most valuable company, with a market value of
$422.9 billion. 
IBM&#8217;s stock has gained 22 percent this year, while
Microsoft&#8217;s has dropped 9 percent.

who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. 
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is promoting the Xbox
360 console as a way to switch easily between games, DVDs and
pay TV. He said on Sept. 14 that by Christmas, Microsoft will
add the Bing search engine to the Xbox and use its Kinect
controller&#8217;s voice recognition to sift through shows on the Web. 
&#8220;We all know the frustrations of using guides and menus
and controllers, and we think a better way to do all of this is
simply to bring Bing and voice to Xbox,&#8221; Ballmer said at a
developers conference. &#8220;You say it, Xbox finds it.&#8221; 
Microsoft also expects to sign deals with Time Warner
Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s HBO cable channel, Sony Pictures Entertainment&#8217;s Crackle
streaming service, NBC Universal&#8217;s Bravo and Syfy channels and
Lovefilm UK, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the person said. 
Wayne Hickey, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment, as did Bobbi Henson, a spokeswoman for Verizon, and
Jennifer Khoury of Comcast, which controls NBC. Greg Belloni, a
Sony spokesman, had no immediate comment. Dorothy Jean, a
spokeswoman for Lovefilm, declined to comment. An HBO
spokesperson declined to comment. 
Pay-TV Tether 
The new applications from Philadelphia-based Comcast&#8217;s
Xfinity TV service and New York-based Verizon&#8217;s FiOs would
require users to prove they already are pay-TV customers in
regions where the services operate, two of the people said. 
The Xbox 360 plays DVDs and video games, and owners can pay
$60 a year for the Xbox Live premium service, which allows for
multi-user play over Web. Console owners can also add
subscriptions to Netflix Inc. (NFLX)&#8217;s and Hulu LLC&#8217;s online film and
television services, and pay-TV through ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s U-verse in
its markets. 
The surge in online entertainment has thrust the Xbox 360
and its console rival, Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 3, into
competition with other Web-connected devices in the home, from
DVRs to television sets. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Moves 
Since last year, Microsoft has integrated social networking
features into Xbox Live, letting viewers chat with each other
while watching movies and shows. The company announced in June
that 35 million people used its paid Xbox Live service around
the world, spending an average of 60 hours a month playing games
and watching entertainment. 
Comcast had 22.5 million pay-TV customers as of June 30.
Verizon Fios had 3.8 million. 
Cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast are
looking to stem defections by putting their services on more
devices and making it easier for them watch. 
In June, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts demonstrated a TV
interface called Xcalibur that uses Web-connected servers to
forgo the need for a set-top box at all. 
Microsoft fell 9 cents to $25.58 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. Comcast lost 33 cents to $22. Verizon slid 5
cents to $36.84 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) passed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become the world&#8217;s second-most
valuable technology company, a reflection of industry changes
including the shift away from the personal computer. 
IBM&#8217;s market value rose to $214 billion yesterday, while
Microsoft&#8217;s fell to $213.2 billion. It&#8217;s the first time IBM has
exceeded its software rival based on closing prices since 1996,
according to Bloomberg data. IBM became the fourth-largest
company by market value, based on yesterday&#8217;s closing price,
and, in technology, trails only Apple Inc. (AAPL) 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano sold IBM&#8217;s PC
business six years ago to focus on corporate software and
services. Though Microsoft has expanded into online advertising
and games, it gets most of its revenue and earnings from the
Windows and Office software used primarily on PCs. 
&#8220;IBM went beyond technology,&#8221; said Ted Schadler, an
analyst with Forrester Research Inc. &#8220;They were early to
recognize that computing was moving way beyond these boxes on
our desks.&#8221; 
IBM remained ahead of Microsoft for a second day today,
sliding $4.30 to $174.87 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, as Microsoft dropped 56 cents to $24.89 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has
gained 19 percent this year, while Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Washington, has fallen 11 percent. 
Apple, which long competed against IBM and Microsoft in the
PC business, passed Microsoft in market value last year, on
rising sales of iPhones, iPods and iPads. Apple&#8217;s market
capitalization is $353.5 billion based on today&#8217;s close. 
Palmisano&#8217;s Strategy 
Palmisano, who is also chairman, has spent his nine years
at the helm sharpening the company&#8217;s focus on software and
services for corporations and government. Once known as the
world&#8217;s largest computer company, IBM in 2005 sold its PC unit
to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), calling it &#8220;commoditized.&#8221; The company
has spent more than $25 billion investing in its software,
computer-services and consulting businesses. 
The maneuvers have helped increase per-share profit for
more than 30 straight quarters. Palmisano has boosted sales by
20 percent from 2001 through last year, while keeping the costs
of the 426,000-employee company little changed. IBM pulled in
more than half of its $99.9 billion in revenue last year from
services and is now the world&#8217;s largest computer-services
provider. 
The company is betting it can add another $20 billion to
revenue through 2015. Palmisano is investing in emerging markets
and analytics, as well as cloud-computing and an initiative
called Smarter Planet to connect roads, electrical systems and
other infrastructure to the Internet. 
Railways, Waterways 
&#8220;Computing is now found in things that no one thinks of as
&#8216;computers&#8217;,&#8221; said Palmisano at a trade show keynote in
February. &#8220;Today, there are nearly a billion transistors per
human, and each one costs one ten-millionth of a cent. Yes, some
of these transistors are going into servers, PCs, smart phones,
MP3 players and tablets. But an increasing number of them are
going into appliances and automobiles, power grids, roadways,
railways and waterways.&#8221; 
IBM plans to almost double operating earnings to at least
$20 a share in 2015. Investors have taken notice: Shares have
climbed 35 percent since the company first announced the goal in
May 2010. 
Microsoft&#8217;s Slump 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software company, was worth
three times as much as IBM in January 2000 and hit a market
capitalization of more than $430 billion in July 2000, according
to Bloomberg data. Microsoft fell to about $135 billion in March
2009 during the economic downturn, before recovering with the
market. 
Microsoft, which had $69.9 billion in revenue for the
fiscal year ending in June, got about 60 percent of its sales
from the Windows and Office units in the most recent quarter. 
&#8220;They were trapped in the classic innovator&#8217;s dilemma&#8221;
because their software business was so good,&#8221; said Schadler.
&#8220;The bet that Microsoft made in the PC business was to double
down and double down and double down.&#8221; 
CEO Steve Ballmer said investors may not appreciate the
company&#8217;s progress in other businesses, including server
software and online versions of Office, given the higher profile
of its consumer businesses. 
&#8220;People are saying, &#8216;Where do you go next?&#8217;,&#8221; said
Ballmer at the company&#8217;s annual meeting in November. There
probably isn&#8217;t &#8220;as much appreciation for the incredible growth
and success we&#8217;ve had with enterprises since people relate
better to the consumer market. But it&#8217;s great products with
great earnings and particularly in some high-visibility
categories.&#8221; 
Xbox, Bing 
The company&#8217;s server software and Office divisions boosted
sales last quarter, as did the entertainment division, which
includes its Xbox games business. Revenue at the online services
division, including the Bing search engine, climbed to $662
million, while its operating loss widened to $728 million. 
Microsoft also cut a deal with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) this year to make
its Windows Phone the primary operating system for the company&#8217;s
smartphones. The deal is designed to help both companies compete
against Apple and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system, which
is available for free to handset makers such as Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. 
Mobile and Cloud 
IBM briefly passed Microsoft in market value rank on an
intraday basis in May, and the companies may continue to switch
positions, said Joel Achramowicz, an analyst for Blaylock Robert
Van LLC in Oakland, California. While IBM has largely convinced
investors it can execute its stable growth strategy, Microsoft
has to prove it can move beyond PCs to tackle the mobile and
cloud computing markets, he said. 
&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re on the cusp of a major offensive move on
the part of Microsoft to position itself with some significant
leadership, this time in the mobile sector,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Investors are skeptical, so the opportunity here is actually
bigger for Microsoft than it is for IBM.&#8221; 
Still, mobile computing is unlikely to ever be as
profitable for Microsoft as the PC business, said Forrester&#8217;s
Schadler. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re never going to win in that business the way they
did in the PC business,&#8221; he said.

Morgan Stanley (MS), which owns the
world&#8217;s largest retail brokerage, is being priced in the credit-
default swaps market as less creditworthy than most U.S., U.K.
and French banks and as risky as Italy&#8217;s biggest lenders. 
The cost of buying the swaps, or CDS, which offer
protection against a default of New York-based Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
debt for five years, surged to 488 basis points as of 4:20 p.m.
in New York, or $488,000, for every $10 million of debt insured,
from 305 basis points on Sept. 15, according to prices provided
by London-based CMA. Italy&#8217;s Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) had CDS trading
at 422 basis points, and UniCredit SpA (UCG) at 426, the data show. A
basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. 
&#8220;The CDS spreads are making investors and creditors
nervous&#8221; about Morgan Stanley, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York who rates the company&#8217;s
stock &#8220;outperform,&#8221; in an e-mail. 
The price of Morgan Stanley credit-default swaps continued
to climb earlier this week even when the firm&#8217;s shares rose. The
stock, which yesterday jumped 6.6 percent, today dropped $1.58,
or 10 percent, to $13.51 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, the biggest drop in the 81-company SP 500 Financials
Index. Shares are down 50 percent since the start of the year. 
Implied Risk 
Moody&#8217;s Analytics, an arm of Moody&#8217;s Investors Service
that&#8217;s separate from the company&#8217;s credit-rating business, said
in a report yesterday that Morgan Stanley&#8217;s CDS prices imply
that investors see the bank&#8217;s credit rating as having declined
to Ba2 from Ba1 in the last month. The company is actually rated
six grades higher at A2 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. 
By comparison, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and France&#8217;s Societe
Generale (GLE) SA, which have CDS trading at 421 basis points and 340
basis points respectively, have prices that imply a rating of
Ba1, higher than the implied rating on Morgan Stanley, said
Allerton Smith, a banking-risk analyst at Moody&#8217;s Analytics in
New York. 
Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley in New York,
declined to comment. 
Morgan Stanley was the biggest recipient of emergency loans
from the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis and also
benefited from capital provided by Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., now the biggest shareholder, and the U.S.
Treasury, which it repaid with interest. 
2008 Peak 
While the price of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit-default swaps is
at the highest level since March 2009, it&#8217;s nowhere near the
peak reached in 2008. On Oct. 10 of that year, the annual price
for five-year protection rose to the equivalent of 1,300 basis
points, according to data provided by CMA, a unit of CME Group
Inc. that compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. 
The credit-default swaps market can be thinly traded, and
the recent jump in prices may reflect no more than a single big
counterparty seeking to hedge contracts, said Hintz, a former
Morgan Stanley treasurer. Morgan Stanley, one of the biggest
traders of CDS among U.S. banks, doesn&#8217;t make a market in its
own swaps, according to Smith of Moody&#8217;s Analytics. 
The CDS market has features &#8220;that may not exist in other
markets like the bond market or the equities market,&#8221; Smith
said in a telephone interview. Having fewer participants trading
in the Morgan Stanley name could result in a &#8220;disproportionate
spread movement,&#8221; he said. 
Trading Volume 
The daily average trading volume in Morgan Stanley shares
over the last three months is 27 million shares, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. By contrast, a three-month study
released this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found
that most single-name CDS trade less than once a day, while the
most active trade more than 20 times per day. 
Trading in Morgan Stanley credit-default swaps has risen to
257 contracts last week, compared with 187 for Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), according to the Depository Trust  Clearing Corp.
That compares with a weekly average of 73 trades in Morgan
Stanley and 91 in Goldman Sachs in the six months that ended on
Aug. 26, DTCC data show. 
There was a net $4.6 billion of protection bought and sold
on Morgan Stanley debt as of Sept. 23, according to DTCC. Even
with the higher trading volume, investor skittishness in the
face of Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis may be leaving few market
participants willing to sell CDS protection to meet the demand
for hedges, said Hintz. 
&#8220;With the EU teetering, few other firms are going to jump
in and write CDS on a global capital markets player like MS,&#8221;
Hintz said in his e-mail, referring to the European Union and to
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s stock-market ticker symbol. 
Trading Decline 
The rise in Morgan Stanley&#8217;s CDS prices may also relate to
an expected decline in third-quarter trading revenue or to the
company&#8217;s exposure to French banks, Smith said. 
Ruth Porat, the bank&#8217;s chief financial officer, said at an
investor conference on Sept. 13 that the fixed-income trading
environment in the third-quarter was worse than 2010&#8217;s fourth
quarter, when Morgan Stanley posted its lowest debt-trading
revenue since the 2008 crisis. The company, led by Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, reported second-quarter
revenue from both investment banking and fixed-income trading
that beat rival Goldman Sachs for the first time on record. 
Morgan Stanley had $39 billion of cross-border exposure to
French banks at the end of December before accounting for
offsetting hedges and collateral, according to an annual filing
with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. Cross-border
outstandings include cash deposits, receivables, loans and
securities, as well as short-term collateralized loans of
securities or cash known as repurchase agreements or reverse
repurchase agreements. 
&#8216;Galloping Wider&#8217; 
While Morgan Stanley hasn&#8217;t updated those figures, Hintz
estimated in a Sept. 23 note to investors that the bank&#8217;s total
risk to France and that country&#8217;s lenders is less than $2
billion when collateral and hedges are included. Morgan Stanley
currently has zero exposure to France, including French banks,
after hedges and collateral are factored in, according to a
person close to the firm. 
As of June 30, Morgan Stanley had about $5 billion of
funded exposure to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain,
which was reduced to about $2 billion when offsetting hedges
were accounted for, according to a regulatory filing. The
company also had about $2 billion in overnight deposits in banks
in those countries and about $1.5 billion of unfunded loans to
companies in those countries, the filing shows. 
&#8220;Their spreads just are galloping wider,&#8221; Smith said.
&#8220;Is it rational that Morgan Stanley CDS spreads would be wider
than French bank CDS spreads if the concern is exposure to
French banks? I don&#8217;t think that makes perfect sense.&#8221; 
Bond Yield Climbs 
Goldman Sachs, which like Morgan Stanley converted from a
securities firm to a bank in 2008, had $38.5 billion of gross
cross-border exposure to French banks as of June 30, according
to a regulatory filing. The firm&#8217;s five-year credit-default
swaps traded at 330 basis points as of 4:20 p.m., according to
CMA. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 10-year debt has also shown signs that
investors are growing concerned. The yield on the company&#8217;s $1.5
billion of 5.5 percent senior unsecured notes that comes due in
July 2021 has climbed to 6.57 percent from 5.46 percent on Sept.
15, according to prices reported by Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 
That&#8217;s still lower than the 6.76 percent yield on 4.125
percent bonds issued by Intesa Sanpaolo that come due more than
a year earlier, in April 2020, according to Bloomberg data. 
&#8216;Very Sensitive&#8217; 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s reliance on the debt markets, instead of
depositors, to provide funding for its assets may be one cause
of concern, some analysts said. Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs, which were the second-biggest and biggest U.S. securities
firms before converting to banks, both got less than 10 percent
of their funding from depositors as of June 30, according to
company filings with the SEC. 
By contrast, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
two largest U.S. banks by assets, funded more than half of their
balance sheets with retail deposits at the end of June, filings
show. 
&#8220;The market is just very sensitive to anybody considered
to be wholesale funded,&#8221; John Guarnera, a financial analyst at
Societe Generale in New York, said in a Sept. 23 telephone
interview. &#8220;If you&#8217;re a bank, you can fall back on the fact
that you have a strong retail deposit base. Morgan Stanley has
deposits, but not like you&#8217;d see out of a BofA or a JPMorgan.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley (MS) agreed to pay
$4.8 million to settle a U.S. antitrust case over a 2006
derivative contract with KeySpan Corp. that the Justice
Department said probably led to higher electricity prices in New
York City. 
The proposed settlement was filed today in federal court in
Manhattan, the Justice Department said in a statement. KeySpan
last year agreed to pay $12 million to settle. 
Morgan Stanley entered into agreements with KeySpan and
Astoria Generating Co., KeySpan&#8217;s largest competitor in the
capacity market, that gave KeySpan a financial interest in
Astoria and ensured the company would withhold output from the
market and increase prices, the Justice Department said. 
&#8220;Morgan Stanley is pleased to have settled this matter
with the Department of Justice,&#8221; Mary Claire Delaney, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said in an e-mailed
statement. 
KeySpan, based in Brooklyn, New York, is a unit of London-

in Britain and the U.S. 
The case is U.S. v. Morgan Stanley, 11-6875, U.S. District

The Group of 20 nations may agree
to take coordinated measures to ease monetary policy at their
November meeting as global growth slows, according to Goldman
Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill. 
&#8220;Central banks have to be forward looking,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill
in an interview in London today. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be completely
surprised if we had some kind of coordinated move at the
November meeting and, if there were, Brazil would definitely
play a role in that.&#8221; 
Brazil&#8217;s central bank unexpectedly cut the Selic benchmark
interest rate by half a percentage point to 12 percent on Aug.
31 as the risk of recession in Europe and the U.S. shifted
policy makers&#8217; focus away from the fastest inflation in six
years. Turkey and Israel have also lowered rates to protect
their economies from the impact of Europe&#8217;s debt problems. 
Brazil&#8217;s decision to cut the benchmark rate was &#8220;quite
smart,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. The probability of the country meeting
its inflation target of 4.5 percent next year has &#8220;risen
significantly&#8221; because of the global economic crisis, he said. 
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis led investors to dump emerging market
assets in the past two months, pushing the real down 18 percent
against the dollar since the end of July. The Brazilian currency
had gained 13 percent in the previous 12 months. 
The real needs to weaken a further 10 percent to 15 percent
to make Brazilian stocks more &#8220;interesting,&#8221; according to
O&#8217;Neill, who ranks Brazil in &#8220;rising third&#8221; place for equity
investment among the so-called BRIC nations, behind China and
Russia and ahead of India. China is the &#8220;most compelling&#8221; and
&#8220;very cheap,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill, who coined the term BRIC in 2001. 
&#8220;If we had a further decline in the real, I think the
Brazilian stock market would look more interesting than it has
for a year,&#8221; he said.

Morgan Stanley (MS) won dismissal of a
retirement fund&#8217;s lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation
called the Libertas CDO. 
The Employees&#8217; Retirement System of the Government of the
Virgin Islands claimed in the 2009 suit that New York-based
Morgan Stanley defrauded investors by collaborating with ratings
companies to give the CDO an undeserved AAA rating at the same
time it was short-selling almost all of the assets underlying
the notes. The CDO was backed by $1.2 billion in assets,
according to the complaint. 
U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan today
dismissed the investor complaint, which asserted claims for
fraud and unjust enrichment under New York state law. 
AAA is the highest rating for fixed-income instruments. The
portfolio was 92 percent residential mortgage-backed securities
and included exposure to more than $130 million in loans from
Option One Mortgage Corp. and $100 million from New Century
Mortgage Corp., both lenders to homebuyers with poor credit
scores, according to the complaint. 
The Libertas CDO entered into credit-default swaps that
referenced specific residential mortgage-backed securities.
According to the complaint, the notes collapsed in value after
they were purchased by the Virgin Islands retirement fund. 
The case is Employees&#8217; Retirement System of the Government
of the Virgin Islands v. Morgan Stanley  Co., 09-cv-10532, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Nigerian unit
said gunmen attacked a vessel supplying one of its offshore oil
platforms, wounding one worker and seizing another. 
&#8220;The incident has been reported to security and relevant
government agencies&#8221; after the attack in southern Akwa Ibom
state, Nigel Cookey-Gam, a spokesman in Lagos, said in an e-
mailed statement. Exxon doesn&#8217;t know where the seized worker has
been taken and the injured individual is &#8220;stable,&#8221; he said. 
Violence has risen in the southern Niger River delta, home
to Nigeria&#8217;s oil and gas industry, after a period of relative
quiet that followed a government amnesty in 2009 and the
disarming of thousands of fighters. Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s largest
oil producer and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. 
Armed attacks in the delta cut Nigeria&#8217;s oil output more
than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) said this month it shut 25,000
barrels a day of crude output from its Imo River field in the
country&#8217;s southern Abia state because of the level of theft.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer wasn&#8217;t awarded his full bonus for fiscal
2011, citing lower-than-expected sales of phones based on the
company&#8217;s software and a drop in revenue in its Windows unit. 
Ballmer, 55, received $1.38 million in pay, according to a
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That
included a bonus equal to 100 percent of his base salary, half
of the maximum he could have been awarded. Still, the board
noted in the filing that it regards Ballmer as &#8220;underpaid.&#8221; 
While directors praised Ballmer for the company&#8217;s operating
income, progress on the next version of Windows and partnerships
with Facebook Inc. and Nokia Oyj, they voiced concerns about
lower sales of Windows software and the need to be quicker to
adapt the software to work on new devices. Ballmer has come
under fire from some investors, including Greenlight Capital
Inc. President David Einhorn, who used a May speech to call on
Microsoft&#8217;s board to replace him. 
&#8220;He deserves this bonus,&#8221; said Kim Caughey Forrest, an
analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group Inc. She said she&#8217;s
encouraged by the newest version of Windows, unveiled last
month. &#8220;I see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it&#8217;s a
pretty big light. They came a huge way for me.&#8221; 
At the same time, Ballmer didn&#8217;t deserve the maximum amount
because he and the board aren&#8217;t returning enough cash to
shareholders, said Caughey Forrest, whose firm manages about
$1.1 billion, including Microsoft shares. 
Windows Revenue 
The popularity of tablets such as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad
contributed to the decline in Windows revenue in fiscal 2011,
which ended June 30. Some shareholders may balk at Ballmer&#8217;s 100
percent bonus because they think the new Windows isn&#8217;t coming
fast enough, Caughey Forrest said. 
&#8220;You could posit Windows 8 and the whole reaction to the
phenomenon of tablets and mobile devices is a few years too
late,&#8221; she said. 
Microsoft&#8217;s board lauded Ballmer for making progress on the
company&#8217;s Bing search engine and Azure cloud software; the
successful release of the Kinect gaming device; the introduction
of the Office 365 Internet-based versions of its productivity
software; work toward the acquisition of Skype Technologies SA;
and a &#8220;strong financial year.&#8221; 
Ballmer, who owns almost 4 percent of the company&#8217;s
outstanding shares, doesn&#8217;t get stock compensation at his own
request, the filing said. 
For fiscal 2010, Ballmer also received 100 percent of a
maximum 200 percent bonus, with the board citing concerns about
new devices and a loss of market share in phone software.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. oil company, began extracting crude from a southern
California field using steam produced by a 29-megawatt solar-
thermal power plant. 
BrightSource Energy Inc.&#8217;s system uses mirrors to focus
sunlight on a boiler at Chevron&#8217;s Coalinga, California, enhanced
oil recovery project, the solar company said in a statement
after extraction began today. 
Solar-thermal technology companies such as BrightSource are
targeting industrial users in the oil-recovery and food-
processing industries as customers as well as power generation. 
Mining and metals processing are also very promising,
especially in remote areas where power can also be generated
along with heat, Charlie Ricker, BrightSource senior vice
president of business development, said today in an interview. 
The company is exploring the possibility of more plants
with Chevron and others, Ricker said. 
&#8220;This technology has the potential to augment gas-powered
steam generation and may provide an additional resource in areas
of the world where natural gas is expensive or not readily
available,&#8221; Chevron Technology Ventures President Desmond King
said today in a company statement. The project produces about
the same amount of steam as one gas-fired steam generator,
Chevron said. 
7,644 Mirrors 
The Coalinga plant consists of 3,822 mirror systems, or
heliostats, each with two 10-foot (3-meter) by 7-foot mirrors
mounted on a 6-foot steel pole focusing light on a 327-foot
solar tower. Steam created by the heat is fed into the oil
reservoir, making it easier to bring to the surface. The system
began generating steam in August, Kristin Hunter, a spokeswoman
for Oakland, California-based BrightSource, said today in an e-
mail. 
Areva SA&#8217;s Areva Solar, Seville, Spain-based Abengoa SA,
Erlangen, Germany-based Solar Millennium AG (S2M) and Burbank,
California-based eSolar Inc. are competing with BrightSource
with their own solar-thermal technology. 
Glasspoint Solar Inc., based in Fremont, California, makes
solar steam generators for the oil and gas industry using
mirrored troughs inside of glasshouse enclosures to protect the
mirrors. 
$16.3 Billion Market 
Enhanced oil recovery, or EOR, fits very well with solar
temperatures, Glasspoint Vice President John O&#8217;Donnell, said
today in an interview. 
Some 32 percent of California&#8217;s industrial and commercial
gas use is for EOR as its use grows in the U.S. and all over the
world, O&#8217;Donnell said. The state produces about 40% of its oil
using EOR and in a few years that will grow to 60%, he said. 
The company can produce heat for EOR for about $3 per
million British thermal units, compared with about $4 for a
comparable natural-gas plant in the U.S. and between $10 to $12
for other conventional solar thermal technologies, O&#8217;Donnell
said. &#8220;We are the only ones below natural gas right now in the
U.S.&#8221; 
According to BCC Research, the global market for enhanced-
oil-recovery technologies was $4.7 billion in 2009 and is
expected to grow at a 5-year compound annual rate of 28 percent,
reaching $16.3 billion in 2014, BrightSource said in its
statement. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), based in Irving, Texas, is the largest
U.S. oil company.

General Maritime Corp. (GMR)&#8217;s bonds
plunged to the lowest level since at least August 2010 as the
U.S. oil-tanker owner is pressured by low freight rates and a
surplus of ships. 
The company&#8217;s $300 million of 12 percent bonds maturing in
November 2017 tumbled 6.75 cents to 30 cents on the dollar as of
8:17 a.m. in New York, with yields soaring to 48.4 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The securities, issued
in November 2009, have tumbled from 96.5 cents on the dollar at
the start of the year. 
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service cut New York-based General
Maritime&#8217;s credit grade to Caa3 last month citing the increasing
likelihood of a restructuring of credit facility terms or of the
debt capital structure because of &#8220;weak sector fundamentals.&#8221;
The company&#8217;s &#8220;overreliance&#8221; on its cash balance, which was
almost $59 million as of June 30, may cause it to fall out of
compliance with a minimum liquidity covenant,  Moody&#8217;s analysts
said in the Sept. 1 note. 
The company is likely to &#8220;have a difficult time achieving
positive operating cash flow, which could threaten its ability
to make cash interest payments,&#8221; the Moody&#8217;s analysts wrote.
Weak freight rates will also pressure the market value of tanker
vessels, cutting another source of liquidity, they wrote.

Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s derivatives holdings
may have been misread by markets and investors, prompting the
bank to plunge more than 10 percent on Sept. 30, a Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) analyst wrote in a report. 
Concern about Morgan Stanley &#8220;appears to be driven&#8221; by
confusion over a U.S. government report that said the company
had $1.78 trillion of outstanding notional value of derivatives
in the second quarter, Wells Fargo&#8217;s Matthew Burnell wrote Sept.
30. In reality, so-called netting agreements outlined in the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency report mean Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s derivatives positions totaled $457 million, according
to Burnell. 
&#8220;Net credit exposure is well below its peer group,&#8221;
Burnell, who has a &#8220;market perform&#8221; rating on Morgan Stanley
shares, told clients. 
Morgan Stanley fell 1 cent, or 0.1 percent, to $13.50 at 11
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange Composite trading, after
climbing as much as 4 percent earlier today. The stock has
dropped 50 percent this year before today. 
The cost of buying credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley,
which offer investors protection against a default by the New
York-based bank, rose to a mid-price of 515 basis points as of
10:28 a.m., according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The
price of insurance on Morgan Stanley is higher than Italian
banks Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) and UniCredit SpA (UCG) and means investors
have to pay $515,000 a year for every $10 million of debt they
are protecting, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
U.S. Aid 
The firm, which owns the world&#8217;s biggest retail brokerage,
was the largest recipient of emergency loans from the Federal
Reserve during the financial crisis and also benefited from
capital provided by Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., now the biggest shareholder, and the U.S. Treasury, which
it repaid with interest less than a year later. 
The largest Wall Street firms will start reporting third-
quarter results this month showing how they performed in a
market grappling with fallout from Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating and concern Greece would default.
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley warned investors in
September trading revenue may suffer.

The U.S. Supreme Court refused to
revive a suit against wireless-phone manufacturers and retailers
filed by customers who said the devices may cause illnesses,
including brain cancer. 
The justices today left intact a federal appeals court
decision that said regulations issued by the Federal
Communications Commission preclude suits under state laws by
phone consumers. Most lower courts to consider the issue have
reached similar conclusions. 
The suit before the justices, filed in Pennsylvania state
court, named more than a dozen companies and trade associations
as defendants. Those sued included Nokia Inc.; units of ATT
Inc. (T) and Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.; and Verizon Wireless,
a joint venture between Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) and Vodafone
Group Plc. (VOD) 
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Stephen Breyer didn&#8217;t take part in today&#8217;s decision not to hear the
appeal. Both owned shares of Nokia as of Dec. 31, according
their most recent financial-disclosure report. 
The appeal centered on the legal impact of the FCC
standards that govern radio frequency emissions and require pre-
authorization of phones sold or leased in the country. The
Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said those
rules, first adopted in 1996, preempt any additional
requirements under state law, including those imposed through
lawsuits. 
The Obama administration joined the mobile-phone industry
in urging the Supreme Court to reject the appeal without a
hearing. 
The case is Farina v. Nokia, 10-1064.

Iowa native Justin Bruch marveled at
the opportunity when Morgan Stanley (MS) called in late 2007 to
recruit him for an unusual assignment. 
The New York bank, flush with $7.5 billion in fiscal 2006
profit -- the biggest in its history -- was going to be farming
11 parcels on the steppes of Ukraine. The commodities team
wanted Bruch, a redhead with meaty hands who&#8217;d been farming all
his life, to manage one of them. 
Bruch saw a chance to dig into some famous dirt, Bloomberg
Markets magazine reports in its November issue. The former
Soviet republic has 30 percent of the world&#8217;s black soil, earth
so fertile Adolf Hitler had Nazi troops cart some back to
Germany during World War II. Wheat, corn, rapeseed and
sunflowers thrive there. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s like the prairie land that was broken in the Midwest
100 years ago,&#8221; says Bruch, 34, who grew up on his family&#8217;s
2,500-acre (1,012-hectare) corn and soybean farm. &#8220;The soil and
potential for crops that Ukraine has is the best in the world.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley was primed for the investment. It was then
the second-largest U.S. securities firm by market value, after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief Executive Officer John Mack was
pushing managers to take more risks.

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest retail brokerage, rose 12 percent, the largest gain in
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, after earlier dropping to the
lowest level since December 2008. 
Morgan Stanley rebounded in the last half-hour of trading,
rising $1.54 to $14.01 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. It was the biggest percentage gain since
March 2009 and came after a report that European Union officials
were examining ways to coordinate the recapitalization of
struggling banks. 
The Financial Times quoted Olli Rehn, European commissioner
for economic affairs, as saying there is an &#8220;increasingly
shared view&#8221; that the region needs a coordinated approach to
halt the sovereign debt crisis. Morgan Stanley had dropped 17
percent over the two previous days as concern intensified that
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will infect U.S. bank balance sheets. 
Credit-default swaps on New York-based Morgan Stanley fell
13 basis points to 570 basis points as of 4:01 p.m. in New York,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The contracts
earlier traded as high as 650 basis points, the highest since
October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
filed for bankruptcy. 
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. said it&#8217;s &#8220;firmly
committed&#8221; to its strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley.
Japan&#8217;s biggest banking group, which is the U.S. firm&#8217;s largest
common shareholder, repeated its commitment in a statement
yesterday &#8220;in response to recent market volatility.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53,
sent a memo to employees yesterday, encouraging them to remain
focused on their jobs and clients instead of responding to &#8220;the
rumor of the day.&#8221; 
&#8220;There has been an enormous amount of confusion and
misinformation about Morgan Stanley and others in our peer
group,&#8221; he wrote in the memo, which was obtained today by
Bloomberg News. &#8220;In fragile markets, where fear triumphs over
common sense, these things are bound to happen.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), which generated more
than $79 million in U.S. theaters after converting &#8220;The Lion
King&#8221; to 3-D, will re-release four other animated features in
the format. 
&#8220;Beauty and the Beast&#8221; will be reissued on Jan. 13 next
year, followed by &#8220;Finding Nemo&#8221; on Sept. 14, the Burbank,
California-based company said today in an e-mail. &#8220;Monsters
Inc.&#8221; will be reissued in January 2013, and &#8220;The Little
Mermaid&#8221; will follow in September of that year. 
&#8220;This is just pure gravy for Disney,&#8221; said Wade Holden,
an analyst with the consulting firm SNL Kagan in Monterey,
California. &#8220;Disney puts their films back in their vault, and
then re-issues them a few years later for the next generation
anyway.&#8221; 
The 3-D conversions also help DVD sales by elevating the
profile of the films, Holden added. Disney released &#8220;The Lion
King&#8221; on DVD and Blu-Ray today. The three-dimensional version
of the film opened in theaters on Sept. 16. 
Disney rose 86 cents to $29.86 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 20
percent this year.

The cost to protect the debt of
Morgan Stanley (MS) against losses fell from the highest levels in
about three years after a report that European Union officials
were examining ways to coordinate the recapitalization of
struggling banks. 
Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley fell 13 basis points
to 570 basis points as of 4:01 p.m. in New York, according to
broker Phoenix Partners Group. The contracts earlier traded as
high as 650 basis points, the highest since October 2008, the

view&#8221; that the region needs a coordinated approach to halt the
sovereign debt crisis. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest insurer, plans to increase cost reductions amid
global &#8220;financial volatility,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Giovanni Perissinotto said. 
The firm plans to cut information-technology costs and
improve the efficiency of asset and real-estate management
&#8220;through the full integration of these functions across the
whole group,&#8221; the CEO said today at a conference held by
Merrill Lynch in London. His comments were confirmed by a
company spokeswoman. 
Trieste, Italy-based Generali, which is expanding in
emerging markets including China and the Middle East to boost
profit, expects higher operating margins in the life and non-
life businesses this year. The insurer&#8217;s second-quarter profit
fell 45 percent, hurt by writedowns of Greek bonds and its stake
in Telco SpA. 
&#8220;We have to be ready to live in a world characterized by
stagnant growth, low returns and great financial volatility,&#8221;
Perissinotto said. &#8220;This adverse trend is accentuated by the
lack of decisiveness and coordination of actions.&#8221; 
About 94 percent of the company&#8217;s government bond holdings
have an A rating or higher, he said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) cut its forecast
for Brazil&#8217;s economic growth and said it expects the central
bank to cut interest rates more than it previously expected as
global financial turmoil weighs on confidence in Latin America&#8217;s
biggest economy, 
The bank, in an e-mailed report, said it expects policy
makers to reduce the benchmark interest rate to 10.5 percent by
January from its current 12 percent. Previously the bank
expected the so-called Selic rate to fall to 11 percent in
January. 
Latin America&#8217;s biggest economy should grow 2.3 percent in
the second half of the year, less than a 3.1 percent forecast
made Aug. 8, JPMorgan analysts wrote in the report. The economy
next year should expand 3.4 percent instead of a previous 3.8
percent forecast. 
&#8220;Domestic growth prospects for next year still seems
cushioned by a more preemptive monetary policy response and the
buffers from fiscal and quasi fiscal policies,&#8221; JPMorgan
analysts including Fabio Akira wrote in today&#8217;s report. 
The currency will end the year at 1.80 per U.S. dollar,
compared with the previous forecast of 1.70, JPMorgan said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley led gains in the cost to protect the debt of the biggest
U.S. banks as concern intensified that Europe&#8217;s sovereign
financial crisis will infect lender balance sheets. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased
48.9 basis points to 444.5 basis points at 9:50 a.m. in New
York, according to data provider CMA. Contracts on Morgan
Stanley, the New York-based owner of the world&#8217;s largest retail
brokerage, climbed 40.7 to 623.4 and those on Citigroup Inc. (C)
added 30.6 to 382, the data show. 
Investor confidence in the creditworthiness of the banks
fell as Europe&#8217;s finance chiefs considered &#8220;technical
revisions&#8221; for a second Greek bailout, Luxembourg Prime
Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said today. The cost to protect
U.S. company debt rose for the third day to the highest since
May 2009 as Goldman Sachs cut its global growth forecasts and
predicted recessions in Germany and France. 
&#8220;When you get stuff blowing out a couple of hundred basis
points in the span of two days, it causes a lot of people to
seize up,&#8221; said Michael Donelan, who oversees $4 billion of
bonds at Ryan Labs Inc. &#8220;If you see equities continue to be
under pressure, it just leads to a further contagion-type
spreading to credit spreads, credit-default spreads, cash bonds
you name it everything&#8217;s interlinked.&#8221; 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses or speculate on
creditworthiness, added 1.4 basis points to a mid-price of 151.5
basis points as of 11:18 a.m. in New York, according to Markit
Group Ltd. 
Global Economy 
The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, has increased from 136.2
on Sept. 27 as concerns mount that Europe&#8217;s fiscal imbalances
are worsening and the global economic recovery is faltering. 
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index slid as much as 2.2 percent
today to 1,074.77. The measure pared declines and was down 0.1
percent to 1,098.15 at 11:11 a.m. in New York after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the central bank is ready
to take additional steps to boost growth. 
Five-year credit-default swaps tied to Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s senior debt climbed 27.9
basis points to 484.5, according to CMA, a unit of CME Group
Inc. that compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. 
Contracts on New York-based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) added 18.8
to 198.6, and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) increased 19 to 195,
the data show. Swaps on American International Group Inc. (AIG)
climbed to 598.4, the highest since May 2010. 
&#8216;Bear Raiders&#8217; 
Credit swaps on Morgan Stanley are up from 305 basis points
on Sept. 15 and are at the highest level since October 2008, the
month after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.
They reached as high as the equivalent of 1,300 basis points on
Oct. 10, 2008, CMA data show. It now costs $623,400 annually for
five years for every $10 million of debt insured. 
&#8220;What you&#8217;ve got right now is bear raiders making a bet
that in the event of a sovereign crisis in Europe coming to a
head, what you&#8217;re going to have is a freezing in the debt
markets,&#8221; Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
in New York, said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; 
That &#8220;will lead to funding problems and all the capital
markets firms will be hurt,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What&#8217;s odd about this
is that it requires a number of leaps of faith, and those would
be that central banks are not going to support their commercial
banks and too large to fail is going to be ignored. And I don&#8217;t
think that&#8217;s going to be true.&#8221; 
&#8216;Special Relationship&#8217; 
Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. said yesterday it&#8217;s
&#8220;firmly committed&#8221; to its long-term strategic alliance with
Morgan Stanley (MS), reiterating its commitment to the firm &#8220;in
response to recent market volatility.&#8221; 
&#8220;The special relationship we have formed remains core to
our global business strategy,&#8221; the Tokyo-based bank said in the
statement. Mitsubishi UFJ invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley
in October 2008 as the firm&#8217;s stock price collapsed after
Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10

International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is planning more acquisitions to fuel growth in its $22.5
billion software business, Senior Vice President Steve Mills
said in an interview. 
IBM, which last week surpassed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become
the world&#8217;s second-most valuable technology company, after Apple
Inc. (AAPL), may spend $100 million to $300 million on targets, the
Armonk, New York-based company said. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano has said he&#8217;s seeking
$20 billion in additional annual revenue by 2015. The company
aims to double or triple the pace of sales growth at companies
it acquires and looks for deals that will add to earnings within
two or three years, Mills said. 
&#8220;Everything&#8217;s got to fit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No spurious, off-
to-the-side, unrelated things.&#8221; 
IBM generated $99.9 billion in sales last year. Software,
which had gross margins of 86.9 percent last year, is key to
IBM&#8217;s growth plans. 
The company has made almost 50 software acquisitions since
2006 in such areas as data analysis, e-commerce, supply-chain
management and computer security, Mills said. More than half of
those have been in business-data analysis, where IBM says it has
spent $14 billion. The company expects those business-analytics
products to yield $16 billion in sales by 2015. 
&#8216;Hell of a Job&#8217; 
&#8220;They&#8217;ve done a hell of a job,&#8221; said Joel Achramowicz, an
analyst at Blaylock Robert Van LLC, an investment bank in
Oakland, California. IBM is &#8220;making the right acquisitions at
the right time.&#8221; 
The company today said it agreed to buy closely held Q1
Labs, a Waltham, Massachusetts-based provider of security
intelligence software, for undisclosed terms. It also created a
new security systems division, to target the $94 billion market
for security software and services. 
IBM fell $1.30 to $171.99 at 9:38 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had gained 18 percent
this year before today. 
The company is unlikely to make large acquisitions, worth
$10 billion or more, Achramowicz said. He said he dropped
coverage of IBM in April partly because of the company&#8217;s
unwillingness to take on a very large deal. 
&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the reasons we got kind of bored with the
stock,&#8221; he said. &#8220;There are some big software companies out
there, which could augment IBM&#8217;s position.&#8221; 
In terms of the existing business, &#8220;IBM&#8217;s done about
everything it can to maximize their operating model,&#8221; he said. 
SPSS, Cognos 
Mills said the company looks for deals that can augment
products it already owns. For example, the statistical-analysis
software company SPSS Inc., which IBM bought in 2009 for about
$1.2 billion, complements the company&#8217;s 2007 acquisition of
Cognos Inc., whose software creates executive &#8220;dashboards&#8221; for
quickly perusing business data. 
SPSS lends Cognos more robust statistics capabilities, and
Cognos helps SPSS users visually depict their data, he said.
That&#8217;s accelerated SPPS&#8217;s growth since IBM bought it, Mills
said. 
&#8220;When you do that, you know you&#8217;re going to get a lift,&#8221;
he said.

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest retail brokerage, named Vikas Khattar managing director
and head of global capital markets in India to tap demand for
investment banking services in Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy. 
Khattar, who joined the bank&#8217;s Mumbai office on Oct. 1,
reports to Crawford Jamieson and George Taylor, co-heads of
global capital markets in Asia-Pacific, according to a statement
from Morgan Stanley. 
International banks are bolstering their services as Indian
companies increasingly tap capital markets overseas. Non-rupee
debt sales by firms from the nation doubled to $9.1 billion this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. New York-based
Morgan Stanley is ranked 13th in arranging international bonds
and 8th in managing domestic share sales by Indian companies in
the last twelve months, data show. 
Essar Group, controlled by the billionaire Ruia brothers,
is considering listing infrastructure assets in London to raise
about $750 million, three people with knowledge of the matter
said. JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG are
working with Essar on the initial public offering, the people
said, declining to be identified because the process in private. 
Khattar was most recently Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s head of South
Asia equity and equity-linked capital markets origination in
India. Before that he was at Merrill Lynch  Co. for 11 years,
according to the release. 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) hired P.V. Krishna from Morgan
Stanley to run its equity capital markets business in India, two

Commodity prices may advance 20
percent over the next year as growth in emerging markets offsets
the impact of the sovereign-debt crisis in Europe and a slowdown
in developed economies, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
The bank reiterated an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on
commodities over the next 12 months, while remaining &#8220;neutral&#8221;
in the near term, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a
report today. Oil and copper forecasts for 2012 were reduced. 
Commodities in the three months to Sept. 30 had the worst
quarter since 2008 on concern that there may be another global
recession as the European debt crisis escalated. The world
economy will probably expand 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with
an earlier prediction of 4.2 percent, Goldman&#8217;s economists Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson wrote in an Oct. 3 report. 
&#8220;With recent GDP revisions by our economists falling
hardest on Europe but emerging market growth expectations still
relatively solid, we continue to believe that demand growth in
2012 will be sufficient to tighten major commodity markets,&#8221;
Currie wrote. &#8220;We now see a flatter upward trajectory for
commodity prices.&#8221; 
Brent oil traded in London may average $120 per barrel next
year, down from an earlier call of $130, Goldman said. The
bank&#8217;s 2012 estimate for three-month copper on the London Metal
Exchange was lowered to $9,200 per metric ton from $10,790. 
Cutting Calls 
Goldman joins BNP Paribas SA and Commerzbank AG in cutting
calls for the metal that some investors see as a barometer for
economic activity. The bank also trimmed the 12-month target for
copper to $9,500 per ton from $11,000, while zinc&#8217;s target was
reduced to $2,400 per ton from $2,700. 
&#8220;Sentiment regarding the economic outlook and the European
sovereign-debt problems are likely to remain poor in the near
term, presenting further downside risk to prices as well as our
forecasts,&#8221; Currie wrote. Still, the lower prices should lure
buyers from China, the world&#8217;s largest copper consumer, back
into the market, he wrote. 
Copper for three-month delivery declined for a fifth day in
London, falling as much as 4 percent to $6,712 per ton, before
trading at $6,935 at 2:58 p.m. in Singapore. Brent crude, which
sank 11 percent last month, traded at $101.36 per barrel. 
No Recession 
Barclays Capital also said the world economy may avoid a
recession as emerging markets expand, which should limit further
losses for commodities, according to a report today from
analysts including Kevin Norrish. 
&#8220;A steep rise in production costs over the past few years,
plus a much greater degree of supply risk due to geopolitical
and weather shocks, all suggest there should be a much greater
degree of fundamentals-driven price resilience in many commodity
markets,&#8221; Norrish wrote. 
Weather disappointments should keep risks for soybeans
&#8220;skewed to the upside,&#8221; according to the Goldman report, which
expects them to trade at $13 per bushel in 12 months. The
November-delivery contract last traded at $11.70 per bushel. 
As soybean demand has become more sensitive to consumption
in China, the commodity should be more resilient to a slowdown
in developed markets as long as Chinese income growth remains
robust, Currie wrote.

Morgan Stanley (MS) said it may raise as
much as 385 billion yen ($5 billion) by selling uridashi bonds
to Japanese investors sometime in the next two years. 
The New York-based firm can sell bonds anytime between Oct.
12 this year and Oct. 11, 2013, according to a shelf
registration filed to Japan&#8217;s Finance Ministry today. Uridashi
bonds are debt issued outside of Japan for sale mainly to
Japanese retail investors. 
The U.S. bank is turning to Japanese individuals for
funding at a time when its share price is falling and the cost
of insuring its bonds is surging amid concern that Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis will infect the global banking system. Market volatility
prompted Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306), the biggest
shareholder, to issue a statement yesterday saying it is
&#8220;firmly committed&#8221; to their alliance. 
Morgan Stanley, owner of the world&#8217;s biggest retail
brokerage, sold uridashi bonds in Japan at least twice in the
past three months, raising 46.5 billion yen in August and 51.5
billion yen in September as part of a 200 billion yen program
announced in April. Natsuo Nishio, a Tokyo-based spokesman,
declined to comment on the timing for any additional sale. 
Sales of yen-denominated uridashi bonds declined 25 percent
to 120.9 billion yen in August from a year ago, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Relies on Debt 
Shares of Morgan Stanley have fallen 54 percent this year
amid speculation that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will erode trading
income and damage balance sheets of U.S. banks. Morgan Stanley
relies on debt markets for funding because it has relatively low
deposits. The bank got less than 10 percent of its funding from
depositors as of June 30, compared with JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
which got more than half from retail deposits, SEC filings show. 
Mitsubishi UFJ invested $9 billion in Morgan Stanley in
October 2008 as the U.S. firm&#8217;s stock price collapsed after the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. The banks agreed in
April to convert $7.8 billion of preferred shares into common
stock and completed the conversion in June, making the Japanese
lender Morgan Stanley&#8217;s largest common shareholder with a 22.4
percent stake. 
Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ asserted its support for Morgan
Stanley yesterday as the cost to protect the U.S. firm&#8217;s debt
surged to the highest level since the weeks after Lehman
collapsed. Contracts on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the world&#8217;s
largest retail brokerage, soared 92 basis points to a mid-price
of 583 basis points yesterday in New York, the highest since
October 2008, according to London-based data provider CMA. 
The largest Wall Street firms will start reporting third-
quarter results this month showing how they performed in a
market grappling with fallout from Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade
of the U.S. credit rating and concern Greece would default.
JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley warned investors in September
trading revenue may suffer.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its
global growth forecast for this year and next, predicting
recessions in Germany and France as the European economy stalls
and the risk of a contraction in the U.S. grows. 
The world economy will probably expand 3.8 percent this
year and 3.5 percent in 2012, compared with earlier predictions
of 3.9 percent for 2011 and 4.2 percent for next year, Goldman
Sachs economists Jan Hatzius and Dominic Wilson wrote in an Oct.
3 report. The company lowered its forecast for earnings growth
in Asia excluding Japan in a separate report today. 
Europe&#8217;s worsening sovereign debt woes and the threat of a
U.S. recession have roiled global stock markets, erasing about
$13 trillion from equities since May. The debt crisis has
infected the European banking system, making financial
institutions wary of lending to each other and pushing overnight
deposits with the European Central Bank last week to the highest
in more than a year. 
&#8220;The further deterioration in the economic and financial
situation in the Euro area has led us to downgrade our global
GDP forecast significantly,&#8221; the economists said. &#8220;Over the
next few quarters, we now expect a mild recession in Germany and
France, and a deeper downturn in the Euro periphery.&#8221; 
Euro Region 
Goldman Sachs predicts the Euro region will expand 0.1
percent in 2012, down from an earlier forecast of 1.3 percent.
It expects growth of 1.6 percent for this year. Goldman also
lowered its end-2011 forecast for the euro to $1.38 per dollar
from an earlier projection for it to trade at $1.40. 
The ECB has been forced to purchase sovereign bonds to
prevent the crisis from spreading to larger euro nations, and is
providing banks with unlimited liquidity for up to six months
against eligible collateral as governments struggle to restore
investor confidence in the 17-member region. 
The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to ease its
liquidity policies further this month as a result of an increase
in financial risk, Hatzius and Wilson said. The ECB will also
probably cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 1
percent by December, they said. 
&#8220;The increase in spillovers from the Euro area, primarily
via tighter financial conditions, is the primary reason why we
have also downgraded our forecasts for the U.S. further,&#8221; the
economists said. &#8220;We now see the risk of a renewed U.S.
recession at around 40 percent.&#8221; 
Flagging U.S. 
The U.S. economy will expand 1.7 percent this year and 1.4
percent in 2012, Goldman Sachs predicts. It had earlier
estimated a 2 percent growth rate for the world&#8217;s largest
economy next year. 
The Federal Reserve announced last month that it would
replace $400 billion of short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries, a so-called Operation Twist, in an
effort to further reduce borrowing costs and strengthen the
flagging U.S. economy. 
&#8220;We expect additional easing of monetary policy beyond the
&#8216;Operation Twist&#8217; announced recently, although this may not come
until sometime in the first half of 2012,&#8221; Hatzius and Wilson
said. &#8220;In addition, the market&#8217;s focus on changes in the Fed&#8217;s
guidance on future policies -- including a greater emphasis on
the employment part of the &#8216;dual mandate&#8217; and/or a temporarily
higher inflation target -- is likely to intensify.&#8221; 
&#8216;Downside Risk&#8217; 
Asia excluding Japan stocks faces a &#8220;downside risk&#8221; of 10
percent to 15 percent, Goldman Sachs analysts led by Timothy Moe
wrote in a report today. 
Earnings per share may grow 10 percent this year and
increase 7 percent next year, lower than an earlier prediction
of 11 percent growth for both years, according to the analysts.
They also cut their 12-month forecast for the MSCI Asia Pacific
excluding Japan Index to 480 from 530. 
Goldman Sachs analysts also lowered their forecasts for 2011
and 2012 oil prices. Crude prices will end this year at $112.50
a barrel, compared with a previous estimate of $119.50. It will
be $122.50 a barrel at the end of 2012, compared with an earlier
forecast of $138.50, according to the report. 
&#8220;The oil market continues to destock as prices anticipate
a potential crisis,&#8221; the economists said. &#8220;If the crisis does
not occur, the oil market risks running into pressing supply
constraints, requiring sharply higher prices than we currently
forecast to force demand in line with supplies.&#8221;

General Atlantic LLC, the U.S.
private equity firm that manages $17 billion, is studying four
acquisitions in India of as much as $200 million each, according
to Ranjit Pandit, its head of investments in the country. 
The planned deals are in the Internet, logistics, financial
and infrastructure industries and will be &#8220;in the $100 million
to $200 million range,&#8221; Pandit said in an interview in Mumbai
yesterday. 
General Atlantic, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, plans to
step up investment in India after a stock market rout reduced
valuations. The firm, which has typically spent about $50
million to $75 million per deal, will also look at acquisitions
of privately held companies, said Pandit. 
&#8220;We are looking at actively pushing a lot of money into
India,&#8221; said Pandit. &#8220;We are looking to do fewer transactions
but bigger transactions.&#8221; He called deal sizes of $100 million
to $200 million the &#8220;sweet spot&#8221; for General Atlantic. 
India&#8217;s private-equity market heated up this year as the
stocks slump shuttered the market for public equity and loans
got pricier, prompting companies to look for other sources of
capital. Private-equity firms have announced $5.52 billion of
deals in the country so far this year, up from $3.79 billion for
all of 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
General Atlantic has invested about $900 million in India
since 2002. It owns stakes worth a combined $1.7 billion in
eight Indian companies, according to Pandit. 
Deals Closing 
Pandit said he expects two of the four deals the firm is
working on in the country will close this year, while the other
two will likely be completed in early 2012. The executive said
he may also consider deals of as much as $400 million in the
South Asian nation. 
General Atlantic paid about $90 million for about 3.7
percent stake in IndusInd Bank Ltd. (IIB), a privately owned lender
based in Mumbai. The stock is down 4.1 percent so far in 2011,
the third-best performance among 14 companies on the BSE Bankex
Index, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
The private-equity firm&#8217;s total investment in IndusInd Bank
may reach  $100 million to $200 million, according to Pandit. 
Pandit said General Atlantic may sell stakes in information
technology companies, without naming any of them. The firm owns
shares in companies including Genpact Ltd. (G), Hexaware
Technologies Ltd. (HEXW) and Infotech Enterprises Ltd. (INFTC) General Atlantic
hasn&#8217;t decided whether to sell the holdings in public markets or
to other companies, said Pandit. 
&#8220;If we look at our information technology portfolio in
India, without commenting on any specific company, it&#8217;s a group
of companies which we held for some time,&#8221; Pandit said. &#8220;We
may be reaching a point of diminishing return from them.&#8221; 
He said Hexaware &#8220;has a lot of options and General
Atlantic will look at all those options,&#8221; without elaborating. 
General Atlantic, founded in 1980, is setting up a
Singapore office, and is considering investing in Vietnam,
Malaysia, Indonesia and Taiwan, Pandit said. Abhay Havaldar, who
has been with the firm since 2002, will lead the Singapore
office, he said.

Microsoft Corp. will offer television
service to Xbox Live users through a partnership with Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), a bid to use TV
programming to attract more customers to its game console. 
The Xbox service will offer content from almost 40
television and entertainment companies, Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft said today in a statement. In addition to
Verizon and Comcast, the partners include ATT Inc., Time Warner
Inc.&#8217;s HBO, Sony Corp.&#8217;s Crackle and the BBC. 
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer wants to lure more
families and casual gamers to the Xbox by making it an
entertainment center, challenging TV services from Apple Inc. (AAPL)
and Google Inc. (GOOG) Today&#8217;s announcement furthers a move started in
2008, when Microsoft added Netflix Inc.&#8217;s video streaming and
the music service Last.fm. 
&#8220;The vision of the Xbox back in 2001 was that it would be
an entertainment hub,&#8221; said Michael Pachter, an analyst at
Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. &#8220;Until they launched Netflix
on Xbox Live, it really wasn&#8217;t that. Today we go from Netflix
and Last.fm to 40 vendors.&#8221; 
Microsoft rose 55 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $25.89 today on
the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have declined 7.2 percent
this year. 
Network Stations 
The Xbox, first released a decade ago, accounted for 48
percent of all current-generation consoles in the U.S. between
2005 and June of this year, according to Microsoft data. Xbox
Live, an Internet service with free and paid versions, already
has more than 35 million members. 
Microsoft didn&#8217;t announce any deals with U.S. network TV
stations, though Comcast and other partners are &#8220;quite likely&#8221;
to add that kind of content in the future, said Ross Honey,
general manager of content acquisition for Microsoft&#8217;s
Interactive Entertainment business. Some network TV content can
already be viewed on Xbox using the Hulu LLC service. 
Other partners announced today include Lovefilm in the
U.K., a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc.; Spain&#8217;s Telefonica SA (TEF);
and Mexico&#8217;s Grupo Televisa SA. 
Microsoft also plans an application for its Windows Phone
mobile software that will turn phones into an enhanced remote
control for the Xbox service. Users will be able to search for
programs and then set them to play on the Xbox, as well as view
additional information about the program, Honey said. 
Apple, Google 
The company intends to offer apps that work with the Xbox
TV service for Apple&#8217;s iOS software as well, Pachter said,
citing a Microsoft analyst briefing yesterday. Honey declined to
comment on those plans, except to say that Microsoft has been
expanding some products to both iOS and Google&#8217;s Android. 
Some programming will require customers to be subscribers
to Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live pay service. Other content, such as the
BBC and other public television, will work with the free version
of Xbox Live, Honey said. 
Customers won&#8217;t have to know which channel or provider
offers the show or movie they want. Instead they can say or type
the name of the program and Xbox&#8217;s Bing search service will
return all options for viewing it, including ones the customer
doesn&#8217;t currently subscribe to, Honey said. 
TV service efforts by companies such as Apple and Google
have gotten little traction with customers. Apple Chief
Executive Officer Tim Cook has said that his company&#8217;s Apple TV
product remains &#8220;a hobby business.&#8221; In April, Logitech
International SA cut the price of its Google TV device, citing
slow initial sales. 
Microsoft has some advantages over those companies, Pachter
said. It already has a big presence in customers&#8217; living rooms:
A total of 55 million Xbox 360 machines have been sold
worldwide. The company also can draw on its search engine, its
Kinect motion-and-voice sensor technology and the new content
agreements. 
&#8220;Each of those guys has a strength, but nobody has
hardware already in the living room, with voice command that
works,&#8217;&#8221; he said. &#8220;Microsoft has a big advantage.&#8221;

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) isn&#8217;t anywhere close
to making an offer for Yahoo! Inc. and senior executives of the
software maker aren&#8217;t involved in discussions, two people
familiar with the matter said. 
Microsoft does plan to review Yahoo&#8217;s financial
information, due to be circulated as soon as this week, said one
of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
deliberations are private. Yahoo doesn&#8217;t regard Microsoft as a
serious bidder, said a person familiar with Yahoo&#8217;s thinking. 
Yahoo shares surged 10 percent today after Reuters reported
that Microsoft may make an offer. Yahoo is fielding inquiries
from potential buyers after ousting Chief Executive Office Carol Bartz and starting a review of its strategic options last month.
Yahoo rose $1.46 to $15.92 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading, the biggest gain since October 2008. 
Yahoo turned down a $47.5 billion offer from Microsoft in
2008, rankling investors. The two companies later forged a 10-
year agreement to outsource Yahoo&#8217;s search engine to Microsoft,
diminishing the chance of a full acquisition. Since then, Yahoo
has struggled to invigorate sales growth and beat back
competition from Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. 
Dana Lengkeek, a spokeswoman at Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo, and Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-
based Microsoft, declined to comment. 
&#8216;Multiple Parties&#8217; 
Yahoo, the biggest U.S. Web portal, said in a September
memo to employees that its advisers have fielded inquiries from
&#8220;multiple parties&#8221; interested in unspecified options. Last
week, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Chairman Jack Ma said he&#8217;s
&#8220;very interested&#8221; in buying Yahoo, which owns about 40 percent
of his company. 
The private-equity firm Silver Lake also has discussed a
possible bid for Yahoo, part of a deal that may include Alibaba
and Russia&#8217;s Digital Sky Technologies, people with direct
knowledge of the matter have told Bloomberg. 
The Silver Lake group contacted Yahoo and its advisers in
recent weeks to inform them of a possible offer, said one
person, who declined to be identified because the talks are
private. The discussions are still at an early stage and it&#8217;s
not certain that the group will agree to make a bid, the people
said. 
Before Yahoo&#8217;s stock surge today, the shares had declined
13 percent this year.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest oil company, is offering for sale a 25 percent stake in
an offshore Brazilian oil prospect after drilling two wells that
failed to strike crude. 
The prospect, known as Block BM-S-22 in the Santos Basin,
may hold as much as 1.5 billion barrels of recoverable crude,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon said in an offering document on
Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)&#8217;s oilfield-marketing website. One of Exxon&#8217;s
partners on the project, Hess Corp. (HES), last year wrote down the
value of two of the three wells already drilled at the prospect
after they came up dry. 
The block lies beneath a layer of salt below the sea floor
in the same region that yielded discoveries such as Tupi, a 6.5
billion-barrel field now known as Lula, Exxon said in the
offering document. 
Exxon owns 40 percent of the prospect and is the operator
of the project. Hess of New York holds a 40 percent stake, and
Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) owns the rest. Hess
expensed its share of costs for the Exxon-drilled Sabia-1 and
Azulo wells during the fourth quarter of 2010, Gregory Hill,
Hess&#8217; executive vice president of worldwide exploration, said
during a Jan. 26 conference call with analysts. 
Agreement 
Exxon and partners Hess and Petrobras, as the Brazilian oil
company is known, &#8220;agreed to seek a fourth co-venturer&#8221; for
the project, Patrick McGinn, a spokesman for Exxon&#8217;s exploration
unit, said today in an e-mailed statement. 
&#8220;We remain interested in future opportunities in Brazil,&#8221;
McGinn said in the e-mail. 
In the offering document, Exxon said an investor must fund
the drilling of one well in the prospect in exchange for the 25
percent stake. The site has already received drilling permits
from the Brazilian government, Exxon said. A data room is being
set up in Houston for prospective buyers. 
&#8220;This opportunity should appeal to companies looking to
gain access to the significant pre-salt play in Brazil,&#8221; Exxon
said in the offering document.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Dmitry Pugachevsky, who oversaw analysis of some of the bank&#8217;s

division. 
Pugachevsky, who has more than 18 years&#8217; experience in the

based JPMorgan. Before that, he was the global head of credit
analytics at Bear Stearns Cos. 
Changes to derivatives regulation in the U.S. and new
international capital rules for banks &#8220;have brought a

firms to adopt active counterparty risk-management systems,&#8221;
Pugachevsky said in a statement released by Summit, New Jersey-
based Quantifi today. 
Pugachevsky has a doctorate in applied mathematics from
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

Protesters assembling today outside a
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) building in New Jersey were met by
almost as many security guards and police officers as &#8220;Occupy
Wall Street&#8221; demonstrators sought to single out the bank. 
About 50 people gathered at a Goldman Sachs building
surrounded by metal barricades in Jersey City, where 30 to 40
officers and guards were waiting. The investment bank&#8217;s
employees watched from windows as the crowd chanted &#8220;We are the
99 percent&#8221; before breaking into discussion groups. 
&#8220;Goldman Sachs has too many people in government, and too
much influence,&#8221; said Pat Meany, 53, who arrived on his bicycle
and wore clothes painted with fluorescent colors and peace
symbols. &#8220;It seems like they&#8217;re looking out for America&#8217;s rich.
It&#8217;s not for the good of all Americans.&#8221; 
In Trenton, about three dozen protesters were initially
outnumbered by members of the media for a simultaneous gathering
at the World War II memorial across from the Statehouse. The
crowd grew to about 75 people within an hour as participants
took turns to speak about corporate greed, the influence of
money on politics, war and the environment. 
&#8220;There is no reason why this country should be the way it
is,&#8221; said Heath Weaver, 46, of Toms River, a self-employed
videographer who came to the Trenton event with a sleeping bag.
&#8220;Instead of people coming together we&#8217;ve been fighting against
each other and nothing&#8217;s getting solved.&#8221; 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the demonstration.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said Chief Executive
Officer Robert Iger will take on the added role of chairman next
year at the theme-park and entertainment company, part of a plan
to appoint a new CEO in 2015. 
Iger, 60, will succeed John E. Pepper at the annual meeting
in March, Burbank, California-based Disney said today in a
statement. Pepper, 73, a former chairman and CEO of Procter 
Gamble Co., has led the board since 2007. 
Disney didn&#8217;t name a successor for Iger, who oversaw the
acquisitions of Pixar and Marvel in the past five years and will
become executive chairman in 2015. The company will combine the
top roles for the first time since 2004, when CEO Michael Eisner
was stripped of the chairmanship after a failed proxy fight
waged by Roy Disney, Walt&#8217;s nephew. The company wanted to keep
Iger and have a smooth transition, Pepper said. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m totally surprised that they would do this again,&#8221;
said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware&#8217;s
John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance. &#8220;Why stick
your head in a blender? An executive just shouldn&#8217;t be in charge
of the board that monitors him.&#8221; 
Two of Disney&#8217;s top executives, Tom Staggs and Jay Rasulo,
swapped roles at the end of 2009, with Chief Financial Officer
Staggs assuming the job of parks chief and Rasulo becoming CFO,
in a move designed to bolster the experience of both men. 
Race to the Top? 
Iger &#8220;set up a race between the two by having them switch
jobs that ought to help him make that decision,&#8221; said David Joyce, a Miller Tabak  Co. analyst in New York who recommends
buying Disney shares. &#8220;They are both 20-year veterans at the
company and have strong operational backgrounds.&#8221; 
Disney&#8217;s largest business is media networks, led by Anne Sweeney and George Bodenheimer, co-chairmen. The division, which
includes ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channel, had $17.2 billion in
fiscal 2010 sales and contributed two-thirds of Disney&#8217;s $7.6
billion in operating income. 
Disney fell 33 cents to $31.70 at the close in New York and
has declined 15 percent this year. 
The company also extended Iger&#8217;s contract through 2016 and
is increasing his salary to $2.5 million annually from $2
million now. The new agreement includes a $12 million annual
cash bonus target, as well as options and restricted stock
valued at $15.5 million, Disney said. His current agreement ends
in 2013. 
&#8216;Strong Performer&#8217; 
&#8220;Iger has made some forward thinking moves that have made
the company a strong performer,&#8221; Joyce said in an interview.
&#8220;He was the first to embrace digital technology and positioned
the company well with the Pixar and Marvel acquisitions.&#8221; 
The bonus is based on performance yardsticks that include
operating income, return on capital, after-tax free cash flow
and earnings per share, the company said. The stock awards will
be based on total shareholder return and earnings per share,
relative to the SP 500. 
In the announcement, Disney said total shareholder return
under Iger is five times higher than the SP 500 index since he
took over as CEO. 
&#8220;The board is delighted that the company has been able to
secure the longer-term continuation of Bob&#8217;s unique blend of
experience and leadership skills,&#8221; Pepper said. Iger &#8220;will
continue to serve the long-term interests of shareholders.&#8221; 
As part of the transition, Disney will appoint an
independent lead director when Iger becomes chairman, according
to the statement. 
Iger was named president of Disney in 2000 and succeeded
Eisner as CEO in October 2005. He led the $8.06 billion purchase
of the Pixar animation studio in 2006 and the $4.2 billion
acquisition of Marvel Entertainment in 2010. He previously
headed Disney&#8217;s ABC television unit.

The cost to protect Morgan Stanley (MS)
bonds against losses dropped for the fourth day as concern eased
that its balance sheet will be impaired by Europe&#8217;s sovereign
debt crisis and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) analysts said investors
should wager on the bank&#8217;s creditworthiness. 
Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley fell 43 basis points
to 431 basis points as of 3:49 p.m. in New York, according to
prices from London-based data provider CMA. The five-year
contracts have declined from 650 basis points on Oct. 4, the
highest since October 2008, the month after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy. 
Creditor confidence in New York-based Morgan Stanley is
rebounding after crumbling for two straight weeks amid
speculation the firm faced losses tied to Europe&#8217;s fiscal
imbalances that has sent borrowing costs on governments from
Greece to Italy to records and triggered drops in the stocks of
the region&#8217;s lenders, led by French banks. 
&#8220;We believe concerns regarding its European swap and loan
exposures appear overdone, as the firm signaled its net
exposures to France and the periphery are modest if not
immaterial,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts and strategists including
John Marshall , Louise Pitt and Daniel Harris said in a note
today. 
The analysts recommended investors sell protection with
one-year contracts tied to Morgan Stanley debt that were quoted
at about 640 basis points. That&#8217;s equivalent to about $640,000
on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. 
The surge in credit swaps doesn&#8217;t &#8220;reflect actual credit
fundamentals&#8221; for a bank a with a $182 billion global liquidity
pool at the end of the second quarter, they said. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. 
Cross-Border Exposure 
Morgan Stanley had about $28 billion of cross-border
exposure to French banks at the end of June before accounting
for offsetting hedges and collateral, according to a filing with
the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. 
Cross-border outstandings include cash deposits,
receivables, loans and securities, as well as short-term
collateralized loans of securities or cash known as repurchase
agreements or reverse repurchase agreements. 
While Morgan Stanley hasn&#8217;t updated those figures, the
total risk to France and the country&#8217;s lenders is less than $2
billion when collateral and hedges are included, Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York estimated in a
Sept. 23 note to clients. The bank&#8217;s current exposure to the
nation and its banks is zero after hedges and collateral, a
person close to the firm said Sept. 30. 
Relative to Peers 
Disclosures by the company when it announces third-quarter
earnings this month are likely to calm fears, causing credit
swaps to narrow relative to peers, the Goldman Sachs strategists
said. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit swaps through yesterday were
trading 164 basis points wider than the average of the six-
biggest U.S. banks, according to prices from London-based data
provider CMA. The gap reached 226 basis points at the close of
trading on Oct. 3, the widest since October 2008. 
Swaps on other banks also decreased today. Contracts on
Citigroup Inc. (C) fell 10 basis points to a mid-price of 290 basis
points, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) dropped 5 to 394 and swaps on
Goldman Sachs declined 19 to 355, CMA prices show. 
A benchmark gauge of U.S. company credit risk snapped three
days of declines as Fitch Ratings downgraded Spain and Italy,
overshadowing positive jobs data in the U.S. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index , which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.7 basis point to a mid-
price of 139.6 basis points as of 3:58 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. The measure
had earlier declined as much as 2.6. 
Payrolls Data 
The swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has dropped
from 150.1 on Oct. 3 as investor speculation grew that Europe&#8217;s
leaders are progressing in stemming the debt crisis. 
&#8220;September&#8217;s payrolls data is a light in the middle of the
tunnel for the credit markets,&#8221; said Guy LeBas, chief fixed-
income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in
Philadelphia. &#8220;It&#8217;s not enough to ease investor anxiety
permanently, but it should provide a catalyst for some relief to
these wider spreads.&#8221; 
Payrolls climbed by 103,000 workers after a revised 57,000
increase the prior month that was more than originally
estimated, Labor Department data showed today in Washington.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is trying to
persuade the National Hockey League&#8217;s New Jersey Devils to sell
bonds backed by the team&#8217;s future television revenue, newsletter
Asset-Backed Alert reported, without saying where it got the
information. 
The sale, which Goldman Sachs bankers proposed to the team
this week, could raise between $75 million and $100 million, the
report said today. The team&#8217;s officials are reviewing the pitch,
according to the newsletter. 
A sale may depend on whether Jeff Vanderbeek, the former
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. executive who owns 47 percent of
the team, can buy the stake held by co-owner Ray Chambers, the
report said. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in
New York, declined to comment. Vanderbeek didn&#8217;t immediately

Morgan Stanley (MS) shares are likely to
rally when the firm reports earnings this month as management
eases concern that profit will be hurt by risks linked to
European sovereign debt, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. 
Morgan Stanley is likely to provide more details on its
sovereign risk and improved liquidity, helping shares to rally
to 70 percent of tangible book value from their current 57
percent, analysts at New York-based Goldman Sachs wrote in a
note today. They recommended investors buy $16 October calls and
sell short-dated credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, which
is also based in New York. 
Investors&#8217; concerns that the firm has large European swap
exposures are &#8220;overdone,&#8221; analysts and strategists including
John Marshall and Louise Pitt said in the note. They made the
recommendation even as they said third-quarter earnings are
likely to be &#8220;weak.&#8221; Goldman Sachs left its &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating
unchanged. 
&#8220;The risk/reward balance of MS shares at current levels
appear tempting,&#8221; the analysts said, referring to the company
by its stock ticker. &#8220;MS should be able to ride out the current
market duress assuming global macroeconomic indicators do not
materially decay. Moreover, concerns regarding its European swap
and loan exposures appear unwarranted, as the firm has signaled
its net exposures to France and the periphery are modest if not
immaterial.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley fell 80 cents, or 5.3 percent, to $14.38 at
12:40 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares gained 22 percent the three days through yesterday, the
largest three-day climb since May 2009. That rally left the
shares down 44 percent this year. An increase to 70 percent of
tangible book value would imply a jump to $18.63. 
Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley, the owner of the
world&#8217;s biggest retail brokerage, fell 54 basis points to 420 as
of 11:07 a.m. in New York, according to broker Phoenix Partners
Group. The five-year contracts have declined from 650 basis
points on Oct. 4, the highest since October 2008, the month
after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won European Union
approval to buy Skype Technologies SA in an $8.5 billion deal
adding the world&#8217;s most popular Web-calling service to the
biggest software maker. 
The deal won&#8217;t harm competition in the region, partly
because of the presence of rivals such as Google Inc., the
European Commission said in an e-mailed statement today. 
&#8220;The investigation found that the parties&#8217; activities
mainly overlap for video communications, where Microsoft is
active through its Windows Live Messenger,&#8221; the commission
said. &#8220;However, the commission considers that there are no
competition concerns in this growing market where numerous
players, including Google, are present.&#8221; 
Microsoft agreed in May to acquire Luxembourg-based Skype,
with 170 million active users, from investors led by private
equity firm Silver Lake. The acquisition, Microsoft&#8217;s largest,
is also the biggest Internet takeover in more than a decade.

ExxonMobil Corp. said it&#8217;s responding
to an oil sheen observed Oct. 7 near its Billings, Montana,
refinery, about 15 miles from an Exxon pipeline spill in July. 
&#8220;ExxonMobil has no pipelines or similar oil containing
equipment in close proximity to the leak,&#8221; said Rachael Moore,
a spokeswoman for the Dallas-based company, in an e-mail
today. The company has &#8220;no reason&#8221; to believe its facilities
were the source of the oil, she said. 
A spill response team from the refinery laid boom to limit
potential environmental damage, and the &#8220;small amount of oil&#8221;
is contained in a side channel of the river, Moore said. 
The company is investigating the source of the sheen, she
said. Moore declined to provide an estimate of how much oil is
in the sheen. 
On July 1, Exxon&#8217;s Silvertip pipeline in Montana ruptured,
spilling as much as 1,000 barrels of crude into the Yellowstone
River. The cleanup effort, which is being led by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, has involved more than 600
people and is expected to cost the company an estimated $42.6
million, Exxon has said.

Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, canceled a
planned appearance tomorrow at Barnard College, whose president
joined the company&#8217;s board four months ago. 
&#8220;Mr. Blankfein&#8217;s office informed us that he would be
unable to deliver his lecture as planned, due to an unavoidable
scheduling conflict,&#8221; Kathryn Kolbert, director of Barnard&#8217;s
Athena Center for Leadership Studies, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;We expect that his talk will be rescheduled for a
future date.&#8221; 
The &#8220;Power Talk&#8221; with Blankfein was cancelled because he
&#8220;must be in Washington D.C. that evening,&#8221; the Athena Center
said on its website. 
Debora L. Spar, president of the women-only liberal-arts
school, joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board at a meeting in London on
June 16, her 48th birthday. Blankfein, 57, and his wife Laura, a
Barnard College alumna and former trustee, donated $50,000 to
the New York-based college in the fiscal year ended Jan. 31,
2010, their nonprofit foundation&#8217;s federal tax filings show. 
Students at Columbia University, across the street from
Barnard, had organized a week-long protest against Blankfein
called &#8220;School the Squid,&#8221; which included discussions about
corporate greed and power abuse, the student-run Columbia Daily
Spectator reported on its website today. 
Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before it converted to a bank in
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., set a pay record in 2007 when it awarded
Blankfein a $67.9 million bonus. 
A 2009 article by Matt Taibbi in Rolling Stone magazine
labeled the company &#8220;a great vampire squid wrapped around the
face of humanity.&#8221; 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
confirmed that Blankfein cancelled his talk due to a scheduling
conflict. He declined further comment.

Morgan Stanley (MS) and Citigroup Inc. (C)
led U.S. banks higher in New York trading after European leaders
pledged to deliver a plan to stem the debt crisis that has led
to concerns about global lenders&#8217; balance sheets. 
Morgan Stanley climbed $1.05, or 7.4 percent, to $15.29 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, bringing
its increase during the last week to 23 percent. Citigroup
jumped 7.6 percent and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) rose 6.4 percent,
helping to lead the 81-company Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index to a 5.1 percent gain. 
The SP 500 has rebounded about 9 percent from a 13-month
low on Oct. 3 amid optimism that European leaders will succeed
in taming the debt crisis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said yesterday they will
deliver a plan to recapitalize European banks and address the
Greek debt crisis by the Nov. 3 Group of 20 summit. 
Every company in the SP Financials Index climbed today.
The index has declined 22 percent this year. Morgan Stanley,
based in New York, is down 44 percent this year. Bank of
America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, has dropped 53
percent, while New York-based Citigroup lost 44 percent. 
Merkel said European leaders will do &#8220;everything
necessary&#8221; to ensure that banks have enough capital. Belgium
also said today it will buy part of Dexia SA and provide
security for depositors as part of a plan to rescue the lender. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said last week
that U.S. financial firms have strengthened and there is
&#8220;absolutely&#8221; no chance of another collapse like Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services company, rose to a
record, surpassing the mark set in July. 
IBM rose 2.3 percent to $186.62 at the close in New York,
giving it a market value of $222.9 billion. The price topped the
$185.21 it reached July 19. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s attractive as a safer, less volatile investment in
tech in very turbulent times,&#8221; said Ed Maguire, an analyst at
Credit Agricole Securities USA in New York who rates the shares
&#8220;outperform.&#8221; 
IBM, which went public in 1915, has gained 27 percent this
year, making it the best performer of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average. The index, down 1.3 percent this year, jumped 3 percent
today as global markets rallied. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano divested the
company&#8217;s PC business six years ago, turning the company once
known for mainframe computers into the world&#8217;s biggest computer-
services provider. IBM is celebrating its 100th anniversary this
year.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), trying to reverse
disappointing sales for its Windows Phone, is counting on
Samsung Electronics Co. and other manufacturing partners to step
up retailer incentives and boost in-store promotions. 
Both Samsung and HTC Corp. have committed to increasing
marketing budgets for the phones, said Andy Lees, president of
Microsoft&#8217;s mobile unit, in an interview. While manufacturers
will determine how the money is spent, some of it will probably
go toward spurring retail staff to tout Windows Phone models, he
said. New handsets with the new Windows Phone 7.5 will go on
sale in the coming weeks, Lees said. 
Since the release of the previous version last October, the
Windows Phone has missed the company&#8217;s sales expectations, and
Microsoft has continued to lose ground to Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone
and devices based on Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android. Microsoft needs to
do a better job of marketing the new software, which is much
improved, said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner Inc. 
&#8220;From a technical perspective, it really does put them on
par with the other competitors, but a lot of times Microsoft
gets it right with the technology and then fumbles the marketing
message,&#8221; he said. Mobile-phone retailers haven&#8217;t cooperated in
the past, Gartenberg said. &#8220;If you went to a store they showed
you anything other than a Windows Phone. If you asked for a
Windows Phone, they tried to talk you out of it.&#8221; 
Retail Rules 
Microsoft is especially reliant on the carriers&#8217; retail
salespeople in the U.S., where more than 80 percent of phones
are sold by stores owned by mobile operators, Lees said. In
other countries, a larger percentage of handsets are sold by the
phone makers themselves. He didn&#8217;t specify what form the
incentives might take. 
Windows Phone 7.5, also known as Mango, was released last
month to existing Windows handset customers. In addition to more
aggressive marketing, Microsoft&#8217;s partnership with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)
will help sales, Lees said. Nokia announced earlier this year
that it would base its handsets on Windows Phone software, a bid
to reinvigorate its smartphone strategy. Nokia directly or
indirectly controls more than 6,000 stores, Lees said. 
Gartner forecasts that Microsoft will become the No. 2
smartphone operating system in 2015, with market share of 20
percent. That would vault it past Apple&#8217;s iOS, with Android
remaining in the top spot. Achim Berg, head of Windows Phone
marketing, said at a September conference in Berlin that the 20
percent share may be a conservative estimate. 
First Quarter 
Next year, Microsoft will account for 11 percent of the
market, up from 5.6 percent this year, Gartner said in an April
report. Lees declined to forecast numbers himself, except to say
he expects market share to rise starting in the first quarter of
2012. 
Manufacturers plan to produce a Windows phone that uses the
high-speed wireless technology known as long-term evolution, or
LTE, in the &#8220;not-too-distant future,&#8221; Lees said. That will
make mobile carriers more eager to promote the Windows Phone. 
Cheaper models also will be produced, giving a boost to the
operating system, Lees said. While handset makers and the
carriers determine prices and subsidies, consumers should see
Windows Phone devices for less than $100 in the U.S., he said. 
&#8220;The stars are really starting to align for us,&#8221; Lees
said. 
The new software, which better integrates apps, search and
phone features, received positive reviews from AllThingsD,
Gizmodo and Bloomberg&#8217;s Rich Jaroslovsky. 
Movies, Maps 
Search for a movie, and the phone brings up a synopsis,
running time, showings nearby, and lets you buy tickets. It also
lists apps related to movies. It has indoor maps so you can find
the parking lot at the mall where the theater is located. A
local app gives you nearby restaurants and if you&#8217;ve downloaded
OpenTable, there&#8217;s a reserve button right there. 
The search key brings up the option to scan book or album
covers for product matches. It will also scan foreign language
text to translate a French restaurant menu. The software can
listen to a piece of music and identify it. 
Microsoft rose 2.6 percent to $26.94 at close in New York.
The stock has dropped 3.5 percent this year.

The cost to protect against losses
on Morgan Stanley (MS) debt dropped to the lowest in almost three
weeks after European leaders pledged this week to ensure the
region&#8217;s banks have enough capital to withstand the sovereign
debt crisis. 
Credit-default swaps on Morgan Stanley bonds fell 41.7
basis points from Oct. 7 to 392.9 basis points, the lowest since
Sept. 21, according to data provider CMA. The New York-based
bank&#8217;s contracts have declined from 582.7 on Oct. 3, the highest
since October 2008. Bond markets in the U.S. were closed
yesterday for the Columbus Day holiday. A benchmark gauge of
U.S. corporate credit risk tumbled to the lowest in three weeks. 
The drop in swaps prices signals that investors are
regaining some confidence in the banking system since German
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Oct. 9 that the region&#8217;s leaders
will do &#8220;everything necessary&#8221; to ensure that European banks
are capitalized after meeting with French President Nicolas Sarkozy. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s swaps had led a surge in contracts on
U.S. banks amid concerns that an escalating crisis in Europe
would trigger losses globally. 
&#8220;We have valuations in the market now that reflect the
binary outcomes we&#8217;re facing as investors: whether we&#8217;re going
to see a blowup in Europe or whether we&#8217;re going to see an
austerity program in the U.S. or whether were going to somehow
keep on keeping on with gridlock in Washington and the euro zone
keeping together,&#8221; Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive officer of
Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, which manages $17
billion, said in a webcast today. 
Markit CDX Index 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, decreased 4 basis points from
Oct. 7 to a mid-price of 135.3 basis points, according to Markit
Group Ltd. The index has fallen from 150.1 basis points on Oct.
3, the highest since May 2009. In London, the Markit iTraxx
Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-grade ratings rose
0.8 for the day to 179.1. 
Both indexes typically decrease as investor confidence
improves and rise as it deteriorates. Credit swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said third-quarter profit rose as proceeds
from a refinery sale and the strengthening U.S. dollar more than
offset slowing oil demand. 
Chevron&#8217;s net income in the period that ended Sept. 30 was
&#8220;comparable&#8221; with second-quarter results, when the company
reported a profit of $7.73 billion, exceeding the $3.77 billion
earned during the third quarter of 2010. Chevron announced
selected third-quarter results in a statement distributed via
Business Wire. The company, based in San Ramon, California, is
scheduled to release full third-quarter results on Oct. 28. 
Chevron sold a U.K. oil refinery and related storage
terminals and marketing assets in Ireland to Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)
in August for $1.73 billion as part of Chief Executive Officer
John Watson&#8217;s effort to shed lower-profit fuel-making units. The
company said today that it recorded a $500 million third-quarter
gain from the sale. 
Chevron&#8217;s oil and natural-gas production during July and
August fell 5 percent from the full third-quarter of 2010 to the
equivalent of 2.6 million barrels a day, the company said. The
declines stemmed from a pipeline incident in Thailand and repair
work to installations in the Gulf of Mexico, Kazakhstan and the
U.K. 
A U.K. tax increase on oil and gas production prompted
Chevron to take a $150 million &#8220;catch-up charge&#8221; during the
third quarter and will cost an additional $40 million during the
current period, according to the statement. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. of Irving, Texas, is the largest U.S. oil
company by market value.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the top-ranked
fixed-income research firm on Wall Street, upgraded its
recommendation on high-grade corporate debt to &#8220;neutral&#8221; as
the assets attract more money from investors. 
The bank, which cut the debt to &#8220;underweight&#8221; on June 15,
said valuations are more attractive than low-yielding U.S.
Treasuries, especially after the Federal Reserve&#8217;s &#8220;Operation
Twist&#8221; program announced last month, analysts led by Eric Beinstein wrote in a note today. Inflows to the asset class,
high cash balances and &#8220;solid&#8221; corporate credit fundamentals
also fueled the outlook shift, according to the note. 
&#8220;Year-end tends to be when investors review their asset
allocations, and we believe HG U.S. corporate bonds will be
deemed about the best asset class to own heading into the low
growth and potentially recessionary environment of 2012,&#8221;
analysts from the New York-based bank wrote. 
Yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury have fallen to
about 2.1 percent from 2.97 percent four months ago as Europe&#8217;s
sovereign debt crisis worsens and after the Fed decided to
replace short-term Treasuries in its $1.65 trillion portfolio
with long-term bonds in a policy known as Operation Twist.
Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have increased to
4.13 percent from 3.72 percent on June 15, increasing the allure
of such securities. 
The analysts, ranked No. 1 investment-grade strategists in
Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s annual poll, didn&#8217;t assign an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation to high-grade corporate debt,
citing growth slowdowns in the U.S. and Europe that will lead to
heightened &#8220;event risk,&#8221; according to the note. They also
cited the lack of a solution to the European debt crisis, asset
sales by European banks and limited allocations to financial
debt versus non-financial. 
A &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation at JPMorgan means the position
is expected to perform in line with benchmarks over the next
three months, according to today&#8217;s note. 
Investment-grade bonds are rated Baa3 or higher by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and BBB- and above by Standard  Poor&#8217;s.

General Motors Co. (GM), the biggest U.S.
automaker, is looking at India, Association of Southeast Asian
Nations member states and Africa as sites for expanding
production to tap growing demand in emerging markets. 
&#8220;If there were two areas that I thought were open to
additional investment, those would be India and the ASEAN
area,&#8221; Tim Lee, GM&#8217;s president of international operations,
said in an interview in Dubai. 
India&#8217;s economy, the third-largest in Asia after China&#8217;s
and Japan&#8217;s, is forecast to grow 7.8 percent in 2011 and 7.5
percent next year, the International Monetary Fund said in
September. India will probably in the long term become Detroit-
based GM&#8217;s third-biggest market after the U.S. and China, Lee
said. The company builds vehicles in India in a joint venture
with Shanghai-based SAIC Motor Corp. 
There is a &#8220;need to look at more production facilities,
but this is yet to be done,&#8221; Lee said in the interview
yesterday. 
The U.S. automaker increased sales in India by 17 percent
in September to 10,112 vehicles, with growth propelled by the
diesel-powered Chevrolet Beat small car, GM said on Oct. 3. The
automaker has estimated that it accounted for 3.4 percent of
India&#8217;s car market in the first nine months of this year. 
&#8220;We expect to grow our share dramatically in India over
the next 12 to 18 months,&#8221; Lee said. 
The executive, who was recently on a visit to Cairo and is
headed to Johannesburg, said Africa is an emerging growth area
&#8220;that would likely support some additional capacity.&#8221; 
South Africa, where GM builds vehicles in Port Elizabeth,
and Egypt, where it has a plant in the Cairo suburb of Maadi,
account for 70 percent of the U.S. company&#8217;s sales in Africa,
the manufacturer said on Nov. 22, when it announced a
reorganization of operations in the region.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) stock analysts
took top honors in Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s rating of
the best U.S. financial researchers for the second consecutive
year, winning by the narrowest margin of any firm since 2002. 
JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, had 40
top-ranked analysts in the survey, edging out Barclays Plc (BARC) and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch, which tied for second
place with 39 each, the publication said today in a statement.
The number of top analysts at Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) rose to 25 from
18, the largest increase, as Germany&#8217;s biggest lender climbed to
eighth place from ninth last year. 
Institutional Investor&#8217;s 40th annual All-America Research
Team ranking tallied ratings from 3,500 fund managers and
analysts at more than 1,000 investment firms overseeing $10.7
trillion of U.S. equities. New York-based JPMorgan, Barclays and
Bank of America held the top spots even as fewer of their
analysts made the cut. 
&#8220;The competition is fierce,&#8221; Thomas Johnson, the
magazine&#8217;s research editor, said in the statement. &#8220;In a period
of unprecedented economic uncertainty, from sovereign debt
crises in Europe and political unrest in the Middle East to
gridlock in Washington, it&#8217;s not surprising that investors would
flock to banks with global platforms.&#8221; 
UBS Gains 
JPMorgan had 46 analysts on the list in 2010 to capture the
top ranking for the first time, snapping a two-year winning
streak for Barclays Capital, the brokerage arm of London-based
Barclays, which placed second with 43 analysts. Barclays owns
the U.S. operations of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which
ranked No. 1 in each of the previous five years. Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America ranked third in 2010. 
UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, climbed to tie Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN) in fourth place with 43 analysts, up from fifth
last year. New York-based Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. was the
only firm in the top 10 to fall, slipping to ninth place from
sixth with 22 analysts, down from 25 last year. 
Winners include John Pitzer, who covers technology for
Zurich-based Credit Suisse, and JPMorgan&#8217;s Steven Alexopoulos,
who took the top spot for Banks/Midcap analysts. 

     The following firms ranked highest in the survey:

Liberians began voting today,
deciding whether to give Nobel Peace Prize winner Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf a second term in the presidency amid promises to create
jobs and boost investment. 
Liberians lined up in rainy weather for at least two hours
before voting stations opened at 8 a.m. in the capital,
Monrovia. 
&#8220;There are no reported incidents of violence or any form of
disruptions,&#8221; Bobby Livingstone, director of press for the
National Elections Commission, said by phone. 
Johnson-Sirleaf, 72, faces 15 candidates including Winston
Tubman, 70, a lawyer whose running mate is George Weah, a soccer
star who won the FIFA World Player of the Year award in 1995,
and 60-year-old lawyer Charles Brumskine. If no candidate wins
more than 50 percent of the vote a second round of balloting
will be held. 
Announcement of results will start tomorrow with the final
outcome given Oct. 26, said James Fromoyan, chairman of the
elections body, in a statement broadcast on radio stations Oct.
9. Voters are also choosing 15 junior senators and 73 lawmakers,
he said. 
Closing Borders 
Johnson-Sirleaf, who was elected Africa&#8217;s first female
president, has been working to rebuild a country devastated by a
14-year civil war that ended in 2003, leaving an estimated
250,000 people dead. The economy is forecast to expand 6.9
percent this year, outpacing the estimated sub-Saharan African
average of 5.2 percent, according to the International Monetary
Fund. The former banker was named a joint winner of the Nobel
prize on Oct. 7 for her work in promoting women&#8217;s rights.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley may consider dropping their status as bank holding
companies to avoid expenses tied to the Volcker rule, said David Hilder, an analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group LLP. 
The rule in its current form would impose costs on lenders
and drive capital to non-bank market makers, causing the two New
York-based firms to consider whether to stop being banks, Hilder
said in a note yesterday, when four regulatory agencies issued a
298-page draft of the rule for public comment. 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the biggest U.S.
securities firms before they converted to bank holding companies
after the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. Both became subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve
and won access to central bank programs such as the discount
window, which are designed to protect deposit-taking banks. 
&#8220;The regulators have proposed a massive new compliance
burden on banks to prove that their market-making activities are
just that, and not proprietary trading in disguise,&#8221; wrote
Hilder, who&#8217;s based in New York. &#8220;If these regulations are
adopted in anything close to their proposed form, there will be
large additional costs imposed on banks as market-makers that
will not apply to market-makers not owned by banks.&#8221; 
David Konrad, a bank analyst at KBW Inc., said Goldman
Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) are unlikely to change their status as
bank holding companies to dodge the Volcker restrictions. 
&#8216;Protecting Deposits&#8217; 
&#8220;If they tried to do that, Congress would amend the rule
to say systemically important banks rather than bank holding
companies,&#8221; Konrad said in a phone interview. &#8220;This is part
protecting deposits, but also part too-big-to-fail. I don&#8217;t
think there&#8217;s any interest from the investment banks in doing
that, and I don&#8217;t think it would serve that purpose.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said
Jan. 21, 2010, the same day President Barack Obama announced his
support for the Volcker rule, that it was &#8220;unrealistic&#8221; to
imagine the firm won&#8217;t be a federally supervised bank. 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley made &#8220;modest profits&#8221;
from pure proprietary trading, which is why they willingly shut
down those desks, David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities,
wrote in a note today. The rule&#8217;s draft indicates regulators
won&#8217;t interfere with customer flow trading, he wrote. 
Goldman Sachs may be hurt by provisions that limit
investments in hedge funds and private equity, Trone wrote. Had
those restrictions been in place in recent years, they would
have cost the firm about $700 million, or 9 percent, of annual
earnings, he wrote. 
&#8216;Crown Jewel&#8217; Businesses 
The rule, named for former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, was
included in last year&#8217;s regulatory overhaul to rein in risky
trading that helped fuel the 2008 credit crisis. The central
bank, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency worked with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on the draft issued yesterday. 
Morgan Stanley climbed 45 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $15.84
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Goldman Sachs
advanced 2.5 percent to $99.11. 
Increased regulation and capital rules may mean the largest
banks have to split off some &#8220;crown jewel&#8221; businesses, said
Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern
School of Business and a former Goldman Sachs partner. 
&#8220;You have to ask which parts of the business are they
simply not going to be able to continue to do or maintain the
talented people who do it because those guys would have better
options if they left the firm and went to a hedge fund,&#8221; Smith
said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want to be left with the third team running
your expensive market-making trading desk.&#8221; 
It&#8217;s too soon to say whether banks affected by the rule
would have to break up to remain competitive and the costs of
the proposal are likely to shift some business to smaller
players, Glenn Schorr, a Nomura Holdings Inc. analyst, wrote in
a note today. Companies and investors are likely to push back
during the comment period to &#8220;dial back&#8221; some parts of the
rule, he wrote. 
Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s Mark Lake declined to comment.

Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said conventional quantitative easing may
not be enough for the U.S. and U.K. economies and more
&#8220;targeted&#8221; policies are needed to boost confidence and growth. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not obvious to me that conventional QE in the U.K.
or the U.S. has got that much bang for its buck,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said
in an interview with Maryam Nemazee on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;The Pulse&#8221; program in London today. &#8220;More imaginative QE or
forms of specific targeted easing, probably involving more
infrastructure or doing something to get bank funding spreads
down, would be more likely to get a stronger result.&#8221; 
His comments were echoed by former Bank of England policy
maker Sushil Wadhwani, who said today that global central banks
need to do &#8220;more creative&#8221; forms of monetary policy to prevent
the global economy slipping into a recession. 
The Bank of England restarted asset purchases last week,
its first expansion of policy since 2009, citing risks to the
recovery from the euro-area debt crisis, while data today showed
the unemployment rate rose to the highest since 1996 in the
quarter through August. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve
announced last month an operation to replace $400 billion of
short-term debt in its portfolio with longer-term Treasuries,
aiming to reduce borrowing costs and spur the recovery. 
Less Impact 
The Bank of England&#8217;s new stimulus &#8220;will have less effect
this time than it did last time,&#8221; former Bank of England policy
maker Charles Goodhart said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;Last
Word&#8221; with Andrea Catherwood today. &#8220;The real problem isn&#8217;t
the level of official interest rates, but it&#8217;s the difficulties
the banks have in getting funding and the spreads the banks
charge.&#8221; 
He said there is a &#8220;very strong case&#8221; for trying to
provide more assistance to small businesses and first-time home
buyers. Referring to Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne&#8217;s credit-easing proposal, he said &#8220;more innovative
ways&#8221; to help boost credit are necessary. 
Wadhwani, founder of Wadhwani Asset Management LLP, said
global policy makers need to do three things &#8220;if they are to
prevent a relapse,&#8221; 
&#8220;First, they need to get firms better access to credit,&#8221;
he said in an e-mailed note co-written with Michael Dicks.
&#8220;Second, they need to help boost demand. And, third, they need
to deal with the euro crisis.&#8221; 
Direct Approach 
Wadhwani recommended U.K. authorities take a more direct
approach to boosting demand by issuing every adult a voucher
that can be spent in the next three months. That is &#8220;surely a
more effective form of quantitative easing&#8221; than the central
bank buying gilts, he said. 
He also said the U.K. and the U.S. can&#8217;t &#8220;play the
innocent bystander and plead with Europe to sort out its mess.&#8221; 
&#8220;Better surely to recognize both the global scale of the
problem and the political constraints that are currently
limiting European policy makers&#8217; room for manoeuvre, and act in
accordance,&#8221; he said. 
The U.K. unemployment data also showed that jobless claims
rose 17,500 in September, a seventh straight increase. Prime
Minister David Cameron said the figures were &#8220;very
disappointing,&#8221; adding that the government won&#8217;t abandon its
budget-reduction plan. 
&#8220;I think it would be a dangerous thing to rule out&#8221; the
U.K. economy deteriorating further &#8220;given what the evidence is
showing,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;It might be because of the fiscal
tightening that is coming home to roost.&#8221;

Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI), the largest
U.S. auto supplier, rose as much as 6.6 percent after
forecasting per-share profit and revenue growth for the 2012
fiscal year. 
Johnson Controls rose 5.7 percent to $31.86 at 11:08 a.m.
in New York after earlier reaching $32.13. The shares dropped 21
percent this year before today. 
Profit in the year that ends Sept. 30, 2012, will be $2.85
a share to $3 a share, including 9 cents to fund pensions and
consolidate a lithium-ion battery joint venture, a gain of as
much as 23 percent from fiscal year 2011. The average estimate
of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for a profit of $3.11 a
share, excluding the one-time items. 
&#8220;The guidance of at least 20 percent earnings growth is
much better than what is priced into the stock,&#8221; David Leiker,
an analyst with Robert W. Baird  Co. in Milwaukee, said in an

said today before its investor day conference in New York. 
Profit in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 increased to 75
cents a share, excluding some costs, compared with 60 cents a
year earlier, Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls said today in a
preliminary earnings statement. The average estimate of 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit of 78 cents a
share. Sales in the quarter were $10.7 billion, compared with an
average estimate of $10.5 billion. 
Improving Margins 
The company said sales and margins will improve in its
three business units, and it forecast higher auto production in
North America and China, while Europe mostly will be unchanged. 
Johnson Controls received 48 percent of its $34.3 billion
in revenue in its fiscal 2010 from its auto parts unit, which
makes seats and instrument panels. Johnson Controls also makes
car batteries and systems to manage building climate and
security. The company said it plans $1.7 billion in capital
investments this year. 
&#8220;The company&#8217;s long-term growth story is intact,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Stephen Roell said in the statement. 
Johnson Controls will release full fourth-quarter results
Oct. 27.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may say profit
slid 10 percent in the third quarter, the biggest drop in more
than two years, as Europe&#8217;s credit crisis and the U.S. debt-
ceiling debate spoiled optimism for an economic recovery. 
Tomorrow&#8217;s report from the New York-based bank will
probably show earnings of $3.96 billion, according to the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. That
compares with $4.42 billion a year earlier and $5.43 billion in
the three months ended June 30. 
Jes Staley, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, braced investors last month for a 30 percent
drop in trading revenue from the second quarter, when the
company generated $5.5 billion from that business. He said fees
from investment banking would tumble almost 50 percent to $1
billion. About $2 trillion in corporate bond issues came to
market in the first half before volume plummeted to about $550
billion in the third quarter, data compiled by Bloomberg show. 
&#8220;We expect another challenging quarter for the universal
bank group,&#8221; Frederick Cannon and David Konrad, analysts at
Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Inc. in New York, wrote in an Oct. 10
research note. &#8220;Declining markets and elevated volatility is
expected not only to slow investment-banking and trading
revenues but also to cause negative marks in investments.&#8221; 
JPMorgan, the first of the major U.S. banks to report
third-quarter earnings, will be a barometer for the rest of the
industry and the broader U.S. economy, the analysts wrote. 
Reserve Releases 
CEO Jamie Dimon, 55, led the bank to a record $17.4 billion
in net income last year, the most of any U.S. bank. Earnings
were buoyed by the release of $7 billion in reserves back into
income as the U.S. economy improved, a benefit that may have
continued in the third quarter and helped &#8220;soften the blow,&#8221;
Jason Goldberg, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
wrote in an Oct. 7 research note. 
At the same time, legal costs to settle lawsuits and other
claims against the company&#8217;s soured mortgage book will continue
to erode earnings, the analysts said. 
The bank, whose $2.25 trillion in assets as of June 30
makes it second to Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), is &#8220;the safe play&#8221; for investors in the sector,
Cannon and Konrad said. 
Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia and analyst with FBR Capital Markets in
Arlington, Virginia, instead recommends that investors either
&#8220;stay on the sidelines&#8221; or place their bets on better
capitalized banks such as Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. and U.S. Bancorp, he said in an Oct. 10
research note. 
Citigroup, Wells Fargo 
New York-based Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S.
lender, may report a profit of $2.5 billion when it releases
results on Oct. 17, and Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco,
will probably say it earned $3.87 billion when it announces
results the same day, the survey of analysts shows. Bank of
America may report a profit of $2.69 billion on Oct. 18 while
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) may say it earned $45.3 million. 
Slowing economic growth and heightened worries about
European sovereign debt have weighed on bank stocks all year.
None of the 24 members of the KBW Bank Index has posted a gain
in 2011, and the worst performer, Bank of America, is down 52
percent through yesterday. A jump in borrowing costs at some
banks, including New York-based Morgan Stanley, subsided last
week as investors became more optimistic that European Union
policy makers would solve the sovereign debt and banking crisis. 
Political &#8216;Incompetence&#8217; 
&#8220;American and EU politicians reached the limit of their
incompetence many months ago,&#8221; Christopher Whalen, founder of
Institutional Risk Analytics, said in a research note yesterday.
&#8220;We see the lack of business volumes and political uncertainty
going into 2012 as far more troubling trends in terms of non-
interest revenue sources for all financials.&#8221; 
Frederic Janbon, the global head of fixed-income at Paris-
based BNP Paribas SA, said in an interview that financial
markets have become &#8220;almost as dysfunctional and illiquid as
they were in 2008.&#8221; 
&#8220;The market is very difficult to trade and highly
sensitive to political news,&#8221; Janbon said. &#8220;Political risk has
moved to the forefront of people&#8217;s minds when looking at the
U.S. and Europe. Since July, anticipation of global economic
slowdown has fundamentally changed this situation. Anxiety has
now spread to all credit products.&#8221; 
Loan growth in the U.S. remains stagnant and net interest
margins, which measure the profit margin on lending, continue to
decline. Bank loans and leases fell $2.1 billion to $6.829
trillion from August 2010 through Sept. 28, according to Federal
Reserve data. 
Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$2.09 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a U.S. producer
of steelmaking coal, jumped 13 percent in New York after the
U.K.&#8217;s Independent reported that Anglo American Plc (AAL) and BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) may bid for the company. 
The potential bidder may be advised by JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the London-based newspaper said,
without citing anyone. Brazil&#8217;s Vale SA (VALE3) and Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA may also may bid, the newspaper said. The shares
rose to $75.22, the biggest gain in five weeks. 
Walter investor Audley Capital Advisors LLP said in July
that the Birmingham, Alabama-based company should explore a sale
because it lacked the leadership to take advantage of an
&#8220;unprecedented market opportunity&#8221; after coal prices jumped.
Walter appointed Walter J. Scheller III as Chief Executive
Officer on Sept. 12. He replaced interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard
and followed Keith Calder, who resigned as CEO in June after
telling the board he had differing opinions concerning
&#8220;management philosophy.&#8221; 
Demand from steelmakers in China and flood-related supply
disruptions in Australia have driven prices for coal to record
highs. Low-volatility coking coal traded at $270 a ton,
Knoxville, Tennessee-based Energy Publishing said in a report
last week. 
Emily Blyth, a spokeswoman for London-based Anglo, declined
to comment, as did Ruban Yogarajah, a spokesman for Melbourne-
based BHP, and Paul Blalock, a spokesman for Walter. 
Coal MA 
Vale doesn&#8217;t respond to market rumors, an official at the
company&#8217;s press office who asked not to be named citing Vale
policy, said in a telephone interview. No one at CSN returned
calls and e-mails seeking comment. 
Buying Walter could allow Anglo to replace assets it might
lose in Chile, Dominic O&#8217;Kane, an analyst at Liberum Capital
Ltd. in London, said today in a note. Chilean copper producer
Codelco said yesterday it plans to exercise an option to buy as
much as 49 percent of Anglo&#8217;s unit in the South American
country. 
There were $20.5 billion of takeover offers for coal miners
valued at $100 million or more announced in the first nine
months of 2011, compared with $10.4 billion in the year-earlier
period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Alpha Natural Resources Inc. bought rival U.S. coal
producer Massey Energy Co. in June for $7.1 billion. Peabody
Energy Corp. and ArcelorMittal agreed in August to pay A$4.8
billion ($4.9 billion) for Australia&#8217;s Macarthur Coal Ltd.,
which like Walter produces metallurgical coal. 
Walter acquired Vancouver-based Western Coal Corp. in April
for C$5.3 billion ($5.2 billion). Calder was the former CEO of
Western Coal. 
Walter operates mines in Alabama, West Virginia, British
Columbia and Wales.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) led
increases in the cost of protecting the debt of U.S. companies
on renewed concern that Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis will continue to
derail the economic recovery and after JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)
reported a drop in profit. 
Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs added 39 basis points
to 340 basis points, according to data provider CMA. Contracts
on JPMorgan climbed 8 to 142 and those tied to Morgan Stanley,
owner of the world&#8217;s largest retail brokerage, increased 29 to
387, the data show. 
A benchmark gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk rose from
the lowest level in three weeks after JPMorgan said revenue at
its investment-banking unit fell 13 percent from the second
quarter amid concern that Greece would default and the U.S.
economic recovery was stalling. That overshadowed a report that
applications for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S.
fell more than expected. 
Credit-default swaps on the biggest U.S. banks tend to
swing with market sentiment, acting as a &#8220;bizarre bellwether,&#8221;
Bonnie Baha, head of global developed credit group at DoubleLine
Capital LP, which has $17.5 billion in assets under management,
said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles. &#8220;I still don&#8217;t
get a sense that this is over yet in terms of the bank and
finance risk out there.&#8221; 
Contracts on Citigroup Inc. (C) increased 22 basis points to
250 basis points and contracts on General Electric Co. (GE)&#8217;s finance
arm General Electric Capital Corp. added 32 to 275. Those on San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) climbed 7 to 140.5. 
Six Largest Banks 
Even with today&#8217;s rise, contracts tied to the debt of the
six largest U.S. banks have decreased to 270 basis points from
360 basis points on Oct. 4, CMA data show, as European leaders
signaled progress in stemming the region&#8217;s debt crisis and
investor concern eased that bank balance sheets would be
infected by sovereign defaults. That&#8217;s equivalent to an average
of $270,000 to protect $10 million of debt for five years. 
JPMorgan swaps have dropped from 185 and Morgan Stanley (MS)
credit swaps declined from 650 basis points during the period. 
JPMorgan said third-quarter earnings fell to about $3.1
billion, or 73 cents a share, not including a 29 cents
accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on the same basis a year
earlier, the New York-based company said today. Net income was
$4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with the average per-
share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92 cents in a survey of
30 analysts by Bloomberg. 
Company Risk Gauge 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, rose 2.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 132.6 basis points at 4:56 p.m. New York time,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, snapped two days of
declines after dropping from 150.1 on Oct. 3. 
Investor confidence in company creditworthiness dropped
even as applications for unemployment insurance payments
decreased 1,000 in the week ended Oct. 8 to 404,000 Labor
Department figures showed. Economists forecast 405,000 claims,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. 
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 4.8 percent in New York
trading after the company reported that profit declined on a
slump in investment banking and trading. 
JPMorgan dropped $1.60 to $31.60 at 4:15 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange. Third-quarter earnings at the New York-
based lender fell to about $3.1 billion, or 73 cents a share,
not including a 29-cent accounting gain, from $4.71 billion on
the same basis a year earlier. 
Revenue at the investment-banking unit slid 13 percent from
the second quarter as concern that Greece would default and U.S.
lawmakers would fail to raise the debt ceiling roiled markets.
The firm said the division will face similar market conditions
for the rest of the year. 
&#8220;There was a lot of noise in this number,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner with the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets. &#8220;When you look
at the core number and back out the benefit of securities gains
and tax benefit, it&#8217;s starting to look like a mid-70 cent
number&#8221; for earnings per share, he said. 
Net income was $4.26 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared
with the average per-share estimate for adjusted earnings of 92
cents in a survey of 30 analysts by Bloomberg, the New York-
based company said today. 
Underlying Business 
The debt-valuation accounting gain &#8220;does not relate to the
underlying operations of the company,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, 55, said in a statement. Dimon said on a conference
call with journalists that the after-tax effect of the
accounting change was about 60 percent of the total gain for the
quarter. 
Matthew Burnell, an analyst at Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), estimated
JPMorgan would post $350 million in gains from the change in
debt valuation. U.S. accounting rules require the adjustment
when the value of a company&#8217;s debt declines, under the theory
that a profit would be realized if it were repurchased at a
discount. 
Third-quarter revenue declined 0.2 percent to $23.8 billion
from a year earlier. Fixed-income and equity-markets revenue
rose to $4.75 billion from $4.3 billion, driven by more than
$900 million in debt-valuation adjustments. 
Jes Staley, CEO of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, braced
investors last month for the drop in trading revenue from the
second quarter, when the company generated $5.5 billion from
that business. The investment bank&#8217;s staff dropped to 26,615 in
the third quarter from 27,716 in the second quarter, a decline
of 4 percent. 
Deposit Growth 
Total deposits surged 21 percent from a year earlier, to
$1.1 trillion. 
The company&#8217;s credit-card division, which posted losses for
all of 2009, generated almost 20 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s net
income for the quarter. The investment bank accounted for 38
percent. 
Fewer consumers fell behind on their credit-card payments
in the third quarter. Loans at least 30 days overdue, a signal
of future write-offs, fell to 2.9 percent from 4.6 percent in
the same quarter in 2010 and 3.0 percent in the second quarter.
Write-offs dropped to 4.7 percent from 8.9 percent the prior
year and 5.8 percent in the previous quarter. 
The slower decline in delinquency rates explains why the
company reduced its loan-loss reserve by only $170 million,
Dimon said on a conference call with analysts. 
Mixed Results 
&#8220;If you look at delinquencies, low rates, first-time
delinquent, all that kind of stuff, they&#8217;re kind of mixed. It
could very well improve again, but it&#8217;s flattened out,&#8221; Dimon
said. 
Brennan Hawken at UBS Investment Research in New York was
expecting a reserve release closer to $1 billion. 
&#8220;The worry is that they are seeing something in credit that
has caused them to stop releasing reserves,&#8221; Hawken said in an
interview. &#8220;That means there could be some trend going on that
has caused them to be cautious.&#8221; 
Retail banking, which includes home loans and checking
accounts, earned $1.16 billion, compared with $383 million
during the second quarter and $716 million a year earlier. The
division benefited from a $370 million reduction in loan-loss
provisions to $1.03 billion. 
Net Interest Margin 
JPMorgan, which has benefited from record low costs of
funding mortgages and other assets, faces a squeeze on its net
interest margin -- the difference between what it pays to borrow
money and what it gets for loans and on securities. 
The bank&#8217;s margin narrowed to 2.66 percent from 2.72
percent the previous quarter and 3.01 percent a year earlier. 
&#8220;Trading overall in the third quarter is going to be
challenged amid dislocations both home and abroad,&#8221; Jason Goldberg, a senior bank analyst at Barclays Capital in New York,
said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;During the quarter, you saw
both a slowdown in investment-banking activity and more
challenging trading conditions amid a spike in volatility fueled
by concerns in Europe.&#8221; 
Slowing economic growth and heightened concern about
European sovereign debt have weighed on bank stocks all year.
The KBW Bank Index (BKX) had dropped 28 percent this year, and the
worst performer, Bank of America Corp. (BAC), is down 53 percent. A
jump in borrowing costs at some banks, including New York-based
Morgan Stanley, subsided last week as investors became more
optimistic that European Union policy makers will find a
solution. 
JPMorgan was the first of the major U.S. lenders to report
third-quarter results. 
Citigroup Inc. (C), the third-biggest U.S. bank, may report a
profit of $2.49 billion when it releases results on Oct. 17, and
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, will probably say it earned
$3.87 billion when it announces results the same day, the
surveys of analysts shows. Bank of America may report a profit
of $2.73 billion on Oct. 18.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) persuaded a
judge to throw out shareholders&#8217; claims that the investment
bank&#8217;s compensation system improperly rewarded employees for
taking risks that hurt the firm&#8217;s stock price. 
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock concluded
yesterday that Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board acted properly in setting
up a pay plan for the fifth-biggest U.S. bank. The judge
dismissed a consolidated investor lawsuit claiming the plan
wrongly awarded billions of dollars in bonuses to executives and
employees, including Chairman Lloyd Blankfein, even as the
firm&#8217;s market value declined by $50 billion since 1999. 
Delaware law &#8220;provides corporate directors and officers
with broad discretion to act as they find appropriate in the
conduct of corporate affairs&#8221; and &#8220;in the exercise of their
business judgment on behalf of the corporation,&#8221; Glasscock
wrote in a 67-page opinion. 
Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007,
faced criticism from politicians and labor unions for its
compensation practices after getting taxpayer aid during the
financial crisis. 
In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the New York-based company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first
six months of this year, according to its website. That was 9
percent less than in the same period in 2010 as revenue tumbled
11 percent. 
&#8216;Limited Value&#8217; 
&#8220;The complaint fails to present facts that demonstrate
that the work done by Goldman&#8217;s 31,000 employees was of such
limited value to the corporation that no reasonable person in
the directors&#8217; position would have approved their levels of
compensation,&#8221; Glasscock said. 
Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, the operator of Philadelphia&#8217;s bus and rail network
and a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argued that the firm&#8217;s board
should be held accountable for not properly overseeing the
compensation system and employees&#8217; wrongful conduct. 
Septa&#8217;s lawyers said in court filings that Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year, while the firm settled U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission claims that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. 
$550 Million Penalty 
Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million, the largest
penalty ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to
resolve claims that marketing materials about the investments
had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007 as the U.S.
housing market faltered, without disclosing that a hedge fund
helped pick the underlying securities and then bet against the
investment vehicles, the SEC said in the suit Goldman settled.
The bank didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing as part of the accord. 
Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment on the Delaware ruling. 
Last month, a New York judge threw out another pension
fund&#8217;s suit that challenged Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation plan
for providing millions of dollars in bonuses to executives. 
New York State Supreme Court Justice Bernard J. Fried
dismissed suits filed by the Security Police  Fire
Professionals of America Retirement Fund and investor Judith A.
Miller on Sept. 21, according to court dockets. 
The Delaware case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Shareholder Litigation, CA5215, Delaware Chancery Court
(Wilmington).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reduced its
investment-bank workforce by almost 4 percent in the third
quarter and cut employee compensation costs 28 percent as the 
division grappled with fallout from the European debt crisis. 
The investment bank had 1,101 fewer employees at the end of
September than three months earlier and will continue to shrink
its staff of 26,615, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55,
told reporters on a conference call after releasing third-
quarter earnings today. 
While the bank isn&#8217;t planning layoffs, &#8220;we always trim our
sails,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;You&#8217;ll see the headcount coming down as
some of these systems get rolled off to reduce costs.&#8221; The firm
will be &#8220;squeezing a little bit here and squeezing a little bit
there&#8221; to trim the workforce by about 1,000 additional people,
or &#8220;maybe a little bit more&#8221; in the next 18 months, he said. 
Jes Staley, CEO of JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, braced
investors last month for a drop in third-quarter revenue as the
European debt crisis roiled markets, and the bank today said it
may face similar challenges in the year&#8217;s final months. A pay
reduction won&#8217;t likely drive out top performers amid such a
difficult environment, said Michael Holland, founder and
chairman of New York-based investment firm Holland  Co. 
&#8220;When things get better they will participate,&#8221; Holland
said in an interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack.&#8221; &#8220;When things are crummy, as they
have been for the last number of quarters, they participate in
the downside as well. A number of the star performers who are
getting paid less will stick around, and I think it&#8217;s exactly
the right way to run the business.&#8221; 
Pay Per Employee 
The investment bank generated a $1.64 billion profit in the
third quarter, compared with $2.06 billion in the prior three
months, according to figures posted today on the New York-based
company&#8217;s website. Revenue at the unit fell 13 percent from the
second quarter to $6.37 billion. 
In the first three quarters, the unit set aside $7.71
billion, or 2 percent less than a year earlier, even as it
generated 10 percent more revenue. The expense, which includes
salaries, bonuses and benefits, was enough to give each of the
division&#8217;s employees $289,611. For the same period last year,
the unit set aside $7.88 billion to pay traders, dealmakers and
other personnel, or $298,866 for each of the 26,373 people on
staff as of Sept. 30, 2010. 
Compensation costs fell to $1.85 billion in the third
quarter, compared with $2.56 billion in the second quarter.
Average compensation per employee dropped to $69,510 from
$92,510, the bank said. Companywide, staff expanded 3 percent to
256,663. 
Less Revenue Spent 
Staley set aside 35 percent of the division&#8217;s revenue for
pay in the first nine months, down from 37 percent in the same
period a year earlier, excluding a 2010 U.K. bonus tax,
according to today&#8217;s disclosure. 
Fees from investment banking tumbled 46 percent to $1.04
billion in the third quarter, compared with the previous three
months. About $2 trillion in global corporate bond issues came
to market in the first half before volume plummeted to $553.3
billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end. 
&#8220;The market-related businesses clearly experienced
pressure from the volatility, reduced volumes and mark-to-market
pressures&#8221; amid the quarter&#8217;s market tumoil, Chief Financial
Officer Doug Braunstein told reporters on a conference call.

     Oct. 13 (Bloomberg)-- Just as his trial was set to start
its second day, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab yesterday pleaded
guilty to all eight charges in the attempted bombing of a
Northwest Airlines plane on Christmas Day 2009. 
U.S. District Judge Nancy Edmunds in Detroit immediately
swore in the Nigerian-born Abdulmutallab, telling the so-called
underwear bomber he had the right to remain silent. He waived
the right and admitted the charges against him. 
The surprise announcement by Abdulmutallab and attorney
Anthony Chambers, so-called standby counsel appointed to assist
him, came as the day&#8217;s first witness was about to be called.
Abdulmutallab planned to represent himself. 
In a statement to the court, Abdulmutallab said he tried to
bomb the plane as an act of retaliation against the U.S. for the
&#8220;killing of my brothers and sisters in Muslim lands.&#8221; 
&#8220;I intentionally carried an explosive device&#8221; onto the
plane, he said. The device was concealed in his underwear. He
was subdued by passengers after failing to set it off. 
Asked if he was aware that his actions were against the
law, he replied, &#8220;Yes, U.S. law.&#8221; He called American law
unjust and oppressive according to the Koran. 
Edmunds accepted his guilty pleas to all eight felony
counts and set sentencing for Jan. 12. The charges include
attempted murder and attempted use of a weapon of mass
destruction. Abdulmutallab has been in custody since his arrest. 
Chambers and U.S. Attorney Barbara L. McQuade said
Abdulmutallab will spend the rest of his life in prison. 
&#8220;This case demonstrates that civilian courts are an
appropriate tool for bringing terrorists to justice,&#8221; McQuade
said in a press conference after the plea. 
The case is U.S. v. Abdulmutallab, 10-cr-20005, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Michigan (Detroit). 
Lawsuit News 
Sprint, Cellular South Seek Access to U.S. Data in ATT Case 
Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) and Cellular South Inc. asked for
access to confidential information that the Justice Department
got from ATT Inc. (T) in its probe of the company&#8217;s proposed merger
with T-Mobile USA Inc. 
The companies said U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle
in Washington should allow their outside lawyers and experts to
use the private data to prepare for trial in their own lawsuits
challenging the T-Mobile deal. To deprive them of that
opportunity creates a &#8220;fundamental unfairness,&#8221; they said. 
The companies, in a joint filing made public yesterday,
argued that, as competitors with relevant information, they have
been subpoenaed for documents by ATT in the government&#8217;s
antitrust suit to block the deal. At the same time, Huvelle,
overseeing all the ATT cases, froze document exchanges in the
private lawsuits while she weighs the company&#8217;s bid to dismiss
them. 
In an order yesterday, Huvelle said ATT and the Justice
Department had until Oct. 17 to respond to the request. 
&#8220;Sprint&#8217;s filing is another step in their fight against
competition,&#8221; Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman, said in an e-
mail. 
The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. Seven states and Puerto Rico joined the
government&#8217;s effort to block the deal, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier. 
Sprint, based in Overland Park, Kansas, brought its
antitrust lawsuit on Sept. 6. The combination of ATT and T-
Mobile would form the country&#8217;s largest mobile phone company. 
Cellular South sued on Sept. 19 claiming the merger
threatened to &#8220;substantially&#8221; cut competition. Cellular South
based in Ridgeland, Mississippi, changed its name to C Spire
Wireless on Sept. 26, according to its website. 
The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
Cerberus, Innkeepers Trial Over Purchase Delayed to Oct. 20 
A trial over Cerberus Capital Management LP&#8217;s decision to
end a deal to buy 64 hotels from Innkeepers USA Trust was
delayed for a fourth time yesterday. 
The trial will begin Oct. 20, Innkeepers lawyer Dan Donovan
said yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
The start date was initially postponed from Oct. 10, when
two people with knowledge of settlement talks said Cerberus
might resolve the dispute by agreeing to buy the hotels at a
lower price. Innkeepers sued after Cerberus, a New York-based
private-equity firm, and Chatham Lodging Trust (CLDT) in August sought
to cancel their $1.1 billion purchase. 
The companies agreed to the sale in May and Innkeepers won
approval of its reorganization terms in June. The company, in
bankruptcy since July 2010, operates 71 hotels, including
Residence Inns, Marriott hotels and Hampton Inns. 
Cerberus cited a clause in the sale agreement allowing the
buyers to back out if there was an adverse change in the lodging
company&#8217;s business or in the overall economy. 
The lawsuit against Cerberus is Innkeepers USA Trust v.
Cerberus Four Holdings LLC, 11-02557, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The Chapter 11 case
is In re Innkeepers USA Trust, 10-13800, in the same court.

Trials and Appeals 
Mark Hurd Lawyers Appeal Ruling on Unsealing Fisher Letter 
Lawyers for former Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) Chief Executive
Officer Mark Hurd sought to keep secret a letter about his
relationship with contractor Jodie Fisher, contending in
Delaware Supreme Court yesterday that the contents are private. 
In March, Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr.
ruled that a copy of the letter, with a few redactions, should
be made public. The order was stayed after Hurd appealed to the
state&#8217;s high court. 
&#8220;The right to public access is non-existent,&#8221; and the
parties have &#8220;a constitutional right to privacy,&#8221; Hurd&#8217;s
lawyer, Rolin P. Bissell, told the justices at a public hearing
in Dover. 
Publicizing the letter will provide &#8220;a full opportunity to
air out&#8221; background details of Hurd&#8217;s departure,&#8217;&#8217; Felipe
Arroyo, a lawyer for shareholder Ernesto Espinoza, told the
panel. 
The letter was sent to Hurd by Fisher&#8217;s lawyer, Gloria Allred, and is part of a Chancery case filed by Espinoza seeking
access to company books and records. The letter contains
accusations of sexual harassment and details of Hurd&#8217;s alleged
advances toward Fisher and her rejection of them, according to
Parsons&#8217;s ruling. 
Hurd is now president of software maker Oracle Corp. (ORCL) He
resigned from Palo Alto, California-based HP in August 2010
after a company investigation determined he violated its
standards of business conduct. HP said it didn&#8217;t find that Hurd
had violated the company&#8217;s sexual-harassment policy. 
Espinoza also wants to see an internal report prepared for
the HP board by lawyers at Covington  Burling LLP as part of
his investigation into possible waste by directors. Parsons on
March 25 denied Espinoza access to the report. 
The Chancery case is Espinoza v. Hewlett-Packard Co.,
CA6000, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). The appeal is Hurd
v. Spinoza, 167, 2001, Delaware Supreme Court (Dover). 
JJ Didn&#8217;t Warn Levaquin Riskier Than Rivals, Lawyer Argues 
A Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) unit never warned users of the Levaquin
antibiotic that it posed a greater risk of tendon damage than
rival medications, a lawyer for two men suing the company said
yesterday. 
Executives of JJ&#8217;s Ortho-McNeil-Janssen Pharmaceutical
unit sought to protect sales by omitting information about
Levaquin&#8217;s &#8220;comparative risk&#8221;  from its warning label, Andy
Alonso, a lawyer for Paul Gaffney and Robert Beare, said in
closing arguments in the trial of their lawsuits against the
drugmaker. 
The case, in state court in Atlantic City, New Jersey, is
the third over Levaquin tendon injuries to go to trial since
November and the first to be tried in New Jersey state courts.
JJ faces more than 2,600 claims in U.S. courts over the drug,
court dockets show. 
A lawyer for the JJ unit countered that for more than a
decade starting in 1996, Levaquin&#8217;s labels contained repeated
warnings about the risk of tendon injuries associated with the
drug. 
Gaffney&#8217;s and Beare&#8217;s own doctors said &#8220;they were aware&#8221;
of the tendon risk posed by the drug, Christy Jones, one of the
drugmaker&#8217;s lawyers, told jurors in her closing argument
yesterday. 
Levaquin, which generated more than $1 billion in sales
over an eight-year period starting in 2000, was JJ&#8217;s third-
largest selling product at one point. In 2008, the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration required all makers of antibiotics in
Levaquin&#8217;s class to beef up warnings about tendon ruptures. 
Regulators required the upgraded warnings after finding
that the antibiotics increased the risk of tendon ruptures to
three to four times that of the general population, FDA
officials said. 
Lawyers for a Minnesota man relied on the FDA&#8217;s push for
stronger warnings on the class of antibiotics that included
Levaquin to convince a federal court jury in December 2010 to
award him a total of $1.8 million in damages over tendon damage
he blamed on the drug. A separate jury in June rejected another
former Levaquin user&#8217;s claim for damages over his Achilles-
tendon injury. 
The case is Beare v. Johnson  Johnson, L-196-10-MT,
Superior Court of New Jersey for Atlantic County (Atlantic
City). 
Strip Searches of Newly Arrested Questioned by High Court 
The U.S. Supreme Court questioned whether jails can
constitutionally search the private body parts of all new
prisoners, including those arrested for traffic violations. 
During an hourlong argument full of graphic descriptions of
jailhouse strip-search protocols, the justices yesterday sought
to draw a line that would both prevent the smuggling of weapons
and drugs and protect the privacy interests of people arrested
for minor violations. 
Several justices questioned whether jails needed to strip-
search people charged with nonviolent offenses, pointing to
studies indicating that intrusive searches of such people rarely
uncover hidden items. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s very hard to find somebody who really was in this
minor offender category who really was found to have
contraband,&#8221; Justice Stephen Breyer said. 
In the case before the justices, Albert W. Florence says he
was strip-searched twice during the week he was jailed following
his arrest for failing to pay an old fine -- a penalty that he
had already paid. Florence is suing officials from two New
Jersey counties -- Burlington and Essex -- over the searches. 
Federal appeals courts around the country are divided on
the issue, which turns on the Constitution&#8217;s Fourth Amendment. A
Philadelphia-based federal appeals court said the counties&#8217;
policies were reasonable ways to prevent prisoners from
smuggling in weapons and drugs. 
Both sides in the case yesterday sought to narrow the
issues before the court. The lawyer for the two counties, Carter Phillips, said jail officials might be barred from touching
inmates during a search. 
Florence&#8217;s lawyer, Thomas Goldstein, allowed that jails
could perform body-cavity inspections on certain categories of
inmates, such as those charged with violent offenses. He also
said all new inmates could be required to strip naked and shower
in front of guards, as long as officials stopped short of a
close-range search of a prisoner&#8217;s genitals and anus. 
That distinction was lost on Justice Sonia Sotomayor. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s OK to stand five feet away, but not two?&#8221; she
asked. She added, &#8220;That&#8217;s a line that doesn&#8217;t make much sense
to me.&#8221; 
The Obama administration argued alongside the counties,
urging the court to give jail officials broad latitude. Nicole
Saharsky, a Justice Department lawyer, said federal jail
officials don&#8217;t have enough information to decide whether a
particular inmate needs to be searched. 
The case is Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of the
County of Burlington, New Jersey, 10-945, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington).

Verdicts, Settlements and Sentences 
Microsoft Award to Alcatel-Lucent May Be Lowered, Judge Says 
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) shouldn&#8217;t have to pay $70 million to
Alcatel-Lucent for patent infringement and the jury award may be
lowered to $26.3 million, a federal judge said. 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff in San Diego said at a
hearing yesterday that she will review more legal arguments
before issuing a ruling. Huff said she agreed with the world&#8217;s
largest software maker that the jury&#8217;s July 29 award wasn&#8217;t
supported by evidence presented during a 10-day trial. 
The judge said $26.3 million is &#8220;a fair damages figure
that is not excessive based on the totality of the evidence.&#8221;
She asked lawyers on both sides to file additional legal
arguments on her finding by the&#160;end of the month before she
makes her decision final. 
The jury found that an Alcatel-Lucent patent was infringed
by Microsoft in versions of its Outlook program and two other
applications. Microsoft asked the judge to reduce the award to
no more than $5 million. 
A different jury in San Diego in 2008 found that Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded
$358 million in damages. An appeals court, upholding the
infringement verdict, overturned the damages award, finding the
calculation lacked sufficient evidentiary support. The case was
sent back for retrial on damages only. 
The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., 07-
cv-2000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(San Diego). 
Bayer Settles With Onyx Over Regorafenib Cancer Treatment 
Bayer AG (BAYN) settled a lawsuit with Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ONXX)
over the promotion and sale of regorafenib, a cancer treatment.
Under the agreement reached Tuesday, Bayer will pay Onyx a 20
percent royalty on worldwide sales of regorafenib for use in
oncology, South San Francisco-based Onyx said yesterday in a
regulatory filing. Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer also will pay
Onyx $160 million for the Japanese royalty rights for Nexavar, a
liver-cancer treatment, according to the filing. 
Regorafenib hasn&#8217;t been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration or the European Medicines Agency, according to
the statement. Nexavar is approved in the U.S. 
The case is Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Bayer Corp.,
09-2145, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). 
Kimelman Gets 2 1/2 Years on Eve of Rajaratnam Sentencing 
Michael Kimelman, the Incremental Capital LLC co-founder,
yesterday was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for insider
trading. Kimelman was found guilty in June with Zvi Goffer, a
former Galleon employee, and his brother, Emanuel Goffer, in a
scheme to bribe two lawyers at Boston-based Ropes  Gray LLP for
secret information about transactions involving 3Com Corp.,
Axcan Pharma Inc., Kronos Inc. and Hilton Hotels Corp. 
&#8220;I was made aware when I went to trial that I could be
convicted,&#8221; Kimelman told U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan.
&#8220;Now that has happened, I am ready to pay the price and face
the consequences of my decision.&#8221; 
Sullivan yesterday also ordered Kimelman to forfeit
$289,000, the amount prosecutors said he made from the scheme.
In September, Sullivan gave Zvi Goffer 10 years in prison, and
last week he sentenced Emanuel Goffer to three years. 
Kimelman has continued to claim he is innocent and intends
to appeal the conviction. Last week Sullivan denied his requests
for acquittal or for a new trial. 
Kimelman&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Sommer, asked Sullivan for
leniency, arguing that his client never used a prepaid cell
phone to evade detection, as others in the ring did. Kimelman
never took or gave any bribes, wasn&#8217;t a leader of the scheme and
didn&#8217;t pass any tips to others, Sommer said. 
Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Tarlowe urged Sullivan to
sentence Kimelman within the advisory federal guideline range of
33 months to 41 months. He said Kimelman created a phony paper
trail to disguise the insider trades. 
Sullivan said he was influenced in his decision to sentence
Kimelman below the guideline range by the more than 100 letters
he received from Kimelman&#8217;s friends and family. 
The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Rajaratnam Shouldn&#8217;t Get Bail After Sentencing, U.S. Says 
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam shouldn&#8217;t be
granted bail pending appeal after he&#8217;s sentenced today for
insider trading, prosecutors said, because he has millions of
dollars and could flee the U.S. 
Federal prosecutors said that Rajaratnam has failed to
prove that he isn&#8217;t a flight risk and hasn&#8217;t refuted their
argument that he has substantial ties outside the U.S.,
including in Sri Lanka where he was born, according to a filing
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. Rajaratnam, who is a
naturalized U.S. citizen, also retains his Sri Lankan
citizenship. 
While the government has said it opposes bail pending
appeal, prosecutors also said yesterday they have told his
lawyers they won&#8217;t object if Rajaratnam surrenders shortly after
his sentencing and goes directly to the facility designated by
the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. Prosecutors said prison authorities
indicated it will take 21 days for them to process his
designation to a federal prison. 
&#8216;Should Rajaratnam flee to Sri Lanka or elsewhere, he would
have access to tens of millions of dollars by the mere touch of
a keystroke and thus could use that money to live abroad,&#8217;&#8217;
wrote assistant U.S. attorneys Jonathan Streeter, Reed Brodsky
and Andrew Michaelson. 
Prosecutors, saying he made $72 million from his crimes,
have asked for a prison term of 19 years and seven months to 24
1/2 years, which Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers called &#8220;grotesquely
severe.&#8221; Defense lawyers said that he only made $7.4 million
from the trades. 
John Dowd, a lawyer for Rajaratnam, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the government&#8217;s
filing. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

New Suits 
Visa, Mastercard Accused of Price Fixing by ATM Operators 
Visa Inc. (V) and Mastercard Inc. (MA), the world&#8217;s biggest payment
networks, were sued by a trade group representing operators of
automated teller machines over claims the card companies fix
prices and suppress competition between ATM networks. 
The companies, in a lawsuit filed yesterday in federal
court in Washington, are accused of &#8220;eliminating or severely
restricting independent decision-making&#8221; among ATM operators by
establishing a uniform agreement with almost every card-issuing
U.S. bank to &#8220;fix&#8221; ATM access fees. 
The allegations were made by the National ATM Council Inc.,
a trade group based in Jacksonville, Florida, and 13 operators
of ATMs in nine states. 
&#8220;The ATM restraints prevent ATM operators from offering
their customers a discount or benefit for completing a
transaction over a network that is less costly to the ATM
operator, so consumers cannot be rewarded for using a lower cost
and more efficient network,&#8221; the lawsuit states. 
James Issokson, a spokesman for Mastercard, based in
Purchase, New York, declined to comment, saying the company had
not been served with the lawsuit. Will Valentine, a spokesman
for San Francisco-based Visa, declined to comment on the
lawsuit. 
The case is National ATM Council v. Visa Inc., 11-1803,
U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). 
MassMutual, John Hancock Sued Over Madoff Investment 
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and John Hancock
Life Insurance Co. USA were sued by a limited-liability company
that said they lost millions of the company&#8217;s dollars to Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. 
SSR II LLC bought variable life insurance policies from
John Hancock and Security Life of Denver Insurance Co. Through
the investment-account component of the policies, SSR invested
$13 million in a Tremont Group Holdings Inc. fund, according to
a lawsuit filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. 
The fund, through its fund-of-funds structure, allocated 22
percent of its assets to other funds, substantially all of which
went to Madoff, according to the complaint. MassMutual and other
defendants &#8220;maintained significant influence and/or control
over and provided substantial assistance to&#8221; various Tremont
entities, SSR said. 
&#8220;Rather than managing a portfolio of underlying
securities, however, defendants funneled over one-fifth of
plaintiff&#8217;s investment to Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, where those
funds were dissipated,&#8221; SSR II said. 
Representatives of Boston-based John Hancock, MassMutual
and Security Life of Denver couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment
after normal business hours. 
The case is SSR II LLC v. John Hancock Life Insurance Co.,
652793-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). 
Transocean Sued by U.S. Agency Over Gulf-Rig Blast Subpoenas 
The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board has
sued a Transocean Ltd. (RIG) unit for its allegedly inadequate
response to requests for information related to the April 2010
sinking of the Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig in the Gulf of
Mexico. 
Transocean Deepwater Drilling didn&#8217;t fully comply with &#8220;38
of 39 specific demands&#8221; in five subpoenas issued between Nov.
24, 2010, and April 7, 2011, Donald Holmstrom, an investigator
for the agency said in a sworn statement filed yesterday in
Houston federal court. The board is seeking to force the
drilling contractor to comply with its requests. 
The Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank while drilling a
well for BP Plc (BP/) off the Louisiana coast, killing 11 workers and
causing the worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. The board
has been investigating the incident since June 2010. 
&#8220;Transocean&#8217;s ongoing failure to provide information has
impeded and delayed the CSB&#8217;s critical safety inquiry,&#8221;
Holmstrom said. 
Transocean &#8220;produced a number of responsive documents&#8221;
under subpoenas issued by the board between July and August
2010, Holmstrom said. When the agency sought additional
documents and answers to &#8220;11 specific interrogatories,&#8221;
Transocean either refused to respond or provided an insufficient
response, he said. 
Lou Colasuonno, a spokesman for Vernier, Switzerland-based
Transocean, said the company&#8217;s lawyers advised the CSB in July
of its position that the Deepwater Horizon investigation should
be left to the U.S. Coast Guard. 
&#8220;The Chemical Safety Board has no jurisdiction over marine
spills,&#8221; Colasuonno said in a phone interview. 
Holmstrom said the information is &#8220;critical&#8221; to the
board&#8217;s analysis of the blast. 
The case is U.S. v. Transocean Deepwater Drilling Inc.,
4:11-cv-3638, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston).

Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s patent-infringement
jury award against Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) may be lowered to $26.3
million from $70 million, a federal judge said. 
U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff in San Diego said at a
hearing yesterday that she will review more legal arguments
before issuing a ruling. Huff said she agreed with the world&#8217;s
largest software maker that the jury&#8217;s July 29 award wasn&#8217;t
supported by evidence presented during a 10-day trial. 
The judge said she disagreed with how an expert witness for
Alcatel-Lucent calculated damages and told lawyers $26.3 million
is &#8220;a fair damages figure that is not excessive based on the
totality of the evidence.&#8221; She asked attorneys on both sides to
file additional legal arguments on her finding by the&#160;end of the
month before she makes her decision final. 
The infringed patent relates to technology used in
Microsoft&#8217;s Outlook program and two other applications.
Microsoft asked the judge to reduce the award to no more than $5
million. 
Microsoft attorney Roger Denning told the judge that
Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s formula for computing damages didn&#8217;t comply
with guidelines set by Huff and appellate court rulings. 
&#8220;Those went ignored,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Lucent put its head down
and bullied through with its $70 million figure ignoring the
guidance that was given.&#8221; 
Alcatel-Lucent&#8217;s lawyers argued there was more than
sufficient evidence to support the jury&#8217;s verdict and that the
verdict should be respected. 
&#8216;High&#8217; Standard 
&#8220;If the court is going to take the judgment out of the
jury&#8217;s hands the standard is extraordinarily high,&#8221; said
company attorney Luke Dauchot. 
Lawyers for Alcatel-Lucent also asked Huff to award $38.3
million in prejudgment interest on top of the jury&#8217;s $70 million
award. Alcatel-Lucent, France&#8217;s largest maker of
telecommunications equipment, also has been awarded $450,479 in
trial costs. 
The technology at issue, called the &#8220;Day patent,&#8221; was
described in court during the trial as involving a touch-screen
form entry. Microsoft argued the patent relates to a simple
&#8220;date-picker&#8221; function and has nothing to do with e-mail, the
most popular function on Outlook. Paris-based Alcatel-Lucent
described the technology as a tool that &#8220;plays a central role
in the entire operation&#8221; of Outlook. 
Infringement 
A different jury in San Diego in 2008 found that Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft had infringed the patent and awarded
$358 million in damages. An appeals court, upholding the
infringement verdict, overturned the damages award, finding the
calculation lacked sufficient evidentiary support. The case was
sent back for retrial on damages only. 
The case is Lucent Technologies Inc. v. Gateway Inc., 07-
cv-02000 U.S. District Court, Southern District of California
(San Diego). 
Alcatel-Lucent today rose as much as 11 percent to 2.31
euros in Paris trading after the Financial Times reported,
without saying how it got the information, that the company
agreed to sell its corporate call-center business. Alcatel-
Lucent spokesman Simon Poulter declined to comment.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), which rose to a record today, may keep climbing to $200
or more, according to analysts who are boosting their price
targets for the stock. 
Eight of the 19 analysts with price targets surveyed by
Bloomberg estimate IBM will rise to at least $200, 7.1 percent
above yesterday&#8217;s close, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Three analysts increased their price targets to $200
or more this week, ahead of IBM&#8217;s Oct. 17 earnings announcement,
and Macquarie Capital began coverage with a $210 target today. 
&#8220;IBM&#8217;s high recurring revenue business model has
&#8216;Goldilocks&#8217; characteristics, allowing IBM to perform well in a
good or bad macro environment,&#8221; said Louis Miscioscia, an
analyst for Collins Stewart, who raised his price target to $210
today and has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. 
Under Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 60, IBM sold
off its personal computer business and focused on software and
services, helping lift per-share profit for more than 30
straight quarters. Now the world&#8217;s largest computer-services
provider, IBM has gained more than 80 percent since Palmisano
took over, including 30 percent this year. 
Investors have been drawn by &#8220;a very stable earnings
stream,&#8221; said David Grossman of Stifel Nicolaus  Co., who has
price target of $210 for IBM. &#8220;If revenues start to come under
pressure for economic reasons, there are several levers at their
disposal that they can exercise to support earnings
expectations.&#8221; 
IBM, based in Armonk, New York, rose 2 percent to $190.53
at the close in New York.

Zijin Mining Group Co. has sold
bonds convertible into shares of Glencore International Plc, the
world&#8217;s largest publicly traded commodities supplier, according
to three people familiar with the matter. 
The bonds were sold at 128.25 percent of face value, said
one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the
process was private. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) managed the sale,
according to a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. 
Zijin Mining, China&#8217;s biggest gold miner by market value,
acquired the bonds ahead of Glencore&#8217;s May initial public
offering, which ended its more than three decades as a closely
held partnership. Glencore, which sold $10 billion of shares in
the biggest IPO this year, has dropped 20 percent since going
public. 
In December 2009 Glencore had sold $2.2 billion of
convertible 5 percent bonds, its first such offering, saying the
debt could be exchanged for shares in the event of an IPO. Zijin
Mining invested in those bonds together with BlackRock Inc. (BLK),
Government of Singapore Investment Corp. and First Reserve Corp. 
Zijin was offering the $175 million of December 2014 bonds
at 128.25 percent to 130.25 percent of face value, plus accrued
interest, according to the term sheet. 
First Reserve, a private equity firm, sold $800 million of
the bonds last month at $135,313.89 for each $100,000 of
principal amount, and used the proceeds to buy Glencore common
stock. Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) and Morgan Stanley managed First
Reserve&#8217;s transaction. 
A call made to the Zijin&#8217;s office outside of regular
business hours wasn&#8217;t answered. Simon Buerk, a spokesman for
Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore, declined to comment. 
Glencore dropped 3 percent to 422.5 pence at the close of
London trading, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 2.8
percent.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
No 2. U.S. mall owner, sold Faneuil Hall Marketplace, a shopping
and dining complex in Boston, for $140 million. 
The transaction was one of three sales of &#8220;non-core&#8221;
assets completed in the last three months, the Chicago-based
company said in a statement today. General Growth also sold the
office and garage components of Westlake Center in Seattle for
$119 million and Riverside Plaza, a strip shopping center in
Provo, Utah, for $21 million. The buyers weren&#8217;t disclosed. 
&#8220;We continue to execute our investment strategy of
focusing on our regional mall portfolio,&#8221;&#160;Shobi Khan, General
Growth&#8217;s chief operating officer, said in the statement. &#8220;These
recent dispositions strengthen our balance sheet.&#8221; 
The deals helped the company eliminate $95 million of
mortgage-related debt associated with the properties, according
to the statement. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, is the second biggest U.S. shopping mall owner after
Simon Property Group Inc. In August, General Growth said it
would spin off 30 malls to shareholders through a special
dividend and that they would be transferred to a new publicly
traded real estate investment trust, Rouse Properties Inc.

British consumers will spend 19.3
billion pounds ($30.5 billion) by 2021 on purchases using their
mobile phones as technology advances and more people have
smartphones, Barclays Corporate estimated. 
The figure will rise from 1.3 billion pounds now,
encouraged by systems such as Near Field Communications and
faster mobile data transmission, Barclays Corporate, a unit of
London-based banking group Barclays Plc (BARC), said in a report. Food
and groceries are the biggest category, with mobile sales of
almost 300 million pounds this year, according to the report. 
&#8220;With little new shop space coming into play, the real
growth opportunities lie on the virtual high street,&#8221; Richard
Lowe, Head of Retail and Wholesale at Barclays Corporate, said
in the statement. &#8220;Those retailers which are prepared to invest
will be at a significant advantage to the competition.&#8221; 
Mobile commerce will grow by 55 percent over the next five
years, according to Barclays. It said just over half of shoppers
already use their mobiles at some stage of purchasing. 
Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) and other wireless operators said in
June they had agreed to create a common platform for mobile
payment systems to speed up the development of additional
services in the U.K. 
Vodafone, Telefonica SA (TEF), and Everything Everywhere, the
partnership between France Telecom SA (FTE) and Deutsche Telekom AG,
will form a joint venture to help banks and advertisers access
the service, which will let people buy items from groceries to
clothes with a swipe of their smartphone, they said at the time.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services company, reported third-
quarter sales that missed analysts&#8217; estimates on slowing revenue
growth at its software, hardware and services businesses. 
Sales climbed 7.8 percent to $26.2 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. Analysts predicted
$26.3 billion, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is focusing on areas
such as business analytics, emerging markets and cloud computing
to boost sales amid sluggish economic expansion. The U.S.
economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter
following a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months, the
weakest performance in two years. 
&#8220;Because they didn&#8217;t beat, the stock&#8217;s going to trade
down; the expectation is pretty high for this name,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. A slowdown in
hardware revenue growth is occurring &#8220;sooner than I expected.&#8221; 
It was the second time in nine quarters that IBM missed
sales estimates. Hardware sales growth slowed to 4 percent from
17 percent in the second quarter. Sales growth at IBM&#8217;s services
business slowed to 8 percent from 10 percent, while revenue
expansion at its software unit decelerated to 13 percent from 17
percent. 
Record Last Week 
IBM fell as much as 4.1 percent to $179.02 in extended
trading after closing at $186.59 in New York today. It has risen
27 percent this year as of the close of regular trading. 
The stock reached a record of $190.53 on Oct. 14, and at
least three analysts revised their price estimates to $200 a
share or higher. In September, IBM passed Microsoft in market
value based on closing prices for the first time since 1996
before the companies switched back. 
&#8220;This is a name that you&#8217;re expecting in this environment
to perform very strong,&#8221; said Brad Zelnick, a Macquarie Capital
USA analyst who added coverage of IBM last week. &#8220;Any
deceleration in signings or any significant drain on backlog is
going to send shares down.&#8221; 
Contract signings for services, which make up about 60
percent of IBM revenue, were $12.3 billion, compared with $14.3
billion in the second quarter. 
Projects Software 
The company projects software will make up half of total
profit in 2015. Analytics software, which helps businesses
predict trends, is expected to draw $16 billion in sales by
2015, while cloud computing will draw $7 billion. 
Smarter Planet, Palmisano&#8217;s initiative to provide digital
monitoring of anything from roads to hospitals to make them more
efficient, will grow to a $10 billion business, the company has
said. 
Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, climbed 19 percent last quarter. Sales from the regions
will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the company
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. 
&#8220;Growth market performance was terrific across all
segments,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
call with analysts and investors. 
It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth
in these markets, and it led revenue growth in all business
segments, Loughridge said. IBM opened up 80 new branches, he
said. 
&#8216;Footprint&#8217; Important 
&#8220;They&#8217;re very ahead of where the big markets will be in a
few years, and it&#8217;s very important for them to have a footprint
there,&#8221; Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities
USA, said in an interview. He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
the shares. 
Palmisano has said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions between 2010 and 2015. So far the company has spent
about $3 billion in acquisitions related to cloud computing,
said Steven Tomasco, an IBM spokesman. 
Because of IBM&#8217;s global position and broad set of computer
services, it is &#8220;about as close as you can get to a technology
index fund,&#8221; Maguire said. &#8220;They&#8217;re a bellwether for the rest
of the market.&#8221; 
Accenture Plc and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which compete with IBM in
selling services to technology companies, both benefited from
increased spending by business clients in their most recent
quarters.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, refinanced $966 million of
adjustable-rate mortgages on four properties into fixed-rate
loans with an average term of 9.1 years. 
The real estate investment trust&#8217;s share of the new loans
totals $483 million after adjusting for the company&#8217;s ownership
in the shopping malls, Chicago-based General Growth said today
in a statement. The refinancings lowered the interest rate to an
average 4.63 percent from 5.66 percent on the prior maturing
mortgages. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection in
November, has been refinancing debt to lower expenses and plans
to redevelop, expand and refurbish malls to boost growth. The
new loans meet the company&#8217;s financing plans for this year,
according to the statement. 
&#8220;We have accomplished our 2011 goals and are now focused
on 2012 financing opportunities,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Sandeep Mathrani said in the statement. 
The newly refinanced malls are Natick Mall in Natick,
Massachusetts; Galleria at Tyler, in Riverside, California;
First Colony Mall in Sugar Land, Texas; and Northbrook Court in
Northbrook, Illinois. 
General Growth has ownership and management interest in 166
malls in 43 states, totaling 169 million square feet (15.7
million square meters), the company said in the statement. It is
second in size to Simon Property Group Inc., based in
Indianapolis.

General Electric Co. (GE) plans to build
a mining equipment plant in Texas and upgrade a factory in
Pennsylvania, adding 490 workers. 
The projects are part of the GE transportation business&#8217;s
expansion into mining equipment as it branches out from
locomotives, which use similar technology, Lorenzo Simonelli,
the unit&#8217;s chief, said in a telephone interview. 
The expansion &#8220;gives us more scale in mining,&#8221; Simonelli
said. 
Demand for such equipment is growing worldwide as emerging
markets seek more raw materials such as rare earths and copper
for infrastructure. Copper prices have more than doubled since
the end of 2008 as demand climbed in China, the world&#8217;s biggest
metals user. 
The Texas plant, to be located near a Fort Worth locomotive
factory announced in May, will build motorized wheels for off-
highway vehicles, GE said in the statement. The $95 million site
will employ about 130 workers, GE Transportation said. 
About 360 employees will be hired in Erie, Pennsylvania,
including 160 production workers to meet higher demand for
mining equipment, GE said. The company will invest about $136
million in upgrading the plant, which is more than 100 years
old, to boost capacity, add research and testing technology and
install a customer showcase center. 
About $22 million of the Erie upgrades is related to mining
equipment production, GE said. Mining has also been a focus for
the Fairfield, Connecticut-based parent company&#8217;s energy
business, which has invested in oil-and-gas acquisitions.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, posted an 8.1 percent increase in third-
quarter profit after boosting global sales volumes and raising
retail pricing in North America. 
Net income advanced to $2.22 billion, or 95 cents a share,
from $2.06 billion, or 88 cents, a year earlier, Atlanta-based
Coca-Cola said today in a statement. Excluding some items,
profit was $1.03 a share, topping the $1.02 average of 13
analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent has built new plants in
emerging markets and pushed more profitable package sizes
overseas, helping boost global case volume sales 5 percent in
the quarter. Coca-Cola also raised pricing 2 percent to
retailers in North America, its largest market. 
&#8220;They are still growing in terms of volume, and that&#8217;s
what you want to see,&#8221; Chris Shanahan, a San Antonio-based
analyst at Frost  Sullivan, said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;They are able to maintain organic growth.&#8221; 
Coca-Cola fell 0.4 percent to $66.74 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York. The shares have gained 1.5 percent this year, while rival
PepsiCo Inc. has decreased 4.5 percent. 
Third-quarter revenue rose 45 percent to $12.2 billion,
helped by the Coca-Cola&#8217;s purchase of its largest bottler last
year. The average estimate of 10 analysts was $12 billion. 
International Sales 
Sales volumes gained 7 percent in Latin America, 6 percent
in the company&#8217;s Eurasia and Africa region and 5 percent in
North American and its Pacific units. The gains were the result
of investments made throughout several years, Kent said today in
an interview. 
&#8220;You have to take a long-term approach to investments and
a shorter term approach to execution,&#8221; said Kent, who last
month announced a plan to spend $3 billion in Russia in the next
five years to develop Coca-Cola&#8217;s brands. 
Coca-Cola said today it plans to buy back as much as $3
billion of its shares this year, up from its previous target of
at least $2.5 billion. The company said today it has repurchased
$2.2 billion shares so far this year. 
Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said today on a
conference call that the company&#8217;s commodity costs will jump
$800 million this year from 2010, more than the $700 million
Coca-Cola previously estimated. The increase is driven by higher
costs for corn syrup used as a sweetener and petroleum-based
plastic for bottles and packaging. 
Coca-Cola said in July it would boost North American
pricing as much as 4 percent in the second half of the year to
offset higher commodity costs.

down; the expectation is pretty high for this name,&#8221; said Josh Olson, an analyst with Edward Jones  Co. in Des Peres,
Missouri, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. A slowdown in
hardware revenue growth is occurring &#8220;sooner than I expected.&#8221; 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is focusing on areas
such as business analytics, emerging markets and cloud computing
to boost sales amid sluggish economic expansion. The U.S.
economy grew at a 1.3 percent pace in the second quarter
following a 0.4 percent gain in the previous three months, the
weakest performance in two years. 
Slowing Growth 
Declines in Japan and the public sector weighed on the
performance of IBM&#8217;s services business, Chief Financial Officer
Mark Loughridge said on a conference call. IBM has more exposure
to Japan than competitors, David Grossman, an analyst at Stifel
Nicolaus in San Francisco, said in a note to investors. 
Sales growth at IBM&#8217;s services unit slowed to 8 percent
from 10 percent in the second quarter, while revenue expansion
at its software unit decelerated to 13 percent from 17 percent.
Hardware sales growth slowed to 4 percent from 17 percent. 
IBM shares have risen 22 percent this year. The stock
reached a record of $190.53 on Oct. 14, and at least three
analysts revised their price estimates to $200 a share or higher
that week. In September, IBM passed Microsoft Corp. in market
value based on closing prices for the first time since 1996
before the companies switched back. 
&#8220;This is a name that you&#8217;re expecting in this environment
to perform very strong,&#8221; said Brad Zelnick, a Macquarie Capital
USA analyst who added coverage of IBM last week. &#8220;Any
deceleration in signings or any significant drain on backlog is
going to send shares down.&#8221; 
Analysts at BMO Capital Markets and FBN Securities reduced
their ratings for IBM shares after the earnings report. 
Backlog Shrinking 
Contract signings for services, which make up about
60 percent of IBM revenue, were $12.3 billion, compared with
$11 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average estimated
$12.5 billion, UBS AG said in a note to investors. 
Backlog, which measures expected future revenue
from contracts, shrank to $137 billion in the quarter from
$144 billion in the second quarter, largely because of changes
in currency exchange rates, Loughridge said. 
Third-quarter net income rose 7 percent to $3.84 billion.
Profit on an operating basis rose to $3.28 a share, beating the
$3.22 average analyst estimate. 
Operating earnings will climb to at least $13.35 a share
this year, up from a previous projection of at least $13.25, IBM
said. Analysts predicted $13.33 on average. 
&#8216;Bellwether&#8217; 
Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and
China, climbed 19 percent last quarter. Sales from the regions
will make up at least 30 percent of revenue by 2015, the company
has said, up from 21 percent in 2010. 
&#8220;Growth-market performance was terrific across all
segments,&#8221; Loughridge said. 
It was the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth
in these markets, and it led revenue growth in all business
segments, Loughridge said. IBM opened up 80 new branches, he
said. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re very ahead of where the big markets will be in a
few years, and it&#8217;s very important for them to have a footprint
there,&#8221; Ed Maguire, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities
USA, said in an interview. He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
the shares. 
Palmisano has said he plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions between 2010 and 2015. So far the company has spent
about $3 billion in acquisitions related to cloud computing,
said Steven Tomasco, an IBM spokesman. 
Because of IBM&#8217;s global position and broad set of computer
services, it is &#8220;about as close as you can get to a technology
index fund,&#8221; Maguire said. &#8220;They&#8217;re a bellwether for the rest
of the market.&#8221; 
Accenture Plc and Oracle Corp. (ORCL), which compete with IBM in
selling services to technology companies, both benefited from
increased spending by business clients in their most recent
quarters.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) rose 5.5
percent in New York trading as investors looked past a third-
quarter loss and focused on gains in trading revenue and
prospects for a rebound in underwriting and takeovers. 
Revenue from trading stocks and bonds increased 16 percent
from the second quarter and the backlog of investment-banking
assignments climbed, Goldman Sachs said today. The third-quarter
loss, which was driven by markdowns on the value of the firm&#8217;s
own investments, was $393 million, or 84 cents a share, the New
York-based company said in a statement. 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein,
57, has tied Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fortunes to trading, which
accounted for 62 percent of revenue in the first nine months of
2011. After reporting weaker second-quarter revenue than
competitors in that business, Goldman Sachs beat both Bank of
America Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) last quarter, excluding
accounting gains related to the decline of the banks&#8217; own debt. 
&#8220;In the core business there are some encouraging signs,&#8221;
said William Fitzpatrick, a Milwaukee-based financial-services
analyst at Manulife Asset Management, which manages $217 billion
and owns Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;It was the private-equity
business that weighed on results in the quarter.&#8221; 
The shares rose $5.35 to $102.25 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain in more than
two months, as the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financial Index climbed
5 percent. 
&#8216;Rough Patch&#8217; 
&#8220;Trading wasn&#8217;t as bad as we all thought, and the bigger
losses came from writedowns in their investing and lending
unit,&#8221; Thomas Brown, chief executive officer of Second Curve
Capital LLC, said in an interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In
the Loop.&#8221; &#8220;I see Goldman as going through a rough patch in
the environment, but it&#8217;s environment-driven, not Goldman Sachs-
driven.&#8221; 
The third-quarter loss, which compared with a year-earlier
profit of $1.9 billion, was the second time that Goldman Sachs
failed to post a profit since it became a public company in
1999. In both cases the loss was caused by reductions in the
value of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investments in companies, private-
equity funds and loans. 
The firm, which said in July that it planned to cut about
1,000 jobs to reduce annual costs by $1.2 billion, said it
employed 34,200 people at the end of September, down 1,300 from
the end of June. 
Litton Sale 
Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar told analysts on a
conference call today that about 500 of the job cuts in the
quarter related to the effort to cut costs. The other 800 came
from the sale of Litton Loan Servicing LP to Ocwen Financial
Corp., which more than offset the addition of personnel when the
firm gained control of its Australian joint venture, JBWere Ltd. 
Investing and Lending, which includes Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
stakes in Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (1398) Ltd. and other
companies, as well as holdings by the Special Situations Group
run by Jason M. Brown, reported negative revenue of $2.48
billion for the quarter. That compared with $1.8 billion in
revenue in the same period a year earlier. 
About $1.05 billion of last quarter&#8217;s negative revenue was
attributed to a drop in the value of ICBC, China&#8217;s biggest
lender, and $1 billion was caused by losses on other equity
securities. The unit also booked $907 in negative revenue from
&#8220;debt securities and loans,&#8221; while gaining $477 from
investments in other entities. 
Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., had
estimated the unit&#8217;s loss would be $1.67 billion, and predicted
the debt securities and loans segment would post $200 million in
revenue. 
Mezzanine Debt 
Most of the writedowns related to spread widening on senior
debt and so-called mezzanine debt, although the segment also
included some distressed loan losses, Viniar said on the call. 
All of the Investing and Lending division&#8217;s losses were
unrealized, meaning they reflected markdowns in asset values and
not actual sales at lower values, Viniar said. He said that
division sold some assets at a profit during the period, which
helped to offset the writedowns. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason to think it won&#8217;t rebound,&#8221; Manulife&#8217;s
Fitzpatrick said of the Investing and Lending results. &#8220;I think
it will remain a big part of the business.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs expects Investing and Lending to produce a
return in excess of 10 percent over the long run, Viniar told
analysts. 
&#8220;In any quarter it can be extremely volatile and up or
down a lot more than that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our history has been a
lot better than a 10 percent return.&#8221; 
Book Value 
Third-quarter revenue fell 60 percent to $3.59 billion from
$8.9 billion a year earlier and declined 51 percent from $7.28
billion in the second quarter. The company&#8217;s book value per
common share decreased to $131.09 from $131.44 at the end of the
second quarter. 
Overall revenue from trading, run since February 2008 by
Edward K. Eisler, David B. Heller, Pablo J. Salame, and Harvey M. Schwartz, rose 16 percent to $4.06 billion from $3.52 billion
in the second quarter and was down 13 percent from $4.67 billion
in the third quarter of 2010. 
The trading results included about $450 million of so-
called debt valuation adjustments, or DVAs, with about $300
million in fixed-income and about $150 million in equities
trading, Viniar said. U.S. accounting rules require that banks
book losses when the value of their debt rises and gains when it
declines on the theory that a loss, or profit, would be realized
if the bank were to repurchase the debt. 
&#8216;A Little Confused&#8217; 
Like most of its rivals, spreads on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
corporate debt and credit-default swaps widened during the
quarter as investors became more cautious about risk from the
European sovereign debt crisis. Viniar said the wider spreads
make him &#8220;a little confused&#8221; because the firm believes it has
strong capital and liquidity. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s had minimal impact on our business so far,&#8221; Viniar
said in response to a question on the call. &#8220;It might affect us
versus some competitors who might have lower spreads, but we
also compete on execution as well and our execution tends to be
pretty good.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs has about $5 billion in &#8220;plain vanilla
debt&#8221; maturing by the end of the year, Viniar said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to replace it or
we want to wait for a better time.&#8221; 
Revenue from fixed-income, currencies and commodities,
typically the firm&#8217;s biggest source of revenue, dropped 36
percent to $1.73 billion from $2.69 billion a year earlier and
increased from $1.6 billion in the second quarter. 
JPMorgan Chase 
Excluding DVAs the business produced $1.43 billion, which
fell short of the $2.27 billion that Citigroup reported and the
$2.8 billion that JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) reported on the same
basis. 
The company&#8217;s average value-at-risk, a measure of the
amount of money the firm estimates it could lose in a single
day, was little changed during the quarter at $102 million
compared with $101 million in the prior period. Viniar told
analysts that the company&#8217;s value-at-risk, or VaR, climbed at
the end of the quarter as market volatility, one of the
ingredients of VaR, increased. Most of the rise took place in
the firm&#8217;s bets on interest rates, Viniar said. 
&#8220;I would expect, assuming we made no changes to positions
at all, that our VaR would be fairly significantly higher in the
fourth quarter than the third quarter,&#8221; he said. 
Equities trading revenue rose to $2.33 billion from $1.98
billion a year earlier and from $1.92 billion in the second
quarter. Excluding DVAs, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s $2.18 billion of
equities trading revenue beat Bank of America, Citigroup and
JPMorgan Chase. 
&#8216;Best Performer&#8217; 
&#8220;They were the best performer of the four so far,&#8221; said
David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in New York who
rates the stock &#8220;outperform.&#8221; 
Investment banking, overseen globally by Richard J. Gnodde,
David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, generated $781 million of
revenue in the third quarter, down from $1.45 billion in the
second quarter and $1.16 billion in the third quarter of last
year. The company ranks No. 1 among advisers on global takeovers
announced this year and also has the top spot among managers of
global equity and equity-linked offerings, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
Investment banking&#8217;s relative contribution within the group
has grown this year. The business generated 15 percent of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s revenue in the first nine months of the year, up
from 11 percent in the same period last year. 
Compensation and Benefits 
Compensation and benefits, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s biggest expense,
fell 59 percent to $1.58 billion in the third quarter from $3.83
billion in the same period last year. The amount set aside to
pay employees in the first nine months of the year fell 24
percent to $10 billion, or enough to pay each employee $292,836.
That compares with $13.1 billion in the first nine months of
2010, or enough to pay each of the firm&#8217;s 35,400 employees at
the time $370,700. 
Goldman Sachs lost $2.12 billion, or $4.97 per share, in
the fourth quarter of 2008 after markets plunged following the
bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Goldman Sachs
rebounded to record profit in 2009 as asset values climbed and
the company slashed pay.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) set aside
$10 billion to pay employees in this year&#8217;s first nine months,
down 24 percent from the same period last year as revenue slid
and the firm cut jobs. 
The compensation expense, which includes salaries, bonuses,
stock awards and benefits, was equivalent to $292,836 for each
of the company&#8217;s 34,200 workers as of Sept. 30. A year earlier
Goldman Sachs employed 35,400 people, who shared about $13.1
billion, or $370,706 each, for the nine-month period. 
Goldman Sachs is among firms that have been targeted by
lower Manhattan protests, called Occupy Wall Street, that seek
to call attention to the income disparity between the wealthiest
1 percent of the population and everyone else. Related
demonstrations took place on four continents over the weekend.
Sixty-seven percent of New York City voters support the
movement, according to a Quinnipiac University survey yesterday. 
Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay record for a
securities firm before converting to a bank in response to the
financial crisis, may cut compensation for the second year in a
row as declining markets sap trading revenue. After setting
aside 39 percent of revenue for compensation in 2010, the
company has allocated 44 percent of revenue for pay and benefits
so far this year. Revenue for this year&#8217;s first nine months fell
25 percent $22.8 billion. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest U.S. bank by assets,
reported last week that it reduced its investment bank&#8217;s
workforce by almost 4 percent in the third quarter and cut
employee compensation costs 28 percent. The investment bank&#8217;s
compensation expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and
benefits, was enough to give each of the division&#8217;s employees
$289,611 for the nine-month period. 
The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and
they don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. Investment
banks set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and
typically decide bonuses at year-end.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
yesterday reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years, sold
$500 million of 50-year unsecured bonds in a transaction aimed
at individual investors. 
Goldman Sachs sold the debt in increments of $25 at a yield
of 6.5 percent after doubling the size of the offering,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based firm
has the option to redeem the bonds at par after five years,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
The transaction was the second Goldman Sachs has targeted
at individual investors, allowing the firm to diversify its
sources of capital while locking in &#8220;attractive&#8221; borrowing
costs, said James Leonard, a credit analyst at Morningstar Inc.
in Chicago. Goldman Sachs issued $1.3 billion of 6.125 percent
notes with a similar structure a year ago, Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a great deal for Goldman,&#8221; Leonard said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re sitting in a win-win situation,
because if interest rates stay low they can call them, but if
rates go up they&#8217;ve got 50 years of funding.&#8221; 
Leonard said he wouldn&#8217;t recommend individual investors buy
the notes because of the difficulty of valuing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
option to redeem them after 2016. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s third-quarter loss of $393 million, or 84
cents per share, compared with a profit of $1.9 billion, or
$2.98, a year earlier, the company said yesterday in a
statement. 
Credit Swaps Fall 
The cost to protect Goldman Sachs&#8217;s debt for five years
using credit-default swaps fell 24 basis points to 321 basis
points, according to London-based data provider CMA. It reached
410 basis points on Oct. 4, the highest since October 2008. 
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses
on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline
as investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. 
&#8216;Confused and Disappointed&#8217; 
David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial officer, told
analysts on a conference call yesterday that a widening of the
firm&#8217;s credit spreads over the last six weeks has had a
&#8220;minimal&#8221; impact on its business. He said the firm, which
yesterday reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years as a
public company, has about $5 billion of debt maturing by year
end and &#8220;we&#8217;ll decide as the quarter goes on whether we want to
replace it or we want to wait for a better time.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs executives have been &#8220;confused and
disappointed&#8221; by the rising prices on the firm&#8217;s credit-default
swaps, Viniar said, which investors use to hedge against losses
on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on its creditworthiness. 
&#8220;Given how strong our capital is, our liquidity is, the
maturity of our funding, the balance sheet, we kind of scratch
our heads a little bit,&#8221; Viniar said. &#8220;But it really hasn&#8217;t
affected anything other than our emotions. We don&#8217;t like seeing
it but it hasn&#8217;t had a big effect.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs fell 1.5 percent to $100.79 in New York after
reaching $102.25 yesterday, the highest since Sept. 20.

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest brokerage, reported profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates
on a $3.4 billion accounting gain and higher revenue from stock
trading. 
Net income was $2.2 billion, or $1.15 a share, compared
with $131 million, or a loss of 7 cents a share after preferred
dividends, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today
in a statement. Earnings beat the 30-cent average estimate of 25
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 20 percent gain in year-over-year
equities-trading revenue was the biggest among the largest U.S.
banks, excluding the accounting benefit. Fixed-income fell 17
percent. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, is trying to
stem a 39 percent decline in the firm&#8217;s shares this year through
yesterday that left the stock trading at a level last seen
during the financial crisis in January 2009. 
&#8220;We saw more activity on the cash equities side,
particularly in electronic trading, and the derivatives business
continued to do well,&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said
in an interview after earnings were released. &#8220;The more
challenging part of the market was in the fixed-income market.&#8221; 
Excluding the $3.4 billion accounting gain, known as debt
valuation adjustments, or DVA, profit was 3 cents a share,
compared with estimates of a 9-cent loss from Citigroup Inc.
analyst Keith Horowitz and a 23-cent loss from Barclays
Capital&#8217;s Roger Freeman. 
Share Performance 
Shares of the company rose 1 cent to $16.64 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York, after surging 9.1 percent yesterday. 
The DVA gain stems from declines in the value of the
company&#8217;s debt, under the theory that a profit would be realized
if the debt were repurchased at a discount. Citigroup and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. each booked more than $1.5 billion of such
gains as bank credit spreads widened in the quarter. 
&#8220;It is a bizarre accounting anomaly,&#8221; Gorman said in an
interview with Erik Schatzker on Bloomberg Television. &#8220;Next
quarter, we may have $3.4 billion of negative adjustments.&#8221; 
Revenue at Morgan Stanley climbed 46 percent to $9.89
billion from $6.78 billion a year earlier. Book value per share
rose to $31.29 from $30.17 at the end of June. The firm&#8217;s return
on equity from continuing operations, a measure of how well it
reinvests earnings, was 14.5 percent. 
Fixed Income 
Trading revenue at five of the largest U.S. banks dropped
by a combined 32 percent from the second quarter and was less
than half that of the first quarter, excluding DVA. Morgan
Stanley is &#8220;constantly reassessing&#8221; whether the current
environment represents a cyclical or secular change, Gorman said
on the conference call. 
&#8220;Over the next several months, it will become clearer
which of the businesses that use a lot of balance sheet and take
on a lot of risk can be expected to generate the kind of return
that shareholders need,&#8221; Gorman said in the Bloomberg
Television interview. 
Third-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading,
which is run by Ken deRegt along with commodity trading co-heads
Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, was $3.88 billion. Excluding
DVA, fixed-income revenue was about $1.1 billion, down from $1.9
billion in the second quarter and $1.31 billion in the third
quarter of 2010. The figure compared with $2.8 billion at
JPMorgan, $2.27 billion at Citigroup and $1.43 billion at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Foreign Exchange 
Interest-rates trading revenue increased from the second
quarter, and the firm saw share gains in foreign-exchange
trading, Porat said on a conference call with analysts. Credit
trading suffered from &#8220;illiquidity&#8221; in the corporate credit
and mortgage markets, she said. 
Losses from hedges tied to monoline insurers reduced fixed-
income trading revenue by $284 million, Porat said. The bank
booked about $400 million of writedowns in corporate lending in
its revenue line labeled &#8220;other sales and trading,&#8221; said Mark Lake, a company spokesman. 
In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
third-quarter revenue was $1.96 billion. Excluding DVA, revenue
fell 26 percent from the second quarter to $1.34 billion. That
compared with $2.18 billion at Goldman Sachs and $289 million at
Citigroup. 
Morgan Stanley generated $864 million in third-quarter
revenue from investment banking, which is overseen by Paul J. Taubman. That figure, down 14 percent from a year earlier,
included $413 million from financial advisory, $239 million from
equity underwriting and $212 million from debt underwriting. 
Expense Control 
&#8220;Core trading and investment-banking revenue held up
better than our muted estimates while expense control was
good,&#8221; Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy 
Investment Group Inc., said today in a note to clients. 
Global wealth management, overseen by Greg Fleming, posted
pretax income of $362 million, up from $281 million in the third
quarter of 2010. It also had $15.5 billion in net new assets.
The division&#8217;s pretax profit margin rose to 11 percent from 10
percent in the first half. Gorman has said the unit should
eventually post a pretax profit margin of more than 20 percent. 
Asset management reported a pretax loss of $117 million,
compared with profit of $279 million in the previous year&#8217;s
period. 
Compensation and benefits were unchanged from the year-
earlier quarter at $3.68 billion, or 37 percent of the firm&#8217;s
overall revenue. The ratio was lower than in the third quarter
of 2010, when the bank set aside 54 percent of revenue. 
Morgan Stanley increased its forecast for annual savings
from an initiative to trim expenses to $1.4 billion, from $1
billion when the three-year project was announced in May. 
Share Volatility 
The firm&#8217;s shares fell 41 percent in the third quarter. The
stock dropped further in the first week of October to $11.58,
the lowest since December 2008. 
The volatility prompted Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc., Morgan Stanley&#8217;s largest common shareholder, to release a
statement on Oct. 3 saying it&#8217;s &#8220;firmly committed&#8221; to its
strategic alliance with Morgan Stanley. Gorman sent a memo to
employees the same day, encouraging them to remain focused on
their jobs and clients instead of responding to &#8220;the rumor of
the day.&#8221; 
&#8220;There has been an enormous amount of confusion and
misinformation about Morgan Stanley and others in our peer
group,&#8221; he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. &#8220;In fragile markets, where fear triumphs over common
sense, these things are bound to happen.&#8221; 
The bank repurchased about $2 billion of its own bonds as
prices fell, Porat said. The gain on the buybacks was less than
$100 million, she said. 
Morgan Stanley updated figures for risks linked to Europe
in a presentation on its website today, saying the five
countries at the center of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis totaled $2.11
billion in exposure including hedges against losses. The risks
linked to France were negative $286 million.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, had the most third-quarter trading revenue
of any Wall Street firm that has reported results so far,
leading the pack for the fourth consecutive period. 
The bank led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 55, has supplanted Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) as No. 1 in
revenue from buying and selling bonds, stocks, currencies,
commodities and derivatives, according to company reports.
JPMorgan&#8217;s trading revenue was more than triple that of Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets. 
The table below details third-quarter and nine-month
trading revenue reported by Bank of America, Citigroup Inc. (C),
JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS) this month. The
figures exclude so-called debt-valuation adjustments, accounting
gains or losses that banks record when the value of their own
bonds falls. 
All the firms are based in New York except Bank of America,

Morgan Stanley (MS) said risks tied to
five countries at the center of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis totaled
$2.11 billion including hedges against losses. The amount for
France is negative $286 million. 
Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain represented
$5.69 billion in exposure before hedges, the New York-based firm
said today on its website. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s risks linked to
France were $1.53 billion before hedges. 
Concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would spark bank losses
contributed to a 41 percent tumble for Morgan Stanley&#8217;s shares
in the third quarter. Europe&#8217;s leaders are set to meet Oct. 23
to discuss how to stem the crisis. 
The risks &#8220;seems meaningfully lower than feared,&#8221; Brennan
Hawken, an analyst at UBS AG, wrote today in a note to
investors. 
The largest net exposure was $1.79 billion to Italy, and
the firm had negative net exposure to Ireland and Portugal. The
figures include obligations tied to sovereign governments,
corporations, clearinghouses and financial institutions. 
&#8220;The exposures have been very well managed,&#8221; Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been
looking forward to addressing this.&#8221; 
Disclosures by the bank are likely to ease concern about
fallout from the crisis, causing Morgan Stanley&#8217;s credit spreads
to narrow relative to peers, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts
and strategists John Marshall, Louise Pitt and Daniel Harris
said in a note earlier this month. 
Comfort Level 
&#8220;They need to give investors a level of comfort that
they&#8217;re addressing it,&#8221; said Douglas G. Ciocca, managing
director at Kavar Capital Partners LLC in Leawood, Kansas, which
manages about $225 million in assets. He spoke before the
figures were released. &#8220;They&#8217;ll have to be as reasonably
assuring and specific as they can be.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), owner of the ESPN
sports channel and the world&#8217;s largest theme-park operator,
apologized to customers after demand for limited editions of its
princess dolls crashed the Disney Store website. 
More than 1,200 Facebook users posted comments when the
company acknowledged yesterday that the site was &#8220;extremely
busy&#8221; and that it &#8220;won&#8217;t allow such high volume to check out
simultaneously.&#8221; 
The furor erupted when the Burbank, California-based
company put the last five models in its Disney Princess Designer
Doll Collection for sale on its website yesterday for $59.50
each. All of the dolls -- the characters Tiana, Jasmine,
Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Pocahontas -- sold out the same
day, the company said. 
&#8220;DUMB, DUMB, DUMB! I think Disney should go back to the
meeting room on this one,&#8221; Susan Herd Collier posted to
Disney&#8217;s Facebook page. 
The company was contrite. 
&#8220;We acknowledge that this has been a poor experience for
many of you, and we are truly sorry for those of you who were
unable to purchase,&#8221; Disney said yesterday in a statement on
the store&#8217;s Facebook page. 
The Disney Princess Designer Doll collection made its debut
on Aug. 23, starting with the Cinderella model and a plan to
introduce one more character a week for a total of 10. Trouble
started when Snow White went on sale Sept. 19 and it sold out
the same day. The company said the doll was &#8220;oversold&#8221; and
blamed a &#8220;system malfunction&#8221; on its Disney Store blog. 
Five More Dolls 
&#8220;We want you to know that we read your comments on
Facebook, saw your Tweets, and our Cast Members have told us
what they heard from our Guests who visited our stores,&#8221; Jim
Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide, said in a Sept.
23 post on the store blog. 
Disney said then it would release the five remaining dolls
all on the same day, starting Oct. 17 in its stores and
yesterday from its website. Customers were allowed to order only
one of each character, and even with that limit, demand led to
the website crash. 
Disney spokesman Gary Foster said the company would have no
comment beyond its online posts.

Mobile telephones don&#8217;t raise the
chance of developing central nervous system cancers, according
to a study of Danish mobile-phone subscribers published today in
the British Medical Journal. 
The study examined reports from Denmark&#8217;s centralized
cancer registry and subscriber records from mobile-phone
networks for 358,403 Danes aged at least 30 from 1990 to 2007.
It found no higher incidence of brain tumors or any other
cancers in the people studied. 
&#8220;We didn&#8217;t find a higher risk for people subscribing for a
mobile phone in the adult population,&#8221; said Patrizia Frei, a
postdoctoral research fellow at the Swiss Tropical and Public
Health Institute in Basel, who led the study while at the
Institute of Cancer Epidemiology in Copenhagen, in an interview. 
The research is the largest of its type and used data that
was already available, instead of retrospectively interviewing
phone subscribers whose recall could be selective or unreliable,
the scientists said. The findings may help clarify previous
research into the link between mobile phones and brain tumors,
which the authors said has been inconclusive and, in some cases,
criticized for being biased or prone to error. 
The International Agency for Research on Cancer, part of
the Geneva-based World Health Organization, said in June that
mobile phones may cause brain cancer. A month later, the
International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection&#8217;s
committee on epidemiology undermined those findings, saying that
using the technology may not increase the risk of tumors after
reviewing studies from several countries. 
Electromagnetic Fields 
More than 5 billion mobile-phone subscriptions are held
worldwide, according to the International Telecommunication
Union. Concerns have arisen over whether exposing the brain to
radiofrequency electromagnetic fields emitted by mobile phones
leads to cancer. The IARC said the fields were &#8220;possibly&#8221;
carcinogenic, the same category as diesel fuel and chloroform. 
A weakness in the Danish study was that it used data about
people who had a mobile-phone contract and excluded corporate
accounts. Some non-users of phones may have been counted among
the subscribers and some heavy users may not have been included
in the study population, wrote Anders Ahlbom, a professor at the
Karolinska Institute in Stockholm in an accompanying editorial. 
&#8220;The absence of a trend in the incidence of brain tumors
in national statistics is reassuring,&#8221; Ahlbom wrote.
&#8220;Continued monitoring of health registers and prospective
cohorts is warranted.&#8221; 
The research was funded by the Danish Strategic Research
Council.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $14.5
million to settle a lawsuit brought by two whistle-blowers who
claimed the company improperly marketed its bladder-control drug
Detrol. 
The whistle-blowers, former sales representatives David
Wetherholt and Marci Drimer, sued Pfizer in federal court in
Boston in 2006, claiming the company cheated Medicaid, the
state-administered, federal health-care program for low-income
people, by pushing Detrol for a prostate condition. The suit was
filed under the False Claims Act on behalf of the U.S. and
multiple states. 
Pfizer will pay $14.5 million to the U.S. government, 49
states and the District of Columbia, Thomas M. Greene, a lawyer
for the whistle-blowers, said today in a statement. The ex-
Pfizer employees will receive 27 percent of the federal portion
of the recovery, or about $3.3 million, he said. 
&#8220;The plan to market Detrol off-label to new patient
populations was hatched by a marketing team, not by research and
development,&#8221; Greene said in an interview. &#8220;Instead of asking,
&#8216;Who will Detrol help?&#8217; or even, &#8216;How does Detrol work?&#8217; the
question became, &#8216;Who can we convince to buy Detrol?&#8217;&#8221; 
&#8216;Favorable Terms&#8217; 
Pfizer denied any wrongdoing. The New York-based company
settled the lawsuit on &#8220;favorable terms,&#8221; it said today in a
statement. 
&#8220;This settlement allows Pfizer to avoid the cost and
distraction of litigation and put this matter behind us,&#8221; the
company said. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, paid $2.3 billion in
2009 to settle U.S. investigations into improper marketing of
its Bextra painkiller and other drugs. The Detrol claim was the
last of the False Claims Act cases connected to these suits, the
company said. 
The U.S. declined to intervene, or join, the Detrol lawsuit
in 2009. The whistleblowers pursued the claim on their own after
that decision, Greene said. 
The former Pfizer sales representatives claimed that the
company marketed Detrol, approved for treatment of overactive
bladder conditions, for an additional, unapproved, use, in
violation of federal regulations. 
Pfizer encouraged prescriptions for patients who have an
impeded flow of urine caused by a condition called benign
prostatic hyperplasia, the whistle-blowers claimed. 
&#8216;Unlawful Conduct&#8217; 
&#8220;Pfizer intentionally embarked on a course of unlawful
conduct that it knew would lead to the submission by physicians
and pharmacists of thousands of Medicaid claims for Detrol uses
that were not covered by Medicaid and for which the drug was
ineffective,&#8221; the whistle-blowers said in their complaint. 
The lawsuit was initially settled in January while the
conclusion of the case was delayed as the plaintiffs got
agreements from the states, according to court filings. 
Wetherholt and Drimer also alleged Pfizer forced them out
after they complained about marketing practices. Greene declined
to comment on whether their claims of wrongful termination were
settled. 
Wetherholt and Drimer will also receive an undetermined
amount from the $2.62 million portion of the settlement shared
by the states, Greene said. 
&#8220;They will receive a percentage of the state settlements
for those states with false claims acts,&#8221; he said. 
The case is U.S. ex. rel. Wetherholt v. Pfizer Inc.,
06-10204, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Boston).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) disclosed $1.3
billion of new expenses tied to faulty mortgages and
foreclosures in its third quarter, pushing the bill for the five
biggest home lenders since 2007 to almost $69 billion. 
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, set aside $314
million for buying back defective loans and incurred $1 billion
in litigation costs caused mostly by mortgages, according to its
Oct. 13 report. That brought the New York-based bank&#8217;s total to
at least $17.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Cost are mounting as borrowers, investors and states accuse
banks of sloppy lending and improper foreclosures. The total may
top $120 billion because mortgage buyers such as Fannie Mae are
becoming more aggressive, said Paul Miller, the FBR Capital
Markets  Co. analyst, and claims are spreading to loans written
after banks said they reformed their practices. 
&#8220;This is still far from over,&#8221; said Neil Barofsky, former
inspector general for the U.S. Troubled Asset Relief Program.
&#8220;These numbers are very high to begin with, but this is now an
enormous overhang on the industry, and it&#8217;s well deserved.
Sooner or later the banks will pay the price for their
behavior.&#8221; 
During the housing boom, banks issued mortgages and bundled
them into securities sold to private investors and government-
backed enterprises. They usually offered &#8220;representations and
warranties&#8221; in which lenders promised to buy back the mortgages
or cover losses if the loans turned out to be based on
inaccurate or missing data on criteria such as the borrower&#8217;s
income, the property&#8217;s value or whether it would be used as a
primary residence. 
Bad Loans 
Regulators said banks abandoned their own lending standards
to approve unjustified loans, leading to record defaults and
foreclosures. Investors who owned the mortgages began scouring
the loans for defects and lodging claims, while homeowners and
state attorneys general alleged that banks based seizures on
missing or false documents. Litigation costs for JPMorgan alone
have come to more than $5 billion. 
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), whose Countrywide unit was the
biggest lender during the housing bubble, had $1.18 billion in
third-quarter costs, according to its Oct. 18 report. That
included a $278 million provision for repurchases, $500 million
for litigation costs and $400 million for waivers and
assessments related to foreclosure problems. The total for the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based company since 2007 is now $40.3
billion, the most of any U.S. home lender. 
Mortgage Servicing 
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) added $390 million to its reserves for
repurchases in the third quarter, bringing its total to $5.48
billion. The San Francisco-based company, the biggest U.S. home
lender, also wrote down the value of its mortgage servicing
rights by $2.64 billion, in part because of expenses &#8220;including
delinquency and foreclosure costs.&#8221; 
The writedown was excluded from Bloomberg&#8217;s tally because
the bank didn&#8217;t say how much of the decline was attributable to
extraordinary foreclosure costs, and Ancel Martinez, a Wells
Fargo spokesman, declined to elaborate. 
Citigroup Inc. (C) reported a $301 million provision for
repurchase demands, lifting the New York-based bank&#8217;s total to
$2.2 billion. 
Thomas Kelly at JPMorgan, Shannon Bell at Citigroup and
Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman, declined to
comment. Ally Financial Inc., previously known as GMAC Inc., has
not reported its third-quarter data yet. As of the second
quarter, the Detroit-based lender had been hit with $3.28
billion in costs. Ally is 74 percent owned by the U.S.
government after being rescued from collapse in 2008. 
Fannie and Freddie 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were also bailed out, say
they&#8217;re getting tougher in demanding repurchases, even for loans
that have not gone into default. Some guarantees offered by
banks oblige them to give refunds merely if the underwriting was
defective, even if the borrower is still paying. 
&#8220;Fannie Mae in particular seems to be getting more
aggressive,&#8221; FBR&#8217;s Miller said. Bank of America said it had
$11.67 billion in outstanding claims and JPMorgan had $3.09
billion. 
While most claims have been concentrated in the years
before the housing bubble burst, JPMorgan and Bank of America
reported that demands for repurchases on loans issued after 2008
had about tripled from the year earlier. Previously, the banks
had said they expected few claims those mortgages were faulty
because they had tightened their lending procedures after the
credit crisis. 
Newer Loans 
Wells Fargo said it had received a rising number of
repurchase demands from Fannie Mae for mortgages from 2006 to
2008 and that &#8220;newer vintage demands continued to emerge.&#8221; 
On top of that, banks have been in negotiations with the
attorneys general of the 50 states to resolve litigation for
foreclosure abuses and errors. A settlement may cost about $20
billion. 
Bloomberg&#8217;s tally was compiled from regulatory filings,
company statements and financial presentations by the nation&#8217;s
five biggest mortgage lenders. The data cover provisions and
expenses attributable to repurchases, foreclosure errors and
abuses, payments to reimburse investors for lost value on faulty
mortgages, legal settlements and litigation expenses. 
The compilation also includes writedowns of assets, such as
mortgage servicing rights, when the company attributed the loss
in value to problems in mortgage underwriting or foreclosures
and the costs of remedies. 
The tally would be higher if it included settlements with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading
investors in mortgage-related securities, such as collateralized
debt obligations. 
The SEC announced Wednesday a $285 million settlement with
Citigroup. In July, 2010, the agency announced a $550 million
settlement with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan paid
$153.6 million in a similar case in June. SEC officials have
said more cases are likely.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is seeking
to raise a collateralized loan obligation with a target size of
$400 million to be managed by Ares Management LLC, according to
three people with knowledge of the deal. 
The CLO may include a $254 million piece rated AAA by
Standard  Poor&#8217;s, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the terms are private. Bank of America Corp.
priced a $410 million CLO for the Los Angeles-based investment
manager in January. 
There have been more than $7.6 billion of CLOs backed by
widely syndicated loans raised in the U.S. this year, more than
double the $3.4 billion raised in 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. At the peak of the market in 2007, $91.1
billion of that type of CLO was issued in the U.S., Morgan
Stanley data show. 
The Ares fund may also consist of a $23 million slice rated
AA, a $40 million piece ranked A, a $21 million portion graded
BBB and an $18 million BB piece. There may also be $44 million
of equity, the people said. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs
spokesman, and Bill Mendel, an Ares spokesman, both declined to
comment. 
CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return. The SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100
Index, which tracks the 100 largest dollar- denominated first-
lien leveraged loans, has climbed 1.5 cents since September to
90.06 cents on the dollar, the highest level since Aug. 8.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, was sued by Israel-based MiniFrame Ltd. for
allegedly offering anticompetitive terms for multiserver
operating systems. 
MiniFrame said Microsoft uses its monopoly on the client
operating-system market to interfere with potential partners and
customers. Before 2007, Microsoft didn&#8217;t include any
restrictions in its licenses that would prevent multiple users,
MiniFrame said in a complaint filed today in Manhattan federal
court. 
MiniFrame alleges that Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft
is attempting to retain its monopoly on the server operating-
system market and the client operating-system market and is
attempting to monopolize the personal-computer sharing software
market and the multi-user software market. 
&#8220;Microsoft recognized the competitive threat which shared
PC systems posed and engaged in several anticompetitive
strategies in order to ensure that it will maintain or otherwise
have a monopoly for any multi-user market, whether it be the
server operating system market, the PC sharing software market,
or the combination of the two markets,&#8221; MiniFrame said. 
MiniFrame said there no technological reason multiple users
can&#8217;t access or use the same Windows Client Operating System at
the same time. 
A Microsoft representative didn&#8217;t immediately return a
voice-mail message seeking comment about the complaint. 
The case is MiniFrame v. Microsoft Corp. 11-CV-7419, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said it&#8217;s unlikely that the U.S. economy
will slip back into recession.  
&#8220;There appears to be this mood around of inevitability
about the next quarter that we&#8217;re back into recession or close
to it,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in an interview on CNBC today. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
really buy. Most of the ongoing reliable data is quite strong.
There&#8217;s no momentum for a recession.&#8221; 
&#8220;It certainly seems that the U.S. is struggling with trend
growth, but something&#8221; about 2 percent &#8220;strikes me as the
cruising speed the U.S. is at now,&#8221; the economist told CNBC.
There will need to be &#8220;a lot of negative shocks going on to
drag the U.S. down,&#8221; he said. 
O&#8217;Neill also said that &#8220;people seem to be convinced that
Europe going wrong is going to drag the U.S. down. That&#8217;s might
happen, but there&#8217;s a strong likelihood it won&#8217;t.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley bought jet-fuel
cargoes at a reduced premium in Singapore, Asia&#8217;s biggest oil-
trading and refining center. Hin Leong Trading Pte extended its
purchases of fuel oil. 
Light Distillates 
Vitol Group bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 92-RON
gasoline from BP Plc in Singapore, according to a Bloomberg
survey of traders monitoring transactions on the Platts window.
The Geneva-based trader paid $118.50 a barrel to load between
Nov. 6 and Nov. 10. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought a 25,000 metric-ton, open-
specification naphtha contract for second-half December from
Mabanaft BV at $884 a ton, the survey showed. 
Naphtha&#8217;s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
dropped $29.74 to $59.90 a ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time,
based on data compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread, a
measure of refining profit, is the narrowest so far this week. 
Middle Distillates 
Morgan Stanley bought two jet-fuel cargoes in Singapore,
according to the Bloomberg survey. Hin Leong and BP each sold
100,000 barrels at 10 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes, the
smallest premium in a week. The cargoes are for Nov. 4 to Nov.
8, the earliest loading period. 
Jet fuel&#8217;s premium to gasoil, or diesel, fell 5 cents to
$2.80 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. Singapore time, based on data from
PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a London-based broker. This regrade is
the narrowest so far this week, signaling it is less profitable
to produce aviation fuel over diesel. 
Gasoil&#8217;s premium to Asian marker Dubai crude rose 42 cents
to $16.71 a barrel, PVM said. This crack spread is the widest
since Oct. 7. 
Fuel Oil 
Hin Leong bought two 20,000-ton cargoes of 380-centistoke
fuel oil in Singapore, bringing its purchases so far this month
to at least 240,000 tons, according to the Bloomberg survey. The
closely held trader paid $9 a ton over quotes for first-half
November to Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Vitol, for loading from
Nov. 15 to Nov. 19. 
Fuel oil&#8217;s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 43 cents to
$4.18 a barrel at 3:21 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM data.
That&#8217;s the smallest gap in a week, indicating reduced losses for
refiners turning oil into residual products. 
The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade decreased 50 cents to $7 a ton, the lowest in a week, PVM
said. A narrowing viscosity spread shows bunker, or marine fuel,
has declined less than higher-quality fuel oil.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) expects production
costs of handsets using Windows Phone 7 software next year to
drop by more than half from when the platform was introduced. 
Cooperation with parts makers including Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) will
allow phones using Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft&#8217;s mobile
operating system to be produced for less than $200, compared
with $400 when the software was released last year, Andy Lees,
head of the Windows Phone division, said in an interview in Hong
Kong today. The actual retail price will be determined by
operators, he said. 
Microsoft is competing with Google Inc. (GOOG) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) to
gain a bigger share of the $207 billion mobile-phone market,
where it lags behind the Android and iOS platforms. The first
models using the latest version of Windows Phone 7, called
Mango, have already been shipped in Japan, with devices to be
available in China next year, Lees said. 
&#8220;Volume, volume, volume,&#8221; is Microsoft&#8217;s main motivation
for helping vendors offer cheaper handsets, Lees said, declining
to identify phone makers. 
Models using Mango to be introduced in the next few months
will require as little as $220 to produce, before the cost falls
further in 2012, Lees said. 
&#8220;We are supporting componentry that will allow us to go
below $200,&#8221; he said, referring to handset production costs. 
Lower prices will mean less royalty revenue per phone
because Microsoft offers tiered pricing, based on the
manufacturing cost of the handset, he said. 
Microsoft works exclusively with Qualcomm to develop chips
that power handsets using its system, allowing it to specify
technical details to ensure devices run more smoothly, the
executive said. 
There is currently no plan to work with other semiconductor
makers for Windows Phone 7 devices, he said. 
HTC Corp. (2498), Samsung Electronics Co. and ZTE Corp. (000063) are among
device makers that have already developed handsets using Windows
Phone 7. Nokia Oyj (NOK1V), which has agreed to develop phones with
Microsoft, will outline its plans for Windows phones next week,
Lees said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a
judge in New York state court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by
Allstate Insurance Co. over the alleged fraudulent sale of
residential mortgage-backed securities. 
The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer sued New York-based
Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Aug. 15 over the sale of more than $100 million worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
including the lost market value of the investments. 
Allstate filed the lawsuit and seven similar complaints
against various issuers and underwriters of residential
mortgage-backed securities, using &#8220;generalities and unsupported
assumptions&#8221; to recoup investment losses on certificates it
bought in five offerings in 2006, Goldman Sachs said in court
documents filed today. 
&#8220;Despite its financial sophistication and expertise
(including in the housing market, where it is a leading
insurer), Allstate now suffers from buyer&#8217;s remorse and has sued
the counterparties with which it traded at arm&#8217;s length,
claiming in separate actions that each of the eight sellers of
RMBS misled it as to characteristics of the securities,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. 
Allstate has also sued lenders including JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill
Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over residential
mortgage-backed securities. 
The investments, pools of home loans securitized into
bonds, were a central part of the housing bubble that helped
send the U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. The
housing market collapsed, and the crisis swept up lenders and
investment banks as the market for the securities evaporated. 
The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,
652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was sued by
a pension fund that alleges the New York-based investment bank
had a conflict of interest in its role as adviser in the planned
$21 billion purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP) by Kinder Morgan Inc. 
Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder
Morgan, steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. 
&#8220;The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan,&#8221; lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. 
In addition to Goldman Sachs, the complaint also names
individual El Paso directors and Kinder Morgan. 
While Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser on the
sale, Goldman&#8217;s presence &#8220;tainted the entire process,&#8221; lawyers
for the retirement fund said in the complaint. Goldman continued
to act as financial adviser on &#8220;related matters&#8221; in connection
with the transaction, the pension fund said in the complaint,
citing the companies&#8217; joint press statement. 
Fiduciary Duty 
Goldman Sachs is accused of aiding and abetting a breach of
fiduciary duty by El Paso directors. In addition to seeking
unspecified damages, the pension fund is asking a judge to order
the directors to give &#8220;full and fair consideration&#8221; to any
alternative offers for the company. 
The retirement fund also faulted El Paso directors for
agreeing to an inadequate deal in light of the surge in demand
for pipelines, the pricing power Kinder Morgan will garner as a
result of the transaction and the premiums paid for past energy
deals. The board &#8220;virtually eliminated&#8221; the prospect of
a superior offer by agreeing to unreasonable deal protection
devices including a no-shop clause and a punitive $650 million
termination fee, according to the complaint. 
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment on the lawsuit except to say that the bank&#8217;s
representatives on Kinder Morgan&#8217;s board recused themselves from
the deal process. 
Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan,
said in an e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending
litigation. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, also
declined to comment. 
Cash and Stock 
El Paso, based in Houston, said Oct. 16 it would be bought
for cash and stock to create the largest natural-gas pipeline
network in the U.S. The company was sued earlier this week by a
shareholder over claims the deal undervalues it shares. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity arm was one of Richard
Kinder&#8217;s co-investors when he took his company private in 2007.
The firm remains one of the largest Kinder Morgan shareholders
and has two representatives on the board. 
Richard Kinder kicked off the takeover talks in late August
when he approached El Paso&#8217;s Douglas Foshee, said Joe Hollier, a
Kinder Morgan spokesman. 
That disrupted a previous plan by El Paso, announced in
May, to spin off its exploration and production assets to
shareholders. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Steve Daniel had been advising El Paso on
the spinoff. For the talks with Kinder Morgan, El Paso instead
turned to a Morgan Stanley team. 
The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) appointed
Greg Agran and Magid Shenouda as co-heads of commodities
trading, according to a company memo obtained by Bloomberg News. 
The memo, dated Oct. 18, was confirmed today by Sophie
Bullock, a company spokeswoman based in London. 
Agran and Shenouda are based in New York and London,
respectively. They replace Jeffrey Resnick, global head of
commodities trading, who decided to retire at the end of this
year after 18 years at the Wall Street firm, the memo said. 
Goldman Sachs generated $3.6 billion of revenue from its
commodities business in 2006 and $3.4 billion in 2007, according
to documents released this year by the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. Goldman likely has a 15 percent
to 20 percent market share in commodities, which generated
industry revenue of $6 billion to $7 billion last year,
according to estimates from Glenn Schorr, an analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc. in New York. 
Agran is currently head of U.S. natural gas and power
trading and head of global commodities principal investing. He
joined Goldman Sachs in 1991 as an analyst in New York and was
named managing director in 1999 and partner in 2006, according
to the memo. 
Shenouda is the bank&#8217;s head of European crude oil and
products trading and European gas and power trading. He joined
Goldman Sachs in 1999 as a vice president in London, after
working as a physical fuel oil trader at independent energy
trader Trafigura Beheer BV. He was responsible for expanding
Goldman&#8217;s physical commodities business, including expanding its
coal, freight, and emissions franchise, the memo said. He was
promoted to managing director in 2005. 
Goldman Sachs competes with other banks in commodities,
including Morgan Stanley (MS), which also has a 15 to 20 percent
market share, according to Schorr at Nomura.

Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) and Novartis AG (NOVN)
are under investigation by the European Union&#8217;s antitrust
regulator over contracts that may have hampered the sale of
generic versions of pain killer Fentanyl in the Netherlands. 
The EU authority said it&#8217;s probing contractual arrangements
between JJ and Novartis that may have had the &#8220;object or
effect of hindering entry&#8221; of the generic drug onto the Dutch
market. Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis owns Sandoz, a
generic-drug maker. 
&#8220;Pharmaceutical companies are already rewarded for their
innovation efforts by the patents they are granted,&#8221; EU
Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Paying a competitor to stay out of the market is a
restriction of competition that the commission will not
tolerate.&#8221; 
Antitrust regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are
focusing on how settlements between companies that make branded
medicines and generics producers might harm consumers. Bayer AG
was among drug firms told by EU officials in January to submit
details of patent-settlement deals that may be used to delay the
sale of generic versions of medicines. Drug developers use
various ways to delay generics, the EU said in a 2009 report. 
The investigation is related to a contractual agreement JJ
had with Sandoz in the Netherlands and is limited to that
country, Stefan Gijssels, a spokesman for JJ&#8217;s Janssen
subsidiary, said in a telephone interview today. The company
will cooperate fully with authorities, he said. 
Teva Deal 
&#8220;It&#8217;s important to underline that the commission has not
made a finding that Janssen did something wrong in the
Netherlands," Gijssels said. &#8216;&#8216;It&#8217;s the start of an
investigation." 
&#8216;&#8216;We don&#8217;t comment on ongoing procedures,&#8217;&#8217; Eric Althoff, a
spokesman for Novartis, said in an e-mail. 
EU antitrust regulators are also investigating Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), the world&#8217;s largest generic
drugmaker, and Cephalon Inc. (CEPH) over a 2005 agreement that may have
delayed generic versions of Provigil. Teva last week completed
its acquisition of Cephalon after agreeing to divest Cephalon&#8217;s
marketing rights in France for a generic version of narcolepsy
drug Provigil. 
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) last year partly lost an appeal at the EU&#8217;s
second-highest court over a commission decision that it had
misled patent officials and flouted antitrust rules to keep a
generic competitor off the market. The London-based company has
an appeal pending.

Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, will sell its Saxon unit to Ocwen Financial
Corp. (OCN), exiting the mortgage-servicing business it bought before
the housing market collapsed. 
Ocwen agreed to pay a base price of $59.3 million plus
about $1.4 billion for receivables outstanding, Morgan Stanley
said yesterday in a statement. The deal is expected to close in
2012&#8217;s first quarter and isn&#8217;t likely to have a material impact
on earnings, New York-based Morgan Stanley said. 
Investment banks are selling mortgage servicers they bought
before the financial crisis as record defaults drive up costs
for billing, collections and foreclosures and make the units
less valuable. Ocwen last month completed the purchase of Litton
Loan Servicing LP from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) for $263.7
million. 
&#8220;These transactions demonstrate yet again Ocwen&#8217;s strong
growth prospects as consolidation of private-label servicing
continues and demand increases for specialty servicing,&#8221; Ocwen
Chairman William Erbey said in a separate statement.&#160;&#8220;We remain
bullish on our growth prospects into 2012.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley bought Glen Allen, Virginia-based Saxon in
2006 for $706 million as the investment bank sought a mortgage
issuer and servicer to provide home loans that it packaged into
securities. Morgan Stanley took a $700 million writedown in the
fourth quarter of 2008 related to businesses it owned, with most
of the charge coming from Saxon. 
Impact on Assets 
The sale will reduce Morgan Stanley&#8217;s risk-weighted assets
as it attempts to meet capital standards set to start taking
effect in 2013. It will also reduce the firm&#8217;s headcount by
about 1,200, according to a person familiar with the unit. 
Ocwen outbid Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)&#8217;s Nationstar
Mortgage Holdings Inc., according to another person with
knowledge of the talks, who declined to be identified because
the process wasn&#8217;t public. 
Ocwen, based in West Palm Beach, Florida, acquires $26.6
billion in unpaid principal balances of mortgage servicing
rights, $10.9 billion of which Ocwen already subservices. The
deal also includes another $12.9 billion of loans that Saxon
services for Morgan Stanley and other firms. It gained about
$38.6 billion of unpaid principal balances with its purchase of
Litton, which Ocwen acquired by also agreeing to pay about
$337.4 million to retire some of Litton&#8217;s debt. 
HomEq Purchase 
Ocwen agreed in May 2010 to buy HomEq Servicing, a mortgage
servicer owned by London-based Barclays Plc, for about $1.3
billion in cash conditional on the value of certain assets at
completion, according to a statement from Barclays at the time.
Barclays also agreed to provide Ocwen with about $1 billion in
secured financing and offered assistance in raising more funds,
according to the statement. 
In May, Saxon agreed to pay $2.35 million to resolve a
lawsuit alleging it improperly foreclosed on 17 U.S. military-
service members from 2006 to 2009. The foreclosures violated the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which was enacted to shield
deployed military personnel from financial stress, according to
the U.S. Justice Department. 
Morgan Stanley considered buying New Century Financial
Corp. (CYFL), the subprime mortgage lender that filed for bankruptcy in
April 2007, before acquiring Saxon, Chairman John Mack said in a
November 2010 interview released this year by the Financial
Crisis Inquiry Commission. 
The bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. won court
approval last year of an agreement to seek buyers or liquidate
its Aurora Bank FSB unit, which includes a mortgage-servicing
arm.

Units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
were sued by Capmark Financial Group Inc., which accused them of
wrongly collecting $147 million five months before Capmark went
bankrupt. 
While they were co-owners of Capmark in May 2009, a group
of Goldman units used their influence to help convince Capmark
to refinance $1.5 billion in unsecured debt owed to Goldman,
according to the lawsuit filed today in Manhattan federal court.
The refinancing allowed Goldman to collect $147 million,
including $7 million in cash, based on the new secured loan,
according to the lawsuit. 
&#8220;Despite these conflicts and close connections -- indeed,
as a result of the influence and insider status that its
multiple simultaneous roles created -- Goldman Sachs actively
and directly participated in internal meetings and discussions
that led to the secured credit facility, which gave it
preferential treatment as a creditor,&#8221; Capmark claimed in the
lawsuit. 
Capmark, the commercial lender once a part of the former
General Motors Corp., exited bankruptcy in September, co-owned
by lower-ranking creditors, some of whom had fought with Goldman
over the refinancing and the payments in bankruptcy court in
Delaware. 
Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman, declined comment
on the lawsuit. 
2006 Purchase 
Capmark, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, became partly
owned by affiliates of New York-based Goldman Sachs when the
bank and a group of investors bought 78 percent of Capmark, then
called GMAC Commercial Mortgage, in 2006 for $1.5 billion in
cash and the repayment of $7.3 billion of debt. 
The creditors committee also battled with Goldman Sachs
over how to handle so-called insider preference claims --
lawsuits sometimes brought against company insiders, including
equity holders, accused of wrongly taking money from the company
in the months before the bankruptcy filing. 
&#8220;Plaintiffs bring this action seeking avoidance and
recovery of all preferential payments made to defendant or for
defendants&#8217; benefit under the pre-petition credit facilities,&#8221;
Capmark said in the complaint filed today. 
Last year, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi gave
Capmark permission to settle allegations that the entire
$1.5 billion refinancing was a fraud on creditors because it
wrongly boosted the repayment priority of Goldman Sachs and
other lenders. 
Under that settlement, Capmark paid New York-based Goldman
Sachs and the other lenders about $835 million, less than the
full value of the loan. 
Capmark filed bankruptcy on Oct. 25, 2009, blaming falling
property values and a drop in lending. 
The case is Capmark Financial Group Inc. v. Goldman Sachs,
11-CV-7511, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), fighting
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. over $6 billion in claims it filed
against the defunct firm, asked a judge to allow continued
sealing of some information in court papers, saying secrecy was
needed to protect entities from harm. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s claims against Lehman and its brokerage are
&#8220;significantly overstated,&#8221; Lehman said in August. The bank, a
go-between for the brokerage&#8217;s repurchase agreements with short-
term investors after the parent&#8217;s Sept. 15, 2008 bankruptcy,
failed to sell collateral securing the loans in a &#8220;commercially
reasonable manner,&#8221; it alleged in a filing where passages were
blacked out. 
Lehman asked the judge to hold a hearing on the issue and
then cut the claims as he considered appropriate. 
JPMorgan later agreed to let Lehman publish a mostly
uncensored version of its objection to the claims, the New York-
based bank said in a filing today. The information that is still
blacked out includes names and account numbers of JPMorgan&#8217;s
trading partners, phone numbers and certain e-mail addresses, it
said. 
Potential Harm 
&#8220;The bankruptcy code provides courts with the power to
issue orders that will protect entitles from potential harm that
may result from the disclosure of certain confidential
information,&#8221; it said in the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. 
In the partially uncensored objection to JPMorgan&#8217;s claim,
Lehman gave details about the sale of collateral. On the morning
the Lehman brokerage went into liquidation, JPMorgan started to
sell the securities, calling the plan &#8220;Project Tassimo,&#8221; after
a coffee maker owned by a bank employee involved in the
transactions, it said. 
The sale was handled &#8220;without any limits or safeguards
ensuring a fair price,&#8221; Lehman alleged. 
Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the largest U.S. bank,
declined to comment on the allegations. Kimberly Macleod, a
Lehman spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
Separately, JPMorgan is contesting an $8.6 billion lawsuit
by Lehman, saying it was protected by so-called safe harbor law
when it took collateral from the defunct firm in 2008. Congress
created the law to protect banks lending to faltering companies,
JPMorgan has said. 
Fraud Allegations 
JPMorgan, which lent $70 billion to Lehman&#8217;s brokerage
around the time of the September 2008 bankruptcy, sued Lehman
back, alleging it defrauded its lender into making the loan. 
The brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc., is being separately
liquidated from its parent, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., after
going into liquidation four days after its parent. 
The main case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), 08-
13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).The lawsuit is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v.
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

The European debt crisis and
government belt-tightening may cause the U.S. economy to slow in
early 2012 even as the risk of it faltering this year has waned,
said JPMorgan Chase  Co. chief economist Bruce Kasman. 
&#8220;As we are picking up some steam, we&#8217;re now obviously
facing a new set of drags, mostly emanating from Europe,&#8221;
Kasman said today in a radio interview on &#8220;Bloomberg
Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene and Ken Prewitt. &#8220;We also have
this uncertainty about where U.S. fiscal policy is heading.&#8221; 
Economic growth may slow to 1 percent early next year &#8220;on
the back of Europe going into recession and on the back of
fiscal tightening&#8221; in the U.S., New York-based Kasman said. The
slowdown may lead to a rise in the unemployment rate, which was
at 9.1 percent in September for a third month. 
More immediately, Kasman said a waning of headwinds, which
included higher fuel prices and supply disruptions from Japan&#8217;s
natural disaster, has helped U.S. growth speed up after
proceeding at a 0.9 percent rate in the first half of this year,
the weakest pace since the recession ended in June 2009. 
Gross domestic product expanded at about a 3 percent pace
from July to September, Kasman said. Economists project a 2.5
percent advance, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey ahead of the Commerce Department figures on Oct. 27.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s smoking cessation drug
Chantix doesn&#8217;t lead to more hospitalizations than nicotine
replacement therapies such Sanofi&#8217;s NicoDerm patches, two U.S.
studies suggest. 
The Food and Drug Administration said today it continues to
evaluate the risk of mood changes and other psychiatric events
linked to Chantix after releasing the results of two studies the
agency cautioned had limitations. Both lacked a large enough
sample size to detect rare adverse events or dismiss the
increased risk of episodes that don&#8217;t result in
hospitalizations, the FDA said in a safety announcement. 
A boxed warning on Chantix, which works by blocking the
effects of nicotine on the brain, cautions patients they could
experience changes in behavior, hostility, agitation, depressed
mood and suicidal thoughts or actions. New York-based Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, is conducting a large clinical
trial of the drug to assess neuropsychiatric effects, with
results expected in 2017, the FDA said. 
Chantix was approved in May 2006 and 21.8 million
prescriptions were dispensed July 2011, according to the agency. 
&#8220;We are reviewing this important information for smokers
provided by the FDA,&#8221; MacKay Jimeson, a spokesman for Pfizer
said in an e-mail. &#8220;Given the significant public health risks
of smoking, Chantix is an important treatment option for adult
smokers to help patients stop smoking.&#8221; 
The FDA sponsored two observational studies with Chantix
conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the
Department of Defense. Both studies&#8217; showed no statistically
significant difference in psychiatric hospitalizations. 
The Veterans Affairs study included 14,131 Chantix users
and an equal number of nicotine replacement therapy users.
Sixteen Chantix-treated patients were hospitalized for
psychiatric reasons compared to 21 in the replacement therapy
group. 
The Pentagon studied 11,978 Chantix users and an equal
number of replacement therapy patients. Patients on Chantix were
hospitalized 18 times for psychiatric reasons compared to 16
times among replacement therapy patients.

Justin Nunez, a former Columbia
University football player in his second year at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), earned the unofficial title of Wall Street&#8217;s best
athlete by winning a charity decathlon held at his alma mater. 
Nunez, 27, finished atop a field of almost 100 traders,
bankers and financial advisers in the 10-event competition,
which benefits the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York. Kyle VanFleet, a former Georgetown University fullback who
also works at Goldman Sachs, was runner-up in the competition
that took place over the weekend. 
Nunez finished with 7,095 points -- 27 ahead of VanFleet
and 41 better than Brad Bagdis of Knight Capital Group -- to
improve on his third-place showing at the 2010 Wall Street
Decathlon. Nunez&#8217;s victory came at Columbia&#8217;s Wien Stadium on
the northern tip of Manhattan, where he played four years at
defensive back for the Lions. 
&#8220;To come back and actually have a chance to compete again
on my home turf felt great,&#8221; Nunez, who works in the investment
management division at Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It brings back a lot of good memories.&#8221; 
Nunez, cheered by family, college friends, his girlfriend
and colleagues from Goldman Sachs, said his experience last year
helped him win this time around.

Swiss banks will likely settle a
sweeping U.S. probe of offshore tax evasion by paying billions
of dollars and handing over names of thousands of Americans who
have secret accounts, Bloomberg News&#8217; David Voreacos, Klaus
Wille and Giles Broom report. 
U.S. and Swiss officials are concluding negotiations on a
civil settlement amid U.S. criminal probes of 11 financial
institutions, including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), suspected of
helping American clients hide money from the Internal Revenue
Service, according to five people with knowledge of the talks
who declined to speak publicly because they are confidential. 
Switzerland, the biggest haven for offshore wealth, wants
an end to new U.S. probes while preserving its decades-old
tradition of bank secrecy, the people said. The U.S. seeks data
on Americans who have dodged U.S. taxes and a pledge by Swiss
banks to stop helping such clients, according to the people. The
Swiss reached accords this year with Germany and the U.K. on
untaxed assets. 
&#8220;The Swiss would like to get out of this by paying money,
and they&#8217;ve done that with other countries,&#8221; said tax attorney
H. David Rosenbloom of Caplin  Drysdale Chartered in
Washington, who isn&#8217;t involved in the talks. &#8220;For the U.S.,
it&#8217;s not primarily a money question. It&#8217;s a matter of making
sure the laws apply fairly among taxpayers.&#8221; 
The Swiss government seeks to outline a final accord for
the Foreign Affairs Committee of its Parliament&#8217;s upper house on
Nov. 10, according to a person familiar with the matter. The
number of banks that will pay to resolve the U.S. negotiations
may extend beyond the 11 under criminal investigation, the
people said. 
&#8220;We are aiming for an all-encompassing solution that will
apply to all the banks,&#8221; Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-
Schlumpf said in an Oct. 4 interview in the Swiss capital Bern.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be confronted with the same issues time and
again.&#8221; 
The Justice Department also may bring criminal charges or
civil enforcement actions against any of the 11 financial
institutions. They could avoid prosecution by separately paying
fines, admitting wrongdoing and disclosing data, the people
said. On Aug. 30, the Justice Department requested statistical
data from the 11 about their U.S. accounts, which the U.S. has
received and is analyzing, the people said. 
The group of 11 also includes HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA), the
biggest European bank, Basler Kantonalbank (BSKP), Wegelin  Co.,
Zuercher Kantonalbank, and Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), the people
said. Three Israeli banks -- Bank Leumi Le-Israel BM (LUMI), Bank
Hapoalim BM (POLI), and Mizrahi-Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF) -- are on the list,
as well as Liechtensteinische Landesbank AG (LLB) and an asset
manager, NZB AG, according to the people.

New Suits 
Goldman Sachs Sued Over Role in El Paso&#8217;s $21 Billion Buyout 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by a pension fund that
alleges the New York-based investment bank had a conflict of
interest in its role as adviser in the planned $21 billion
purchase of El Paso Corp. (EP) by Kinder Morgan Inc. 
Goldman Sachs, which owns about 20 percent of Kinder
Morgan, steered El Paso directors to sell at a price below its
full value, earning larger advisory fees than if the company had
completed a planned spinoff, lawyers for the Louisiana Municipal
Police Employees Retirement System said in the complaint.
Goldman Sachs also stands to see its Kinder Morgan investment
increase in value, according to the complaint. 
&#8220;The El Paso board impermissibly heeded the advice of its
conflicted financial adviser Goldman Sachs and abandoned a
previously announced spinoff of its exploration and production
business in favor of a low premium sale to competitor Kinder
Morgan,&#8221; lawyers for the retirement system, an investor in El
Paso, said in the complaint filed Oct. 20 in Delaware Chancery
Court in Wilmington. 
In addition to Goldman Sachs, the complaint also names
individual El Paso directors and Kinder Morgan. 
While Morgan Stanley served as financial adviser on the
sale, Goldman&#8217;s presence &#8220;tainted the entire process,&#8221; lawyers
for the retirement fund said in the complaint. Goldman continued
to act as financial adviser on &#8220;related matters&#8221; in connection
with the transaction, the pension fund said in the complaint,
citing the companies&#8217; joint press statement. 
Andrea Rachman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, declined
to comment except to say that the bank&#8217;s representatives on
Kinder Morgan&#8217;s board recused themselves from the deal process. 
Larry Pierce, a spokesman for Houston-based Kinder Morgan,
said in an e-mail that the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending
litigation. Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for El Paso, also
declined to comment. 
The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Braniff, CA6960, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Standard Bank Sues Saudi Billionaire Over $150 Million Debt 
Standard Bank Plc sued Saudi billionaire Mohamed bin Issa
al Jaber for $150 million in a London court, saying loans made
to companies in his MBI International  Partners Inc. group
weren&#8217;t repaid. 
The bank says al Jaber personally guaranteed three loans to
JJW Hotels  Resorts Ltd. and Ajwa for Food Industries Co. in
2008, according to court papers outlining its claim. 
Al Jaber, Saudi Arabia&#8217;s third-richest man according to
Arabian Business, believes he has a claim against the bank over
a $96.5 million loss from unauthorized foreign-exchange trades,
his lawyer Catharine Otton-Goulder said Oct. 20 at a pre-trial
hearing. 
He blames Standard Bank, a unit of Johannesburg-based
Standard Bank Group Ltd., for the trades from a personal account
he held with the company and says the loans were provided to
cover the foreign-exchange losses. 
Janice Garraway, a spokeswoman for Standard Bank in London,
declined to comment on the case via e-mail Oct. 20. Gary Pegg,
an attorney for al Jaber, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail requesting
comment.

Brigham Exploration Sued by Shareholders Over Statoil Deal 
Brigham Exploration Co. (BEXP) was sued by shareholders contending
that Statoil ASA (STL)&#8217;s $4.4 billion buyout price is too low. 
The offer price is a discount to the oil and gas producer&#8217;s
52-week high trading price, according to separate suits filed by
the same law firm on behalf of shareholders Robert Fioravanti
and Howard Weisberg. 
&#8220;The proposed transaction is the product of a flawed
process that involved no known open auction,&#8221; Weisberg said
Oct. 20 in a complaint in Delaware Chancery Court. 
Statoil said Oct. 17 that it would buy all of Brigham&#8217;s
shares for $36.50 each, a 20 percent premium to the company&#8217;s
Oct. 14 closing price. The deal is the seventh-largest takeover
announced this year in the oil and gas industry. 
Statoil, Norway&#8217;s biggest oil company, is using Brigham to
expand into unconventional U.S. assets such as the Bakken shale
area in North Dakota. 
The offer price reflects an inadequate premium given
Brigham&#8217;s strong growth prospects and is still below the 23
percent average premium for the industry this year, the
shareholders said. 
The deal also includes preclusive protection devices
include a clause prohibiting Brigham from seeking a third-party
bid and a $136.5 million termination fee that discourages other
potential buyers, according to the complaints. 
Weisberg and Fioravanti are seeking to represent all
Brigham shareholders in their request to bar the transaction. 
Rob Roosa, a spokesman for Brigham Exploration, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call seeking comment. 
The cases are Weisberg v. Brigham Exploration Co., CA6957,
and Fioravanti v. Brigham Exploration Co., CA6962, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington)

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
ATT Seeks to Knock Out Government&#8217;s Ally in T-Mobile Hearing 
ATT Inc. (T) will ask a federal judge to throw out Sprint
Nextel Corp. (S)&#8217;s lawsuit to stop its purchase of T-Mobile USA
Inc., seeking a decision that would curb Sprint&#8217;s ability to
help the U.S. block the deal. 
ATT will argue at a hearing today in Washington that
Sprint, as a competitor rather than a consumer, has no right
under antitrust law to bring the suit and that Sprint&#8217;s claims
the $39 billion deal would hurt its business are unfounded. 
Should ATT persuade U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal
Huvelle to dismiss the case, Sprint&#8217;s advice on the Justice
Department&#8217;s suit would be limited by its restricted access to
confidential ATT information, said Thomas Horton, a law
professor at the University of South Dakota Law School and
former antitrust attorney in the department. 
&#8220;It will expedite the government&#8217;s case to have Sprint as
an official ally,&#8221; said Horton, who spent about eight years in
the antitrust division. 
Sprint told Huvelle on Oct. 12 that to prepare its case it
needed access to confidential data the Justice Department
collected from ATT during the U.S. probe of the proposed T-
Mobile merger. The company said it suffered from &#8220;fundamental
unfairness&#8221; because, as a competitor with relevant information,
ATT is allowed to subpoena Sprint documents in the government&#8217;s
antitrust case. 
Huvelle, overseeing all the ATT cases, froze the document
exchanges while she weighs the motion to dismiss. 
The government&#8217;s case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-01560;
Sprint&#8217;s case is Sprint Nextel Corp. v. ATT Inc., 11-01600; and
Cellular South&#8217;s case is Cellular South Inc. v. ATT Inc.,
11-01690, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington).

Goldman Sachs Asks New York Court to Dismiss Allstate Suit 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) asked a judge in New York state
court to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Allstate Insurance Co. over
the alleged fraudulent sale of residential mortgage-backed
securities. 
The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer sued New York-based
Goldman Sachs in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan on
Aug. 15 over the sale of more than $100 million worth of
residential mortgage-backed securities, asking for damages
including the lost market value of the investments. 
Allstate filed the lawsuit and seven similar complaints
against various issuers and underwriters of residential
mortgage-backed securities, using &#8220;generalities and unsupported
assumptions&#8221; to recoup investment losses on certificates it
bought in five offerings in 2006, Goldman Sachs said in court
documents filed Oct. 21. 
&#8220;Despite its financial sophistication and expertise
(including in the housing market, where it is a leading
insurer), Allstate now suffers from buyer&#8217;s remorse and has sued
the counterparties with which it traded at arm&#8217;s length,
claiming in separate actions that each of the eight sellers of
RMBS misled it as to characteristics of the securities,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said in the court documents. 
Allstate has also sued lenders including JPMorgan Chase 
Co., Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill
Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG over residential
mortgage-backed securities. 
The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Goldman, Sachs  Co.,
652273/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). 
Andrew Madoff Seeks Appeal in Picard $198 Million Suit 
Andrew Madoff, son of confidence man Bernard L. Madoff,
asked to appeal a bankruptcy judge&#8217;s ruling that allowed a $198
million lawsuit by the liquidator of his father&#8217;s firm to go
forward, according to a court filing. 
Trustee Irving Picard last month won a court ruling
permitting him to pursue most claims in a 2009 lawsuit alleging
that the Madoffs treated the now-defunct firm, Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC, as their &#8220;family piggy bank.&#8221; U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland also dismissed some claims in
the case while allowing Picard to file a new complaint. 
Andrew Madoff asked a U.S. District Court judge to allow an
appeal, according to Oct. 6 filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
New York. In court papers filed in his own behalf and as
executor of his late brother&#8217;s estate, he said the judge&#8217;s
decision would result in a &#8220;massive expansion of liability&#8221;
for managers of banks and large corporations for the wrongs of
individual units. 
Picard opposed Andrew Madoff&#8217;s request to appeal Oct. 20,
saying in his court papers that Lifland&#8217;s ruling was &#8220;well-
reasoned&#8221; and that he would seek to prove his claims at a
trial. 
In his lawsuit, Picard said that Madoff family members --
including Bernard&#8217;s brother Peter Madoff, sons Andrew and Mark
Madoff and niece Shana Madoff Swanson, all of whom held senior
positions at Madoff Securities -- profited from the fraud. 
Instead of preventing the crime, they took $198 million in
investor money from the New York-based money-management firm to
finance a business venture, pay for restaurants, vacations and
clothing and to buy cars, boats and vacation homes, he said. 
Picard didn&#8217;t try to prove in his complaint that the family
&#8220;engaged in any kind of securities fraud, dishonesty, or
deception,&#8221; only that they were derelict in their duty and
misused company funds, he said in the Oct. 20th filing. 
Martin Flumenbaum, a lawyer for Andrew Madoff and Mark
Madoff&#8217;s estate, has said that the Madoff sons didn&#8217;t know of
their father&#8217;s scheme and that they contacted prosecutors after
their father told them of his fraud. Bernard Madoff is serving a
150-year prison term. 
The case is Picard v. Madoff, 09-1503, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

AIG Bid to Move BofA Lawsuit to State Court Denied by Judge 
American International Group Inc. (AIG)&#8217;s request to move a $10
billion lawsuit against Bank of America Corp. to state court
from federal court was denied by a U.S. judge. 
AIG in August sued Bank of America in New York state court
over $10 billion in losses on mortgage-bond investments.
Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America then moved the
case to federal court. 
U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan denied New
York-based AIG&#8217;s request to return the case to state court in an
order dated Oct. 20. 
The case is American International Group Inc. v. Bank of
America Corp., 11-06212, U.S. District Court. Southern District
of New York (Manhattan).

Trials 
Kimelman Appeals Conviction, Sentence for Insider Trading 
Michael Kimelman, the co-founder of Incremental Capital
LLC, appealed his conviction and sentence for insider trading. 
Kimelman, sentenced Oct. 12 to 2 1/2 years in prison,
appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York, according to
a court filing dated Oct. 20. 
A jury found Kimelman guilty in June in a scheme to bribe
two lawyers at the Boston-based law firm Ropes  Gray LLP to
disclose secret information about companies including 3Com Corp.
and Hilton Hotels Corp. Also found guilty were brothers Zvi and
Emanuel Goffer. 
Kimelman was sentenced a day before Raj Rajaratnam, the
founder of Galleon Group LLC, received an 11-year sentence for
insider trading. Kimelman&#8217;s lawyers include Michael Sommer. 
The case is USA v. Goffer, 10-00056, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Massmart Ruling Failed to Consider Economy, Jobs, Union Says 
South African regulators who let Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) buy
control of Massmart Holdings Ltd. (MSM) failed to take account of
negative effects on the economy or jobs, a lawyer for a union
seeking to dismantle the deal said. 
The Competition Tribunal &#8220;has reached a fundamentally
wrong conclusion&#8221; in its conditional approval of the
acquisition, Paul Kennedy, senior counsel for the South African
Commercial, Catering and Allied Workers Union, told an appeal
court in Cape Town Oct. 21. &#8220;Certainly this merger will benefit
the shareholders of the merged parties. It may have very
negative consequences. There is a danger of job losses.&#8221; 
The union is asking the Competition Appeal Court to
overturn the tribunal&#8217;s May 31 clearance of Wal-Mart&#8217;s purchase
of a 51 percent holding in Johannesburg-based Massmart, South
Africa&#8217;s biggest food and general-goods wholesaler. Approval was
subject to the companies promising to refrain from firing
workers for two years and set up a fund to assist local
suppliers and manufacturers. 
Wal-Mart, the world&#8217;s largest retailer, paid 16.5 billion
rand ($2.05 billion) in June for the stake in Massmart. On June
26, the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company said it would create
15,000 jobs in South Africa within five years and spend about 60
billion rand more on food or fast-moving consumer goods in the
period, most of which would go to local suppliers. 
Kennedy said there was a &#8220;dearth of information&#8221; about
what effect the takeover will have on imports and employment,
and that the companies failed to disclose sufficient information
to regulators. 
Judge Dennis Davis, the court president, said that while he
had &#8220;significant difficulty&#8221; with evidence provided by the
companies, &#8220;they can&#8217;t have information that goes outside the
confines of their business.&#8221; 
David Unterhalter, the retailers&#8217; senior counsel, argued
that takeovers under South African law should be approved
provided they don&#8217;t significantly reduce competition. There&#8217;s no
onus on companies to prove a takeover is counter to the public
interest, he said. 
The three-judge panel will &#8220;take time to consider&#8221; its
ruling, Davis said at the conclusion of the hearings Oct. 21,
without specifying a deadline. 
Should the court decide against referring the decision back
to the tribunal, it may either uphold the approval of the
takeover or rule that it should have been rejected or subjected
to different conditions, the judge said Oct. 20. 
The case is South Africa Commercial, Catering and Allied
Workers Union v Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Massmart Holdings Ltd.,
111/CAC/Jul11.

Verdicts/Settlements 
Hedge Fund CEO Brownstein Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading 
Drew &#8220;Bo&#8221; Brownstein, the founder and chief executive
officer of Denver-based Big 5 Asset Management, pleaded guilty
to trading on inside information about a corporate merger. 
Brownstein, 35, made more than $2.5 million in illegal
profits for his hedge fund and for relatives by trading on a tip
in advance of Apache Corp. (APA)&#8217;s $2.7 billion acquisition of Mariner
Energy Inc. (ME) in April 2010, prosecutors said. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ve severely disappointed my family, colleagues,
investors and friends,&#8221; Brownstein told U.S. District Judge
Robert Patterson in Manhattan federal court Oct. 21. &#8220;I&#8217;m truly
sorry.&#8221; 
The sentencing guideline is 37 to 46 months with the plea
agreement, the judge said. Brownstein, who pleaded guilty to one
count of securities fraud, will be sentenced on Dec. 20. He was
released on a $500,000 personal recognizance bond. 
&#8220;You had inside information about the fact that Mariner&#8217;s
stock would probably go up because it was about to be acquired
by another company,&#8221; Patterson said to Brownstein. 
The tip originated with H. Clayton Peterson of Denver, a
retired former Arthur Andersen partner who served on Mariner
Energy&#8217;s board of directors, prosecutors said. Peterson, who was
also a director of Re/Max International Inc. and Lone Pine
Resources Inc., pleaded guilty to conspiracy and securities
fraud in August. His son, Drew, a Denver financial adviser,
pleaded guilty to the same charges. 
Clayton Peterson, who was appointed to Mariner&#8217;s board in
March 2006, said he passed information about the planned
transaction in April 2010 to his son. At his guilty plea, Drew
Peterson, 35, said he bought shares of Mariner stock based on
the tip and passed the information to another unidentified
person who also traded on it. 
The case is U.S. v. Peterson, 11-CR-665, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Macklowe Wins Case Icahn Filed Over Aborted 2006 Reckson Bid 
New York developer Harry Macklowe won a jury verdict that
his company doesn&#8217;t owe Carl Icahn&#8217;s Meadow Star LLC $60 million
for backing away from a 2006 bid to buy six New York skyscrapers
from Reckson Associates Realty Corp. 
Macklowe&#8217;s attorney, Roger Netzer, said a unanimous jury
voted in favor of his client after two hours of deliberations in
a lawsuit filed in 2008 by Meadow Star, an affiliate of Icahn
Enterprises LP, in New York state court in Manhattan. A verdict
was entered Oct. 19 for Macklowe, according to court records. 
Meadow Star alleged Macklowe company WH Rome Partners LLC
failed to put up its half of $1.2 billion to outbid SL Green
Realty Corp. (SLG) for the Reckson buildings, according to court
filings. SL Green paid $4.5 billion in cash and stock to buy all
of Reckson&#8217;s holdings. 
&#8220;A deal is a deal and Mr. Macklowe honored his obligations
under the language of the contract that these very sophisticated
parties had agreed to,&#8221; Netzer said Oct. 22 in a telephone
interview. Herbert Beigel, an attorney who represented Icahn&#8217;s
company at trial, declined to comment about the verdict. 
The aborted offer cost Icahn $60 million, according to his
complaint. Netzer said Macklowe&#8217;s half of the bid wasn&#8217;t
required unless certain conditions were met, including a signed
acquisition agreement with Reckson and a guarantee that the bid
wouldn&#8217;t exceed $1.2 billion. 
The case is Meadow Star LLC v. Harry Macklowe and WH Rome
Partners LLC, 08-603165, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). 
Abbott Said to Agree to Pay $1.3 Billion for Depakote Suits [bn:WBTKR=ABT:US]  
Abbott Laboratories (ABT) [] agreed to pay at least $1.3 billion to
settle claims by the U.S. government and 24 states alleging the
company illegally marketed its Depakote epilepsy drug, people
familiar with the accords said. 
Abbott executives, federal prosecutors and state officials
reached a tentative agreement calling for the drugmaker to pay
about $800 million to resolve civil claims over Depakote and
about $500 million in criminal penalties for marketing the
epilepsy medicine for unapproved uses, said three people
familiar with the settlement who declined to be identified
because the agreement hasn&#8217;t been made public. Abbott said last
week it was reserving $1.5 billion to cover costs of the
potential settlement. 
&#8220;Settlement negotiations are ongoing,&#8221; Scott Stoffel, a
spokesman for Abbott, said in a phone interview Oct. 21. He
declined to comment further. Charles Miller, a U.S. Justice
Department spokesman, had no comment on the settlement. 
The Abbott Park, Illinois-based company said Oct. 19 that
it will split next year, with one company selling medical
products and the other prescription medicines. Powered by
Humira, an anti-inflammatory with $6.5 billion in annual sales,
the new drugmaker may attract a bid from Merck  Co., Roche
Holding AG or Bayer AG, said Jeffrey Holford, a Jefferies Group
Inc. analyst. 
The settlement would be the third-largest illegal
pharmaceutical marketing accord in U.S. history, behind the $2.3
billion Pfizer paid in 2009 over the marketing of its Bextra
painkiller and other drugs and the $1.4 billion Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY)
paid the same year over sales of its Zyprexa anti-psychotic
medicine. 
The case is U.S. ex rel. McCoyd v. Abbott Laboratories,
1:07-cv-00081, U.S. District Court, Western District of Virginia
(Abingdon).

Markit to Settle Suit Against Former Employees 
Markit Group Ltd. agreed to settle a lawsuit against two
former employees in Singapore after they pledged not to compete
with the firm for one year. 
Zhibo Li, previously a vice-president of sales, and Shiyang
Cui, who was an associate vice-president, are permanently banned
from using or disclosing information obtained from Markit,
according to a filing with the Singapore High Court this month. 
Markit, a swap prices data provider, sued Li and Cui last
month, accusing them of breaching their employment contracts and
misusing the firm&#8217;s trade secrets to set up rival Fundamentrix
Pte. Li and Cui are also banned from soliciting clients of the
London-based company for one year. 
Caroline Lumley, a spokeswoman at Markit, declined to
comment Oct. 20 on the agreement. Both Li and Cui didn&#8217;t reply
to two e-mails seeking comment. 
The case is Markit Asia Pte.  Ors v Zhibo Li  Ors
S628/2011 in the Singapore High Court. 
News Corp. (NWSA) to Pay $4.8 Million to End Dowler Hacking Case 
News Corp.&#8217;s U.K. unit agreed to pay 3 million pounds ($4.8
million) to settle claims that its News of the World tabloid
hacked the mobile-phone messages of a murdered schoolgirl in
2002, hampering a police investigation. 
The deal -- the biggest payout by News Corp. since the
hacking scandal erupted -- includes a 2 million-pound payment to
the family of Milly Dowler and a 1 million-pound donation to
charity, London-based News International said Oct. 20. News
Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, 80, was personally involved in
the negotiations, a person familiar with the matter said last
month. 
&#8220;When I met with the Dowlers in July, I expressed how
deeply sorry I was for the hurt we had caused this family,&#8221;
Murdoch said in the statement, which indicated he would
personally pay the 1 million-pound charitable donation. &#8220;The
behavior that the News of the World exhibited towards the
Dowlers was abhorrent.&#8221; 
The settlement was confirmed by News Corp. the same day as
the New York-based company&#8217;s annual shareholder meeting in Los
Angeles. U.K. lawmaker Tom Watson, who is part of a government
probe of the scandal, said he would attend the meeting to speak
against the company&#8217;s management. The California Public
Employees&#8217; Retirement System and other large investor groups
have also taken stances aimed at loosening Murdoch&#8217;s control,
citing concerns about how the phone-hacking issue was handled. 
Reports in July that Dowler&#8217;s messages had been
intercepted, hampering a police search when she was still
missing, triggered a public outcry that led News Corp. to close
the 168-year-old tabloid and drop its 7.8 billion-pound bid for
full control of British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc. (BSY) The hacking
was previously thought to be limited to celebrities, athletes,
royalty and other public figures.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer-services provider, added $7 billion
to its share-buyback plan to boost per-share earnings and
investor returns. 
The addition brings the size of the repurchase program to
$12.2 billion, as IBM had $5.2 billion remaining of its previous
repurchase authorization, according to a statement from the
Armonk, New York-based company today. Last week, IBM said it had
bought back $11.5 billion of stock this year. 
&#8220;The buyback program, given their exceptional cash flow,
is one of the key elements of continuing to grow their
earnings&#8221; per share, said Louis Miscioscia, a Collins Stewart
analyst in Boston, who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the stock. 
Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is using buybacks as
he targets operating earnings of at least $20 a share by 2015,
up from $13.35 the company projects for this year. IBM has spent
more than $100 billion on dividends and buybacks since 2003, the
year Palmisano became the chairman. He has also increased
earnings by steering the company toward software and services. 
The company has said it plans to spend $50 billion on
buybacks through 2015. In the third quarter, the reduction in
share count contributed 18 cents to earnings of $3.28 a share,
which beat analysts&#8217; estimates. IBM ended the third quarter with
$11.3 billion in cash. 
Dividend Increases 
IBM also declared a quarterly dividend of 75 cents a share,
payable on Dec. 10. IBM has increased its dividend every year
for 16 years, bumping it to 75 cents in April. Since 2006, IBM
has bumped the dividend up by 10 cents each year, except for in
2009, when the increase was halved amid the recession. 
IBM fell 1 percent to $180.36 at the close in New York. The
shares have climbed 23 percent this year. 
The buyback extension is in line with IBM&#8217;s repurchase
strategy and was largely expected by investors, said Shebly Seyrafi, an analyst at FBN Securities in New York.

Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the
world&#8217;s largest brokerage, plans to adjust its compensation
structure to boost profitability, according to a person familiar
with the discussions. 
The new pay policies are set to go into effect in 2012,
said the person, who declined to be identified because
compensation decisions aren&#8217;t public. The New York-based firm is
raising the minimum amount of revenue a broker must generate to
avoid pay cuts to $300,000 from $250,000, the person said. 
The plan includes bonuses aimed at giving financial
advisers more incentives to bring in new clients and increase
lending to customers. The changes may bring down the division&#8217;s
compensation ratio as President Greg Fleming seeks to achieve
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman&#8217;s goal of a pretax profit
margin of more than 20 percent at the unit. 
&#8220;Greg Fleming is very focused on expense discipline,
expense management,&#8221; Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer
Ruth Porat said on a conference call last week. &#8220;What he&#8217;s
focused on is reducing the lower productivity FAs and that
brings with it some incremental cost savings as well.&#8221; 
Compensation costs amounted to 62 percent of the global
wealth management division&#8217;s net revenue in the first nine
months of the year, down from 63 percent in the same period of
2010. 
Brokers who produce less than $300,000 will receive a
payout of 20 percent of that revenue, instead of 32 percent or
34 percent, the person said. The average annualized revenue per
adviser in the third quarter was $747,000. The firm is also
changing the makeup and vesting schedule of bonuses for
employees who have been with the firm a minimum of five years. 
Reuters reported the pay changes earlier today. 
Advisers&#8217; Bonuses 
Financial advisers&#8217; bonuses based on revenue production
will be reduced by 1 percentage point across the board, the
person said. Brokers can earn as much as $442,500 under new
bonuses that pay as much as 0.40 percentage point on new client
assets and 0.50 percentage point on new mortgages and other
loans sold to customers, according to the person. 
Morgan Stanley bought a controlling interest in the joint
venture two years ago and has the option to buy the business
outright from Citigroup Inc. over the next three years. The
division, which Fleming took over in January, had 17,291
advisers and $1.56 trillion in client assets as of Sept. 30. 
The brokerage will operate with a &#8220;mid-teens&#8221; pretax
margin by the first half of 2013 &#8220;irrespective of the market,&#8221;
Fleming, 48, said today in an interview on Bloomberg Television
with Erik Schatzker. Rising equity markets and higher interest
rates may push the margin to 20 percent, he said.

Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the
world&#8217;s largest brokerage, will operate with a &#8220;mid-teens&#8221;
pretax margin by the first half of 2013 &#8220;irrespective of the
market,&#8221; according to Greg Fleming, president of the business. 
The brokerage can reach the 20 percent pretax profit-margin
target that Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman
has set for the unit, Fleming, 48, said today in an interview on
Bloomberg Television with Erik Schatzker. The division had a 10
percent margin in the first nine months of this year. 
&#8220;Eventually we&#8217;ll have a higher SP and higher interest
rates, and that will be the final piece to put us at and over 20
percent,&#8221; Fleming said. 
Investors are looking for an increase in profitability at
the brokerage joint venture, which Morgan Stanley bought a
controlling interest in two years ago. It has the option to buy
the business outright from Citigroup Inc. over the next three
years. The division, which Fleming took over in January, had
17,291 advisers and $1.56 trillion in client assets as of
Sept. 30. 
&#8220;In a Basel 3 world, with the capital standards changing
on some of the trading businesses, these activities are even
more valuable,&#8221; Fleming said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t think the market today
appreciates the business mix that we have and the earnings power
that it will generate going forward, but we&#8217;re willing to be
patient and continue to stay at it and continue to drive higher
margins and better results, and ultimately the market will
reward that.&#8221; 
Fee-Based Accounts 
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney will increase revenue in part
by raising the amount of assets in its fee-based advisory
consulting accounts, Fleming said. The firm&#8217;s goal is to more
than double those assets to $1 trillion during the next five
years, from $465 billion as of Sept. 30. 
Fleming said there are three &#8220;revenue drivers&#8221; and two
&#8220;expense levers&#8221; the brokerage can use to improve
profitability regardless of the market environment. Revenue from
deposits, lending and transaction and advisory services, along
with decreasing integration expenses and cost synergies, will
drive the margin improvement, according to a presentation by
Gorman in February. 
A 100-point change in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and a
50 basis-point change in the Fed Funds rate each would have
about a 1 percentage point effect on the brokerage&#8217;s pretax
profit margin, Gorman said in February.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) signed a deal with
Compal Electronics Inc. for tablets, mobile phones, e-readers
and other consumer devices running the Android or Chrome
platform. 
Specific details and financial terms of the agreement
weren&#8217;t disclosed other than a mention that the company will
receive royalties from Taipei-based Compal, Microsoft said in a
statement. 
Microsoft&#8217;s patent licensing business began when Marshall Phelps joined the Redmond, Washington-based software company in

billion dollar business at International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
Phelps was Microsoft&#8217;s Corporate Vice President and Deputy
General Counsel for Intellectual Property and Licensing until
his departure in 2010. 
The company began using litigation as part of its patent-
licensing strategy after Horacio Gutierrez took over management
of the company&#8217;s patent portfolio in 2006. 
In the Microsoft statement, Gutierrez said the licensing
agreement with Compal meant that more than half the companies in

Gigaset, a maker of cordless telephones, said in a
statement yesterday that several products in the AVM FRITZ!

The company is seeking money damages and an injunction
regarding the use of its technology. It also asked for a court
order for destruction of the allegedly infringing products. 
Phyton Sues Samyang in Germany Over Paclitaxel Production Patent 
Phyton Ltd.&#8217;s Phyton Biotech unit filed a patent-
infringement suit against Seoul&#8217;s Samyang Corp., according to a
company statement. 
The suit, filed in a German court, is related to a patent
for plant cell fermentation using cell lines derived from the
Taxus species to produce the paclitaxel compound. Taxus is the
family to which yew trees belong, and paclitaxel is used to
treat a variety of cancers. 
Phyton claims Samyang&#8217;s method of producing paclitaxel
infringed the patent. It asked the court to order Samyang to
halt its alleged infringement, and requested a ban on the sale
and use of Samyang&#8217;s paclitaxel in Germany. 
Phyton, based in San Antonio, is a global supplier of
paclitaxel and docetaxel, a related anti-cancer compound also
produced from yew trees.

Apple Tells German Cafe&#8217;s Logo Infringes Trademarks 
Apple Inc. (AAPL), maker of the iPod and iPad, has sent a cease-

Geek.com technology news website reported. 
Apfelkind cafe, which registered its mark in Munich in
June, was told its logo was confusingly similar to Cupertino,
California-based Apple, according to Geek.com. 
The cafe, which offers a family-oriented coffeehouse
setting with a playroom for kids, features apple-related foods
and drinks on its menu, such as apple blossom tea, Geek.com

McDonald&#8217;s Says Wonderful&#8217;s &#8216;W&#8217; Logo Infringes Arches Trademark 
McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD), the world&#8217;s largest restaurant chain, has
filed a second trademark infringement suit against Wonderful, a
Beijing restaurant, the WantChinatimes.com news website
reported. 
Since 2003 Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald&#8217;s has been
objecting to Wonderful&#8217;s logo, a red letter &#8220;W&#8221; on a yellow
background it says too closely resemble its &#8220;golden arches&#8221;
logo, according to the website. 
Earlier, China&#8217;s trademark appeal board said that despite
McDonald&#8217;s protests, the logo could be used for non-restaurant
purposes, WantChinatimes.com reported. 
McDonald&#8217;s argues in Beijing No. 1 People&#8217;s Court that the
restaurant&#8217;s application to register the mark was made in a
malicious fashion, the website reported. 
Registration Sought for &#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; Trademark 
Interest in the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; movement has led to several new
applications filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office,
according to that office&#8217;s trademark database. 
A resident of Los Angeles filed an application Oct. 6 to
register &#8220;Occupy D.C. 2012,&#8221; with the mark to be used on T-
shirts. 
An &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; application was filed Oct. 18 by
a resident of West Islip, New York. According to the
application, the mark would be used for beach bags, back packs,
overnight bags, umbrellas, bumper stickers and clothing. 
On Oct. 19 a resident of Powell, Ohio, filed an application
to register &#8220;Every Where I Go I Occupy.&#8221; That mark would be
used on T-shirts. 
As further evidence of the &#8220;Occupy&#8221; zeitgeist, Caf&#233;Press
Inc.&#8217;s website lists 99 pages of print-on-demand items the San
Mateo, California-based company says are related to the

Comcast Files Suit in Utah over &#8216;The Biggest Loser&#8217; Trademark 
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)&#8217;s Universal City Studios sued 14 Utah-based
companies and residents and another 50 unnamed defendants for
trademark infringement. 
The suit, filed Oct. 21 in federal court in Salt Lake City,
Utah, is related to &#8220;The Biggest Loser&#8221; trademark associated
with Comcast&#8217;s NBC unit&#8217;s television program by the same name. 
According to court papers, the defendants have made
unauthorized use of the trademark on www.premierfitnesscamp.com,
which is used to promote the weight-loss camp with which the
defendants are involved in what Universal calls a &#8220;tangled
web&#8221; of ownership and control. 
Universal claims it has suffered &#8220;great detriment and
injury&#8221; to its trademark, business, goodwill and profits. News
Corp (NWSA) is a co-plaintiff with Universal because of an agreement
sharing the rights to the mark, according to court papers. 
The company asked the court to bar further infringement of
its mark, and for awards of money damages, profits the
defendants realized as the result of their alleged infringement,
and attorney fees and litigation costs. 
Premier Fitness Camp didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an e-

China Isn&#8217;t Cutting Piracy Enough, Software Alliance Says 
China isn&#8217;t reducing software piracy quickly enough and the
government should aim to cut illegal use by 10 percentage points
in the next two years, according to a trade group that tracks
counterfeiting. 
The country will eventually surpass the U.S. to become the
industry&#8217;s largest source of piracy losses, Robert Holleyman,
chief executive officer of the Business Software Alliance, said
at a press conference in Beijing yesterday. He declined to
provide a more specific forecast. 
In China, almost four out of five programs in use are
pirated, the alliance said in its annual report in May. The
$7.78 billion commercial value of software pirated in China last
year was second only to the $9.52 billion lost in the U.S., the
report said. 
&#8220;We are seeing progress, but it&#8217;s not progress at the pace
we would have liked to have seen or anticipated,&#8221; Holleyman
told reporters. &#8220;Virtually everyone agrees, piracy in China is
higher than it should be.&#8221; 
China isn&#8217;t currently on pace to achieve a 10 percent age-
point reduction over the next two years, Holleyman said. 
Should that target be reached in four years, it would
result in creation of 250,000 industry jobs and generate $4
billion in tax revenue in China, Holleyman said. 
The percentage of software in China that is pirated dropped
to 78 percent last year, from 79 percent in 2009 and 92 percent
in 2003, according to the May report. While the proportion of
stolen software has declined, its value has increased as the
Chinese software market expands, the report said. 
Holleyman called on the country to update its copyright law
to provide for criminal offenses for piracy and said the country
wouldn&#8217;t see a significant decline in the practice unless it
takes that step. The group will &#8220;ramp up&#8221; lawsuits against
users of unlicensed software, he said, without giving details. 
China has said it increased enforcement of intellectual
property rights. Last year, Chinese courts ruled on 48,051 cases
of intellectual property rights violations, a gain of 33 percent
from the previous year, Wang Shengjun, president of the Supreme
People&#8217;s Court, said in a report to the National People&#8217;s
Congress on March 11. 
The value of pirated software worldwide rose 14 percent to
$58.8 billion in 2010, almost double the total in 2003,
according to the group. 
Members of the Washington-based Business Software Alliance
are some of the biggest software companies including Microsoft
Corp., Apple Inc. and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE)

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage 
Leesburg Claims Details of Smart Grid Contract Are Trade Secrets 
The city of Leesburg, Florida, has refused to release the
cost of a contract with General Electric Co. (GE) to own and operate
the city&#8217;s &#8220;smart grid&#8221; electrical grid system, Florida&#8217;s

The city is claiming the price and the details of the
bidding process are trade secrets, according to the newspaper. 
Leesburg Finance Director told the Sentinel that rate
payers needn&#8217;t worry that the project will cause power-delivery
problems because &#8220;as high-profile as GE is, they&#8217;re not going
to let this puppy fail.&#8221; 
City officials have said that once the contract with GE is
signed, the total price will be revealed, minus the specifics of
the bid, the Sentinel reported.

General Dynamics Corp. (GD), maker of
Gulfstream business jets and Abrams tanks, said third-quarter
profit rose 2.5 percent as sales of aircraft and combat vehicles
increased. 
Profit from continuing operations advanced to $665 million,
or $1.83 a share, from $649 million, or $1.70, the Falls Church,
Virginia-based company said today in a statement. Analysts had
predicted $1.77 a share, the average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. 
Chief Executive Officer Jay Johnson said today that he
forecasts full-year profit &#8220;at the high end&#8221; of the $7.15 to
$7.20 per share range. Analysts are forecasting $7.19 per share,
the average of 23 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
&#8220;As we plan for 2012, the defense market is shrouded by
the uncertainty&#8221; of Pentagon funding, Johnson said in an
earnings conference call. Congress has not yet approved a
Pentagon budget for fiscal year 2012, which started Oct. 1, and
a special congressional committee has been tasked with finding
ways to trim government spending by at least $1.2 trillion. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s clear that defense spending will be part of
addressing our nation&#8217;s economic problems,&#8221; Johnson said. &#8220;The
manner and degree to which cuts are made will dictate how they
impact our industry.&#8221; 
&#8216;Looks Resilient&#8217; 
Total sales declined 2 percent to $7.85 billion. General
Dynamics had about $2.16 billion in cash on hand for the quarter
ending July 3. 
&#8220;This was another good operating performance from General
Dynamics, with margins offsetting some top-line weakness,&#8221;
Robert Stallard, a New York-based analyst for RBC Capital
Markets, wrote in a note to clients today. &#8220;Gulfstream backlog
continues to grow, and it looks like the G650 is still on
track.&#8221; He has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on the stock. 
Sales at the Aerospace unit, the maker of Gulfstream jets,
rose 9.4 percent to $1.41 billion from $1.29 billion the year
before. Profit at the unit rose 9 percent to $217 million from
$199 million. 
General Dynamics&#8217; Gulfstream unit is adding new models as
demand for business jets starts to rebound, according to unit
President Larry Flynn. Gulfstream expects to boost deliveries
about 10 percent this year and more than 15 percent next year as
the long-range G650 enters service, Flynn said in a recent
interview. 
G650 Certification 
General Dynamics expects provisional certification for the
G650 in the &#8220;next several weeks,&#8221; Johnson said today. 
For the G280 jet, the company anticipates Israeli
certification by the end of the year. U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration certification is expected to slip into the first
part of 2012, according to Johnson. 
During the quarter the Aerospace unit received an order for
20 Gulfstream aircraft, worth $810 million, from Minsheng
Financial Leasing, a Chinese aviation leasing company. 
Sales at the Combat Systems unit, which manufactures Abrams
tanks and Stryker vehicles, rose 3.4 percent to $2.14 billion. 
Profit rose 2.6 percent to $319 million. General Dynamics
during the quarter was awarded $440 million for the technology
development phase of the U.S. Army&#8217;s new ground combat vehicle
program. 
Stryker Contract 
The Army also awarded General Dynamics $250 million to
produce 115 Stryker vehicles with a double V-shaped hull to
protect against roadside bombs, the company said in its earnings
statement today. 
In addition, General Dynamics received an order from the
Canadian government to upgrade the Canadian Army&#8217;s fleet of LAV
III combat vehicles. The order was valued at $1.05 billion. 
The Marine Systems and Information Systems and Technology
units had a decline in revenue and reported an increase in
profit. 
Revenue at the Marine Systems unit, which builds nuclear-
powered submarines and Navy destroyers, fell 4.6 percent to
$1.62 billion, while profit rose 2.4 percent to $173 million.
During the quarter, the unit received a $1.8 billion order from
the U.S. Navy for the engineering, design and construction of
two DDG-1000 destroyers, which are scheduled for delivery in
2015 and 2018. 
Information unit sales fell 9.2 percent to $2.68 billion
and profit rose 1.3 percent to $310 million, the company said in
its statement today. 
Two Acquisitions 
Johnson has said that acquisitions are &#8220;very important&#8221;
to General Dynamics, both to expand its current portfolio and to
fill gaps. 
General Dynamics on Sept. 30 completed the acquisition of
Vangent Holding Corp., the parent company of Vangent Inc., a
health-care information technology provider to the federal
government. The cash transaction was valued at about $960
million. 
It announced on Sept. 21 that it had bought privately held,
400-employee Metro Machine Corp., an East Coast surface-ship
repair company that supports the Navy&#8217;s fleet in Norfolk,
Virginia. The government approved the deal on Oct. 19. General
Dynamics did not disclose the value of the cash transaction. 
The company said it expects both acquisitions to be
&#8220;accretive&#8221; to the company&#8217;s earnings beginning in 2012. 
General Dynamics fell $1.37, or 2.1 percent, to $63.89.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is among
firms that could gain by buying part or all of MF Global
Holdings Ltd. (MF), said Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale
Securities LLC. 
&#8220;Goldman could benefit from MF Global&#8217;s plight,&#8221; Bove
said in a note today. &#8220;One might argue that Goldman is over
capitalized and that it has too much liquidity. Buying some or
all of MF Global might create the opportunity to make a windfall
profit.&#8221; 
MF Global, run by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jon Corzine, is exploring strategic options, including a potential
sale, after reporting its biggest quarterly loss ever and having
its credit ratings cut by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, a person
with knowledge of the matter said today. 
The firm needs to generate liquidity and find a partner
with excess capital and a &#8220;sizable&#8221; trading operation, Bove
said in a telephone interview. Goldman Sachs, which Corzine
helped run from 1994 to 1999, and Citigroup Inc., both based in
New York, would be &#8220;logical buyers,&#8221; he said. 
David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, and Danielle Romero-Apsilos at Citigroup declined to comment. 
Large deposit-taking banks may not want to buy MF Global
because they would have to set aside cash to back the futures
trades placed by the firm&#8217;s customers, said Allan Zavarro, the
former global head of futures trading for ABN Amro Bank NV.
Regulatory capital in the range of 6 percent to 10 percent of
client funds on deposit must be set aside by the broker or bank,
Zavarro said. 
Capital Allocation 
&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure the big banks would want a big futures
position on their books now because they have to allocate
regulatory capital to it,&#8221; he said in an Oct. 25 telephone
interview. As of Aug. 31, MF Global had $7.2 billion of customer
funds in segregated accounts, according to the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission. 
In 2008, MF Global sold $300 million in preferred shares
and notes to the public and as much as $300 million in equity-
linked securities to buyout firm JC Flowers  Co. to help repay
a $1.05 billion bridge loan. 
Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR), the investment bank founded by
former U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, might also
show interest in a deal with MF Global, Bove said. The firm is
advising MF Global on the review of its business, said a person
with knowledge of the matter today. Evercore may be interested
in providing advisory clients with the ability to raise funds
through a fixed-income trading platform, Bove said. 
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me at all if Evercore jumped up as a
company that was going to acquire them,&#8221; he said. Such a deal
might not resolve MF Global&#8217;s liquidity needs, he said. 
Evercore would more likely be interested in fee-based, low-
capital-intensive businesses, said Warren Gardiner, an analyst
for Ticonderoga Securities LLC. 
Dana Gorman, a spokesman for Evercore, declined to comment.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) raised holdings in the past year in the
London Metal Exchange, the 134-year old bourse that&#8217;s facing a
possible takeover. 
Goldman increased its stake in LME Holdings Ltd. by 330,000
ordinary shares to 1.23 million shares as of Sept. 26, according
to filings with the U.K.&#8217;s Companies House. JPMorgan owned
800,000 shares compared with 550,000 shares a year earlier,
while ScotiaMocatta transferred 30,000 shares in the period to
leave the company with no shares, the filings show. 
The LME, which handles 80 percent of global trade in metals
futures, told members last month that it would begin a process
that may lead to &#8220;an acceptable offer for the company being
received.&#8221; Any sale would take at least until the end of the
second quarter to complete, Martin Abbott, chief executive
officer, said earlier this month. The bourse operates London&#8217;s
last open-outcry transactions in which traders shout out orders. 
The exchange issues two share classes. Ordinary shares
confer ownership and 330,000 of them traded at 4.925 pounds
($7.89) in July, according to data on the bourse&#8217;s website. B
shares exchanged hands at 85.425 pounds on Sept. 27. Neither
shares trade on an exchange. 
LME spokeswoman Miriam Heywood declined to comment on the
latest holdings. Sophie Bullock, Goldman&#8217;s spokeswoman, declined
to comment. Kate Haywood, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to
comment.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson may struggle to reach his full-year
production target after rallying oil prices reduced the
company&#8217;s take from wells in Africa and output slumped in the
U.S. and Europe. 
Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest company by market value, needs
to boost production in the current quarter to the equivalent of
5 million barrels a day to meet the 4 percent growth target for
2011 that Tillerson set forth during a March presentation to
analysts in New York. 
The closest Exxon ever came to pumping that much crude and
natural gas was during the final three months of 2010, when
daily output reached 4.97 million barrels. Even with new wells
in Iraq and Russia adding to the company&#8217;s global production,
Tillerson may fall short of the mark, said Allen Good, an oil-
industry analyst at Morningstar Investment Services Inc. in
Chicago. 
&#8220;I&#8217;d be surprised if they hit that number,&#8221; Good said
during a telephone interview. &#8220;They&#8217;re having long-term trouble
growing oil volumes and I don&#8217;t see how they get to five&#8221;
million barrels a day. 
Exxon&#8217;s worldwide oil and gas production declined by 3.8
percent during the July-to-September period to the equivalent of
4.28 million barrels of crude a day, the Irving, Texas-based
company said yesterday in a statement. It was the lowest output
since the second quarter of last year and the largest decline
since 2008, according to Bloomberg data. 
Production Agreements 
When international crude prices rise, energy prospectors
such as Exxon receive a smaller portion of output from wells
governed by production-sharing contracts in countries like
Nigeria. In Africa, which accounts for more than one-fifth of
Exxon&#8217;s global crude supply, the company&#8217;s output tumbled 24
percent during the quarter, the biggest decline anywhere in the
world. 
In Europe, Exxon&#8217;s crude output dropped 16 percent,
according to a company statement. U.S. oil production from Exxon
wells declined by 5.8 percent. The company boosted crude output
in Asia by 7.3 percent to 806,000 barrels a day. 
Excluding the impacts of higher crude prices, asset sales
and quotas imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, Exxon&#8217;s output was unchanged from a year earlier,
David Rosenthal, the company&#8217;s vice president of investor
relations, said during a conference call with analysts
yesterday. 
Major Producer 
On that basis, Exxon may be able to meet its full-year
production forecast, he said during the call. In March, at the
company&#8217;s annual presentation to the investment community at the
New York Stock Exchange, Tillerson forecast production growth of
as much as 4 percent this year. 
Such a growth rate would translate into full-year average
daily output equivalent to 4.625 million barrels, compared with
4.447 in 2010, based on Bloomberg calculations. 
Exxon pumps about 3 percent of the world&#8217;s oil, producing
more than OPEC members such as Kuwait and Algeria, according to
International Energy Agency figures. The company&#8217;s $396 billion
market valuation exceeds the economic output of all but 22
nations. 
Exxon is outperforming its biggest rivals, advancing 12
percent since the end of last year. PetroChina Co. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), the second- and third-largest oil companies by
market value, have increased 2.2 percent and 10 percent,
respectively. 
Exxon abandoned a well in the Turkish sector of the Black
Sea during the third quarter that failed to find oil or gas,
Rosenthal said yesterday. The dry hole followed recent
exploration failures by the company in Brazil, where Exxon is
attempting to sell a 25 percent stake in an offshore prospect. 
Unconventional Prospects 
Tillerson is spending as much as $37 billion this year to
search for crude, erect gas-liquefaction plants and expand
refineries and chemical plants. The company spent $38 billion in
the past 16 months acquiring shale-rock formations and the
expertise to crack them as part of Tillerson&#8217;s move into so-
called unconventional prospects that require intensive drilling
techniques. 
Exxon also is counting on production increases from mega-
projects such as the Kearl oil-sands development in Canada, the
West Qurna oilfield in Iraq and Sakhalin-1, an offshore oil and
gas project in Russia&#8217;s Far East, said Douglas Ober, whose $1.6
billion under management includes Exxon shares at Adams Express
Co (ADX) and Petroleum  Resources Corp. (PEO) in Baltimore. 
Project Pipeline 
&#8220;They are probably going to fall a little short&#8221; of the
production target this year, said Ober, whose holdings include
1.6 million Exxon shares. &#8220;That said, they&#8217;ve got a bunch of
projects coming on stream in the next couple of years that will
add a lot to output. To expect them to keep having new projects
come online constantly is unrealistic.&#8221; 
Exxon&#8217;s output during the current quarter probably will get
a boost as the European winter begins and rising furnace use
increases demand for gas from Exxon-run fields in countries such
as the Netherlands, Morningstar&#8217;s Good said. European wells
account for 25 percent of the company&#8217;s worldwide gas
production.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, said net income exceeded $10
billion for a third consecutive quarter as rallying crude prices
more than made up for the biggest production decline in three
years. 
Oil and natural-gas production fell 3.8 percent to the
equivalent of 4.28 million barrels of crude a day, the largest
decline since the third quarter of 2008, according to Bloomberg
data. The drop was smaller than the double-digit production
shortfalls reported earlier this week by rivals such as BP Plc,
ConocoPhillips and Hess Corp. (HES) 
Third-quarter profit rose to $10.33 billion, or $2.13 a
share, from $7.35 billion, or $1.44, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said today in a Business Wire statement. The
per-share result was in line with the average estimate of 19
analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Sales rose 32 percent to $125
billion. 
&#8220;These guys keep pushing the oil out and selling it like
it&#8217;s going out of style,&#8221; Douglas Ober, who manages $1.6
billion at Adams Express Co. and Petroleum  Resources Corp. in
Baltimore. 
$10 Billion Streak 
The last time Exxon&#8217;s quarterly profits exceeded $10
billion for three consecutive periods was 2008, when Brent oil
touched an all-time record of $147.50 a barrel and the company
reaped $45.22 billion in full-year net income. So far this year,
Exxon shares have risen 12 percent, poised for the best annual
performance since 2007. 
Exxon&#8217;s 41 percent profit increase was the second-largest
among major international oil companies that have announced
third-quarter results. Only Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the world&#8217;s
third-largest energy company by market value behind Exxon and
PetroChina Co., boasted a larger jump, by doubling net income to
$7 billion. 
State-controlled PetroChina lifted third-quarter profit by
7.8 percent. BP Plc, owner of the Macondo well that erupted last
year and fouled the Gulf of Mexico with millions of barrels of
crude, posted a 3.6 percent decline in net income.
ConocoPhillips (COP), based in Houston, said third-quarter profit fell
14 percent. 
Rounding out the largest international oil companies,
Chevron Corp. and France&#8217;s Total SA are scheduled to announce
results tomorrow, followed by Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo
Brasileiro next month. 
Spending Plans 
Brent crude futures, the benchmark for two-thirds of the
world&#8217;s oil, jumped 46 percent during the July-through-September
period to average $112.09 a barrel. 
Exxon Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson plans to spend
as much as $37 billion this year to find untapped oil and gas
reserves, construct gas-export terminals and expand refineries
and chemical plants. In August, Tillerson signed a $3.2 billion
agreement with Russia&#8217;s state-controlled OAO Rosneft to drill
wells in the Black Sea and offshore Arctic. 
In exchange, Moscow-based Rosneft will be allowed to invest
in some deep-water Gulf of Mexico and onshore Texas prospects,
David Rosenthal, vice president for investor relations, said
today during a conference call with analysts. Exxon won&#8217;t swap
any assets with Rosneft, he said. 
Outlining Growth 
The Rosneft deal was Exxon&#8217;s biggest transaction since its
$34.9 billion acquisition last year of XTO Energy, a Fort Worth,
Texas-based natural-gas producer. Tillerson is using XTO&#8217;s
expertise in cracking open dense, gas-rich shale rock to access
previously-impenetrable geologic formations in Poland and
elsewhere. 
Exxon shares rose 1 percent to $81.88 at the closing of
trading in New York. The stock has 14 buy recommendations from
analysts, 11 holds and two sells. 
Exxon&#8217;s crude output fell 7.1 percent to 2.25 million
barrels a day, led by declines in Africa, the U.S. and Europe,
according to the statement. The company raised gas output in
Europe and the U.S. 
A well in the Turkish sector of the Black Sea that failed
to discover oil or gas has been plugged and abandoned, Exxon&#8217;s
Rosenthal said today. 
Exxon plans to begin drilling for oil in the Romanian
sector of the Black Sea next year and the Russian sector in
2014, Rosenthal said. 
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the company today increased its
estimate for the size of the column of oil-soaked rock
discovered in the Hadrian prospect to 1,000 feet (305 meters)
from a previous 750-foot estimate. The figure was revised after
additional drilling, Rosenthal said. In June, when the discovery
was announced, Exxon said the field probably holds the
equivalent of 700 million barrels of crude.

Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s El Segundo refinery
in California is conducting planned maintenance that may result
in flaring through tomorrow. 
The refinery may flare gases until 10 a.m. local time
tomorrow, according to a South Coast Air Quality Management

the facility,&#8221; Rod Spackman, a spokesman for the San Ramon,

repairs this weekend, a person with direct knowledge of the work
said Oct 26.

Chevron Corp. (CVX) reported its biggest
quarterly profit in three years, outperforming other major oil
companies, as rising crude prices and proceeds from the sale of
a refinery made up for a slump in production. 
Third-quarter net income more than doubled to $7.83
billion, or $3.92 a share, from $3.77 billion, or $1.87, a year
earlier, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a
statement today. Excluding a gain from the sale of a Welsh
refinery, the per-share result was 22 cents more than the
average of 19 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Chevron quit the European oil-refining market in August
when it sold the U.K. refinery and related assets to Valero
Energy Corp. (VLO), a transaction that accounted for $500 million of
third-quarter results. Production fell to the equivalent of 2.6
million barrels of oil a day, from 2.74 million for the same
period last year. Sales rose 30 percent to $64.4 billion. 
&#8220;They are benefiting from higher crude prices and
strategic asset sales,&#8221; Gianna Bern, president of Brookshire
Advisory  Research Inc., a Chicago-based risk-management
consultant to the energy industry. &#8220;I&#8217;d expect production to
bounce back in the near future.&#8221; 
Oil and natural-gas production was less than the 2.63
million barrels a day forecast by Paul Cheng, a New York-based
analyst at Barclays Plc. Two hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico,
maintenance work at oil installations and less production from
some overseas joint ventures hurt output, the company said. 
Chevron posted the largest year-on-year third-quarter
profit increase among major international oil producers that
have announced results. 
Other Results 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc&#8217;s 100 percent gain was the second-
largest, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp., which reported a 41
percent increase, and Total SA, which boosted profit by 13
percent. PetroChina Co. said net income rose 7.8 percent, while
BP Plc and ConocoPhillips saw profit decline. 
&#8220;Chevron is the strongest of the majors right now,&#8221; said
Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis
who rates the shares a &#8220;buy.&#8221; &#8220;Even with production coming in
a little lower than my expectations, they offset that with
pretty strong refining results.&#8221; 
Chevron was paid an average of $103 for each barrel of
crude produced outside the U.S. during the quarter, up 47
percent from $70 a year earlier, the company said. International
oil prices soared as growing demand bumped up against supply
constraints in Libya. Chevron gets 74 percent of its crude
outside the U.S., according to an Aug. 4 regulatory filing. 
Chevron rose less than 1 percent to close at $109.64 in New
York. The shares have gained 20 percent this year. 
Profit from oil and gas sales climbed 74 percent to $6.2
billion, the company said. Refining profits more than tripled to
$1.99 billion from $565 million. 
The proceeds from the sale of the Pembroke refinery in
Wales accounted for 22 cents a share in profit, Youngberg said.

Basis Capital Funds Management Ltd.,
an Australian hedge fund, filed a new lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) over the sale of securities known as Timberwolf
and Point Pleasant after a similar complaint was dismissed. 
The suit, filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan by Basis Capital&#8217;s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, accuses
New York-based Goldman Sachs of &#8220;knowingly making materially
false and misleading statements and omissions&#8221; in connection
with the securities. 
&#8220;Within weeks after BYAFM entered into these transactions,
they precipitously declined in value, as defendants knew and
intended they would,&#8221; Basis Capital said in the complaint. &#8220;As
a result, BYAFM lost more than $67 million plus consequential
damages.&#8221; 
A June 2010 lawsuit by Basis Capital over the securities
was dismissed this year by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in
Manhattan, who ruled the Australian fund couldn&#8217;t use U.S.
securities laws to pursue its claims against Goldman Sachs. 
Jones&#8217;s ruling followed a decision by the U.S. Supreme
Court last year in Morrison v. National Australia Bank. In that
decision, the high court said U.S. securities laws don&#8217;t apply
to the claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S. securities on
foreign exchanges. 
Not Misled 
Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Goldman
Sachs, said the U.S. bank acted appropriately and Basis Capital
wasn&#8217;t misled. 
&#8220;Basis and Goldman Sachs relied on the same data on the
underlying mortgages and both were well aware of the prevailing
global market conditions,&#8221; Naylor said in a phone interview
today. &#8220;Goldman Sachs was also an investor in Timberwolf
securities and lost several hundred million dollars.&#8221; 
The suit filed yesterday relates to Point Pleasant, a
collateralized debt obligation based on subprime residential
home mortgages, and two credit default swaps that referenced
securities from a similar CDO known as Timberwolf, Basis Capital
said in the lawsuit. 
Basis accuses Goldman Sachs of marketing new CDO
investments in early 2007, after the company had already
determined that the value of securities in that market &#8220;would
likely go into sharp decline in the near future,&#8221; and used the
new CDOs as a vehicle to short the market, the lawsuit says. 
Basis Capital said Goldman was formalizing its Timberwolf
deal with the fund during the same week that a Goldman Sachs
executive sent an e-mail describing the Timberwolf investment as
&#8220;one shi--y deal.&#8221; 
&#8216;Key Part&#8217; 
&#8220;The Point Pleasant and Timberwolf offerings were a key
part of this Goldman strategy, and provided a vehicle for
Goldman to unload its toxic inventory and to profit from the
decline in value of the very securities it was recommending that
its clients purchase.&#8221; 
Basis Capital is seeking to recover the $67 million and
$1 billion in punitive damages, according to the lawsuit. 
The case is Basis Yield Alpha Fund (Master), 652996/2011,
New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, added M. Michele Burns as an
independent director, expanding its board to 12 members and
adding a third woman to the board for the first time. 
Burns, 53, was chairman and chief executive officer of
Mercer, a unit of Marsh  McLennan Cos., until earlier this
month, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a statement today.
She was recently named to plan and design a new retirement
policy center for Marsh  McLennan, Goldman Sachs said. Her
election was effective yesterday. 
Chairman and CEO Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, has been seeking
new directors since H. Lee Scott, the former Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. (WMT) CEO, left Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board earlier this year and Brown
University President Ruth Simmons stepped off the board in May
2010. Goldman Sachs, which reported its second quarterly loss in
12 years as a public company this month, named Barnard College
President Debora L. Spar to the board in June. 
Burns and Spar join Lois D. Juliber, the former Colgate-
Palmolive Co. vice chairman who has served on the Goldman Sachs
board since March 2004, in making women represent one quarter of
the board&#8217;s members. Rival banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. each have two female
directors.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is winning
higher ratings from analysts than Apple Inc. (AAPL), the iPad maker
that doubled since its low last year, after the European debt
crisis battered the U.S. bank&#8217;s shares. 
The two companies are among 15 in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
1500 Composite where &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendations made up 85 percent
of analyst ratings and there were no &#8220;sells,&#8221; data compiled by
Bloomberg Rankings as of Oct. 24 show. Stocks with fewer than 15
analysts covering them were excluded. For JPMorgan, the total
was 89.5 percent, compared with 87.5 percent at Apple. 
JPMorgan shares are lagging behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index by 15 percentage points this year after investors sold
banks amid concern the European crisis would prompt losses.
Following its decline, no other financial institution in the
U.S. has more support from analysts. 
&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be beaten up,&#8221; Jeff Harte, a Chicago-based
financial analyst at Sandler O&#8217;Neill  Partners LP, said in a
telephone interview on Oct. 26. During the last financial crisis
in 2008, JPMorgan &#8220;capitalized on others&#8217; weakness.&#8221; 
JPMorgan, based in New York, topped Bank of America Corp.
as the biggest U.S. lender by assets as of Sept. 30 and posted
more trading revenue than any other Wall Street firm for the
fourth straight quarter. 
The company was profitable every quarter during 2007 and
2008 as the collapse of the subprime mortgage market prompted
$2.1 trillion in writedowns and losses at banks, brokerages and
other financial firms worldwide. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon bought Bear Stearns Cos. and the banking unit of
Washington Mutual Inc. amid the turmoil three years ago. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s Drop 
JPMorgan has retreated 13 percent since Dec. 31, while the
SP 500 posted a gain of 2.1 percent, turning positive for the
year yesterday for the first time since Aug. 3. The stock, which
had 34 &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings and four &#8220;holds&#8221; as of Oct. 24, is
beating its peers. The diversified financials group in the SP
500 has slumped 20 percent in 2011. 
&#8220;JPMorgan tends to be run more conservatively, which is
probably why it&#8217;s liked by its analysts,&#8221; Craig Hodges,
president of Dallas-based Hodges Capital Management Inc., who
oversees about $700 million, said in an Oct. 26 phone interview. 
Besides JPMorgan and Apple, the 15 companies include Google
Inc. (GOOG) and Halliburton Co. (HAL), according to Bloomberg data. The most-
favored stocks in the SP 500 beat the entire index since the
last bear market ended 2 1/2 years ago, the data show. They
returned 144 percent on average since March 9, 2009, versus 90
percent for the SP 500. Since the index peaked this year in
April, the 15 stocks have lagged behind, falling 3 percentage
points more than the measure.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), owner of the ABC
TV network and Disney Channel, will license a limited number of
its older TV shows to Amazon&#8217;s Prime streaming video service,
the world&#8217;s biggest Internet retailer said in a statement. 
Disney will license more than 800 episodes of such shows
as ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Lost&#8221; and &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; and &#8220;Phineas and

almost 13,000 episodes by early next year, he said. 
The newly licensed Disney content will be available on
more than 300 devices, including Amazon&#8217;s Kindle Fire, the
company said. The movies are only available to consumers who
pay $79 a year for Amazon&#8217;s Prime delivery service. Amazon
didn&#8217;t give terms for the agreement. 
Disney also extended its agreement with Netflix to add
older movies and TV shows for that service as well, according
to a separate statement. Episodes from Disney and ABC series
will be made available to Netflix 30 days after the final
episode of each season airs, according to that statement.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, plans to hire staff and be &#8220;physically
present&#8221; in West and central Africa&#8217;s French-speaking nations,
regional General Manager Simon Ouattara said. 
So far this year, the Redmond, Washington-based company has
placed employees in Burkina Faso, Gabon, Guinea, Benin and
Republic of Congo and plans to be present in all 17 Francophone
nations in the region, as well as Cape Verde and Sierra Leone,
Ouattara said in an interview in Abidjan, Ivory Coast&#8217;s
commercial capital, yesterday. 
Microsoft wants to &#8220;support our partners better by placing
the managers closer to them,&#8221; Victoria N&#8217;dee Uwadoka, marketing
manager for the region, wrote in an e-mailed response to
questions. &#8220;Our interest is basically to increase the business
opportunities for Microsoft and also for our partners,&#8221; she
said. 
Ouattara said Microsoft wants to take advantage of
investments other companies are making in the West African
nation, which is seeking to lure investment and boost growth
following a violent post-election crisis. 
&#8220;There is a mass of initiatives and projects in the
country at the moment, and a lot of companies are equipping
themselves again in software,&#8221; he said. 
Ivory Coast&#8217;s economy may contract 5.8 percent this year
after the crisis that was sparked by ex-leader Laurent Gbagbo&#8217;s
refusal to cede power to Alassane Ouattara after a November
election. Businesses shut their doors, banks closed their
branches and cocoa exports were largely halted in the world&#8217;s
biggest producer of the chocolate ingredient. 
In April, Gbagbo was captured in Abidjan and a month later,
Ouattara sworn in as leader. The economy may expand 8.5 percent
next year as cocoa exports and gold mining increases along with
spending on electricity and roads. 
Microsoft currently has offices in Senegal and Cameroon and
staff in the Democratic Republic of Congo, said the company&#8217;s
Ouattara, who is not related to the president.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s purchases of
Treasury securities in Brazil, where benchmark yields averaged
almost 12 percent this month, helped push the bank&#8217;s holdings in
South America&#8217;s biggest economy 40 percent higher in two months. 
Assets at JPMorgan&#8217;s Brazilian unit jumped to 22.5 billion
reais ($12.6 billion) as of Aug. 31 from 16.2 billion on June
30, Claudio Berquo, chief executive officer of the business,
said in an interview in Sao Paulo. About 4 percent is company
loans and most of the rest is Treasury securities, according to
the unit&#8217;s chief financial officer, Cristiano Almeida. 
The Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy of keeping its benchmark
interest rate near zero percent in the U.S. is pushing
investments offshore, said Richard Bove, a bank analyst at
Rochdale Securities LLC. Brazil&#8217;s real-denominated bonds
returned 14 percent in the past year, compared with the 7
percent average return in local currency terms on JPMorgan&#8217;s
government bond index for emerging markets. 
&#8220;We are having a wonderful year in Brazil, better than
planned,&#8221; Berquo, 50, said. 
Bond purchases by the New York-based bank contributed to a
46 percent jump in earnings from Brazil in the first eight
months of 2011, to 94.5 million reais, even after the bank
boosted expenses to continue investing in the country, according
to Almeida. 
Goldman Sachs 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. have also
targeted Brazil for a bigger share of their investments. New
York-based Goldman Sachs said earlier this year that Brazil was
one of three countries, along with China and India, where most
of its hiring efforts have been concentrated. Citigroup, also
based in New York, added more than 340 employees in Brazil in
the month of March alone. 
&#8220;U.S. banks have got to find growth somewhere, and they&#8217;re
not going to find it in the United States if the economy is
going to lope along at the current level,&#8221; said Bove, whose
company is based in Lutz, Florida. 
Loans to Brazilian companies represent a small percentage
of JPMorgan&#8217;s assets in the country because the bank has only
just started offering credit denominated in reais, Berquo said.
Dollar loans remain the majority of JPMorgan&#8217;s lending to
companies in the country, and those assets, which Berquo
declined to quantify, are booked in New York. 
The Brazilian unit had 952.9 million reais of loans
outstanding as of Sept. 11, about twice as much as the level in
December 2009, he said, adding that the bank&#8217;s goal is to lend
to the top 300 Brazilian firms with annual revenue above 1
billion reais. 
Room to Grow 
&#8220;We are already doing business with half of these
companies, but we still have a lot of room to grow,&#8221; he said. 
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will crimp the amount of credit
international banks are willing to lend Brazilian companies and
banks, Berquo said. &#8220;A lot of banks will cut credit to
Brazilian clients and the spreads are going to go up,&#8221; and that
trend may be an opportunity for JPMorgan to gain market share,
he said. 
As part of that effort, JPMorgan moved about 923 million
reais in capital into Brazil in September, and &#8220;we will bring
in as much as needed,&#8221; Berquo said. 
JPMorgan was the 23rd largest bank by capital in Brazil as
of June 30, with 1.7 billion reais, according to central bank
figures. Itau Unibanco Holding SA, the biggest, had 67.2 billion
reais. 
Oil and Gas 
&#8220;We want to finance the biggest oil and gas projects, the
infrastructure projects, we want to be a big credit bank in
Brazil,&#8221; Berquo said, adding that trade finance and export-
prepayment loans are also being targeted. 
&#8220;But we are also planning to start participating in the
local bond markets, which are open right now and more attractive
than international markets,&#8221; he said. 
JPMorgan hired Ricardo Leoni from Santander to head fixed
income in Brazil, and plans to bring on more people after the
end of the bonus season in February, Berquo said. JPMorgan has
more than doubled its headcount, to 750 employees from 339,
since Berquo came back from New York to head the Brazilian
operation at the end of 2009. 
The bank is also expanding in asset-management for larger
companies and institutional investors and has 40 people devoted
to the business so far. 
Last year, JPMorgan bought Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the
wealth-management company founded by former Brazilian central
bank Governor Arminio Fraga, for an undisclosed amount. The bank
also has a private-equity arm, One Equity Partners, to invest
JPMorgan&#8217;s own money. That business in Brazil is run by Veronica
Serra, the daughter of Jose Serra, who ran for the presidency
last year against Dilma Rousseff and lost. 
&#8220;We will keep growing in the asset-management business, in
private and corporate banking,&#8221; Berquo said, adding that the
plan is to reach 1,000 employees by the end of 2014.

(Corrects number of index members in eighth paragraph.) 
Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of top-seller Lipitor to help cushion
tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic versions reach
the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read said. 
Lipitor, which is Pfizer&#8217;s biggest product, loses U.S.
patent protection on Nov. 30. The New York-based company is
looking for ways to replace its $10.7 billion in annual revenue
as cheaper copies drive down prices. 
&#8220;There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace,&#8221; Read said today on a conference
call discussing third-quarter earnings. A nonprescription
version of Lipitor wouldn&#8217;t be available until at least 2013
because of the regulatory process to get it approved, he said. 
&#8220;We have no definitive evidence we can do it,&#8221; Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. 
The loss of Lipitor&#8217;s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said
yesterday in a report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the
top spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. 
&#8216;Rapid&#8217; Decline 
Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be &#8220;very rapid.&#8221; Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. &#8220;We believe it would be economically
important, but you have to look in the context of some of the
larger OTC brands,&#8221; he said. The company&#8217;s Advil and Centrum
nonprescription drugs generate $175 million to $250 million each
per quarter, Chief Financial Officer Frank D&#8217;Amelio said in the
interview. 
Pfizer increased 1.3 percent to $19.50 at 3:10 p.m. New
York time, while the other 29 companies in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average index fell. 
Divesting Units 
The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. 
The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor&#8217;s
prescription. 
Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) for $16.6 billion. 
Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. 
Pfizer reported third-quarter earnings today that beat the
average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg by 6 cents
a share, as increased sales overseas and favorable exchange
rates helped boost revenue. Profit excluding one-time items was
62 cents a share. 
Net income increased more than fourfold to $3.74 billion,
or 48 cents a share, from a year earlier when the company had
charges related to an acquisition and asbestos litigation,
Pfizer said in a statement.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) seeks a lien on
all of MF Global Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s assets and may have a lien on
its operating account balance of $26.6 million, the bank said. 
MF Global, which filed for bankruptcy with assets of $41
billion, has five operating accounts, all with JPMorgan. The
bank may have a lien on the entire balance because of so-called
setoff rights related to a credit line to MF Global where it
acts and agent and lender, the New York-based bank said in a
filing. 
&#8220;JPMorgan asserts, and the debtors admit, that &#8216;by virtue
of such setoff rights, such funds may be subject to liens in
favor of&#8217;&#8221; JPMorgan, it said. 
Lenders move to protect themselves after a bankruptcy
filing. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, made the statement in
an objection filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan today
to a cash management plan proposed by the company. Limits should
be placed on the company&#8217;s use of cash, it said. 
JPMorgan holds less than $80 million of the MF Global&#8217;s
debt, said Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-
based bank and acts as an agent to lenders for a $1.2 billion
credit line to MF Global Holdings and a $300 million credit line
to its broker-dealer unit. 
Protect Collateral 
JPMorgan seeks the on all of MF Global&#8217;s assets to protect
its collateral, including proceeds of potential lawsuits, as
well as reimbursement for its own legal fees in the bankruptcy,
it said in the filing. The bank also asked Bankruptcy Court
judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan to limit intercompany transfers
and order the company to deliver it a budget and full list of
its assets. MF Global has asked to have until Jan. 30 to report
a full list of its assets and debts. Glenn will hold a hearing
today beginning at 3 p.m. 
&#8220;Although JPMorgan is hopeful the debtors will be able to
generate meaningful recoveries for creditors, no one, including
the debtors, can predict whether, when and to what extent this
may actually occur,&#8221; lawyers from Simpson, Thacher  Bartlett
LLP wrote, representing the bank. 
JPMorgan said it won&#8217;t allow its collateral to backstop
payment of the administrative expenses for MF Global&#8217;s
bankruptcy.  MF Global asked for a carve-out for some of its
professionals of $4 million, which would apply if a
reorganization fails and there aren&#8217;t enough assets to pay for
the costs of liquidation. 
No Recovery Prediction 
MF Global&#8217;s request should be limited because the firm has
&#8220;no reliable basis for predicting the extent to which creditors
may expect to see a recovery here,&#8221; JPMorgan said in a filing
today in bankruptcy court. 
&#8220;There is a real risk that every dollar of cash collateral
spent as the debtors propose will be potentially lost&#8221; if the
request is granted, the bank said. 
MF Global filed the eighth-largest U.S. bankruptcy
yesterday, after failing to find a buyer over the weekend. The
New York-based futures broker suffered a ratings downgrade and
loss of customers after revealing it had investments related to
$6.3 billion in European sovereign debt, leading to the filing.
Regulators are investigating hundreds of millions of dollars
that may be missing from its client accounts, two people have
told Bloomberg News. 
MF Global drew almost all of a $1.2 billion credit line
that was amended last year to give it more liquidity, and its
broker-dealer unit has borrowed about $210 million of a $300
million secured credit line. JPMorgan Chase is the agent to
lenders who supplied credit for both loans. 
The bankruptcy case is MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF), 11-bk-
15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, separated responsibility for its capital markets
business into two groups, naming new heads for equity and debt. 
Andy O&#8217;Brien and Jim Casey will become co-heads of global
debt capital markets, a team combining debt capital markets and
leveraged finance, investment-banking chief Jeff Urwin said in
an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg. The two previously ran
syndicated and leveraged finance in North America together. 
Viswas Raghavan, formerly head of international capital
markets, will become global head of equity capital markets as
the bank combines its regional teams, according to the New York-
based lender. Raghavan will remain based in London. 
&#8220;Clients in all regions are facing similar issues and
increasingly are seeking access to capital outside their home
markets,&#8221; Urwin said. &#8220;Investors want to broaden the
geographic reach of their investments.&#8221; 
O&#8217;Brien and Casey are succeeding Therese Esperdy, who ran
global debt capital markets and is leaving to become co-head of
Asia Pacific investment banking with Todd Marin, who previously
ran the group alone, according to an Oct. 24 internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg. Esperdy and Marin will run JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank throughout Asia Pacific, except Japan, said the
memo from Urwin and Gaby Abdelnour, chairman and chief executive
officer for Asia Pacific. 
Best-Paid Bank 
JPMorgan, the most profitable U.S. bank, was the world&#8217;s
best-paid investment bank in 2010 in the Bloomberg 20 ranking of
advisers, with total fees of $4.14 billion. The bank also led
the field in fees from bond and equity issues. 
So far this year, JPMorgan ranks No. 1 among underwriters
in high-yield and high-grade debt and No. 2 behind Bank of
America Merrill Lynch in U.S. leveraged loans, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. 
O&#8217;Brien took the lead in pulling together a $20 billion,
unsecured loan to Dallas-based ATT Inc. in March-- one of the
largest unsecured corporate loans ever. The financing package
helped the bank land the deal advising the telecommunications
company&#8217;s $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG&#8217;s wireless
unit, T-Mobile USA.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest

The bank was testing a $3 fee in Georgia and northern

Morgan Stanley (MS) fell as much as 12
percent in New York trading, leading financial stocks lower on
concern a Greek referendum on Europe&#8217;s bailout plan will worsen
the region&#8217;s debt crisis. 
Morgan Stanley dropped $1.11, or 6.3 percent, to $16.53 at
10:37 a.m., the biggest decline in the 81-company Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index, which slid 2.3 percent. Citigroup
Inc. (C) fell 4.3 percent and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) decreased 4.1
percent. 
Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou plans to hold a
referendum after details of last week&#8217;s second bailout package
for Greece are approved. The move poses a threat to financial
stability in the euro region and increases the risk of a
&#8220;disorderly&#8221; default, Fitch Ratings said. 
&#8220;Macro uncertainty is certainly the word of the day,&#8221;
Thomas Brown, chief executive officer of Second Curve Capital
LLC, said on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In The Loop.&#8221; &#8220;There is
a lot of concern that the European solution is going to fall
apart and we&#8217;re going to have a global recession.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley has dropped 14 percent in the past two
trading days. Shares of the New York-based firm rallied 27
percent during the previous two weeks as the firm reported
earnings that beat analysts&#8217; estimates and said it had $2.1
billion of net exposure to the peripheral European countries. 
MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) became the first U.S. bank to
collapse under the weight of the crisis, filing for bankruptcy
yesterday after a $6.3 billion bet on European debt. 
Missing Funds 
U.S. regulators are investigating whether hundreds of
millions of dollars are missing from client accounts at MF
Global, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.
The firm was ordered by the enforcement division of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission to preserve records for the
review, one of the people said. 
EU leaders carved out a second aid package for Greece at a
summit in Brussels last month after Papandreou scraped together
parliamentary approval for the second round of austerity
measures in four months. Greece will receive 130 billion euros
($180 billion) in public funds plus a 50 percent writedown on
Greek debt, following a fully taxpayer-funded package of 110
billion euros extended in May 2010.

Tohru Sasaki, head of Japan rates and

chosen as a top currency fundamentals analyst in an annual
survey by J-Money, a Japanese financial magazine. 
Sasaki, who moved up from third place last year, was

strategist at Citigroup Inc. (C) in Tokyo. Minori Uchida, a senior
analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd., and Atsushi Kobayashi, head of foreign-exchange sales at BNP Paribas in
Tokyo, were tied for third. 
J-Money, previously known as the Japanese version of the
Euromoney magazine, based the ranking on an August survey of 797
institutional investors in the Tokyo foreign-exchange market.
The ranking was published in its Autumn 2011 edition. 
The top financial firms in terms of currency trading were
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, No. 1 for a sixth-straight year,

Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), the U.S. coal
producer that paid C$5.3 billion ($5.2 billion) for Western Coal
Corp. in April, fell 6.7 percent after forecasting fourth-
quarter profit that was lower than analysts&#8217; estimated. 
Net income will be $120 million to $150 million, or $1.91
to $2.39 a share, the Birmingham, Alabama-based company said in
a statement today. That compares with the $2.64-a-share average
of 18 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. 
Sales of hard-coking coal, which is used by steelmakers,
will be 2.1 million to 2.3 million tons in the quarter.
Production will be 2.2 million to 2.4 million tons, Walter said. 
Third-quarter net income fell 44 percent to $76.2 million,
or $1.21 a share, from $136.2 million, or $2.55. That beat the
$1.12 average of 17 analysts&#8217; estimates. 
Sales rose 49 percent to $690.1 million from $464.2
million. 
Walter dropped to $68.80 as of 6:29 p.m. in New York.

Total SA (FP) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) to become the first and only
Asian company in the top five, according to a list published by

firm&#8217;s financial performance in fiscal 2010 in asset worth,
revenue, profit and return on invested capital, the energy news

Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR), the energy explorer being acquired by
Vedanta Resources Plc (VED), was the fastest-growing Asian company on
the list, according to Platts. The firm was placed 120 in the
overall ranking. 
Apart from PetroChina, China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. (600028),
known as Sinopec, was the only other Asian company to rank in
the global top 10, the pricing service said. 
Britain&#8217;s BP Plc (BP/), Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), the Brazilian

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) paid
bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. about $438 million for
the defunct firm&#8217;s stake in 10 Virginia buildings, according to
a court filing. 
Lehman, which has said it expects enough votes by Nov. 4
to back a $65 billion liquidation plan, has been buttressing its
real estate to prepare for more sales. Last year it said it
would spend as much as $262.5 million to pay mortgages on the 10
office buildings it owns with partners in Rosslyn, Virginia, a
suburb of Washington. Lehman&#8217;s share of the investment was
$206 million and its partners&#8217; share was $56.5 million, it said. 
Yesterday&#8217;s filing disclosing the price followed an Oct. 31
statement that New York-based Goldman Sachs was the buyer of
Lehman&#8217;s stake. Lehman, also based in New York, may receive
another $10 million for the properties and other sums through
2015, it said in the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Manhattan. 
The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ),
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of Lipitor, its top-selling drug, to help
cushion tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic
versions reach the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
said. 
Lipitor loses U.S. patent protection on Nov. 30. The New
York-based company is looking for ways to replace its $10.7
billion in annual revenue as cheaper copies drive down prices. 
&#8220;There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace,&#8221; Read said yesterday in a
conference call discussing third-quarter earnings. 
A nonprescription version of Lipitor wouldn&#8217;t be available
until at least 2013 because of the regulatory process needed to
get it approved, he said. 
&#8220;We have no definitive evidence we can do it,&#8221; Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. 
The loss of Lipitor&#8217;s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said in
an Oct. 31 report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the top
spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. 
Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be &#8220;very rapid.&#8221; Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. 
&#8220;We believe it would be economically important, but you
have to look in the context of some of the larger OTC brands,&#8221;
he said. 
The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. 
The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor&#8217;s
prescription. 
Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. 
Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. 
AMD Loses Bid for Immediate Halt to S3 Patent Case Against Apple 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) failed to persuade a U.S. judge
to halt a patent dispute S3 Graphics Co. has against Apple Inc. (AAPL)
at the U.S. International Trade Commission, according to a
filing with the trade agency. 
AMD, a maker of chips for Apple computers, sued S3 last
month, claiming it owned the patents that S3 has asserted
against Apple. In an Oct. 28 filing with the ITC, S3 said the
federal judge denied a request for an immediate halt to the ITC
case. The commission is scheduled to release its final decision
on Nov. 15. 
The civil suit is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. v. S3
Graphics Co., 11-cv-965, U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware (Wilmington). 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Devices
with Image Processing Systems, 337-724, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington). 
Piramal Healthcare Settles Patent Litigation With Baxter 
Piramal Critical Care Inc., a unit of India&#8217;s Piramal
Healthcare Ltd. (PIHC), settled patent litigation related to Baxter
Healthcare Corp.&#8217;s Suprane inhaled anesthetic. 
Piramal didn&#8217;t disclose terms of the settlement in a
statement. Baxter filed the suit in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware, in 2009, accusing Minrad International Inc. of Orchard
Park, New York, of infringing patent 5,617,906. 
Baxter, based in Deerfield, Illinois, sued shortly after
Piramal said it would acquire Minrad. 
The case is Baxter Healthcare Corp. v. Minrad Inc., 1:09-

Trademark 
&#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; Draws Competing Trademark Applications 
Two competing applications have now been filed to register
&#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; as a trademark, according to the most
recent listings in database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. 
One group lists itself as &#8220;Occupy Wall Street,&#8221; and uses
a New York City address. According to its website, Occupy Wall
Street  is a &#8220;leaderless resistance movement with people of
many colors, genders and political persuasions.&#8221; 
The other applicant, Fer-Eng Investments LLC, lists an
address in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Vincent Ferraro of Fer-
Eng told Cable News Network that his company had no affiliation
with the movement and simply filed the application as a business
proposition. 
Both applications were filed Oct. 24. The California
applicant said the mark would be used mainly for clothing and
accessories such as T-shirts, backpacks and hats. 
The New York applicant seeks to register the mark for a
broader range of uses, including newsletters, periodicals, and
photo, audio, video and press &#8220;educational and entertaining
materials relating to Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement
in general.&#8221;  That application also seeks to register the mark
for clothing items such as t-shirts. 
The application from the California company doesn&#8217;t list an
attorney. The New York application was submitted on Occupy Wall
Street&#8217;s behalf by Wylie Stecklow, a New York attorney who does
criminal defense, immigration and plaintiffs personal injury
work, according to his website.

Copyright 
&#8216;Hello Dolly&#8217; Set Design Infringed, Copyright Holder Claims 
The holder of copyright to stage sets designed by the late
Oliver Smith sued a New Orleans costume and fabric shop for
copyright infringement. 
Smith, who died in 1994, was known for his innovative set
design for American Ballet Theater productions such as
&#8220;Rodeo,&#8221; &#8220;Fancy Free,&#8221; and &#8220;Swan Lake.&#8221; He also designed
the Broadway productions of &#8220;Hello Dolly,&#8221; &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;
and &#8220;Auntie Mame.&#8221; 
Rosaria Sinisi of Brooklyn, New York, is the inheritor of
the Smith copyrights, according to the complaint filed in
federal court in New Orleans. For a fee, she licenses the
copyrights for use in productions in the U.S, and abroad, she
said in the complaint. 
Broadway Bound Costumes Inc. of New Orleans bought a set
for a production of &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221; from a licensee, and used it
for a production of the musical at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux
Carre, in New Orleans&#8217; French Quarter in 2003 and has since
rented the set to productions in New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts, according to court papers. 
Sinisi claims that the New Orleans company never had the
right to use the design in any performance or to rent the set to
others using this design. She also accused Broadway Bound of
modifying the design without permission. 
As a result of the company&#8217;s actions, Sinisi said she&#8217;s
harmed and claims she will continue to sustain &#8220;substantial,
immediate and irreparable injury&#8221; without intervention by the
court. 
She asked the court to bar further infringement of her
copyright, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. 
Sinisi is represented by Jennifer Stierman Edwards and R.
Vaughn Cimini of Cimini  Associates of Metairie, Louisiana. 
The case is Sinisi v. Broadway Bound Costumes Inc., 2:11-
cv-02625-ILRL-ALC, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). 
First Infringement Notices Under New Law Hit New Zealand ISPS 
The first infringement notices have been received by
Internet service providers under New Zealand&#8217;s newest copyright
regime, the New Zealand Herald reported. 
To date, all notices were sent by the Recording Industry
Association of New Zealand, according to the newspaper. 
Most of the first batch of infringement notices were
related to unauthorized downloading of music by Rihanna, Lady
Gaga and the British musician Taio Cruz, according to the
newspaper. 
In many cases, teenage children of the Internet subscribers
did the unauthorized downloading, which meant that the
infringement notices are likely to be an unpleasant surprise to
recipients, the Herald reported. 
Taiwan Funeral Homes Become Music Copyright Enforcement Targets 
As part of growing efforts toward copyright enforcement,
nine infringement suits were filed against Taiwan funeral homes
in connection with the pre-recorded music they use at funerals,
the Voice of America reported. 
The funeral homes say they shouldn&#8217;t have to pay the $30
per service demanded by the music studios, according to VOA. 
The music is based on Buddhist chants and not protected by
copyright, VOA reported.

Manga Creator Says Copyright Change Will Damage His Industry 
Ken Akamatsu, creator of the &#8220;Negima&#8221; and &#8220;Love  Hina&#8221;
series of the Japanese comics known as &#8220;manga,&#8221; warned that
changes in Japan&#8217;s copyright law could destroy derivative self-
published works and diminish the entire Japanese comics
industry, AnimeNation reported. 
Japan is presently involved in regional trade-agreement
discussions involving nine other nations, aimed at making
copyright laws more uniform, according to AnimeNation. 
If Japan joins the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement
under discussion, a formal complaint from the content owner
would no longer be required to trigger infringement prosecution,
AnimeNation reported. 
Akamatsu, who operates the j-comi.jp website, posts, with
permission of the creators, derivative self-published works
alongside the originals, according to AnimeNation.

The New York Yankees will focus on
&#8220;pitching, pitching, pitching&#8221; as they seek to improve their
starting rotation and bullpen during the Major League Baseball
offseason, General Manager Brian Cashman said. 
Cashman said hitting isn&#8217;t a concern for New York, which
had a major league best 222 regular-season home runs this year
while ranking second to the Boston Red Sox in runs scored and
runs batted in. By contrast, Yankees pitchers combined for a
3.73 earned run average to rank 11th of 30 major league teams. 
&#8220;As we enter the process this winter, I don&#8217;t anticipate a
bat being of need at all,&#8221; Cashman told reporters on a
conference call yesterday. &#8220;Our main focus and efforts are
going to be to continue to support and reinforce the pitching
rotation and bullpen.&#8221; 
Cashman&#8217;s comments probably rule out attempts by the
Yankees to sign first basemen Albert Pujols or Prince Fielder,
the top sluggers in this year&#8217;s free agency class. 
Fielder ranked second in the majors during the regular
season with 120 runs batted in and was fifth with 38 home runs
for the Milwaukee Brewers, one more than Pujols had for the St.
Louis Cardinals. Curtis Granderson and Mark Teixeira of the
Yankees finished second and third in the majors with 41 and 39
home runs respectively. 
&#8220;Offense is not an issue that we&#8217;ll be focusing on,&#8221;
Cashman said. &#8220;It will be the pitching. I feel our offense is
very, very strong.&#8221; 
Free Agents 
C.J. Wilson, Mark Buehrle and Hiroki Kuroda are leading
pitchers entering free agency. 
Wilson finished the regular season with a 16-7 record and
2.94 ERA for the Texas Rangers, who lost the World Series in
seven games to the Cardinals. Buehrle went 13-9 with a 3.59 ERA
for the Chicago White Sox and the Los Angeles Dodgers&#8217; Kuroda
finished the year with a 13-16 mark and 3.07 ERA. 
The Yankees two days ago agreed to an extension with All-
Star pitcher CC Sabathia that could keep him in pinstripes
through the 2017 season. Locking in Sabathia was a key part of
the team&#8217;s strategy, Cashman said. 
&#8220;He&#8217;s certainly the most important piece as we entered
this process,&#8221; Cashman said. &#8220;CC provides us a lot of
security.&#8221; 
While the Yankees re-signed Sabathia, they had eight
players become free agents, including starting pitchers Bartolo Colon and Freddy Garcia, and catcher Jorge Posada, who has been
with the team since 1995. Free agents are allowed to sign with
any team starting at 12:01 a.m. tomorrow. 
Burnett to Stay 
A.J. Burnett will probably remain in the starting rotation
and New York is open to re-signing Colon and Garcia, Cashman
said. Burnett had a 5.15 ERA in the regular season this year to
rank 94th in the major leagues. 
The Yankees, who had an opening day payroll of about $202
million that was the highest in baseball, won the American
League East this year with a 97-65 record and fell in the first
round of the playoffs to the Detroit Tigers. 
Cashman yesterday signed a three-year contract extension.
The 44-year-old&#8217;s previous three-year, $6 million contract
expired two days ago. Financial terms of his new deal weren&#8217;t
disclosed. 
Cashman joined the Yankees in 1986 as a 19-year-old intern.
He was 31, baseball&#8217;s youngest general manager at the time, when
he took over from Bob Watson in February 1998, two years after
the Yankees won their first title in 18 years. 
In Cashman&#8217;s 14 seasons in the team&#8217;s front office, the
Yankees have won 11 AL East division titles and World Series
championships in 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2009. 
Cashman&#8217;s career winning percentage of .605 (1,369-895) is
the best of any major league general manager with at least five
seasons of experience since 1950.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) will try to introduce a
nonprescription form of Lipitor, its top-selling drug, to help
cushion tumbling sales of the cholesterol pill as generic
versions reach the market, Chief Executive Officer Ian Read
said. 
Lipitor loses U.S. patent protection on Nov. 30. The New
York-based company is looking for ways to replace its $10.7
billion in annual revenue as cheaper copies drive down prices. 
&#8220;There is an intent at some point to have an OTC version
of Lipitor in the marketplace,&#8221; Read said yesterday in a
conference call discussing third-quarter earnings. 
A nonprescription version of Lipitor wouldn&#8217;t be available
until at least 2013 because of the regulatory process needed to
get it approved, he said. 
&#8220;We have no definitive evidence we can do it,&#8221; Read said
in an interview. An over-the-counter version of Lipitor would be
the first of the statin cholesterol drugs on the market that
consumers could buy without a prescription. The medicine would
still compete with generic versions. 
The loss of Lipitor&#8217;s patent-protected revenue will drop
Pfizer from its place atop the pharmaceutical world, where it
leads all competitors in drug sales, EvaluatePharma Ltd. said in
an Oct. 31 report. In 2012, Paris-based Sanofi will hold the top
spot, followed by Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis AG, and
Pfizer in third, EvaluatePharma said. 
Read said the company expects the decline in Lipitor sales
to be &#8220;very rapid.&#8221; Revenue from the cholesterol drug will
fall by about half next year to $4.57 billion and to $3.17
billion in 2013, according to an average estimate by four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
Read declined to give a specific sales projection for over-
the-counter Lipitor. 
&#8220;We believe it would be economically important, but you
have to look in the context of some of the larger OTC brands,&#8221;
he said. 
The company is divesting its animal health and nutritional
units to focus on producing new, brand-name pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer will keep its generic drug business, which also oversees
sales abroad. 
The company has been examining an over-the-counter version
of Lipitor, a person familiar with the situation said in August.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration must determine if patients
can safely and effectively dose themselves without a doctor&#8217;s
prescription. 
Pfizer successfully took its allergy medicine, Zyrtec,
over-the-counter in 2008 before selling its consumer unit that
year to Johnson  Johnson for $16.6 billion. 
Along with trying to get an over-the-counter Lipitor to
market, the company has struck agreements with pharmacy benefit
management companies including Medco Health Solutions Inc. and
Express Scripts Inc. to sell brand-name Lipitor at a lower
price, Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., said in a note to clients on Oct. 30. The agreements are
mostly for customers who get their drugs by mail, he said. 
AMD Loses Bid for Immediate Halt to S3 Patent Case Against Apple 
Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) failed to persuade a U.S. judge
to halt a patent dispute S3 Graphics Co. has against Apple Inc. (AAPL)
at the U.S. International Trade Commission, according to a
filing with the trade agency. 
AMD, a maker of chips for Apple computers, sued S3 last
month, claiming it owned the patents that S3 has asserted
against Apple. In an Oct. 28 filing with the ITC, S3 said the
federal judge denied a request for an immediate halt to the ITC
case. The commission is scheduled to release its final decision
on Nov. 15. 
The civil suit is Advanced Micro Devices Inc. v. S3
Graphics Co., 11-cv-965, U.S. District Court for the District of
Delaware (Wilmington). 
The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Electronic Devices
with Image Processing Systems, 337-724, U.S. International Trade
Commission (Washington).

Trademark 
&#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; Draws Competing Trademark Applications 
Two competing applications have now been filed to register
&#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; as a trademark, according to the most
recent listings in database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office. 
One group lists itself as &#8220;Occupy Wall Street,&#8221; and uses
a New York City address. According to its website, Occupy Wall
Street  is a &#8220;leaderless resistance movement with people of
many colors, genders and political persuasions.&#8221; 
The other applicant, Fer-Eng Investments LLC, lists an
address in Rancho Santa Fe, California. Vincent Ferraro of Fer-
Eng told Cable News Network that his company had no affiliation
with the movement and simply filed the application as a business
proposition. 
Both applications were filed Oct. 24. The California
applicant said the mark would be used mainly for clothing and
accessories such as T-shirts, backpacks and hats. 
The New York applicant seeks to register the mark for a
broader range of uses, including newsletters, periodicals, and
photo, audio, video and press &#8220;educational and entertaining
materials relating to Occupy Wall Street and the Occupy movement
in general.&#8221;  That application also seeks to register the mark
for clothing items such as t-shirts. 
The application from the California company doesn&#8217;t list an
attorney. The New York application was submitted on Occupy Wall
Street&#8217;s behalf by Wylie Stecklow, a New York attorney who does
criminal defense, immigration and plaintiffs personal injury
work, according to his website.

Copyright 
&#8216;Hello Dolly&#8217; Set Design Infringed, Copyright Holder Claims 
The holder of copyright to stage sets designed by the late
Oliver Smith sued a New Orleans costume and fabric shop for
copyright infringement. 
Smith, who died in 1994, was known for his innovative set
design for American Ballet Theater productions such as
&#8220;Rodeo,&#8221; &#8220;Fancy Free,&#8221; and &#8220;Swan Lake.&#8221; He also designed
the Broadway productions of &#8220;Hello Dolly,&#8221; &#8220;West Side Story&#8221;
and &#8220;Auntie Mame.&#8221; 
Rosaria Sinisi of Brooklyn, New York, is the inheritor of
the Smith copyrights, according to the complaint filed in
federal court in New Orleans. For a fee, she licenses the
copyrights for use in productions in the U.S, and abroad, she
said in the complaint. 
Broadway Bound Costumes Inc. of New Orleans bought a set
for a production of &#8220;Hello Dolly&#8221; from a licensee, and used it
for a production of the musical at Le Petit Theatre du Vieux
Carre, in New Orleans&#8217; French Quarter in 2003 and has since
rented the set to productions in New York, Pennsylvania and
Massachusetts, according to court papers. 
Sinisi claims that the New Orleans company never had the
right to use the design in any performance or to rent the set to
others using this design. She also accused Broadway Bound of
modifying the design without permission. 
As a result of the company&#8217;s actions, Sinisi said she&#8217;s
harmed and claims she will continue to sustain &#8220;substantial,
immediate and irreparable injury&#8221; without intervention by the
court. 
She asked the court to bar further infringement of her
copyright, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees and
litigation costs. 
Sinisi is represented by Jennifer Stierman Edwards and R.
Vaughn Cimini of Cimini  Associates of Metairie, Louisiana. 
The case is Sinisi v. Broadway Bound Costumes Inc., 2:11-
cv-02625-ILRL-ALC, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). 
First Infringement Notices Under New Law Hit New Zealand ISPS 
The first infringement notices have been received by
Internet service providers under New Zealand&#8217;s newest copyright
regime, the New Zealand Herald reported. 
To date, all notices were sent by the Recording Industry
Association of New Zealand, according to the newspaper. 
Most of the first batch of infringement notices were
related to unauthorized downloading of music by Rihanna, Lady
Gaga and the British musician Taio Cruz, according to the
newspaper. 
In many cases, teenage children of the Internet subscribers
did the unauthorized downloading, which meant that the
infringement notices are likely to be an unpleasant surprise to
recipients, the Herald reported. 
Taiwan Funeral Homes Become Music Copyright Enforcement Targets 
As part of growing efforts toward copyright enforcement,
nine infringement suits were filed against Taiwan funeral homes
in connection with the pre-recorded music they use at funerals,
the Voice of America reported. 
The funeral homes say they shouldn&#8217;t have to pay the $30
per service demanded by the music studios, according to VOA. 
The music is based on Buddhist chants and not protected by
copyright, VOA reported. 
The five Taiwan music-collection management societies may
also begin demanding payment for live performances of music at
some funerals, according to VOA. 
Manga Creator Says Copyright Change Will Damage His Industry 
Ken Akamatsu, creator of the &#8220;Negima&#8221; and &#8220;Love  Hina&#8221;

Morgan Stanley (MS) won a narrowing of
claims in a lawsuit by Singapore investors who said the firm
induced them to buy synthetic collateralized debt obligations
that were designed to fail. 
U.S. District Judge Leonard Sand on Oct. 31 granted the
firm&#8217;s request to throw out the claims of negligent
misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment,
aiding and abetting. Sand, in New York, allowed other claims of
fraud and breach of good covenant and good faith to continue. 
Last year, a group of investors sued Morgan Stanley, the
sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, alleging it created
collateralized debt obligations -- a debt security usually
backed by bonds or corporate loans -- and failed to inform the
investors that it was a counter-party to the agreements. For
each dollar the investors lost, the bank gained a dollar, the
investors said. 
Sand said the plaintiffs &#8220;have pled what amounts to self-
dealing by Morgan Stanley, insofar as Morgan Stanley was betting
against, or &#8216;shorting&#8217; the synthetic CDOs that it had itself
created. The engineered frailty of the CDOs and Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
positions on both sides of the deal adequately alleges motive.&#8221; 
&#8216;Place on Guard&#8217; 
The judge said that New York-based Morgan Stanley hasn&#8217;t
proffered evidence to suggest that investors were &#8220;placed on
guard&#8221; and concluded the plaintiffs have shown sufficient
evidence that they acted reasonably in relying upon the firm&#8217;s
statements. 
&#8220;Even a sophisticated investor armed with a bevy of
accountants, financial advisers, and lawyers could not have
known that Morgan Stanley would select inherently risky
underlying assets and short them,&#8221; Sand said. 
Several Morgan Stanley units created the scheme to redirect
funds into the bank&#8217;s own coffers, the investors including the
Singapore Government Staff Credit Cooperative Society Ltd. said
in the complaint. 
The case is Dandong v. Pinnacle Performance Limited, 10-
CV-8086, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Buyout firms circling Regions
Financial Corp. (RF)&#8217;s Morgan Keegan brokerage unit lowered bids by
at least $200 million after financing markets deteriorated and
MF Global Holdings Ltd. filed for bankruptcy, according to
people with direct knowledge of the process. 
Thomas H. Lee Partners LP and Jeffrey Greenberg&#8217;s Aquiline
Capital Partners LLC submitted the highest offer at about $750
million, the people said, asking not to be named because the
talks are private. The group topped a joint bid from Carlyle
Group LP and Blackstone Group LP (BX), according to the people, who
said previous offers valued the unit at more than $1 billion. 
A deal hasn&#8217;t been reached and talks could fall apart as
Regions is pushing both groups to raise their price, the people
said. Regions, based in Birmingham, Alabama, has been planning
to use proceeds from the sale to boost capital and pay back a
$3.5 billion U.S. bailout. Regions has indicated it plans to
collect a $250 million dividend from Morgan Keegan prior to any
sale, increasing proceeds from the business, the people said. 
Evelyn Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Regions, declined to
comment on Morgan Keegan. Shares of the company rose 5 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $3.93 in New York trading at 1:39 p.m. They&#8217;ve
lost 44 percent this year. 
Regions is among the biggest U.S. banks that have yet to
repay the Treasury Department rescue. The company said in June
it was exploring options for Morgan Keegan, which provides
brokerage and investment-banking services. Founded with five
workers in 1969, the unit has more than 300 offices and 4,400
employees across the Southeast and Midwest, including Texas,
Missouri, Ohio, the Carolinas and Florida. 
Third-Quarter Profit 
Morgan Keegan agreed to be sold to Regions in 2000 for
about $789 million. The unit, based in Memphis, Tennessee, had a
$26 million third-quarter profit, Regions said on Oct. 25. That
was up from $22 million a year earlier and a decrease from $60
million in the second quarter. 
Regions Chief Executive Officer Grayson Hall, 54, told
investors in September that the Troubled Asset Relief Program
repayment would depend on achieving &#8220;sustainable profitability&#8221;
and an improvement in credit metrics, not just a successful
resolution of the review of Morgan Keegan. Regions, the 10th-
largest U.S. bank by deposits, has said it hired Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) to help examine options for the unit and find ways to
manage capital and increase shareholder value. 
Stifel Financial Corp. (SF), a brokerage based in St. Louis,
also bid for Morgan Keegan and was rejected, people with
knowledge of the matter said last month. Among the reasons was a
concern that Morgan Keegan executives and brokers, some of whom
opposed selling to a competitor, might quit before the purchase
was completed and jeopardize the deal, they said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon was targeted by protesters during a keynote
speech in Seattle last night, with activists picketing and
chanting &#8220;banks got bailed out, we got sold out.&#8221; 
More than 100 participants weathered pouring rain and
temperatures in the 40s to air frustrations as Dimon, 55,
addressed the University of Washington Foster School of
Business&#8217; annual business leadership dinner. 
At least three protesters said they were hit with pepper
spray as they tried to block entrances to a Sheraton hotel,
where the dinner was closed to the public. Activists held signs
that called for Dimon&#8217;s arrest and compared his hourly wage,
which they calculated at around $10,000, with about $23 for an
average worker. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re bringing to the surface the pent up
disappointment, anger, frustration and fear that the American
people has with the direction that the economy and country has
taken over the last decade,&#8221; said John Taylor, president and
CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a
Washington-based non-profit group that represents affordable
housing charities. 
Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for the New York-based bank,
declined to comment on the Seattle demonstrations. 
Occupy Wall Street activists have repeatedly targeted Dimon
as they protest income disparity, the influence of money on
politics and the use of taxpayer funds to rescue banks in 2008.
They marched from Wall Street in downtown New York to his home
on the upper East Side on Oct. 11. The route also included
demonstrations outside homes of News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch,
billionaire hedge fund manager John Paulson and Republican donor
David Koch. 
Avoided Losses 
Dimon, who runs the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,
saw his institution through the recession without posting a
quarterly loss. He has said that JPMorgan, which took $25
billion in money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, did so
only to encourage other banks to participate and shore up the
financial system, not because it needed the money. 
Boston, San Francisco, Washington and London are among
cities where rallies have been held to protest banks and their
executives. People are focusing lenders&#8217; role in creating the
housing crisis and the impact it had on the economy and
unemployment, said Taylor. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s not Jamie personally, it&#8217;s the institutions
themselves and what they are doing or not doing,&#8221; he said. 
&#8216;Do the Right Thing&#8217; 
More than 1,200 people signed an online petition last year
urging Syracuse University in New York to rescind Dimon&#8217;s
invitation as the commencement speaker. Dimon presented the
address, telling students to have the courage to speak the
truth, even when it&#8217;s unpopular. He told graduates to &#8220;do the
right thing, not the easy thing&#8221; and not to become someone
else&#8217;s &#8220;lapdog or sycophant.&#8221; 
Less than a dozen graduates protested in silence by
removing their caps and gowns during his speech. While Dimon
urged graduates to hold him and other CEOs accountable for their
actions, he warned against indiscriminately judging all
executives based on the failings of a few as &#8220;another form of
prejudice and ignorance.&#8221; 
&#8220;It&#8217;s okay for us at times to blame and be dissatisfied
with others and hold them responsible, but it&#8217;s not okay to
oversimplify and paint everyone with the same brush,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;It should not be acceptable to denigrate entire groups, not
all companies, not all CEOs, not all politicians, not all media,
not all students.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, said its traders lost money on 16 days in
the third quarter as turmoil in Europe roiled bond and equity
markets. 
The bank had 177 days of positive trading revenue in the
first nine months, including five days in which the gains
exceeded $200 million, according to a regulatory filing today by
New York-based JPMorgan. The biggest U.S. lenders have leaned on
trading operations this year to boost profit as results at
consumer-related businesses sagged. 
JPMorgan&#8217;s nine-month perfect trading record ended in the
second quarter with two days of losses, as concern rose that
Greece would default on its debt and U.S. lawmakers would fail
to raise the debt ceiling. In all, JPMorgan&#8217;s traders lost money
on 26 days during the past seven quarters. 
Trading revenue averaged $76 million a day during the first
nine months. Revenue at JPMorgan&#8217;s investment-banking unit,
which houses the trading desks, fell 13 percent from the second
quarter to $6.4 billion.

General Electric Co. (GE) officials told
U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter, in their first
meeting since he took the post, that they&#8217;ll keep pressing to
win congressional backing for an alternative F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter engine. 
David Joyce, chief executive officer of General Electric
Aviation, and other company officials met on Monday with Carter,
who became deputy defense secretary last month, according to GE
spokesman Rick Kennedy and Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman. 
The Pentagon in April told General Electric and partner
Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/) that it was ending the secondary engine
program for Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)&#8217;s F-35. Since then, the U.S.
House has included provisions in its version of the annual
defense authorization bill to revive the project, which GE and
Rolls-Royce plan to self-fund. The Obama administration opposes
the legislation, calling the second engine wasteful spending. 
The meeting took place at GE&#8217;s request, Whitman said in an
e-mailed statement. In his previous position as the Pentagon&#8217;s
acquisition chief, Carter terminated the second-engine project. 
Pratt  Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp. (UTX),
builds the primary engine for the F-35. 
GE Aviation leaders discussed &#8220;the GE/Rolls-Royce desire
to seek congressional approval to self-fund the F136 development
in 2012, a proposal which received overwhelming support in the
House Defense Authorization bill,&#8221; Kennedy said in an e-mailed
statement. The topic was part of an update on the General
Electric military engine fleet, Kennedy said. 
Pentagon Still Opposed 
Carter and GE officials agreed during the meeting to find
ways to enhance &#8220;work on leading edge engine technologies,&#8221;
Whitman said. The Pentagon&#8217;s position on scrapping the
development of the second F-35 engine is unchanged, according to
Whitman. 
&#8220;We believe it is just as important as ever to advocate
for the House DoD Authorization bill provision that preserves
the F136 engine and associated equipment, while authorizing GE
and Rolls Royce to self-fund the engine in 2012,&#8221; Kennedy said. 
The House legislation prohibits the Defense Department from
destroying or discarding the engines made by GE and Rolls Royce. 
General Electric and Rolls Royce proposed to self-fund the
development of the alternative engine for the rest of this year
and next year. That would cost more than $100 million, Kennedy
said in May. The company&#8217;s goal is to compete with primary
engine maker Pratt  Whitney starting in 2016, Kennedy said. 
Congress still has to approve the 2012 defense
authorization bill, which sets spending targets and military
policy. The House approved the bill in May and the Senate may
start debating its version of the bill as early as next week. 
The Senate Armed Services panel included a provision that
prohibits any government funds to be spent on the development of
a second engine for the F-35.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by
Louisiana&#8217;s pension fund for police, which said the bank&#8217;s
$88.3 million settlement with the U.S. Treasury Department
stemmed from a breach of fiduciary duty by its directors. 
The complaint, filed today in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan, follows an Aug. 25 announcement that the company
agreed to resolve alleged violations of international sanctions
programs including Cuban assets control and anti-terrorism
regulations. 
The Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System,
an investor in JPMorgan that provides retirement benefits for
full-time municipal police officers in Louisiana, accused the
current directors of the New York-based bank, including Chairman
Jamie Dimon, of &#8220;knowingly&#8221; allowing and rewarding violations
of Treasury Department programs. 
&#8220;The misconduct occurred, unchecked, under the defendants&#8217;
watch because of their complicity in the improprieties alleged
herein,&#8221; the pension fund said in the complaint. &#8220;Because of
its acquiescence in the scheme, JPMC&#8217;s board cannot be
disinterested and independent.&#8221; 
The Treasury said that JPMorgan, through its correspondent
banks, maintained prohibited financial transactions with
sanctioned entities in countries including Cuba and Iran. The
JPMorgan payment agreed upon by the Office of Foreign Assets
Control, known as OFAC, involves &#8220;egregious&#8221; violations for
five years, according to a Treasury Department statement. 
The OFAC enforcement action covers actions from December
2005 to March 2011 involving multiple violations of sanctions
programs, the Treasury Department said. The violations include
processing 1,711 wire transfers totaling $178.5 million from
December 2005 to March 2006 involving Cuban people and a trade
loan of
$2.9 million with a blocked affiliate to the Islamic Republic of
Iran Shipping Lines. 
OFAC said the $88.3 million payment from JPMorgan is based
on the bank&#8217;s cooperation, transaction review and the absence of
an OFAC notice or finding of violation during the five years of
the transactions. 
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages &#8220;caused by the
individual defendants&#8217; unlawful course of conduct and breaches
of fiduciary duty,&#8221; including costs to the company associated
with the settlement, remedial measures, damage to goodwill and
&#8220;increased regulatory scrutiny.&#8221; 
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. 
The case is Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement
System v. Dimon, 653083/2011, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) was sued by two
investors who claim the bank was &#8220;at the very center&#8221; of
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. 
The investors, Stephen and Leyla Hill, claim JPMorgan
should have been aware that Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities LLC was passing all the money he stole from customers
through a JPMorgan account known as the &#8220;703 Account.&#8221; They
seek to represent all investors who had money invested with
Madoff in December 2008, when he was arrested and the fraud
collapsed. He was convicted and sentenced to 150 years in
prison. 
&#8220;While numerous financial institutions enabled Madoff&#8217;s
fraud, JPMC was at the very center of that fraud, and thoroughly
complicit in it,&#8221; the Hills said in a complaint filed today in
Manhattan federal court. &#8220;JPMC could not perform even cursory
due diligence on Madoff or BLMIS without bumping up against
evidence of Madoff&#8217;s fraud.&#8221; 
The suit comes a week after a judge dismissed $19 billion
in claims by the trustee liquidating Madoff&#8217;s former firm. On
Nov. 1, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan ruled
that the trustee, Irving Picard, isn&#8217;t the legally appropriate
party to demand common-law damages on behalf of former Madoff
investors such as the Hills. 
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment on
the lawsuit. 
The case is: Hill v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-07961, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

General Motors Co. (GM), the U.S.
automaker trying to end losses in Europe, named the chief
executive officer of its German brand Adam Opel GmbH to head of
all of its European operations, effective Jan. 1. 
Karl-Friedrich Stracke becomes president of GM Europe,
replacing Nick Reilly, who will retire in March after a 37-year
career, the Detroit-based automaker said today in an e-mailed
statement. Stracke will retain the Opel post, GM said. 
GM is trying to stem losses in Europe that have totaled
$14.5 billion since 1999. The company&#8217;s European operations
earned $102 million before taxes and interest in the second
quarter following a first-quarter loss of $390 million,
including a writedown of goodwill. Without that cost, GM&#8217;s
European operations would have generated a first-quarter profit
of $5 million. 
&#8220;The main thing Stracke has to do stabilize Opel,&#8221; Jim Hall, principal of Birmingham, Michigan-based consulting firm
2953 Analytics Inc., said in a phone interview. &#8220;Opel is the
European-cost brand without the luxury of a premium nameplate to
offset their higher production costs.&#8221; 
Stracke, a 55-year-old German native, became head of Opel
in April as GM named Reilly, 61, the division&#8217;s supervisory
board chairman. The automaker opted to keep Opel in November
2009 after its emergence from U.S.-backed bankruptcy, backing
out of a German government-brokered agreement to sell the
majority of the unit to Canadian parts maker Magna International
Inc. (MG) and partner OAO Sberbank. 
Reilly &#8220;may just be tired, especially with the unmitigated
bizarreness that&#8217;s gone through GM Europe and all the proposed
sales of Opel to parties that didn&#8217;t speak the same language,&#8221;
Hall said. 
GM rose 1.7 percent to $24.01 at the close in New York. The
shares have slid 35 percent this year.

Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI), the largest
U.S. auto supplier, said it doesn&#8217;t expect to bid for the
interiors unit rival Visteon Corp. is said to be selling. 
Johnson Controls, which tried to buy Visteon&#8217;s interiors
and electronics units before that company emerged from
bankruptcy in 2010, won&#8217;t bid on the interiors business because
of the complexity of the unit&#8217;s joint ventures, Stephen Roell,
chief executive officer of Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls,
said today in an interview at Bloomberg&#8217;s New York headquarters. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not in active conversations at all with Visteon,&#8221;
Roell said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not in discussions. I don&#8217;t think, because
of the circumstances, that that will be something that we&#8217;ll
look at.&#8221; 
Visteon, a spinoff of Ford Motor Co. (F), is shopping its
lighting and interiors units to pare low-margin revenue and
focus operations on Asia, five people familiar with the sale
process said last month. Shanghai-based Yanfeng Visteon
Automotive Trim Systems Co., Visteon&#8217;s joint venture with SAIC
Motor Corp., is the most attractive part of the interiors
business, Roell said. 
Jim Fisher, a Visteon spokesman, declined comment on the
terms of its joint venture with SAIC. 
Visteon in June 2010 rejected a $1.25 billion offer from
Johnson Controls for its interiors and electronics units, saying
it would hurt Visteon&#8217;s creditors. 
Integrating Acquisitions 
Johnson Controls bought three companies for more than $1.2
billion to boost its automotive seating business since October
2010: Michel Thierry SA, a maker of seat fabric; C Rob
Hammerstein Group, a maker of metal seat frames; and Keiper and
Recaro Automotive. 
Roell said today the company is integrating those companies
into its operations and probably won&#8217;t make auto-related
acquisitions in the near-term. 
Johnson Controls received 49 percent of its $40.8 billion
in revenue in its fiscal 2011 from its auto-parts unit, which
makes seats and instrument panels. Johnson Controls also makes
car batteries and systems to manage building climate and
security. 
Johnson Controls rose 0.5 percent to $32.62 at the close in
New York. The shares have slid 15 percent this year. Visteon
fell 1 percent to $57.60.

A Morgan Stanley (MS) infrastructure fund
sold its 50 percent stake in Inversiones Grupo Saesa Ltda.,
Chile&#8217;s second-largest electricity distributor, to Alberta
Investment Management Corp. for an undisclosed amount. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s MSIP bought Saesa in July 2008 with
Ontario Teachers&#8217; Pension Plan. Teachers&#8217; will retain a 50
percent interest in Saesa after the sale, Morgan Stanley wrote
in a statement distributed by Business Wire today. 
&#8220;Our investment thesis for Saesa has been proven out, as
we worked with the management team to implement operational
changes and make additional investments that should allow Saesa
to continue its strong growth,&#8221; MSIP Chief Investment Officer
Sadek Wahba said in the statement. 
Chile needs to double electricity capacity this decade to
meet growing demand. President Sebastian Pinera aims to achieve
average annual economic growth of 6 percent over his four-year
term and shorten Chile&#8217;s path to becoming the region&#8217;s first
advanced nation. Electricity demand probably will grow on
average 6.7 percent through 2020, Energy Minister Rodrigo Alvarez said last month. 
Saesa operates 53,500 kilometers (33,000 miles) of
transmission and distribution lines and owns and operates about
190 megawatts of wind, hydro, diesel and gas electric-generating
capacity, according to today&#8217;s statement.

General Electric Co. (GE) filed a shelf
registration for the sale of about $20 billion in securities,
including stock and debt, to replace a three-year-old submission
that was expiring. 
A shelf registration allows companies to sell a specified
amount of securities for routine needs without having to
register each offering with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The filing from Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE
covers preferred and common shares as well as delayed delivery
contracts and guarantees. 
About $19.9 billion of the securities were unsold under a
registration statement initially filed in November 2008 and
updated on February 2010, according to the filing. About $1.7
million in securities were added today. 
The new registration replaces the 2008 filing, which was
expiring, said Kenny Juarez, a GE spokesman. 
Proceeds may be used for debt repayment, capital
expenditures and investment in subsidiaries or acquisitions, GE
said in the filing.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) raised $1.1
billion selling shares of Industrial  Commercial Bank of China (601398)
Ltd., trimming an investment first made in 2006 after the stock
posted its biggest monthly rally in 2 1/2 years. 
Goldman Sachs sold 1.75 billion ICBC shares at HK$4.88 (63
cents), two people with knowledge of the matter said, asking not
to be identified because the details are private. ICBC fell 7.1
percent to HK$4.82 at 10:06 a.m. in Hong Kong trading 
ICBC, the world&#8217;s largest bank by market value, jumped 28
percent in the month through yesterday&#8217;s close after the Chinese
government started buying shares in state-owned lenders that had
been pummeled by concern that bad loans may increase. Goldman
Sachs, which last month posted its second quarterly loss in 12
years, has made $2.65 billion on its ICBC stake since the fourth
quarter of 2006. 
&#8220;Goldman and most banks globally had a terrible third
quarter, so anything they can do to sort of salvage the year-
end&#8221; will help, John Wadle, head of research on banking at
Mirae Asset Securities (HK) Ltd., said in an interview with
Bloomberg Television today. 
Goldman Sachs, which relied on trading for 62 percent of
revenue so far this year, recorded losses from that business on
21 days in the third quarter, the most since the fourth quarter
of 2008, according to a quarterly filing. 
The amount of ICBC stock sold is smaller than the 2.4
billion shares Goldman Sachs offered, and the sale was priced at
the low end of the HK$4.88 to HK$5 offering range, according to
a term sheet obtained by Bloomberg News. The KBW Bank Index (BKX)
dropped 5.9 percent yesterday to 38.43, its steepest decline in
two months. 
Third Sale 
The deal was Goldman Sachs&#8217;s third sale of ICBC stock, an
investment it originally made in 2006 before the Chinese bank&#8217;s
initial public offering. Around that time, China allowed foreign
lenders to purchase pre-IPO stakes in state-owned banks after
about a decade spent bailing them out from bad debts. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, sold 3.04 billion ICBC
shares at HK$5.74 each in September last year, raising about
$2.25 billion. The Wall Street firm sold an almost $2 billion
stake in ICBC in June 2009, the maximum number of shares it was
free to divest at the time. 
ICBC President Yang Kaisheng said his bank understands and
respects Goldman Sachs&#8217;s decision to sell its shares. The sale
was to raise funds for internal &#8220;adjustments&#8221; Goldman Sachs is
undertaking, and isn&#8217;t a reflection of the New York-based bank&#8217;s
valuation of ICBC&#8217;s stock, Yang told reporters in Beijing
yesterday. 
&#8216;Modestly&#8217; Reducing 
&#8220;The value of our holding has appreciated considerably and
we have modestly reduced the size of our investment over time,
but we intend to remain a very significant long-term shareholder
in ICBC,&#8221; said Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs
in New York. Van Praag declined to comment on the size of the
sale. 
Goldman Sachs initially bought 4.9 percent of ICBC for
about $2.59 billion, according to a regulatory filing. The bank
booked a third-quarter loss of $1.05 billion on its investment
in ICBC, according to its Oct. 18 earnings report.

Credit-default swaps on the biggest
U.S. banks climbed as yields for Italy, the world&#8217;s third
biggest sovereign borrower, rose to euro era records and stoked
concern that Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis is accelerating. 
Contracts linked to the debt of Morgan Stanley jumped 34.1
basis points to 426.8 basis points and those tied to Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. (BAC) increased 30.4 to
377.4 as of 2:32 p.m. in New York, according to data provider
CMA. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) added 26 to 339 and a gauge of
U.S. corporate credit risk rose by the most since September. 
Traders pushed the contracts higher on concern that
Europe&#8217;s burgeoning debt crisis may infect bank balance sheets
worldwide. Yields on Italy&#8217;s $2.2 trillion of debt surged as
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi agreed to step down
after the approval of an austerity plan and a clearinghouse said
it will demand more money to back trades in the bonds, further
squeezing banks. 
&#8220;There is a risk of contagion that sits there in the
financial sector,&#8221; Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economic
research at Aladdin Capital Management LLC in Stamford,
Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;If we have a big
tumble here with Italy, it&#8217;s going to cause a very steep
recession in Europe and it will have ripples through interbank
markets.&#8221; 
Yields on Italian five-year notes rose above 7 percent for
the first time in the euro era. The yield on Italy&#8217;s 10-year
bond rose to 7.32 percent, and credit-default swaps on Italy&#8217;s
government bonds jumped to 562, CMA data show. 
Margins Raised 
LCH Clearnet SA raised the deposit factor charged for
Italian bonds due in seven to 10 years. The deposit requirement
will be raised to 11.65 percent, the French unit of LCH Clearnet
said in a document on its website dated yesterday. That compares
with a charge of 6.65 percent announced on Oct. 7. 
Clearing houses guarantee investors&#8217; trades are completed
by standing in the middle of two counterparties. They raise
margin requirements to protect themselves against losses if one
side of the trade fails. 
LCH raising margin requirements &#8220;really is not a good
sign,&#8221; according to MacDonald. &#8220;This is something that&#8217;s done
when people feel that the country or the other party at the
other end of the line cannot fund itself, so you&#8217;re beginning to
raise issues of liquidity,&#8221; he said. The drying up of liquidity
in international markets is &#8220;what gets dangerous,&#8221; MacDonald
said. &#8220;That&#8217;s a real problem. That impacts Main Street, and
that&#8217;s what you had in 2008.&#8221; 
MF Global Filing 
New York-based Morgan Stanley (MS) said last month it had $2.1
billion of net exposure in the peripheral European countries. 
Goldman Sachs said today that it had $4.16 billion of gross
funded exposure to governments, financial institutions and
companies in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain as of
Sept. 30, with Italy accounting for more than half. 
Concern over bets on European sovereign debt toppled New
York-based MF Global Inc. last month. The futures broker filed
for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 31 after a $6.3 billion bet on
the bonds of some of Europe&#8217;s most indebted nations prompted
regulator concerns and a credit rating downgrade. 
MF Global&#8217;s bankruptcy triggered an 18 percent slide in New
York-based Jefferies Group Inc. last week, as investors
speculated that the firm could be hurt by similar risks.
Jefferies has issued six statements this month detailing its
investments in European sovereign debt and said it cut both its
gross holdings in sovereign securities of Portugal, Italy,
Ireland, Greece and Spain by almost 50 percent since last week. 
Index Soars 
The firm&#8217;s $550 million of 6.875 percent senior unsecured
notes maturing in April 2021 fell 2.25 cents to 85.5 cents on
the dollar to yield 9.2 percent at 2:27 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. 
Credit-default swaps on Citigroup Inc. (C) added 27.9 basis
points to 257.9, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. Contracts tied to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s debt
increased 13 to 153.1, and those on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) added 13
to 153, the data show. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, increased 8.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 129.6 basis points as of 2:53 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. 
The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has increased
from 113.4 basis points on Oct. 27, the lowest level in more
than two months, on concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis is
spreading. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, had $2.32 billion of &#8220;funded&#8221;
credit exposure to Italy&#8217;s government, financial institutions
and companies as of Sept. 30. 
Hedges that offset those risks result in a net funded
exposure of $700 million, the New York-based company said in a
quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
today. &#8220;Substantially all&#8221; of the hedges are purchased from
investment-grade counterparties based outside of Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain, Goldman Sachs said. 
Italian stocks and bonds fell today on concern Prime
Minister Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s offer to resign won&#8217;t be enough to
contain the turmoil in a nation with the euro-region&#8217;s second-
biggest debt. Concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would spark bank
losses contributed to a 19 percent tumble in the 843-company
Bloomberg World Financial Index this year. 
Goldman Sachs said Italy accounted for more than half of
the $4.16 billion of gross funded exposure the firm had to the
five European countries on Sept. 30, and less than half of the
$2.46 billion in net funded exposure to those nations, according
to the filing. The company also has $750 million of unfunded
lending commitments to borrowers in the five countries, the
filing shows. 
Morgan Stanley (MS) 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s net funded exposure tied to Italy was
$1.79 billion at the end of September, accounting for most of
the $2.11 billion total from the five countries, the New York-
based firm said in a presentation last month. The nations
represented $5.69 billion in exposure before hedges, with risks
linked to Italy of $4.58 billion. 
Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s &#8220;net current funded exposure&#8221; tied to the
five countries was $7.2 billion at the end of September, more
than three times the exposure to Belgium and France, the New
York-based bank said last week in a filing. Total cross-border
claims linked to Italy were $14.5 billion. The company said the
risk of loss associated with the exposure &#8220;is likely materially
lower&#8221; than the amount disclosed. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s exposure to Italy from trading,
lending and securities available for sale was $11.3 billion as
of Sept. 30, the New York-based company said last week in a
filing. Net exposure including hedging and collateral was $5.5
billion. 
JPMorgan Chase 
Net exposure to Italy&#8217;s sovereign debt was $2.4 billion at
the end of the third quarter, more than half the $4.5 billion of
net sovereign exposure it had to the five countries. JPMorgan&#8217;s
credit-default swaps on the debt were bought from counterparties
based outside those countries and are either investment grade or
are &#8220;well-supported by collateral arrangements,&#8221; JPMorgan said. 
Bank of America Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s non-U.S. exposure linked to Italy
was $6.54 billion at the end of September, almost 45 percent of
the total linked to the five European countries, the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based lender said Nov. 3. 
Of that total, $1.5 billion is in sovereign risk, most of
which is hedged by credit-default protection, the bank said. 
Morgan Stanley fell 6.6 percent in New York trading at
10:39 a.m., the biggest decline among the largest U.S. banks.
The drop was 5.5 percent at Citigroup, 5.3 percent at Goldman
Sachs, and 4.5 percent at JPMorgan. Bank of America lost 3.3
percent.

Oil prices may be &#8220;significantly
higher&#8221; if supplies from Iran are disrupted following a United
Nations report on the country&#8217;s nuclear plans, according to
Morgan Stanley (MS) analysts. 
&#8220;While shut-in Iranian production is certainly not our
base case, we highlight the upside risk to our price forecasts
if tensions flare to the point of conflict,&#8221; analysts including
Hussein Allidina in New York said in a report yesterday. 
It&#8217;s unlikely that there will be a &#8220;significant supply
disruption,&#8221; according to the analysts, and there will be
&#8220;little lasting impact on crude prices.&#8221; 
Iran produces 3.6 million barrels a day of oil, about 5
percent of the world&#8217;s total, the analysts said. About 2 million
barrels a day were exported to countries such as Japan, Korea
and Italy. 
Iran carried out &#8220;work on the development of an indigenous
design of a nuclear weapon including the testing of
components,&#8221; the International Atomic Energy Agency, based in
Vienna, said yesterday. 
Crude oil for December delivery rose $1.28, or 1.3 percent,
to $96.80 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
yesterday, the highest settlement since July 28. Prices fell
$1.22 to $95.58 at 9:07 a.m. in New York.

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-biggest U.S. shopping-mall owner, said funds from
operations excluding some items rose 0.4 percent in the third
quarter as occupancy in its regional malls increased. 
The company&#8217;s &#8220;core&#8221; FFO climbed to $224.2 million, or 23
cents a share, from $223.2 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier,
the Chicago-based real estate investment trust said in a
statement today. General Growth&#8217;s forecast for full-year core
FFO beat analyst estimates. FFO is a measure of a property
owner&#8217;s ability to generate cash. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection a year
ago, is refinancing debt to lower expenses and plans to
redevelop, expand and refurbish shopping centers to boost
growth. Last month, the company said it sold Faneuil Hall
Marketplace in Boston, the office and garage components of
Westlake Center in Seattle and a shopping center in Provo, Utah,
as it focuses on its regional malls. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s still a story of debt refinancing and pushing out
maturities and figuring out the whole portfolio,&#8221; Craig Guttenplan, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. in London, said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;Fundamentals are improving versus the
prior year.&#8221; 
In August, General Growth said it would spin off 30 of its
malls to shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse Properties Inc. 
Full-Year Forecast 
General Growth forecast core FFO of 93 cents to 95 cents a
share for the full year. Analysts projected full-year FFO of 90
cents a share, the average of 11 estimates in a Bloomberg
survey. 
The core FFO excludes items such as discontinued operations
and costs related to debt retirement. Net income was $252
million, or 26 cents a share, compared with a loss of $231
million, or 69 cents, a year earlier. 
General Growth said occupancy in its regional malls rose to
92.7 percent in the quarter and initial rent on leases completed
in 2011 increased 6.7 percent to $63.71. Comparable sales by its
tenants gained 7.8 percent to $471 a square foot. 
The company is among landlords who are increasing rents on
new leases as sales by its tenants rise. U.S. retail purchases
climbed 1.1 percent in September, the most in seven months,
Commerce Department data showed. 
General Growth announced earnings before the start of
regular U.S. trading. Its shares rose 2.2 percent to $14.83
yesterday in New York. 
Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), the only U.S. mall owner larger
than General Growth, on Oct. 25 reported third-quarter results
that beat analysts&#8217; estimates and raised its full-year forecast
as income from rents rose. Simon, based in Indianapolis, also
boosted its quarterly dividend to 90 cents a share, a 12.5
percent increase.

The figures don&#8217;t include offsetting hedges and collateral,
the New York-based bank said today in a 10Q filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The amount is &#8220;primarily comprised&#8221; of loans to a
clearinghouse that are secured by collateral, Goldman Sachs
said. Cross-border outstandings include cash, receivables, cash
financial instruments and repurchase agreements. They exclude
derivative instruments and commitments, the bank said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, raised its estimate of &#8220;reasonably
possible&#8221; losses from legal claims by 30 percent in the third
quarter. 
The estimate rose to $2.6 billion as of Sept. 30 from $2
billion on June 30, the New York-based company said in its
quarterly filing today with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
Banks started releasing estimates of possible losses after
the SEC told corporate finance chiefs in October 2010 that they
should disclose such costs &#8220;when there is at least a reasonable
possibility&#8221; that they may be incurred, even if the risk is too
low to require reserves. 
The estimate, the fourth of its kind made by Goldman Sachs,
is the &#8220;upper end&#8221; of losses in matters where the risk is
&#8220;more than remote but less than likely,&#8221; the firm said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
relied on trading for 62 percent of revenue so far this year,
recorded losses from that business on 21 days in the third
quarter, the most since the fourth quarter of 2008. 
The firm&#8217;s traders lost more than $100 million on one of
the days, according to the New York-based company&#8217;s quarterly
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They
produced more than $100 million on nine days out of 64 total
days in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, the filing showed. 
Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, last
month reported its second quarterly loss as a public company as
it marked down the value of investments the firm had made with
its own money. The bank, which sustained a 22 percent drop in
client-trading revenue in the first nine months of this year,
has said it plans to cut about 1,000 jobs this year. 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
this week that its traders lost money on 31 days during the
quarter. Traders at JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp., the two biggest U.S. banks, lost money on 16 days and 20
days respectively, according to company filings last week. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s traders lost money on 15 days during the
second quarter and on a single day in the first quarter,
according to company reports. Goldman Sachs recorded zero
trading losses in the first quarter of 2010, the only such
perfect quarter in the firm&#8217;s history. 
Trading losses exceeded Goldman Sachs&#8217;s value-at-risk
limit, a measure of how much the company estimates it could lose
in the securities markets in one day, on one occasion during the
quarter. Average daily value-at-risk was $102 million in the
quarter.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will get a $20 million fee
for advising El Paso Corp. (EP) if the pipeline company completes a
planned $21 billion sale to Kinder Morgan Inc. 
Goldman Sachs is the second-largest shareholder of Kinder
Morgan and has two directors on the Houston-based pipeline
company&#8217;s board. Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t take part in negotiations
with Kinder Morgan or express an opinion on the deal price,
Kinder Morgan said today in a regulatory filing. 
Goldman Sachs had been advising Houston-based El Paso on an
unrelated plan to spin off the company&#8217;s exploration and
production division when Kinder Morgan made an unsolicited
offer, Kinder Morgan said. Goldman Sachs collected $5 million
for that work and would have gotten another $25 million if the
spinoff had been completed, Kinder Morgan said. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s private-equity arm invested alongside
Kinder Morgan Chief Executive Officer Richard Kinder to take his
company private in a 2007 leveraged buyout, and the New York-
based investment bank retains a stake after an initial public
offering this year. Goldman Sachs directors on the Kinder Morgan
board, Henry Cornell and Kenneth Pontarelli, didn&#8217;t take part in
discussions about the El Paso offer, Kinder Morgan said. 
Morgan Stanley (MS) advised El Paso on negotiations with Kinder
Morgan and gave an opinion that the sale price was fair. The
bank may collect a total of $35 million for its advice if the
deal is completed, Kinder Morgan said. 
Kinder Morgan&#8217;s financial advisers, Evercore Partners Inc.
and Barclays Plc (BARC), will get a total of $15 million each if the
acquisition is completed, Kinder Morgan said. 
Andrea Rachman, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to
comment.

Goldman Sachs&#8217;s New Zealand unit forecast the country&#8217;s

a previous projection of 74 cents. The six-month forecast for

Morgan Stanley (MS) and two mortgage-
servicing companies reached agreements with New York&#8217;s banking
regulator intended to reform their foreclosure practices. 
Morgan Stanley, American Home Mortgage Servicing Inc. and
Vericrest Financial Inc. agreed to mortgage-servicing changes
aimed at &#8220;troublesome and unlawful practices that have
plagued&#8221; the industry, the Department of Financial Services
said in a statement today. 
The changes include ending the practice of referring a
borrower to foreclosure while the homeowner is pursuing a loan
modification, and stopping so-called robosigning, in which
foreclosure documents are signed without verification of the
facts, according to the statement. 
Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, said in an e-mail that the company is pleased to
have reached the accord with the state regulator. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Saxon Mortgage Services Inc. is also
included in the agreements, according to the Department of
Financial Services. Morgan Stanley has agreed to sell Saxon to
Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) 
`Best Practices'     
American Home spokeswoman Philippa Brown said the Coppell,
Texas-based company supports efforts to establish best practices
for residential mortgage servicers. 
&#8220;Industrywide standards are essential to assure accuracy,
speed and fairness as we work with borrowers who are struggling
to make mortgage payments,&#8221; she said in an e-mailed statement. 
A representative of Oklahoma City-based Vericrest couldn&#8217;t
be reached for comment. 
The deals announced today don&#8217;t preclude investigations of
past practices or release any claims, the Department of
Financial Services said. The department previously reached
mortgage-servicing agreements with Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
Goldman Sachs Bank, Ocwen Financial and Litton Loan Servicing.

Morgan Stanley (MS) Smith Barney, the

markdowns on bond transactions. 
The firm was also ordered to pay $371,000 in restitution

General Motors Co. (GM), the biggest U.S.
automaker, is &#8220;optimistic&#8221; about Europe as the manufacturer
shifts marketing of the Chevrolet brand in the region to its
Asian and Middle Eastern unit. 
The General Motors International Operations unit, which
already sells GM&#8217;s brands including Chevrolet outside the
Americas and central and western Europe, will take on the new
market as of Jan. 1, Tim Lee, president of the division, said in
an interview in Dubai. 
GM&#8217;s global third-quarter profit fell 2.5 percent and the
Detroit-based carmaker abandoned a goal yesterday of breaking
even this year in Europe, where it makes Opel and Vauxhall
models, as economic conditions in the region deteriorate. Lee&#8217;s
GMIO unit was the automaker&#8217;s only business outside North
America to report a profit in the quarter, in contrast to losses
at GM Europe and in South America. 
&#8220;I am very optimistic that between the divisions --
Chevrolet, Opel and Vauxhall -- we can find good synergies and
improve our business conditions,&#8221; Lee said. 
GM expects a &#8220;very strong&#8221; end to the year in GMIO&#8217;s
markets, Lee said. The unit is also responsible for GM&#8217;s
business in Africa and former Soviet countries including Russia. 
Floods in Thailand, currently in the 15th week, won&#8217;t have
any material impact on GM&#8217;s operations in the country in the
fourth quarter, Lee said. The company has relocated its national
headquarters from Bangkok to its plant in the city of Rayong,
where production is continuing, he said. 
Development Costs 
GM&#8217;s worldwide profit this year has been affected by
increasing costs related to engineering, marketing and
introducing models, Lee said. 
The spending has &#8220;brought us down a bit, but these are
investments we&#8217;re making in the future,&#8221; said Lee, who is
presenting Chevrolet&#8217;s new TrailBlazer sport-utility vehicle at
the Dubai International Motor Show. 
The U.S. carmaker had aimed to break even this year in
Europe in terms of earnings before interest and taxes, excluding
reorganization costs. GM Europe&#8217;s losses during the quarter
narrowed to $292 million from $559 million a year earlier, while
the unit&#8217;s deliveries rose 4.6 percent to 407,000 vehicles. The
results in Europe and South America were &#8220;unacceptable,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Dan Akerson said yesterday. 
&#8220;Europe is a concern,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;We have yet to solve
the riddle in terms of being steadily profitable in Europe, but
we are working on it every day both from the Opel, the Vauxhall
and the Chevrolet side.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends
buying the euro after developments in Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt
crisis this week. Morgan Stanley said its time to sell the 17-
nation currency against the dollar. 
The 17-nation currency gained today, rising 1.1 percent to
$1.3749, as former European Central Bank Vice President Lucas
Papademos was sworn in as prime minster of Greece and Italy&#8217;s
Senate approved an austerity bill, paving the way for a new
administration that may be led by former European Union
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti. Italian bonds gained,
pushing yields down from euro-era records above 7 percent. 
The emergency of the new governments helps reduce &#8220;near-
term political uncertainty&#8221; and suggests &#8220;that euro-zone fiscal
tensions could continue to decline, at least for a period of
time,&#8221; wrote Thomas Stolper, Goldman&#8217;s London-based chief
foreign-exchange strategist, in a client note. 
Investors should target $1.40 and should exit the trade if
the euro falls to $1.35, according to the Goldman note. In a
video webcast today, Stolper reiterated a 12-month forecast of
$1.48 for the euro. 
Morgan Stanley said the shared currency may fall to $1.30,
according to analysts led by Hans Redeker, the firm&#8217;s head of
foreign-exchange strategy in London. &#8220;Political uncertainties&#8221;
and Italian bond yields that remain above 6 percent leave the
firm &#8220;fundamentally bearish&#8221; on the euro &#8220;as Italy runs the risk
of being too big to save,&#8221; the firm said in a client note. 
Traders should sell the euro, targeting $1.3050, and end
the bet if it rises to $1.3950, Morgan Stanley recommended in a
note yesterday.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the U.S. oil
company that helped engineer a 48 percent production increase
from Iraq&#8217;s West Qurna field in one year, risks a backlash from
that nation&#8217;s central government by signing exploration deals
with semi-autonomous Kurds. 
Exxon, the world&#8217;s biggest company by market value, recently
signed contracts with the Kurdistan Regional Government to
explore six blocks in the country&#8217;s north, Michael Howard, an
adviser to the regional authority, said today in an e-mailed
statement. 
Exxon may be jeopardizing existing oilfield-development
agreements overseen by Iraq&#8217;s central government, Abdul-Mahdy al-
Ameedi, the head of the Baghdad-based Oil Ministry&#8217;s licensing
department, said today in a telephone interview. A dispute
between Baghdad and the regional government over oil contracts
led to a temporary suspension of crude exports in 2009. 
&#8220;They know very well that any company will be disqualified
from implementing its contract with the Oil Ministry&#8221; if it
signs a deal with Kurdish regional authorities, Al-Ameedi said.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the public policy of the Oil Ministry that companies have
to choose one of two options: The KRG or the Oil Ministry.&#8221; 
Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon,
declined to comment. The company&#8217;s shares gained 1 percent to
$79.47 at 12:49 p.m. in New York. The stock has risen 9.2 percent
this year, poised for the biggest annual gain since 2007. 
No Blacklist 
The Oil Ministry&#8217;s warning may be an empty threat, given the
importance of Exxon&#8217;s expertise to central government efforts to
lift production in southern oil fields, said Richard Quin, lead
analyst for Middle East-North Africa energy research at Wood
Mackenzie Consultants Ltd. 
&#8220;It wouldn&#8217;t be in Iraq&#8217;s best interest to effectively rip
up their contract,&#8221; Quin said in a telephone interview from
Edinburgh. &#8220;That would be detrimental to Iraq&#8217;s expansion of
southern exports.&#8221; 
Iraqi law also appears to be on the side of Exxon and its
Kurdish partners, Quin said. 
&#8220;There is no legislation or real mechanism for Baghdad to
really force through a blacklist,&#8221; he said. 
Exxon, whose worldwide crude output exceeded that of every
member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Venezuela last year, is the latest
Western entrant into Kurdistan. Others include Vallares Plc, the
explorer founded by former BP Plc (BP/) Chief Executive Officer Tony Hayward, Afren Plc (AFR), Hess Corp. (HES), Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR), Marathon Oil
Corp. (MRO) and Repsol YPF SA. (REP) 
Shares Rise 
The announcement of Exxon&#8217;s Kurdish contracts boosted the
shares of other explorers that are targeting the region. Gulf
Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP) surged 33 percent in London trading,
while DNO International ASA (DNO) jumped 31 percent in Oslo. 
An index of 10 Western oil companies with Kurdish
exploration agreements rose as much as 3.3 percent today, the
biggest intraday gain since Oct. 27. 
Iraqi political leaders will have a say in how the central
government and Oil Ministry react to Exxon&#8217;s Kurdish agreements,
Al-Ameedi said. 
Any decision on whether to penalize Exxon wouldn&#8217;t only be a
commercial decision, he said. &#8220;The ministry needs to discuss
with the cabinet in order to take the right action. 
Exxon and partners Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Iraq&#8217;s Oil
Exploration Co. boosted production from the West Qurna field in
the southern part of the country to 370,000 barrels a day last
month from about 250,000 barrels a year earlier. 
The companies are injecting water into the field to flush
more crude to the surface, under the terms of a 20-year
development deal signed in January 2010.

Yusuf Alireza, who was promoted to
co-president of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s operations in the
Asia-Pacific region outside Japan in January, is leaving after
19 years with the company, according to an internal memo. 
David Ryan will remain as president of the business,
according to the memo from Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chief Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, and
Vice Chairman J. Michael Evans. Goldman Sachs spokesman Edward
Naylor confirmed the contents of the document. 
Alireza, 41, is the most senior departure from Goldman
Sachs in the region since Ravi Sinha, former co-head of
investment banking for Asia ex-Japan, stepped down in April 2010.
Alireza was among four Asia-based members of the firm&#8217;s global
management committee. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s net revenue from Asia shrank to $7.1
billion last year from $8.3 billion in 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s net revenue from the
region more than doubled last year, to $4.3 billion. At 18
percent, Asia still accounted for a greater share of Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s overall revenue than at Morgan Stanley, which got 14
percent of its total from the region last year, the data shows. 
Alireza has no plan to join a rival company, said a person
with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified.
Goldman promoted him along with Ryan in January, with Alireza
overseeing trading operations and Ryan focusing on advisory
services such as arranging mergers and managing stock sales. 
Quarterly Loss 
Alireza joined the firm&#8217;s fixed-income research group in
New York in 1992 and had held positions in fixed-income sales
and hedge fund sales, rising to become a partner in 2004,
according to the memo. He moved to Hong Kong in 2008 to run the
securities division in the Asia-Pacific region. 
Goldman Sachs, based in New York, last month reported its
second quarterly loss in 12 years as a public company as the
firm lost money on investments. Still, revenue from trading
stocks and bonds rose 16 percent from the second quarter and the
backlog of investment-banking assignments climbed, the firm said. 
Buckley Ratchford, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head of global bank loan
trading and distressed investing, and Blake W. Mather, who runs
bank loan sales at the firm, are leaving at the end of this year,
according to internal memos.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. (BMY)&#8217;s experimental drug apixaban wasn&#8217;t safer or more effective
than a standard treatment in stopping blood clots in the legs
and lungs of patients after hospitalization, a study found. 
The trial, reported today at the American Heart Association
meeting in Orlando, Florida, is the second to show new
anticoagulants don&#8217;t provide a benefit in severely ill patients
more than Sanofi&#8217;s injected drug Lovenox, the current standard.
Johnson  Johnson and Bayer AG (BAYN)&#8217;s Xarelto failed to beat the
standard therapy in a trial reported last April. 
The potentially deadly clots occurred in 2.7 percent of
those given apixaban, also known by the brand name Eliquis,
compared with 3.1 percent of those given Lovenox, the results
showed. The difference wasn&#8217;t statistically significant,
researchers said. While the drugs&#8217; benefits increased over time,
both also triggered more major bleeding. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve made great headway in preventing deep vein
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in surgical patients and
hospitalized medical patients,&#8221; said lead author Samuel
Goldhaber, director of the venous thromboembolism research group
at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical
School, in a statement. &#8220;Where we have failed to make progress
is the after-hospital discharge medical patient.&#8221; 
8 Million Patients 
There are about 8 million U.S. patients a year that are at
moderate to high risk of venous thromboembolism, Goldhaber said.
About 1 percent of patients develop symptoms from the clots
after they are released from the hospital, and they are most
common in the following three months, said Mary Cushman,
director of the thrombosis program at the University of Vermont. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, and Bristol-Myers
are both based in New York. The companies are evaluating the
results and haven&#8217;t decided what their next steps will be, said
MacKay Jimeson, a Pfizer spokesman. 
Researchers in the apixaban study and earlier trial of
Xarelto, made by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ), and Bayer, of Leverkusen, Germany, were looking to see
if longer treatment with the new pills could cut death rates and
prevent complications from leg clots that occur in as many as
600,000 Americans each year. 
Hospitalized patients, such as those with pneumonia or
heart failure, are at high risk for the clots. 
The chance of success in the study was slim given the
difficulty of treating such sick patients, especially after the
Xarelto setback, said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst with Leerink
Swann  Co. in Boston, in a Nov. 4 note to investors. 
Atrial Fibrillation 
Apixaban is in development to prevent stroke in patients
with atrial fibrillation, an erratic heartbeat that occurs in 2
million Americans a year. If approved, it will compete against
Xarelto and Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH&#8217;s Pradaxa in a market
estimated to top $10 billion in annual sales. 
Analysts predict apixaban may take the lead after a study
presented in August found it reduced deaths and bleeding rates
more than warfarin, a form of rat poison used to treat the
condition for more than five decades, unlike its rivals. 
&#8220;Afib is clearly the primary indication for apixaban,&#8221;
said Marc Goodman, an analyst at UBS AG in New York, in a note
after the results were released. While the drug was forecast to
generate about $100 million in 2015 for medically ill patients,
the results should have &#8220;no meaningful impact&#8221; on the
companies&#8217; shares or the drug&#8217;s eventual sales, he said. 
Hospitalized Patients 
In hospitalized patients, the risk of the dangerous clots
were lower with apixaban as the trial progressed and patients
stopped getting Lovenox, which was given for longer than
patients now get it in routine care, Goldhaber said. That raises
the possibility that another study may find a benefit, he said. 
&#8220;There is no question this is a tremendous opportunity to
design and carry out a new trial,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;I
have been in this field for 30 years, and I have no doubt that
it is going to happen.&#8221; 
Bleeding occurred in 7.73 percent of patients on apixaban,
up from 6.81 percent of those given Lovenox. Major bleeding was
2.5-fold higher in patients given apixban, occurring in 0.47
percent of those given the experimental drug versus 0.19 percent
of those on Lovenox. 
The increased risk of major bleeding poses a problem since
few patients released from the hospital will ultimately develop
symptoms from the clots, which the drug was designed to prevent,
said Cushman from the University of Vermont. Cushman, who wasn&#8217;t
involved in the trial, reviewed the findings at a press
conference at the heart meeting. 
The study was funded by Pfizer and Bristol-Myers and
published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Johnson 
Johnson, maker of Xarelto with Germany&#8217;s Bayer, is based in New
Brunswick, New Jersey.

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) Chief Executive
Officer Rex Tillerson is playing catch-up with a former rival,
ex-BP Plc (BP/) CEO Tony Hayward, in a race to tap oil riches in Iraq&#8217;s
Kurdish region that dwarf the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. 
Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest company by market value, signed a
contract to drill for crude in the Kurdish-controlled north of
the country on Oct. 18, Ashti Hawrami, the natural resources
minister for the Kurdistan Regional Government, said yesterday
during an oil conference in Erbil, Iraq. Hayward&#8217;s Vallares Plc
has a six-week head start with its $2.1 billion agreement in
September to acquire Turkey-based Genel Energy Plc, the biggest
oil producer in Kurdistan. 
Home to about 40 percent of the Iraqi nation&#8217;s 115 billion
barrels of reserves, Kurdistan has attracted keen interest from
small and midsized foreign explorers since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 opened the region for the first time in decades.
The biggest international producers such as Exxon had steered
clear of Kurdistan to avoid getting in the middle of a long-
standing dispute between Iraq and Kurdish leaders over how to
divide oil revenue. 
Iraq&#8217;s central government said it&#8217;s settled the dispute with
an agreement that would open the door to international oil
companies operating in the Kurdish region without penalty from
Iraq, according to a Nov. 12 report by Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, the U.S. government-funded news outlet. 
Expanding Production 
Tillerson has been expanding Exxon&#8217;s holdings from the
Russian Arctic to the Texas-Mexico border to reverse a production
shortfall that saw third-quarter output drop the most in three
years. The company&#8217;s willingness to sign a contract with Kurdish
authorities may presage a flood of investment and acquisitions
not only in the northern region but all over Iraq as perceptions
of political and security risks diminish, said Gianna Bern,
president of Brookshire Advisory  Research Inc., a Chicago-based
risk-management adviser to the energy industry. 
&#8220;Iraq is open for business,&#8221; Bern said. &#8220;If Exxon can
advance its efforts in Iraq, then opportunities for all the major
oil companies to invest are going to increase significantly over
the next several years.&#8221; 
Kurdish authorities have offered international oil producers
more profitable terms than those given by Iraq&#8217;s central
government. In Kurdistan, foreign explorers are granted a share
of the oil pumped from each well. That&#8217;s a richer prospect than
the service contracts with Iraq&#8217;s government for developing
southern oilfields, which give foreign companies pre-set fees of
as little as $1.90 a barrel. 
Tensions with Iraq 
Shares of oil explorers focusing on Kurdish fields surged
today. Petroceltic International Plc (PCI) rose 8 percent in London
after earlier jumping 13 percent. Gulf Keystone Petroleum Ltd. (GKP)
advanced as much as 14 percent. 
Exxon riled some members of the Iraqi government by signing
its exploration contract with Kurdish leaders before the oil-
sharing agreement with Iraq had been completed. After Exxon&#8217;s
contract was reported Nov. 11, Abdul-Mahdy al-Ameedi, head of
licensing at the Iraqi central government&#8217;s Oil Ministry,
threatened to cancel the company&#8217;s existing contracts to extract
oil in Iraq&#8217;s southern fields. 
A day later, Adal Barwari, Prime Minister Nouri Kamil al- Maliki&#8217;s adviser on Kurdish affairs, told Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty that the central government and the Kurds reached
&#8220;mutually acceptable&#8221; solutions to long-standing disagreements
over oil, territory and Kurdish armed forces. 
Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon,
declined to comment yesterday in an e-mailed statement. 
Hayward&#8217;s Kurdish Plan 
Hayward, forced out of London-based BP last year after the
Deepwater Horizon disaster that killed 11 rig workers and spilled
more than 4 million barrels of crude in the Gulf, plans to spend
about $725 million to develop Genel&#8217;s six Kurdish fields. An
equal amount will be devoted to buying up some of the 41
companies drilling for crude and natural gas in the Kurdish
region, Hayward said during a Sept. 8 meeting with reporters in
Istanbul. 
&#8220;We will be participating in the inevitable consolidation
among the 41 companies in the Kurdish region,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
want to have the dominant position in the region by building a
bigger company.&#8221; 
Vallares, a so-called blank-check company founded by Hayward,
financier Nathaniel Rothschild and banker Julian Metherell, said
in a Nov. 3 statement that it plans to change its name to Genel
Energy Plc, pending approval by shareholders. 
Kurdistan holds as much as 45 billion barrels in crude
reserves, Hawrami said in September. That&#8217;s more than double the
20.4 billion barrels of crude the U.S. Energy Department
estimates lay beneath the sea floor in the deep-water Gulf of
Mexico. 
Unexploited &#8216;Vast&#8217; Reserves 
Iraqi oil production surged to a 9-year high of 2.73 million
barrels a day in September, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Output fell 2.7 percent to 2.655 million barrels a day
last month after attacks on pipelines in the southern part of the
country disrupted transport. 
&#8220;Iraq may be one of the few places left where vast oil
reserves have barely been exploited,&#8221; the U.S. Energy
Department&#8217;s Energy Information Administration said in a 2010
report on its website. 
Tillerson, a University of Texas-trained engineer, is
spending $37 billion this year to drill wells, construct gas-
export terminals and expand oil refineries as he seeks new
sources of growth for Exxon. In the past year-and-a-half,
Tillerson signed a $3.2 billion deal with Russia&#8217;s OAO Rosneft to
explore the Black Sea and Kara Sea for crude, and devoted another
$40 billion to acqusitions in gas-rich U.S. shale formations. 
&#8216;Binding Contract&#8217; 
So far, Exxon has been mum about its plans for Kurdistan,
refusing even to confirm the existence of an agreement. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a binding contract,&#8221; Hawrami told reporters
yesterday at the Kurdistan-Iraq Oil and Gas Conference in the
regional capital city Erbil. 
The agreement entitles Exxon to explore six blocks,
including Al Qush, Bashiqa, Tirman, Betwata, Qurna-Hanjeer and an
area along the border with Iran, he said. Hawrami didn&#8217;t disclose
any details about how much Exxon has pledged to spend on seismic
mapping, exploratory drilling or training local residents to work
in the oilfields. 
&#8220;Iraq is considered a frontier region in the oil
industry,&#8221; said Brookshire Advisory&#8217;s Bern, a former BP crude
trader and author of &#8220;Investing in Energy: A Primer on the
Economics of the Energy Industry.&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s still a risky place to
operate but if Exxon can advance its efforts there, it&#8217;ll be a
pretty significant feather in its cap.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its
forecast for commodity gains in the next year to 15 percent
after correctly predicting the climb in prices since the
beginning of last month. 
The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index will be led by gains
in industrial metals in the next year, Jeffrey Currie, a Goldman
analyst in London, wrote in a report today. The bank, which
lowered its commodities forecast from 20 percent last month,
says copper will gain 22 percent and London oil 10 percent. 
Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and
copper in April and turned more bullish the following month
before prices rebounded. It lowered its commodities outlook
after the GSCI Enhanced gauge jumped 15 percent since Oct. 4.
Raw materials have gained as European leaders attempted to
contain the region&#8217;s debt crisis and the Federal Reserve
signaled more stimulus may be available to spur growth. 
&#8220;Notwithstanding the continuing European crisis, we
maintain our view that global growth will provide enough support
to demand to drive key commodity prices higher over the next 12
months,&#8221; Currie wrote in the report. 
Winners, Losers 
Energy commodities will climb almost 19 percent in the next
12 months, and industrial metals will advance 26 percent,
Goldman said. Precious metals will increase 5 percent, livestock
will rise almost 11 percent and agriculture will drop 5.1
percent. Copper will be at $9,500 a metric ton in London in a
year and London oil will be at $125 a barrel, the bank said. 
Goldman held its price forecasts for industrial metals and
raised its estimates from an Oct. 4 report for New York and
London oil, gasoline, gold and live cattle. It cut its outlook
for wheat, soybeans, cotton and sugar. 
Europe&#8217;s inability to contain a regional debt crisis that
started in Greece more than two years ago led to a surge in
Italian bond yields as investors bet on which nation may need
aid next. Mario Monti, a former European Union competition
commissioner, was offered Italy&#8217;s prime minister post. George
Papandreou resigned last week as Greek prime minister to make
way for a coalition led by Lucas Papademos. 
Whirlpool vs Rocks 
&#8220;The commodity markets continue to navigate between a
potential European whirlpool on one side and rocks on the other
side, which the market will likely run up against should demand
not falter and supply constraints force price spikes to balance
the market,&#8221; Curry wrote. &#8220;We continue to emphasize that
concerns about being pulled under by the whirlpool have pushed
key commodity prices too low relative to current fundamental
balances.&#8221; 
Commodities as measured by the GSCI Enhanced index are up
3.7 percent in 2011, heading for their weakest performance since
2008. The International Monetary Fund is forecasting economic
growth of 4 percent in 2012, unchanged from this year. 
Goldman forecast that gold will be at $1,930 an ounce in 12
months, compared with $1,776.90 by 6:28 a.m. in New York. Silver
will be 6.1 percent lower at $32.20 an ounce and wheat will fall
8.3 percent to $5.90 a bushel in Chicago.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank, is preparing for a faster global economic
rebound than most forecasters expect, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that we can conclude that this slowdown is
secular rather than cyclical change,&#8221; Blankfein, 57, said today
at an investor conference in New York hosted by Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit. &#8220;The world will snap back and it
will be a surprise and it will be faster than people think. I
don&#8217;t know when that will be and we will gear ourselves
accordingly.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before converting to a bank in 2008,
last month reported its second quarterly loss in 12 years as a
publicly traded company. The stock dropped 41 percent this year
through yesterday to $99.29, below the company&#8217;s $120.41
tangible book value per share at the end of September. 
Blankfein, while noting that the firm is cutting costs and
adapting to changing regulation and slower economic growth, said
he is wary of overreacting by assuming the world has permanently
changed. He reminded investors that Goldman Sachs reported
record earnings in 2009 following a quarterly loss in 2008, in
part because competitors pulled away from making markets for
clients. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re managing our costs, obviously, but we&#8217;re not
thinking necessarily that there&#8217;s such a radical, structural
change,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We want to be in shape for the upturn.&#8221; 
Volcker Rule 
Blankfein said he expects Goldman Sachs&#8217;s clients and other
&#8220;end-users&#8221; of investment-banking services to inform
regulators of their concerns about the Volcker rule, which
limits banks from trading on their own behalf and from investing
in private-equity and hedge funds. Clients are concerned the
regulations could reduce market liquidity and make trading more
expensive, he said. 
&#8220;As people weigh the costs to themselves, I think the
intensity will rise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think user groups will chime
in and make their interests known. In fact I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8221; 
People familiar with the situation said last week that
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were considering holding some
of the loan promises they make to clients at the original cost
instead of at the market cost. Asked to comment on a newspaper
report on the deliberations, Blankfein reiterated the firm&#8217;s
belief in the importance of mark-to-market accounting. He said
the firm had had a debate on how to mark unfunded loan
commitments to market. 
Mark to Market 
&#8220;From time to time we evaluate how we are marking certain
kinds of things,&#8221; Blankfein added. &#8220;Somebody picked up on
something, eavesdropped on a partial conversation or something
and were, I guess, tapping into a conversation we were having
specifically about how -- how, not will -- how you mark unfunded
commitments that tend not to be drawn down just when they&#8217;re in
the money.&#8221; 
Blankfein has spoken at the annual Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Banking and Financial Services Conference every year
beginning in 2006, when he was named chairman and CEO. Guy Moszkowski, the Bank of America analyst who covers Goldman
Sachs, cut his recommendation on the stock to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; in March.

Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest
U.S. bank, may benefit from a decline in the dominance of fixed-
income trading on Wall Street, said Paul J. Taubman, co-
president of the firm&#8217;s institutional-securities group. 
Fixed-income revenue grew in the last decade to almost two-
thirds of investment banking and trading revenue for the
financial industry, Taubman, 50, said today at an investor
conference in New York. Around 2000, the revenue was evenly
split between fixed-income, equity trading and investment
banking, he said. 
&#8220;We suffered as much as anything else from a mix shift
away from those businesses where we had historic leadership
positions,&#8221; Taubman said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt that the
institutional-equities business and the investment-banking
business are likely to comprise an ever-increasing share of the
overall Street wallet for institutional revenues.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley generated $4.9 billion from fixed-income
trading and $4.9 billion from equity trading in the first nine
months of the year, excluding accounting adjustments. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc. generated more than twice as much
revenue from fixed-income trading as equities. All three firms
are based in New York. 
Morgan Stanley also had $3.3 billion in revenue from
investment banking. That represented an increase of 20 percent
from a year earlier, a bigger jump than any of its largest
competitors, said Taubman, who oversees investment banking and
capital markets. 
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman set out a goal earlier
this year of gaining 2 percentage points in fixed-income-trading
market share. 
&#8220;Every indication&#8221; is that the investments made toward
that goal are paying off with increased share, Taubman said
today at the conference, hosted by Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch unit. The number of corporate clients using the
firm&#8217;s debt-derivatives services climbed 33 percent from a year
earlier, Taubman said.

A benchmark gauge of U.S. credit-
default swaps rose to the highest level in five weeks as Fitch
Ratings said further contagion from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis would
pose a risk to American banks. 
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, added 2.3 basis points to a mid-
price of 134.6 basis points at 5:01 p.m. in New York, the
highest level since Oct. 11, according to index administrator
Markit Group Ltd. Credit default swaps on U.S. banks rose, led
by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. 
Traders pushed the swaps index higher for a third day as
Fitch said that while U.S. lenders have &#8220;manageable direct
exposures&#8221; to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain,
further turmoil poses a &#8220;serious risk&#8221; to U.S. banks&#8217;
creditworthiness. The credit gauge has climbed from a two-month
low of 113.4 basis points on Oct. 27 even as economic data
signals the U.S. economy may avoid recession. 
&#8220;The market remains pretty fixated on Europe and all the
ups and downs from policy makers,&#8221; George Bory, chief corporate
credit strategist for UBS AG, said in a telephone interview from
London. &#8220;The renewed weakness in bond markets has put a little
bit more pressure on credit markets overall, which really limits
the ability for people to take risk going into the end of the
year.&#8221; 
Contracts on Morgan Stanley increased 24.6 basis points to
459.6 basis points, while those on Goldman Sachs added 18 to
367.9, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. Bank of America Corp. added 17.8
basis points to 402.8, the data show. 
The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has increased
even as some U.S. economic reports have signaled consumers are
spending at a faster rate than analysts expected. U.S. retail
sales rose 0.5 percent in October, according to Commerce
Department figures yesterday, exceeding the median forecast of
81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News for a rise of 0.3
percent. 
&#8220;Domestic economic data has continued to improve over the
period, providing a favorable fundamental backdrop,&#8221; Anthony Valeri, a market strategist with LPL Financial in San Diego,
which oversees $330 billion, said in a note to clients.
&#8220;European headlines are likely to keep prices volatile over the
near term.&#8221; 
Contracts on Lowe&#8217;s Cos. climbed as it sold $1 billion of
debt a day after its credit grade was lowered by Standard 
Poor&#8217;s. The second-largest U.S. home-improvement retailer sold
10- and 30-year bonds with proceeds to be used for stock
buybacks, capital expenditures, acquisitions or working capital,
according to a regulatory filing today. 
Credit-default swaps on the Mooresville, North Carolina-
based company climbed 3.5 basis points to 106.8 basis points,
according to CMA. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Prevnar 13 vaccine for
a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia won the backing of a
U.S. advisory panel today for use in adults 50 and older, a
population that may add almost $2 billion to sales in 2015. 
Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration at a meeting
today in Silver Spring, Maryland voted 14-1 that the shot was
safe and effective for adults in producing an immune response
against the pneumococcal bacteria. The FDA doesn&#8217;t have to
follow the panel&#8217;s recommendations. 
The FDA is expected to decide on approval of Prevnar 13 in
adults 50 and older by Jan. 2. The agency is weighing approval
on the condition that Pfizer studies the vaccine further to
prove it protects against pneumococcal pneumonia. Pfizer started
an 85,000-subject trial in the Netherlands to confirm the
vaccine&#8217;s effectiveness in staving off the infection. 
&#8220;We are very optimistic that this trial is going to show
the data that you want to see,&#8221; Marion Gruber, the FDA&#8217;s acting
director of vaccine research and review, said during the panel
meeting. She said the agency expects results from the study in
2013. 
Prevnar 13, approved in the U.S. last year for children six
weeks to 5 years old, generated $2.82 billion the first nine
months of 2011, according to the New York-based drugmaker&#8217;s
regulatory filings. The vaccine may generate $5.9 billion by
2015, with adult use contributing $1.8 billion, said Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in New York, in
an Oct. 21 investment note. 
Staff Report 
An FDA staff report released Nov. 14 determined the vaccine
was safe and effective in adults who received Merck  Co.&#8217;s
older vaccine approved almost 30 years ago and in those never
immunized. The report found no major side effects, though
limitations included the size of the safety database, which may
be too small to detect some rare adverse events, the report
said. 
FDA considers the protection of adults from pneumococcal
pneumonia a &#8220;meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing
treatments,&#8221; according to the report. 
Pneumococcal pneumonia accounts for 175,000
hospitalizations each year in the U.S. and more than 6,000
deaths, according to the National Foundation for Infectious
Diseases. 
Merck&#8217;s Pneumovax 
Pfizer conducted clinical studies that showed the vaccine
likely will be associated with better protection than Whitehouse
Station, New Jersey-based Merck&#8217;s Pneumovax 23 against
pneumococcal pneumonia, Emilio Emini, Pfizer&#8217;s chief scientific
officer for vaccine research, said in a telephone interview. 
Pfizer hasn&#8217;t determined how long the shot will last and is
studying a five-year duration as part of the Netherlands trial,
said Peter Paradiso, of Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine development unit. 
Merck&#8217;s Pneumovax 23 brought in $276 million in sales in
the first nine months of this year, according to company
filings. 
Insurance coverage for Prevnar 13 will depend on whether
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s vaccines panel
recommends Prevnar 13 for those 50 and older. The 2010 health
law requires coverage of vaccines recommended by the panel
without a co-payment or deductible cost to patients. 
Merck&#8217;s vaccine is recommended for people ages 65 and older
and for people 2 years and older at high risk for pneumonia,
such as those with sickle cell disease, HIV infection and other
conditions that compromise the immune system, according to the
CDC. It is also recommended for adults 19 to 64 years old who
smoke, have asthma or live in nursing homes or long-term care
facilities.

Morgan Stanley (MS)&#8217;s Michael DePietro,
head of trading for U.S. home-loan bonds without government
backing, left the firm amid a slump in the market, according to
three people familiar with the matter. 
DePietro, an executive director at the New York-based bank
who led U.S. non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities
trading, departed this week along with Steven Sasson and another
member of his group, said two of the people, who declined to be
identified because the moves weren&#8217;t public. 
Rebecca Hogan, a managing director who heads the bank&#8217;s
consumer asset-backed securities trading business, will take
DePietro&#8217;s post, one of the people said. 
Wall Street firms&#8217; inventories of non-agency securities
have declined in value as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis drives down
prices for risky bonds. Morgan Stanley posted a 17 percent
decline in third-quarter fixed-income trading revenue from a
year earlier, excluding accounting gains. That was driven in
part by &#8220;relative weakness&#8221; in mortgage trading, Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on an Oct. 19 conference call. 
Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment on the departures, as did DePietro. Sasson
didn&#8217;t immediately return a message left on his cell phone. 
Morgan Stanley posted trading losses on 31 days in the
third quarter, the most since 2008, according to a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
The rout in the $1.2 trillion market for non-agency bonds
began in May as the Federal Reserve&#8217;s auctions of bonds assumed
in its American International Group Inc. (AIG) bailout added to dealer
stockpiles. Non-agency mortgage notes lack guarantees from U.S.-
backed Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae. 
Subprime Securities 
Floating-rate subprime mortgage bonds from the credit
bubble have lost 13 percent on average since February, Barclays
Capital index data show, with some debt tumbling 30 percent,
according to investment firm Ellington Financial LLC. (EFC) 
Trading has also slowed. In the past five weeks, dealers
have conducted auctions for $14.8 billion of non-agency debt,
down from $26.1 billion in the first five weeks of the year,
according to data from Empirasign Strategies LLC. Investment
banks reported completed sales of $4.4 billion of the bonds
offered in the most recent period, according to the New York-
based provider of data on securitized-debt trading.

Multinational companies including
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Oracle Corp. (ORCL) are urging Congress to make
passing a measure to allow a tax break on their offshore profits
a greater priority than a comprehensive tax-code overhaul. 
The opportunity to boost the economy by encouraging
repatriation of more than $1 trillion in earnings held by U.S.
corporations overseas should, in the short run, trump the longer
process of revamping the tax code, the WIN America Coalition
said in a letter congressional leaders released today. 
&#8220;While we support congressional efforts to enact
comprehensive tax reform that makes our domestic tax code more
efficient for U.S. companies to compete in the growing global
market, we believe in the short term, Congress has an enormous
opportunity to immediately inject significant private-sector
investment into the U.S. economy,&#8221; said the letter, signed by
Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, Oracle Co-
President Safra Catz, and the CEOs of 13 other companies. 
The letter called on Congress to authorize the return of
overseas income at &#8220;a more efficient tax rate than is currently
available.&#8221; 
The document didn&#8217;t specify a tax rate the companies were
seeking. Several pieces of repatriation legislation propose
allowing companies to return offshore profits at 5.25 percent,
the same rate in effect during a so-called tax holiday on
foreign income in 2004. The top corporate tax rate is currently
35 percent. 
2004 Holiday 
Opponents of a tax holiday, including Democratic Senator
Carl Levin of Michigan, have complained that companies used
revenue from the 2004 tax holiday to buy back stock and then cut
jobs. 
Under the current U.S. worldwide tax system, multinational
companies with headquarters in the U.S. owe taxes on profits
they earn outside of the country. They get tax credits for
payments to other governments and can defer the residual U.S.
tax until they bring the money home. 
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp has
proposed shifting to a so-called territorial system, which would
shield 95 percent of corporate profits earned offshore from U.S.
taxation. 
The WIN America coalition has been lobbying Congress for
the tax holiday for months. 
The Obama administration has said that a tax holiday should
be considered in the context of a broader tax overhaul. 
The congressional supercommittee is considering changes to
the tax code as it considers fashioning the framework of debt-
cutting plan by a Nov. 23 deadline. Failure to enact a debt-
reduction plan this year would trigger $1.2 trillion in
automatic spending cuts beginning in 2013.

Viktor Hjort, the Hong Kong-based
head of fixed income-research at Morgan Stanley Asia Ltd., spoke
about Asia&#8217;s credit outlook at a forum in Singapore today. 
On Asia&#8217;s credit outlook: 
&#8220;European banks have to shrink over the next few years,
they have to de-leverage and one of things that they will most
likely end up doing is to shift some of their exposure or assets
to Asia. So Asian banks will have to deal with it over the
coming 12 to 24 months and will probably have to find new
avenues of funding to replace some of the wholesale funding
that&#8217;s been provided by European banks. 
&#8220;They are also going to have to sell some of the assets
European banks are most likely to exit. What that will mean is
that the cost of capital in Asia will gradually rise. 
&#8220;Access to lending conditions will deteriorate so that&#8217;s
negative for margins in Asia&#8217;s credit market. In the sense that
it will force more issuance in the bond markets, it will drive
up the cost of capital.

Johnson Publishing Co. Chief
Executive Officer Desiree Rogers plans Internet and mobile
initiatives to create new revenue sources for the owner of Ebony
and Jet magazines and capitalize on its archive of more than
half a century of African-American life. 
Johnson Publishing will launch a new Ebony.com website in
January that may include current issues and older stories on
people such as comedian Flip Wilson or Martin Luther King, said
Rogers. It also plans initiatives for social networks and mobile
devices, she said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not just going to do magazines,&#8221; Rogers said in an
interview at Bloomberg headquarters in New York. &#8220;That is not
the end game.&#8221; 
Rogers, the former White House social secretary and
executive at Allstate Corp. (ALL) and Peoples Energy Corp., was hired
as CEO of the Chicago-based company in August 2010. Linda Johnson Rice, who had been chairman and CEO, remains chairman. 
Johnson Publishing is looking to revitalize and expand its
brands after a JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) unit took a minority stake
in July. Rice, whose father founded the company in 1942, is the
majority shareholder. 
Rogers helped redesign Ebony magazine this year and is
working to relaunch Jet in February. She&#8217;s also hired Trenton
Parks as chief information officer to help with technology
initiatives. 
Rogers recruited Sam Fine, a celebrity makeup artist, to
help boost revenue at its Fashion Fair cosmetics unit. The
company may launch its own retail stores to sell its African-
American-oriented products, she said. 
Johnson Publishing has &#8220;an authentic voice&#8221; that can
speak to younger generations while holding on to its traditional
audience, Rogers said.

Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) said it will
acquire control of Light Group, an operator of restaurants and
nightclub bars, for about $46.5 million to enhance its hotel-
management business. 
Morgans, which operates the Royalton and Mondrian hotels,
will buy a 90 percent stake in Light Group. The company runs
such venues as the Bank Nightclub at the Bellagio Hotel and the
Diablos Mexican Cantina at the Monte Carlo Hotel, both in Las
Vegas, for MGM Resorts International (MGM), Morgans said in a
statement today. 
Morgans, based in New York, has been selling some
properties and using the proceeds to expand its management
business. The company said the transaction may lead to
additional partnerships with MGM and new hotel-management
contracts. 
The acquisition &#8220;will position us to increase our food and
beverage profits, drive average daily rate growth at existing
hotels and win and service new management agreements,&#8221; Morgans
Chief Executive Officer Michael Gross said. 
Morgans said it will pay $28.5 million in cash when the
transaction is completed, likely by the end of the year. The
deal will immediately add to Morgans&#8217; earnings, the hotelier
said. Light Group&#8217;s management agreements produce about $8
million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization annually, Morgans said.

&#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?,&#8221; the new
mobile game from Walt Disney Co. (DIS), stars Swampy, an alligator who
lives in an underground sewer. 
The googly eyed reptile likes to lounge around in his
subterranean bathtub while he scrubs his back with a brush.
Players swipe their fingers across an Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone screen
to guide water into his tub while dodging toxic sludge and
collecting rubber duckies as prizes. 
With the 99-cent application, also available for Apple&#8217;s
iPad tablet, the House of Mickey is attempting to do something
it has never done before: spin a multimillion-dollar franchise
out of a character that made his debut on a 3.5-inch screen,
Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its Nov. 21 issue. 
So far the Swampy experiment is going swimmingly. Following
its Sept.&#160;22 release, &#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?&#8221; quickly jumped to
the top of the Apple App Store&#8217;s paid applications chart,
displacing the record-setting &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221; game from the No.
1 spot for three weeks. 
The logic behind Disney&#8217;s new release is simple. A movie
takes three to five years and hundreds of millions of dollars to
make, and as with &#8220;Mars Needs Moms,&#8221; Disney&#8217;s big theatrical
release this past spring, success is hardly guaranteed. 
&#8216;New Way&#8217; 
The cost of a mobile game runs in the hundreds of
thousands. It took a crew of seven people seven-and-a-half
months to produce &#8220;Where&#8217;s My Water?&#8221; If Swampy becomes a hit
with kids, a follow-up movie could have a ready base of fans
eager to buy tickets. 
&#8220;This is a very, very cost-effective way to develop
characters,&#8221; said Tim Nollen, an analyst at Macquarie Capital
USA Inc. in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a new way of doing things.&#8221; 
About 52&#160;percent of kids 8 and younger have used a mobile
device for games and other activities, according to a recent
survey of 1,384 parents by Common Sense Media Inc. 
A new generation of Disney fans &#8220;is growing up, and this
is their main platform,&#8221; said Bart Decrem, senior vice
president and general manager of Disney Mobile, a 150-person
unit. &#8220;My gut feeling is, over the next few years, someone will
create a game with a billion gamers on it. We want to be that
company.&#8221; 
Disney already has Swampy&#8217;s career plotted out. A 12-
episode animated series will air on Disney.com and on Google
Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s YouTube sometime in the first quarter of 2012, part of a
deal that will have the two companies spend as much as
$15&#160;million on co-branded content. A book and a movie featuring
the cute green gator could follow, Decrem says. 
&#8216;Angry Birds&#8217; 
The company aims to replicate Rovio Entertainment Oy&#8217;s
success in catapulting &#8220;Angry Birds&#8221; into something beyond a
digital phenomenon. 
The Finnish gamemaker sells 1&#160;million plush toys a month --
along with T-shirts, school lunch boxes and other gear -- and
publishes a comic strip online. There are also plans for
educational books and a movie. 
There&#8217;s no reason why Disney, with its amusement parks,
hundreds of stores and a cruise line, can&#8217;t do the same, said
Jack Kent, an analyst at researcher IHS Screen Digest. 
&#8220;Disney is one of the experts in merchandising,&#8221; he said. 
Disney last year acquired social-gaming company Playdom
Inc. and mobile-games maker Tapulous Inc., where Decrem was
chief executive officer. 
Swampy&#8217;s Emotions 
Working in this new medium required some adjustments for
Disney&#8217;s animators. Swampy had to be able to show emotions
within the constraints of a tiny phone screen. 
The company says it solved the problem by developing a
special technique that doesn&#8217;t require gamers to download large
files. It also has put more effort into character development
and storytelling than is typical for a mobile game -- an
investment it hopes will pay off as Swampy makes the progression
from mobile devices to streaming video, and perhaps eventually
the big screen. 
Disney is confident enough about its alligator&#8217;s ability to
navigate the digital shoals that it&#8217;s already considering two
more original characters for mobile gadgets. 
&#8220;We want to create new characters that are born and sized
for this platform,&#8221; said Decrem.

General Mills Inc. (GIS), the maker of
Cheerios cereal and Yoplait yogurt, sold $1 billion of notes as
U.S. bond sales exceed the 2011 average for the fourth
consecutive week. 
The Minneapolis-based food manufacturer, rated Baa1 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and an equivalent BBB+ by Standard 
Poor&#8217;s, issued 3.15 percent notes due in December 2021 that
yield 125 basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Companies have sold $24.9 billion of bonds in the U.S. so
far this week, equaling the $23.2 billion weekly average this
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The higher-than-
average sales totals signal improved confidence that the U.S.

General Maritime Corp. (GMR), the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, filed for bankruptcy
protection from creditors after falling oil demand and a surplus
of ships led to two years of losses. 
The New York-based company listed assets of $1.71 billion
and debt of $1.41 billion today in a Chapter 11 petition in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. Lender Oaktree Capital Management
LP agreed to make a $175 million equity investment and a group
led by Nordea Bank Finland Plc will provide as much as $100
million in financing to help the company through reorganization,
General Maritime said. 
&#8220;There will be others joining them&#8221; in bankruptcy, Nigel Prentis, a London-based analyst at HSBC Shipping, said by phone
today. &#8220;If you look at the listed universe of tanker companies,
you are seeing their share prices have just collapsed this year.
The stock market has given up on them.&#8221; 
Freight rates for oil carriers have fallen to the lowest in
at least 14 years, prompting General Maritime to warn in a Sept.
30 regulatory filing that it might file bankruptcy.    Single-
voyage rates for very large crude carriers, hauling about 20
percent of the world&#8217;s oil, averaged $7,627 a day this year,
compared with $32,006 in 2010, according to the London-based
Baltic Exchange, which publishes costs along more than 50
maritime routes. 
Angeliki Frangou, who heads three shipping companies
controlling more than 100 vessels, said this month that
bankruptcies within the industry will accelerate. Korea Line
Corp. (005880), Korea&#8217;s second-largest operator of dry-bulk ships, sought
U.S. bankruptcy protection in February. Time-chartered operators
Britannia Bulk Plc, Armada (Singapore) Pte Ltd. and Transfield
ER Cape also have filed for bankruptcy. 
Ship Glut 
The sovereign-debt crisis in Europe is curbing lending to
the industry, Frangou, the chief executive officer of Navios
Maritime Holdings Inc. (NM) and two related companies, said in a Nov.
10 interview. At the same time, a glut of ships has depressed
the price of vessels hauling oil, dry-bulk raw materials and
refined petroleum products. 
The global fleet of very large crude carriers has expanded
about 9 percent to 570 ships in the past two years, the most
since 1983, according to London-based Clarkson Research Services
Ltd., a unit of the world&#8217;s largest shipbroker. Owners ordered
the greatest number of new vessels since the 1970s between 2006
and 2008, when charter rates surged to as much as $289,000. 
Oil Demand 
Those tankers started joining the fleet just as global
demand for oil fell by the most in 27 years, according to data
from London-based BP Plc. The International Energy Agency, the
Paris-based adviser to 28 nations, in September reduced its
forecast for 2012 crude demand by 0.4 percent to 90.7 million
barrels a day. It was the biggest cut since April 2009. 
Seaborne oil shipments into the U.S. were forecast to drop
to 6.9 million barrels a day, or 17 percent of crude this year,
an 11-year low, according to Clarkson. Tankers are going unused
partly because domestic production in the U.S., the world&#8217;s
largest petroleum market, is at an eight-year high. 
The depressed shipping rates mean owners of vessels bought
at higher prices are unable to cover operating costs and repay
loans, Frangou said. General Maritime, which operates in the
Caribbean, South and Central America, the U.S., Western Africa
and the North Sea, has a fleet of 31 double-hull tankers,
according to its website. 
&#8220;Operations are to continue without interruption&#8221; the
company said in a statement. &#8220;General Maritime expects to
substantially reduce its funded indebtedness and enhance its
liquidity profile.&#8221; 
&#8216;Easier to Accept&#8217; 
General Maritime&#8217;s new financing agreement with lenders may
reassure companies that hire oil tankers, said Erik Folkeson Jensen, an analyst at First Securities ASA in Oslo. 
&#8220;Charterers will be a bit reluctant toward companies that
might get their ships arrested because they have failed to pay
down debt or make interest payments,&#8221; Jensen said by phone.
&#8220;Now that General Maritime has been given a deal, it might be
easier for charterers to accept General Maritime vessels.&#8221; 
Like Frangou, Norwegian shipping billionaire John Fredriksen and New York-based Wilbur Ross, chairman of private-
equity firm WL Ross  Co., are looking to acquire distressed
shipping companies. Fredriksen said in May that he would
consider buying tankers within &#8220;a year or two&#8221; as rates slide.
Ross, who invested in shipping for the first time three months
ago, said in August that deploying &#8220;another few hundred
million&#8221; in the industry &#8220;is certainly easy to do.&#8221; 
Balance Sheet 
General Maritime has been restructuring its balance sheets
since at least March, when it took out a $200 million loan from
Oaktree Capital Management to refinance 2005 debt and amend 2010
debt, according to the most recent annual report, filed in
March. 
Chief Executive Officer John Tavlarios said in July that
the company made transactions to increase its liquidity, as it
announced a loss excluding some items of $36.8 million for the
quarter ended June 30, more than double the $14 million loss in
the same period a year earlier. 
Among the largest unsecured creditors listed in court
papers were Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), trustee for holders
of $300 million in 12 percent callable bonds due in 2017. 
The notes fell 1 cent to 9 cents on the dollar as of 10:01
a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The debt
has plunged from 101.5 cents in December 2010 and is at the
lowest on record. 
Share Decline 
In August, General Maritime led declines in oil-tanker
stocks as analysts predicted a return to recession in the U.S.
would delay any rebound in charter rates for tankers until after
2013. On Aug. 22, the company said it had received a delisting
notice as its share price failed to meet the New York Stock
Exchange&#8217;s minimum requirements. 
The shares closed yesterday at 16 cents, down 95 percent
this year. Trading was delayed today. 
Peter C. Georgiopoulos, founder and chairman of General
Maritime and also chairman of Athens-based Aegean Marine
Petroleum Network Inc. (ANW), holds more than 5 percent of General
Maritime, according to the bankruptcy petition. 
Oil-tanker companies may demolish the most ships since 2003
to reduce the glut and lift charter rates. Owners might break up
5 percent of the fleet within 18 months, said Michael Pak, an
analyst at Clarkson Capital Markets LLC in Houston. 
Ship Scrapping 
Scrapping won&#8217;t be enough to make ships profitable. Freight
derivatives, traded by brokers and used to bet on future rates,
anticipate a 68 percent jump to $12,817 a day in 2013 compared
with this year&#8217;s average so far. That&#8217;s still 43 percent of what
Frontline Ltd., the biggest operator, says it needs to cover
costs. 
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service cut its credit grade on General
Maritime&#8217;s debt to Caa3 in September, citing the increasing
likelihood of a restructuring because of &#8220;weak sector
fundamentals.&#8221; Lower freight rates also are reducing the market
value of tanker vessels, cutting another source of liquidity,
the Moody&#8217;s analysts wrote. 
Prices for new vessels have plunged as much as a third from
a record three years ago, while used ships lost 38 percent of
their value, according to data from Clarkson. 
The case is In re General Maritime Corp., 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world&#8217;s
largest brokerage, hired Richard Lindquist from Guggenheim
Partners LLC as head of high yield in its asset-management
business. 
Lindquist will oversee about $1.7 billion in assets and
report to Michael Kushma, chief investment officer for global
fixed-income, according to an internal memo obtained today by
Bloomberg News. Matt Burkhard, a spokesman for New York-based
Morgan Stanley, confirmed the contents of the memo. 
Greg Fleming, who took over as head of Morgan Stanley
Investment Management last year, identified high-yield investing
as one of the unit&#8217;s most significant product gaps. The
division&#8217;s revenue is down 20 percent in the first nine months
of the year, as a 16 percent increase in traditional asset-
management revenue has been outweighed by declines in real-
estate investment and merchant-banking revenue. 
Lindquist will be a senior member of MSIM&#8217;s fixed-income
strategy team, according to the memo. He was co-head of U.S.
high yield at Guggenheim since 2009, and previously worked at
HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and Credit Suisse Group AG.

General Motors Co. (GM) will introduce
its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid car in China at an auto show
on Nov. 21, and dealers will begin taking orders for the model
&#8220;shortly,&#8221; the automaker said. 
&#8220;This will be relatively low-volume,&#8221; Kevin Wale,
president of the Detroit-based company&#8217;s China unit, said in a
phone interview yesterday in Shanghai, declining to comment on
specifics including pricing before the show in Guangzhou.
&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to use this as a statement for technology and the
beginning of the path towards electrification.&#8221; 
GM will be first among the world&#8217;s largest automakers to
sell a plug-in car in China, where rivals including Daimler AG (DAI)
and Nissan Motor Co. also plan to introduce similar models.
Electric-car sales in China are forecast to exceed those in the
U.S. by 2020, helped by government subsidies and investment as
the Asian nation, the world&#8217;s largest polluter, seeks to cut
emissions, according to the Boston Consulting Group. 
The Volt, which is powered by an electric battery for about
40 miles before a gasoline engine kicks in, retails in the U.S.
for $39,995 before a federal tax credit. 
The model will complement an all-electric car that GM is
working to develop with its Chinese partner, SAIC Motor Corp.,
Wale said. 
Daimler is working with Shenzhen-based carmaker BYD Co. to
introduce an electric vehicle in China in 2013, the Stuttgart,
Germany-based automaker said in April. Nissan plans to export
its all-electric Leaf car to China for fleet sales, the
Yokohama, Japan-based company said in September. 
Toyota Prius 
Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) started a yearlong test of its Prius
plug-in hybrid in the city of Tianjin early this year, and the
model isn&#8217;t being sold to consumers yet, said Niu Yu, a
spokesman for the Toyota City, Japan-based automaker. 
Electric cars may account for as much as 7 percent of total
auto sales in China, the world&#8217;s largest vehicle market, by
2020, Boston Consulting said in a June 14 report. Chinese
consumers are more receptive to the technology than their U.S.
and European counterparts, with more than 90 percent showing
interest, the report found. 
&#8220;To achieve a breakthrough, carmakers must offer
attractive mass-market vehicles, and the vehicles&#8217; relatively
high price and smaller driving range must be addressed,&#8221; said
Marco Gerrits, a Beijing-based partner at the consulting
company. 
Currently, buyers of energy-efficient cars in Shanghai,
Shenzhen and four other Chinese cities qualify for a 60,000 yuan
($9,450) subsidy. The government aims to have 1 million
electric-powered vehicles on the road by 2015, according to the
Ministry of Science. 
Lower Parking Fees 
State media have reported China would support the use of
such vehicles through favorable policies and buying incentives.
Alternative-energy cars will be exempt from current license-
plate and traffic restrictions in some major cities, Xinhua News
reported Nov. 12, citing a government notice. 
There are 25 Chinese cities running trials for alternative-
energy vehicles, and local authorities must develop policies to
promote their adoption, including building charging points at
government agencies, hospitals and shopping malls, Xinhua said. 
The trial cities should also lower fees for parking,
electricity and road use for such vehicles and adjust the
purchase policies of government agencies and state-linked
companies, according to the report, citing the National
Development and Reform Commission and the ministries of science
and technology, finance, and industry and information
Technology. 
China Demand 
China&#8217;s auto demand may grow 5 to 10 percent next year,
driven by demand for passenger cars, Wale said today. Sales of
commercial vehicles, which have dipped this year, will grow 5
percent, he forecast. 
GM will expand its luxury Cadillac brand and distribution
network and broaden its range of sport-utility vehicles, he
said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a much greater move to individuality in
terms of colors and body styles,&#8221; said Wale, who aims for GM&#8217;s
China sales to grow faster than the overall market in 2012. 
The U.S. carmaker is counting on China to overtake Toyota
in global sales this year. GM expanded deliveries in the Asian
nation 6.9 percent from a year earlier to 2,113,274 vehicles in
the first 10 months of 2011, according to the company.

The amount of oil that has leaked
into the ocean from a sea-floor fissure near a Chevron Corp. (CVX)
well in Brazil may be four times as large as previously
estimated, the country&#8217;s oil regulator said. 
As much as 2,640 barrels have gushed into the sea during an
eight-day period, and oil continues to leak, the agency, known
as the ANP, said in an e-mailed statement today. 
Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, said Nov. 15 that
the oil slick caused by the spill was as much as 650 barrels. At
that time, the company said flows from the well appeared to have
ceased. 
Chevron has &#8220;substantially reduced&#8221; oil leaking from a
fissure after it began plugging an exploration well Nov. 15th at
the Frade offshore project, ANP said. The agency is
investigating the causes of the spill and is auditing safety
conditions at the project&#8217;s platform. 
Brazil may tighten environmental regulations as the country
plans to double oil output over the next decade, tapping fields
in the so-called pre-salt region of the Atlantic Ocean, Adriano Pires, head of the Brazilian Center for Infrastructure, said
today in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro. 
&#8220;This could slow the expansion process if the government
implements more strict environmental regulations,&#8221; Pires said.
&#8220;This tells Brazilian society that the story about transforming
the pre-salt region isn&#8217;t that simple.&#8221; 
Chevron didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail and phone
call today seeking comment. 
Production hasn&#8217;t been halted at Frade, located in deep
waters of the Campos Basin, according to Chevron. Oil was
leaking from fissures on the ocean floor near a well the company
was drilling and then plugged.

General Maritime Corp., the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, can draw $30 million of a $75
million loan that will require it to file a plan of
reorganization in 75 days or sell all its assets. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan court today
approved the company&#8217;s request to borrow funds from Nordea Bank
Finland Plc and other lenders. The company, which operates in
over 230 ports of call in over 70 countries, filed for
bankruptcy yesterday after falling oil demand and a surplus of
ships led to two years of losses. 
The loan &#8220;is critical for the survival of the company,&#8221;
General Maritime&#8217;s bankruptcy counsel, Kenneth Eckstein, told
Glenn today. 
General Maritime hopes to file a reorganization plan in
January, Eckstein said in court today. If the company doesn&#8217;t
outline the terms of a plan within 75 days from its Nov. 17
filing, it must sell all its assets through an auction, under
the requirements of its $75 million loan, he said. Oaktree
Capital Management LP, a lender, would be the so-called stalking
horse, or starting bidder, for that auction. 
General Maritime owns 30 vessels and charters three, giving
it a total carrying capacity of 5.3 million deadweight tons. Its
vessels are registered in Bermuda, Liberia or the Marshall
Islands. Its publicly held securities include 121.5 million
common shares and $300 million in unsecured 12 percent notes due
2017, according to court papers. 
Milestones 
&#8220;There are various milestones,&#8221; required by the loan,
Eckstein said, adding that the company will use its time in
bankruptcy to seek a financial sponsor. Moelis  Co. is serving
as the company&#8217;s financial adviser. 
A group of General Maritime Corp. noteholders opposed a
request for the loan. Its terms would &#8220;serve to prematurely
limit or foreclose the rights of unsecured creditors or any
official committee appointed to represent their interests,&#8221; the
group said in court papers filed today. 
The ad-hoc group, which doesn&#8217;t have formal standing in the
case, owns over $185 million in 12 percent senior notes due
2017. It includes Capital Research and Management Company, J.P.
Morgan Investment Management, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
Stone Harbor Investment Partners LP and Third Avenue Focused
Credit Fund. 
General Maritime already has a rough plan to restructure
with certain lenders; negotiations leading up to its bankruptcy
led to a &#8220;restructuring support agreement&#8221; under which lender
Oaktree Capital Management LP agreed to make a $175 million
equity investment. 
New Company 
Glenn ordered that papers detailing the support agreement
be filed publicly in court papers. 
The agreement will convert all of the company&#8217;s debt into
stock in a newly created company, and lenders would agree to
vote in support of a plan of reorganization under certain terms,
according to court papers. Supporting lenders in the agreement
include those to a $550 million loan made in May 2011, and a
$372 million loan made in May 2010, according to court papers. 
The noteholder group said in its objection that junior
secured lenders to a $200 million loan, which includes an
affiliate of Oaktree, shouldn&#8217;t benefit from protections given
to Nordea Bank and other lenders to the $75 million &#8220;debtor-in-
possession&#8221; financing. Such loans allow companies to keep
operating in bankruptcy and give them a higher priority to be
repaid. 
Reserve 
They also said a $75,000 reserve set aside to fund
investigations into any claims the estate might have is too low. 
General Maritime and its lenders agreed to slight changes
in the loan today before it was approved, including a clause
which said unsecured creditors can challenge that cap. 
Freight rates for oil carriers have fallen to the lowest in
at least 14 years, prompting General Maritime to warn in a Sept.
30 regulatory filing that it might file bankruptcy. 
Separately, Glenn granted the company&#8217;s requests today to
pay critical foreign vendors, pay employee wages, continue its
insurance programs, and take other steps typical at the outset
of a bankruptcy. 
General Maritime said its $75 million loan may be increased
by $25 million subject to the agreement of lenders and certain
other conditions. Fees for the loan will total around $2.3
million, according to court papers. The company&#8217;s non-bankrupt
affiliates will be transferred around $3 million per month,
General Maritime said. 
General Maritime has been restructuring its balance sheet
since at least March, when it took out the $200 million loan
from Oaktree to refinance 2005 debt and amend 2010 debt,
according to the most recent annual report, filed in March. 
The New York-based company listed assets of $1.71 billion
and debt of $1.41 billion today in a Chapter 11 petition in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
The case is In re General Maritime Corp. (GMR), 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, named the smallest group of new
managing directors since 2008 as the firm cuts jobs and grapples
with declining revenue. 
The firm appointed 261 people to managing director, the
company&#8217;s second-highest rank, according to an internal memo
obtained by Bloomberg News. The number is down 19 percent from
last year&#8217;s record list of 321 new managing directors and 
exceeds the 259 promotions in 2008. David Wells, a spokesman
for the New York-based company, didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail and
two phone messages seeking confirmation of the memo. 
Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, said this week that the firm is working to remain
positioned for a rebound even as it eliminates about 1,000 jobs
to contend with a drop in trading revenue. The company set aside
$10 billion for employees&#8217; salaries, bonuses and benefits in the
first nine months of this year, equivalent to $292,836 per

A group of General Maritime Corp.
noteholders opposed a request by the second-largest U.S. owner
of oil tankers to borrow $75 million in bankruptcy. 
General Maritime is scheduled to seek permission from U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan court today to draw
$30 million of a $75 million loan to fund operations while it
reorganizes. The company, which operates in over 230 ports of
call in over 70 countries, filed for bankruptcy protection
yesterday after falling oil demand and a surplus of ships led to
two years of losses. 
The terms of the loan will &#8220;serve to prematurely limit or
foreclose the rights of unsecured creditors or any official
committee appointed to represent their interests,&#8221; the
noteholder group said in court papers filed today. 
The ad-hoc group, which doesn&#8217;t have formal standing in the
case, owns over $185 million in 12 percent senior notes due
2017. It includes Capital Research and Management Company, J.P.
Morgan Investment Management, Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
Stone Harbor Investment Partners LP and Third Avenue Focused
Credit Fund. 
General Maritime&#8217;s proposed loan is from Nordea Bank
Finland Plc and other lenders. The company also has a plan to
restructure with certain lenders; negotiations leading up to its
bankruptcy led to a &#8220;restructuring support agreement&#8221; under
which lender Oaktree Capital Management LP agreed to make a $175
million equity investment. 
New Company 
The agreement will convert all of the company&#8217;s debt into
stock in a newly created company, and lenders would agree to
vote in support of a plan of reorganization under certain terms,
according to court papers. 
The noteholder group said that junior secured lenders to a
$200 million loan, which includes an affiliate of Oaktree,
shouldn&#8217;t benefit from protections given to Nordea Bank and
other lenders to the $75 million &#8220;debtor-in-possession&#8221;
financing. Such loans allow companies to keep operating in
bankruptcy and give them a higher priority to be repaid. 
They also said a $75,000 reserve set aside to fund
investigations into any claims the estate might have is too low. 
Freight rates for oil carriers have fallen to the lowest in
at least 14 years, prompting General Maritime to warn in a Sept.
30 regulatory filing that it might file bankruptcy. 
Single-voyage rates for very large crude carriers, hauling
about 20 percent of the world&#8217;s oil, averaged $7,627 a day this
year, compared with $32,006 in 2010, according to the London-
based Baltic Exchange, which publishes costs along more than 50
maritime routes. 
March Loan 
General Maritime has been restructuring its balance sheet
since at least March, when it took out a $200 million loan from
Oaktree Capital Management to refinance 2005 debt and amend 2010
debt, according to the most recent annual report, filed in
March. 
Among the largest unsecured creditors listed in court
papers were Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK), trustee for holders
of $300 million in 12 percent callable bonds due in 2017. 
The New York-based company listed assets of $1.71 billion
and debt of $1.41 billion today in a Chapter 11 petition in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. 
The case is In re General Maritime Corp. (GMR), 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the second-largest
U.S. energy company, said it is reducing the amount of oil
leaking from a project off the coast of Brazil after plugging
the source of the spill on Nov. 13. 
The amount of oil leaking from fissures on the ocean floor
is less than the &#8220;hundreds of barrels&#8221; that gushed during the
first days after a drilling incident on Nov. 7, said George
Buck, the head of Chevron&#8217;s operations in Brazil. More than 10
barrels a day of &#8220;residual oil&#8221; in the rocks around the well
is still leaking, and the rate continues to decline, Buck said. 
&#8220;The majority of this event has been over for several
days,&#8221; Buck told reporters in Rio de Janeiro. &#8220;We know we
stopped the flow at the reservoir.&#8221; 
Foreign oil companies including Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) are waiting for Brazil to auction new
exploration areas in deep waters of the Atlantic Ocean. Buck
said Chevron will study the spill to prevent similar incidents
in Brazil and other oil producing regions. Chevron is producing
about 80,000 barrels a day at the Frade project and didn&#8217;t halt
production during the spill, which was caused by an appraisal
well, Buck said. 
Pressure Kick 
Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at a
reservoir at the project about 230 miles (370 kilometers)
northeast of Rio, Buck said. The well suffered a &#8220;kick&#8221; of
pressure when it reached the reservoir, causing oil to leak to
fissures on the ocean floor. Chevron cemented shut the section
of well above the reservoir and continues to work on sealing it,
Buck said. 
Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the world&#8217;s biggest offshore-oil driller,
supplied Chevron with the Sedco 706 rig. The Vernier,
Switzerland-based company shut the well properly, Buck said.
Chevron &#8220;takes full responsibility&#8221; for the spill and is
cooperating with the Brazilian government to investigate the
causes, Buck said. 
Buck declined to estimate the cleanup costs or potential
fines. Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator said Nov. 18 that as many as 2,640
barrels of oil spilled during the first eight days after the
incident. Buck said the regulator&#8217;s estimates are &#8220;a good
number.&#8221;

Transocean Ltd. (RIG), the operator of the
rig that exploded in the Gulf of Mexico and caused the worst
U.S. maritime spill, and Chevron Corp. (CVX) may be banned from deep-
water drilling in Brazil after an oil leak. 
Chevron, which was fined 50 million reais ($28 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities, may lose the right to
develop deep-water fields there and be ordered to pay as much as
100 million reais to the regulator, Haroldo Lima, the head of
the agency, said. The regulator may also ban Transocean, Lima
said. Rio de Janeiro state may claim another 100 million reais
in damage, Rio Environment Secretary Carlos Minc said. 
&#8220;If we have reasons to do this, we will,&#8221; Lima told
reporters in Sao Paulo today, referring to a possible downgrade
of the &#8220;class A&#8221; status that allows Chevron to drill in deep
water. &#8220;It will depend on a detailed analysis.&#8221; 
Drilling at Chevron&#8217;s Frade project in the Campos Basin off
Rio&#8217;s coast triggered a leak of as much as 3,000 barrels in
eight days, Lima said. The spill followed a surge of pressure
from an oil reservoir on Nov. 7, George Buck, San Ramon,
California-based Chevron&#8217;s head of operations in Brazil, said in
Rio yesterday. 
Edited Images 
Chevron edited video images that should have been made
available in their entirety to Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator ANP,
director Magda Chambriard said at a press conference in
Brasilia. 
&#8220;The company&#8217;s treatment of the regulatory agency and the
Brazilian government was unacceptable,&#8221; Chambriard said. &#8220;We
had to go aboard the platform to search for the original images
even after the company was notified to provide us with the
video.&#8221; 
Transocean, which owned the rig involved in the 2010
blowout of BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo Well in the Gulf of Mexico, will be
banned from operating in Rio state, Minc said. More than 80
percent of Brazil&#8217;s crude is produced in Rio&#8217;s Campos Basin. 
&#8220;Transocean continues to fully cooperate with Chevron, the
operator of the well, and Brazilian authorities in all aspects
of this matter,&#8221; Guy Cantwell, a Houston-based spokesman for
Transocean, said in a telephone interview. 
Violations 
Chevron may be fined by the oil regulator, known as ANP, as
early as today for inadequate equipment and withholding
information, Lima said. Each violation may cost the company 50
million reais, he said. 
&#8220;Chevron&#8217;s situation to obtain licenses to operate in
Brazil became more difficult after what happened,&#8221; Lima said in
Brasilia. 
Chevron has taken full responsibility for the spill and
brought it under control as fast as it could amid stormy weather
in the region, Buck said. 
&#8220;The moment the seeps were first identified, we
immediately activated our emergency response plan and began
dispatching necessary resources to safely manage the
situation,&#8221; Lloyd Avram, a Chevron spokesman, said in an e-
mailed statement. 
Halted Flow 
The company has halted oil flow from the reservoir and
reduced the amount seeping from fissures in the ocean floor near
the drilling site, Buck said. Transocean wasn&#8217;t responsible for
the leak and acted quickly to help block it, he said. 
Chevron is the third-largest oil producer in Brazil, behind
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc. (RDSA) Frade was Brazil&#8217;s eighth most productive field in
September with 75,000 barrels a day of oil production, according
to the website of the country&#8217;s oil regulator. 
Transocean has 10 rigs operating in Brazilian waters,
including the Petrobras 10000, a 2-year-old vessel designed to
drill seven miles beneath the sea surface and withstand 47-foot
waves. 
Chevron fell 2 percent to $95.90 at 3:53 p.m. in New York.
Transocean dropped 3.6 percent to $45.75.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), operator of the $3.6
billion Frade oilfield off the Brazilian coast, said it hasn&#8217;t
received any notices of fines or other penalties from Brazil&#8217;s
government stemming from a subsea crude leak. 
Chevron is investigating the cause of the leak from cracks
in the sea floor near an appraisal well, Scott Walker, a
spokesman for the San Ramon, California-based company, said
today in an e-mailed statement. The results of the probe will be
turned over to Brazilian authorities, he said in the statement. 
Chevron will be fined 50 million reais ($28 million) for
environmental violations associated with the leaks first spotted
about two weeks ago, Brazilian regulators said today. The
company may lose the right to drill in Brazil&#8217;s deep-water oil
region and could face another 100 million reais in fines,
Haroldo Lima, the head of the country&#8217;s oil agency, said today
during a meeting with reporters in Sao Paulo. 
Chevron may also be penalized for withholding information
from the government and editing video footage of the leaks
before turning it over, said Magda Chambriard, a director of
Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator, known as ANP. 
The sheen on the sea surface has been reduced to 18 barrels,
Walker said. Chevron estimated the entire volume of the leak at
2,400 barrels of oil. 
&#8220;We are committed to deploying resources until the sheen
can no longer be detected,&#8221; the company said in the statement. 
Transocean&#8217;s Role 
Chevron is the third-largest oil producer in Brazil, behind
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Royal Dutch Shell
Plc. Frade was Brazil&#8217;s eighth most productive field in
September with 75,000 barrels a day of oil production, according
to the website of the country&#8217;s oil regulator. 
Transocean Ltd. (RIG), owner of the rig under lease to Chevron at
the time of the leak, may also face a ban in water adjacent to
Rio de Janaeiro, Carlos Minc, environment secretary for Rio
state, said today. 
Transocean has 10 rigs operating in Brazilian waters,
including the Petrobras 10000, a 2-year-old vessel designed to
drill seven miles beneath the sea surface and withstand 47-foot
waves.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley (MS) pressed the Federal Reserve
earlier this month on the potential unintended consequences
stemming from its proposed ban on proprietary trading. 
Bank lawyers H. Rodgin Cohen and Michael Wiseman from
Sullivan  Cromwell also attended the Nov. 8 meeting, according
to documents released by the Fed today. The firms discussed
&#8220;possible unintended consequences of the rule,&#8221; according to
the Fed. 
The proposal, which bans banks from investing more than 3
percent of their Tier 1 capital in private-equity or hedge
funds, will cost U.S. national banks about $1 billion in extra
regulatory and capital costs, according to a Sept. 7 analysis by
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. 
U.S. lawmakers passed the Volcker rule last year as part of
the Dodd-Frank Act, aiming to curb risk-taking by bank holding
companies that receive federal assistance. Wall Street firms
have shut or spun off some funds that wager their capital in
advance of the rule, named after former Fed chairman Paul Volcker.

company will name later, said Cathy Clegg, GM&#8217;s vice president
of labor relations. 
&#8220;Our No. 1 priority in auto negotiations this year was
jobs,&#8221; Bob King, president of the United Auto Workers, said in
the statement. Joe Ashton, vice president of the Detroit-based
union&#8217;s GM department, has said getting work for the Tennessee
plant was one of the union&#8217;s main objectives in contract talks
with the automaker that concluded in September. 
The UAW has said that GM, the largest U.S. automaker, will
add or retain 6,400 jobs and invest $2.5 billion in its plants
as part of their four-year contract ratified by members Sept.
28. 
GM will use the Spring Hill plant to build a &#8220;variety&#8221; of
vehicles off of different base architectures, Clegg told workers
today at the factory. 
&#8216;Flex&#8217; Operation 
&#8220;The flex operation can change products frequently based
on what we need to do in the market,&#8221; Clegg said. GM may be
able to add production of a model that&#8217;s selling well in as
little as four to six months, she said. 
The additional Equinox production will supplement output
from GM&#8217;s CAMI Automotive plant in Ingersoll, Ontario, and a
factory in Oshawa, Ontario. There is &#8220;no impact&#8221; to production
from those operations for &#8220;the foreseeable future,&#8221; Clegg said
today on a conference call with reporters. 
GM idled its assembly plant in Spring Hill, about 35 miles
(56 kilometers) south of Nashville, in November 2009, when it
was making Chevrolet Traverse SUVs. The factory made GM&#8217;s first
Saturn, a red SL sedan, in July 1990, according to the company&#8217;s
website. 
Saturn and the Tennessee plant had been championed by
former Chief Executive Officer Roger Smith as GM&#8217;s way to
profitably build small cars. The brand evolved into an
experiment in marketing, where dealers offered &#8220;no-haggle&#8221;
pricing. Saturn owners formed clubs to celebrate the small car.
Smith died in 2007 at age 82. 
Saturn Brand 
GM shuttered Saturn, Hummer and Pontiac and sold Saab as it
pared U.S. brands to four from eight as part of its $50 billion
government rescue and 2009 bankruptcy. The automaker has said
its new labor contract will cost $215 million over the next
three years as it raises wages for entry-level employees and
buys out some of its most expensive laborers. 
GM fell 3.5 percent to $20.92 at 1:20 p.m. New York time. 
Labor costs will rise 1 percent a year during GM&#8217;s contract
with the UAW, the smallest increase in a contract in four
decades, the company has said. 
The Spring Hill plant will reopen as part of an
&#8220;innovative staffing and operating agreement&#8221; that allows GM
to build different vehicles on several platforms, Dan Ammann,
the company&#8217;s chief financial officer, said in a Sept. 28
conference call with analysts. Clegg didn&#8217;t elaborate on the
staffing agreement today at the plant.

Thirty-six years after his death,
Spanish Dictator General Francisco Franco managed to make his
presence felt in Spain&#8217;s general elections yesterday. 
Socialist Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero had
called for the vote to be held on the anniversary of the
Generalissimo&#8217;s death. Nov. 20 is a day celebrated each year by
remnants of Franco&#8217;s fascist following in acts that are loathed
by millions of Spaniards who were marked by his dictatorship or
scarred by the bloody civil war that produced it. 
Still, the vote&#8217;s outcome shows how the ghost of Franco,
and the Socialists&#8217; attempts to associate the winning People&#8217;s
Party with its fascists roots, have lost most of their power.
The PP, founded by a minister in Franco&#8217;s last government, won
the biggest parliamentary majority in almost 30 years and will
bring leader Mariano Rajoy to power within a month. 
Zapatero &#8220;chose the date to sow division but I don&#8217;t
care,&#8221; said Maria Asuncion Moreno, a 69 year-old homemaker
celebrating victory outside the PP&#8217;s Madrid headquarters last
night. &#8220;The PP has nothing to do with Franco.&#8221; 
The pro-business party, which governs in 11 of 17 of the
country&#8217;s autonomous regions, has a chance to unseat the
Socialists in their southern stronghold of Andalusia in March
elections after yesterday&#8217;s landslide victory. 
In a reflection of how Spain&#8217;s fascist past stays part of
its democratic present, both Rajoy and the Socialist candidate
Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba commented on how the incident-free
polling day and 72 percent turnout had bolstered Spanish
democracy. Rubalcaba&#8217;s campaign manager, Elena Valenciano, said
in a televised statement &#8220;the main winner today has been
democracy, which emerges strengthened.&#8221; 
&#8216;Absolute Power&#8217; 
The Socialist party traditionally plays on many Spaniards&#8217;
willingness to associate the PP with its fascist roots.
Rubalcaba, trailing by 15 percentage points in the polls, closed
the campaign in a Nov. 18 interview in El Pais newspaper by
appealing to voters to prevent the right from gaining &#8220;absolute
power.&#8221; 
Zapatero cited his grandfather, who was shot by Franco&#8217;s
firing squads, as the inspiration for his political career. The
man was a soldier who fought to preserve the Second Republic of
Spain of the 1930s that was overthrown by Franco&#8217;s Nationalists. 
During the 7 1/2 years of Zapatero&#8217;s mandate, he stirred
controversy by opening an inquiry into Republicans executed by
Franco&#8217;s troops and dumped in unmarked graves around Spain. 
The date he chose this year for early elections is when
Franco&#8217;s relatives and sympathizers traditionally gather for a
mass in his honor at the Valley of the Fallen memorial in the
mountains outside Madrid. Hundreds of Catholics filed past
Franco&#8217;s grave, decorated with flowers, to take communion at
yesterday&#8217;s service in a church that had standing room only. 
Mass, Mausoleum 
The monument to soldiers killed in the three-year civil war
is a magnet for Franco supporters who mark Nov. 20, or &#8220;20-N&#8221;
as it&#8217;s known in Spain, by holding their traditional mass there.
The complex was built partly by prisoners from the socialist and
anarchist forces that opposed him. 
&#8220;There has to be a change and the only party that can lead
the change is the PP,&#8221; Jose Manuel Florez, 39, said yesterday
after the mass held at Franco&#8217;s mausoleum in the mountains
outside Madrid. &#8220;They have a lot of work to do.&#8221; 
Florez, a dental implant salesman, attended the religious
service wearing a fascist flag as a neckerchief. Afterward,
outside the basilica where the dictator is buried, his son shot
a smartphone photograph of Florez making a fascist salute while
others sang Franco&#8217;s anthem, &#8220;Face to the Sun.&#8221; 
PP loyalists say their party has again been left to restore
order after the Socialists left the country in a mess. Rajoy&#8217;s
PP predecessor Jose Maria Aznar, came to power in 1996 after the
Felipe Gonzalez government was weakened by a string of
corruption scandals and a recession. 
Aznar Era 
&#8220;When Aznar came to power he found a country in a very bad
state and put it back on the right track,&#8221; said Moreno. &#8220;We
hope this is what is going to happen again, that is why we came
here today,&#8221; she said at the Rajoy victory celebration. 
Franco&#8217;s remaining supporters credit the dictator with
preventing the country&#8217;s collapse after the Second Republic or
falling under the sway of the Soviet Union. 
&#8220;Spain was in ruins when Franco took over and he kept the
country together,&#8221; said Luis Alonso Garcia, 59, a fruit and
vegetable seller smoking a cigar and leaning on his walking
stick outside the basilica. &#8220;We didn&#8217;t have much but what we
had was ours. People today have bought a load of useless rubbish
on their credit cards and now they can&#8217;t pay the bills.&#8221; 
Unemployment reached 22 percent in the third quarter while
the government&#8217;s borrowing costs in a bond auction last week
were back up at the level investors demanded before Spain joined
the single currency in 1999. 
Family vs Country 
El Pais, the left-leaning daily, which didn&#8217;t endorse the
Socialists in the election, ran a three-page story Nov. 19 on
how Franco was &#8220;more effective in securing the future of his
family than his country.&#8221; The newspaper described the Franco
family&#8217;s real estate holdings across Spain including a location
used to shoot erotic movie scenes southwest of Madrid. 
Even with the biggest Parliamentary majority in 29 years,
Rajoy faces a challenge to maintain public support, said Antonio Barroso, an analyst at Eurasia Group. The new leader&#8217;s program
is likely to include additional spending cuts as he aims to
restore the country&#8217;s AAA-rating. 
Unions will likely resist attempts to loosen labor laws and
even some PP voters were turned off by corruption charges that
forced the party&#8217;s regional leader for Valencia to resign. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll vote for the PP while holding my nose,&#8221; said
Agustin Velasco, 75, in an interview yesterday outside the mass.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the PP but I want the Socialists out.&#8221;

Seattle&#8217;s chief technology officer,
Bill Schrier, is bracing for a 6 percent budget cut in 2012,
bigger than this year&#8217;s, a sign of tighter spending that
indicates slower sales gains for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Intel Corp. (INTC) 
&#8220;Spending is going to be down, and in some places it&#8217;s
going to be down considerably,&#8221; Schrier said of technology
spending by governments generally. 
Schrier is likely to be told to cut even more next year, so
he&#8217;s delaying upgrades to Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 7, cutting
services contracts from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
and seeking cheaper alternatives to gear from Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) 
Belt-tightening in the biggest city in the Pacific
Northwest reflects a larger trend: Financial-services companies
such as Western  Southern Financial Group and governments,
including the state of California, will cut or leave spending on
information technology unchanged next year as economic growth
slows. That means some technology bellwethers, including Intel,
Microsoft, IBM and Cisco, may suffer. 
&#8220;It will be a tough environment just because there&#8217;s so
much pessimism out there,&#8221; said Richard Gordon, an analyst at
market research firm Gartner Inc. The industry will need to
prepare for &#8220;general downward pressure everywhere.&#8221; 
While Gartner now expects information technology spending
among businesses to rise 3.9 percent next year, less than the
5.9 percent increase for 2011, the Stamford, Connecticut-based
research firm will probably cut that forecast at the end of the
quarter, Gordon said. 
VMware May Benefit 
Some businesses that seek to stretch technology dollars may
step up spending on products that are designed to save money,
such as VMware Inc. (VMW)&#8217;s so-called virtualization software, which
helps clients make more efficient use of data centers. Other
companies that represent &#8220;areas of strength&#8221; include Citrix
Systems Inc. (CTXS) and SAP AG (SAP), according to Morgan Stanley. 
Technology budgets will rise just 0.6 percent over the next
year, according to a September survey of U.S. and European CIOs
by UBS AG. 
As a result, sales growth will slow next year for companies
like Microsoft and IBM, which rely on government and financial-
services customers, said Gordon. Sales at Armonk, New York-based
IBM, the largest provider of technology services, will rise only
3 percent in 2012, less than half this year&#8217;s 7 percent pace,
according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. 
At Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, the largest
software maker, sales in fiscal 2012 will increase only 7
percent, compared with 12 percent in 2011. 
&#8216;Real Risk&#8217; 
Revenue will climb 8 percent in fiscal 2012 at Oracle Corp. (ORCL),
the top seller of database software, compared with 33 percent
the prior year, while the rate of increase at Intel, the biggest
maker of computer chips, is projected to be 6 percent, a
fraction of this year&#8217;s estimated 26 percent, according to
Bloomberg data. 
The outlook for many executives dimmed in the second half
as Europe&#8217;s credit crisis spiraled, and more recently as
flooding in Thailand has threatened the supply of computer hard-
disk drives. Among corporate chief financial officers surveyed
by Duke University and CFO Magazine, 65 percent said they were
less optimistic about the U.S. economy in the third quarter than
they were in the second. 
&#8220;There is a real risk, and it would be foolish to say
otherwise,&#8221; said Michael Holland, chairman of Holland  Co.,
which oversees about $4 billion, including shares of Microsoft,
Intel and IBM. &#8220;To be realistic is to expect things to be a
little less than the level that they were this year.&#8221; 
Zero Spending Growth 
Speculation that technology stocks will decline has left
options traders at their most bearish since May 2010. Three-
month puts to sell the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) cost
10.44 points more than calls to buy, according to implied-
volatility data compiled by Bloomberg. The price relationship
known as skew increased 78 percent in the past four months and
reached 11.67 on Nov. 9, the widest in 17 months. 
Life insurer Western  Southern Financial Group is keeping
its technology budget flat next year after a 2 percent increase
this year, Chief Technology Officer Douglas Ross said. The
Cincinnati-based company is investing in virtualization software
from VMware so it can cut purchases of server computers from
Dell Inc. (DELL) and Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and storage products from EMC
Corp. and NetApp Inc. (NTAP), he said. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot of scrutiny on whether the economy is
slowing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly concerned about it. The
management team is really looking at every item to figure out
what we can dispense with.&#8221; 
Demand from businesses this year was a bright spot for some
companies, including Microsoft and Intel, as consumers curtailed
spending on personal computers and other electronics. It won&#8217;t
provide as big a cushion in 2012. 
Thai Flooding Impact 
PC shipments will drop by as much as 13.4 percent in the
first quarter because of supply constraints and rising prices
related to flooding in Thailand, according to researcher IDC.
That&#8217;s down from a previous forecast for an 8.2 percent gain. 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) will boost its technology
spending by 3.7 percent. While that&#8217;s about the same as last
year, it&#8217;s more modest than the bank&#8217;s historical increases,
which range from 4 percent to 6 percent, Chief Information
Officer John Fiore said. The bank is saving money by moving all
but the most complicated technology services to India, instead
of using vendors like IBM and Accenture Plc (ACN), he said. 
While the State of California hasn&#8217;t finished its budget,
Secretary of California Technology Carlos Ramos predicts another
year of cuts. 
Insulated at Oracle 
The growth slowdown will hit some areas of technology
harder than others. Spending on technology services will rise
4.4 percent in 2012, compared with 7.3 percent growth this year,
according to Gartner. Spending on server computers will increase
5.8 percent, down from 11 percent this year, while software
spending will climb 7.4 percent next year, below this year&#8217;s 8.7
percent. 
Companies that have a high percentage of recurring revenue
from maintenance contracts, such as CA Inc. (CA), or large cash piles,
including Microsoft and Redwood City, California-based Oracle,
have some insulation against sudden swings in customer spending,
said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. 
Some companies are increasing spending on areas that will
help them reduce expenses in the long run or reach new customers.
Equifax Inc. (EFX), the provider of consumer credit information, will
lift spending by 4 percent to 6 percent in 2012 after a 4
percent increase this year. The spending is aimed at helping the
company deliver on a pledge to investors that 10 percent of
sales will come from new products, CIO David Webb said. 
&#8216;After the Accident&#8217; 
&#8220;Most companies today are totally dependent on technology
for growth and even if there is contraction in the general
market, to stay abreast of competition you have no choice but to
invest in technology,&#8221; Webb said. 
Even companies that plan higher spending may favor modest
increases, said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland,
Oregon-based Becker Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.2
billion in assets. Continued turmoil in Europe or in the broader
market may spook CEOs and CFOs who are still scarred from the
recession. 
&#8220;This is a world of driving after the car accident,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;After you get in an accident, you&#8217;re a little jumpy and
you go slower.&#8221;

Walt Disney Co. (DIS) named John Skipper
president of ESPN, succeeding George Bodenheimer, who becomes
the profitable sports network&#8217;s executive chairman and gives up
oversight of day-to-day operations. 
Skipper, 55, previously executive vice president of
content, also becomes co-chairman of Disney Media Networks, the
Burbank, California-based entertainment and theme-park company
said today in a statement. The moves are effective Jan. 1. 
Bodenheimer, 53, initiated the succession discussions this
year, Disney said. In his 13 years as president, ESPN has grown
to include eight U.S. television networks, five high-definition
services and a 3-D network. The sports network operates 48
international channels, 18 websites and has 750 radio
affiliates, Disney said. 
Disney fell 0.9 percent to $34.02 at the close in New York
time. The stock has declined 9.3 percent this year. 
Media networks, led by cable outlets such as ESPN, are
Disney&#8217;s largest business, with pay-TV channels contributing a
third of the $10.4 billion of sales in the fourth quarter ended
Oct. 1. The cable networks produced 60 percent of Disney&#8217;s
operating profit of $2.11 billion. Hearst Corp. owns 20 percent
of ESPN. 
In his new role, Bodenheimer will continue to serve as
chairman of ESPN&#8217;s board, provide strategic direction and
support a seamless transition, Disney said. Skipper has been
head of content since October 2005.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chairman Bill Gates
faced more cross-examination on allegations that the world&#8217;s
largest software maker undermined Novell Inc.&#8217;s WordPerfect
program. 
Novell said in its 2004 complaint that Microsoft unfairly
restricted competition by using its monopoly on personal
computer operating systems to suppress a rival word-processing
program. Jeffrey Johnson, Novell&#8217;s lawyer, continued his
questioning of Gates, 56, today in federal court in Salt Lake
City. 
Johnson began his cross-examination yesterday by asking
Gates about the U.S. government&#8217;s landmark antitrust case
against Microsoft that was settled more than eight years ago. In
that case, Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft was declared an
illegal monopolist. 
Gates acknowledged &#8220;there was a lawsuit&#8221; and &#8220;findings&#8221;
concluding Microsoft engaged in anticompetitive conduct. 
Gates told Microsoft lawyer Steven Holley yesterday that he
&#8220;absolutely&#8221; denied the central allegation of Novell&#8217;s suit,
that in 1994, in developing the Windows 95 operating system,
Microsoft blocked an element of the software to thwart Novell&#8217;s
WordPerfect and Quattro Pro programs. 
&#8216;Pretty Irrelevant&#8217; 
While the elements restricted from the operating system may
have been useful to companies developing e-mail programs, they
were &#8220;pretty irrelevant&#8221; to word-processing, Gates testified. 
Johnson today showed the court an e-mail that Microsoft
lawyers had asked Gates about yesterday. The Oct. 3, 1994, e-
mail from Gates to Brad Silverberg, a Microsoft senior vice
president, and other employees concerned the &#8220;shell,&#8221; which
displayed file names in the Windows 95 operating system. 
The message addressed Gates&#8217;s decision to restrict outside
programmers&#8217; access to &#8220;extensions,&#8221; or programming code, a
decision that Novell claims deliberately targeted WordPerfect
and made it impossible to run properly on Windows. 
&#8220;I have decided that we should not publish these
extensions,&#8221; Gates wrote in the message. &#8220;We should wait until
we have a way to do a high level of integration that will be
harder for likes of Notes, Wordperfect to achieve, and which
will give Office a real advantage.&#8221; 
Microsoft lawyer Holley yesterday asked Gates if those
extensions were &#8220;crucial&#8221; to the development of WordPerfect. 
&#8216;Absolutely Not&#8217; 
&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; Gates said. He also testified that he
restricted the extensions because they generated instability in
the Windows operating system, and could cause it to crash. 
Steve Aeschbacher, a lawyer for Microsoft, said in an
interview that Gates wanted to wait to add the extensions to a
future operating system Microsoft called &#8220;Cairo,&#8221; which
Microsoft never completed or shipped. 
Novell, which was bought by Seattle-based Attachmate Corp.
in April, has argued that WordPerfect&#8217;s share of the word-
processing market fell to less than 10 percent in 1996 from
almost 50 percent in 1990. 
Its value dropped from $1.2 billion in May 1994 to
$170 million in 1996, when it was sold to Ottawa-based Corel
Corp., said Novell. The company settled separate antitrust
claims against Microsoft for $536 million in 2004. 
In May, the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia,
revived the case, which had been dismissed by a lower court. The
appeals court ruled that Novell, which briefly owned WordPerfect
in the mid-1990s, didn&#8217;t cede its rights when it transferred
claims related to its personal-computer operating system
products to Caldera Inc. in 1996. 
The appeals court ruling sent the case back to U.S.
District Judge J. Frederick Motz in Baltimore, who had
originally rejected it. Motz is conducting the trial in Salt
Lake City, where the original lawsuit was filed. 
The case is Novell Inc. (NOVL) v. Microsoft Corp., 04-01045, U.S.
District Court, District of Utah (Salt Lake City).

Chevron Corp. (CVX) will be fined for
falsifying information to Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator on a spill in
deep waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro and for failing to
meet a plan to counter the accident. 
The value of the fines for the two violations will be set
after the end of a probe into the leak, the regulator, known as
ANP, said in an e-mailed statement today. The environment agency,
which fined Chevron 50 million reais ($28 million) yesterday, and
the Brazilian Navy are also investigating the spill, ANP said. 
The leak, which started Nov. 7 in Chevron&#8217;s $3.6 billion
Frade project in the Campos Basin, may lead to tighter regulations
for oil producers, which could affect Brazil&#8217;s output target,
according to Erasto Almeida, a analyst at New York-based research
company Eurasia Group. 
&#8220;More scrutiny could slow&#8221; production (PETR4) increases, although
it&#8217;s hard to asses by how much,&#8221; Almeida said in a phone
interview from New York today. 
State-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras,
accounted for 90 percent of Brazilian oil output in September and
aims to more than double production to 6.4 million barrels a day
in 2020. The Rio de Janeiro-based company&#8217;s production rose 1.2
percent in the first nine months of this year, the slowest rate
since 2007, according to information on the company&#8217;s website.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank by assets, was sued for fraud by German lender
Bayerische Landesbank over losses on about $2.1 billion in
mortgage-backed securities. 
JPMorgan units concealed the truth about the poor quality
of the loans underlying the securities and knew that credit
ratings misrepresented their risk, BayernLB said in a lawsuit
filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court. 
&#8220;This misconduct has resulted in astounding rates of
default on the loans,&#8221; BayernLB said. Most of the securities
have been downgraded to junk, it said. 
The lender said it believed the mortgage securities were
safe investments based on representations about the quality of
loans and credit ratings when it invested almost $2.1 billion in
57 offerings from 2005 to 2007, according to the complaint. The
lawsuit names JPMorgan and other units of the New York-based
bank as defendants. 
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment on the lawsuit. 
The case is Bayerische Landesbank New York Branch v. Bear
Stearns  Co., 653239/2011, New York State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan).

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is nearing a
deal to acquire MF Global (MF) Holding Inc.&#8217;s stake in the London
Metal Exchange for about 25 million pounds ($39 million),
according to a person familiar with the process. 
The deal values the exchange at about 530 million pounds,
the person said, declining to be identified because the talks
are private. An announcement may be made as soon as today, a
second person with knowledge of the deal said. 
MF Global filed for bankruptcy protection last month after
making bets that went bad on European sovereign debt. Its
British subsidiary, MF Global U.K. Ltd., one of 12 category 1
members of the LME that normally hold the right to trade on the
floor, was stopped from trading on the metals exchange on Oct.
31. The company&#8217;s special administrator in Britain, KPMG, has
been trying to sell the unit&#8217;s stake. 
The subsidiary owns 600,000 ordinary shares out of 12.9
million, a 4.7 percent stake, and 25,000 nonvoting B shares,
according to a U.K. Companies House filing on Oct. 24. 
JPMorgan has raised its holdings in the LME over the past
year. It owned 800,000 shares as of Oct. 24, compared with
550,000 shares a year earlier, according to filings with
Companies House. 
JPMorgan is also agent to a $1.2 billion loan to MF Global
Holdings, and was given a lien on all of the company&#8217;s available
assets as security for its loan by a New York bankruptcy court
judge. JPMorgan has also proposed letting MF Global use the only
cash collateral it has on hand, $26 million, to fund operations
while it winds down in bankruptcy. 
The LME, for its part, has been the object of takeover
interest. The exchange, which handles 80 percent of global trade
in metals futures, said in September it had received several
&#8220;expressions of interest.&#8221; A bid may be recommended to
shareholders as early as March, Martin Abbott, chief executive
officer of the exchange, said at the time. 
Representatives of JPMorgan and KPMG declined to comment.

Chevron Corp., operator of the $3.6
billion Frade oilfield off the Brazilian coast, is blocked from
drilling in the country while a recent spill is examined, the
South American country&#8217;s oil regulator said. 
Chevron&#8217;s &#8220;negligence&#8221; contributed to the spill and the
company needs to pay more attention to safety precautions, the
Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, or ANP, said today in an e-mailed
statement. The ban will remain in effect until the regulator
identifies the causes of the spill and considers it safe to
resume drilling,  ANP said. 
The company &#8220;will adhere to all the rules and regulations
of the government of Brazil and its agencies,&#8221; Lloyd Avram, a
spokesman, said in an e-mail. Chevron, based in San Ramon,
California, continues production from the field, he said. The
stock dropped (CVX) 2.8 percent to $93.75 at the close in New York. 
Brazil is sanctioning Chevron at a time other foreign oil
companies such as BP Plc, Statoil ASA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
are accelerating exploration in deep waters off the coast of
Brazil. The nation expects production to double during the next
decade as it develops the largest oil discoveries in the Western
Hemisphere since 1976. 
Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the Nov. 7 spill in deep
waters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It will be fined for
falsifying information to ANP and for failing to meet a plan to
counter the accident, the regulator said yesterday. 
3,000 Barrels 
An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima, head of
the ANP, said yesterday. 
Chevron, the third-largest oil producer in Brazil after
state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Shell, operates
Frade with a 51.74 percent stake. Petrobras holds a 30 percent
stake and Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a joint venture including
Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp. holds 18.26 percent. 
The regulator&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t return phone calls
seeking comment on the order.

Jefferies Group Inc.&#8217;s 62 percent
stock-market swoon is more than just business for Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Richard Handler -- it&#8217;s personal. 
The value of Handler&#8217;s stake has plunged by $248.7 million
this year, including $38.7 million in November alone after MF
Global Holdings Ltd. collapsed. What&#8217;s more, Handler hasn&#8217;t had
an employment contract as a safety net in the 21 years he&#8217;s
worked at New York-based Jefferies. 
Handler, 50, focused this month on dispelling speculation
that a liquidity crunch and losses on European debt will sink
his firm, too. In a Nov. 21 letter to stakeholders, he branded
those ideas &#8220;malicious lies&#8221; spread by people &#8220;whose
interests are absolutely opposed to yours and ours.&#8221; Handler&#8217;s
interests, besides his job, include 12.1 million shares, making
him the biggest individual owner. 
&#8220;Handler is a quite unusual bird,&#8221; Frank Glassner, CEO of
Veritas Executive Compensation Consultants in San Francisco,
said in a phone interview. &#8220;He clearly communicates a message
that he&#8217;s in it for the long term and in it with shareholders as
well. It&#8217;s a great leap forward in faith on his part not to have
an executive contract.&#8221; 
The Jefferies CEO owns a bigger share of his company than
CEOs at the biggest Wall Street banks, with a 6 percent stake
that dwarfs the 0.43 percent Lloyd Blankfein holds in Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and the 0.05 percent of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s James Gorman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
Restricted Stock 
Handler finished 2010 with almost 13.9 million shares,
including restricted stock, valued at $370.1 million at year-end
when Jefferies traded at $26.63, according to regulatory filings
and Bloomberg data. Handler&#8217;s current stake is valued at about
$121.4 million based on yesterday&#8217;s $10.06 closing price, the
lowest since March 2009. 
Employment contracts and &#8220;golden parachutes&#8221; aren&#8217;t
typically offered to senior executives, according to Jefferies.
&#8220;We believe our severance, change-in-control and pension
benefits are quite modest compared to general business practices
for companies of comparable size and character,&#8221; Jefferies said
in a March regulatory filing. &#8220;We have considered this fact in
setting the levels of total direct compensation.&#8221; 
Under a policy that limits severance to six months&#8217; pay,
Handler would get $500,000 if he&#8217;s fired without cause,
according to the filing. If he&#8217;s dismissed involuntarily after a
change in control, $21.2 million in restricted stock units that
he&#8217;s already earned would vest immediately. 
Repelling an Assault 
Jefferies has plunged 21 percent since MF Global&#8217;s Oct. 31
bankruptcy, triggered by former CEO Jon Corzine&#8217;s $6.3 billion
bet on the bonds of Europe&#8217;s most-troubled nations. Handler has
defended his firm since, as it has come under pressure from
short sellers and a credit downgrade by Egan-Jones Ratings Co.
Jefferies issued seven statements on its European holdings and
cut its position by about three-quarters as of Nov. 21. 
Handler took the lead in repelling what he called an
assault on his company as inquiries flooded in from investors
and analysts. The CEO personally sent and revised e-mails to the
news media as he sought to break the stock&#8217;s slide and convey
what his six-page letter called &#8220;the reality of what is
happening at Jefferies.&#8221; 
He wrote that the firm struggled about whether to discuss
what Handler called even more remote rumors including &#8220;sadly
some that are rather personal and, as with all the others,
utterly and totally false.&#8221; In an interview with the New York
Times, Handler said he debated whether to write the Nov. 21
letter and that he thought it was too long and emotional. 
&#8216;Staying in Front&#8217; 
&#8220;He&#8217;s being a good CEO in staying in front of the story,&#8221;
said Tim White, a managing partner at Dallas-based executive
search firm Kaye/Bassman International Corp. &#8220;When CEOs own a
big piece of a company, then they&#8217;re going to act in the
interest of shareholders more stridently than they might if they
didn&#8217;t own a big piece of it.&#8221; 
The campaign impressed Chris Kotowski, an Oppenheimer  Co.
analyst, who said he found Handler&#8217;s letter convincing. In a
note to investors today titled &#8220;Another Hack Attack,&#8221; he
called parts of an updated Egan-Jones&#8217;s analysis &#8220;flat-out
wrong by a country mile.&#8221; 
According to a Nov. 22 Egan-Jones report, revenue has
fallen 37.8 percent annually &#8220;over the last couple of years.&#8221;
Kotowski said Egan-Jones also &#8220;bizarrely projects&#8221; that
Jefferies&#8217;s total assets would increase from $45 billion as of
Aug. 31 to about $67 billion at fiscal year-end and $102.2
billion in November 2012. 
&#8216;Grotesquely Wrong&#8217; 
&#8220;Try as we might, we could not reverse engineer a 37.8
percent decline rate to figure out what the &#8216;couple of years&#8217;
time-frame was,&#8221; wrote Kotowski, who has a &#8220;market perform&#8221;
recommendation on Jefferies shares. &#8220;Every analyst is entitled
to his or her opinion, but we doubt that the market will pay
much heed given the gross miscalculations we see in this
report.&#8221; 
Jefferies rose 4.5 percent to $10.51 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York after falling 1.4 percent to $10.06 yesterday. Egan-Jones
stands by its report, President Sean Egan said in an e-mail.
Gimme Credit, the research firm specializing in bonds, upgraded
Jefferies today to &#8220;buy.&#8221; 
Handler bought 170,948 shares this year for $2.98 million,
a stake valued at $1.72 million based on yesterday&#8217;s close. On
Sept. 22, he sold 2 million shares for $12.58 each to Leucadia
National Corp. (LUK), Jefferies&#8217;s biggest owner with a 29 percent
stake. In a memo to employees, Handler said the sale was tied to
the vesting of stock awards that required &#8220;significant tax
payments in cash.&#8221; Handler had never before sold Jefferies
shares except for charitable donations, according to a filing. 
Richard Khaleel, a spokesman for Jefferies, declined to
comment on Handler&#8217;s stake beyond what the firm has reported in
regulatory filings. 
High-Yield Finance 
Handler received a bachelor&#8217;s degree in economics from the
University of Rochester in 1983 and a master&#8217;s in business
administration from Stanford University in 1987. He joined the
company in 1990, when junk-bond powerhouse Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. filed for bankruptcy and Jefferies hired 60 of its
bankers to expand high-yield finance. 
In his first year at the investment bank, Handler co-
founded the high-yield capital markets group and was a managing
director of the unit from May 1993 until February 2000. He
became CEO in 2001, when Jefferies had $3.96 billion in assets
and about 1,000 employees, and was named chairman a year later.
He has since expanded the balance sheet to $45.1 billion and
posted profits for the past 11 quarters. 
Handler has almost quadrupled the staff as CEO, hiring
dealmakers and traders from the world&#8217;s biggest investment
banks, including Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse Group AG,
Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc. 
His compensation for the 11 months ended November 2010
climbed 17 percent from all of the previous year to $15.2
million, including $917,000 in salary, a $1.25 million cash
bonus and $13 million in restricted stock units linked to
performance, according to the March filing. Last year, Jefferies
changed its fiscal year-end to Nov. 30 from Dec. 31.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
the London Metal Exchange shares of MF Global U.K. Ltd., while
talks on the sale of remaining assets in the U.K. continue, the
special administrator said. 
MF Global (MF) filed for bankruptcy protection last month after
making bets that went bad on European sovereign debt. Its
British unit, MF Global U.K. Ltd., one of 12 category 1 members
of the LME that normally hold the right to trade on the floor,
was stopped from trading on the bourse on Oct. 31. The company&#8217;s
special administrator in Britain, KPMG LLP, put the unit&#8217;s stake
on sale. 
Following a &#8220;competitive bidding process,&#8221; JPMorgan
agreed to purchase all of MF Global&#8217;s shareholding, Richard
Fleming, Richard Heis and Mike Pink, the special administrators
of MF Global U.K. Ltd. at KPMG, said today in an e-mailed
statement. 
&#8220;The sales process for various aspects of the MF Global
U.K. business continues apace and we are in negotiations with
several parties to this end,&#8221; Heis said in the statement. 
The unit owned 600,000 ordinary shares out of 12.9 million,
a 4.7 percent stake, and 25,000 non-voting B shares out of 1.36
million, according to a U.K. Companies House filing on Oct. 24.
JPMorgan may pay about 25 million pounds ($38.8 million) for the
stake, a person familiar with the process said yesterday. The
price was not given on today&#8217;s statement. 
JPMorgan, one of the category 1 LME members, has raised its
holdings in the bourse over the past year. The latest purchase
will make the company a holder of 1.4 million shares, or 11
percent, making it the biggest shareholder. It owned 800,000
shares according to the Oct. 24 filing, compared with 550,000
shares a year earlier, according to Companies House. 
Goldman Sachs 
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its holdings in the past
year by 330,000 ordinary shares to 1.23 million shares, or 9.5
percent, according to the Companies House filing. Metdist
Trading Ltd. and Metdist Ltd. own a combined 1.21 million
shares, or 9.4 percent. 
The LME issues two share classes. Ordinary shares confer
ownership and 330,000 of them traded at 4.925 pounds in July,
according to data on the bourse&#8217;s website. B shares exchanged
hands at 85.425 pounds on Sept. 27. Neither shares trade on an
exchange.

Odin Knudsen, the JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) managing director for environmental markets, resigned last
month as the largest U.S. lender scaled back its climate-related
practice. 
Knudsen, 68, left the New York-based lender by mutual
agreement after it became apparent the U.S. was not going to
join a global system to trade carbon emissions, undermining the
bank&#8217;s business plans, he said in a Nov. 21 phone interview.
JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. 
&#8220;We&#8217;d all been geared up for the U.S. coming on board at
some point,&#8221; Knudsen said. &#8220;The market pretty much died out.&#8221; 
Knudsen, who once headed the World Bank Carbon Fund, is the
second senior carbon markets banker to announce his departure
this month after emissions credits and clean power stocks
plunged in 2011. Investors deserted those markets as the United
Nations plan for a global emissions cap remains gridlocked and
European governments that subsidize most clean energy projects
are battered by the sovereign debt crisis. 
Benchmark EU carbon-emission permits have dropped 40
percent this year, falling to a record low today, while the
Bloomberg Industry solar energy stocks index (BISOLAR) plunged 68 percent,
undercutting investor interest in buying research and advisory
services. 
Permits Slumped 
The value of carbon trading fell 8 percent to 23.7 billion
euros ($32 billion) in the third quarter from the previous three
months as the price of European emission permits slumped,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. 
A record 1.5 billion tons of EU carbon permits was traded
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange between July and September,
exchange data show. Trade in UN carbon credits was a record 348
million tons in the same period. 
UBS AG (UBSN), the Swiss bank that lost $2.3 billion from
unauthorized trading this year, in September shut its climate-
change advisory practice and fired the staff, according to
former vice chairman of the securities unit Jon Anda, who ran
the team. Anda was fired along with his team. 
Clean-energy analyst Ben Lynch left Commerzbank AG in the
past two months, according to spokeswoman Claire Tappenden. The
industry is being covered by Lauren Licuanan, a power analyst. 
Knudsen, who worked 27 years at the World Bank before
joining JPMorgan on Sept. 11, 2007, originally planned to leave
earlier this year and was persuaded to stay on to assess the
bank&#8217;s own environmental impact. 
By the time he quit the environmental markets business
&#8220;there were only a few of us left,&#8221; he said. The unit had
employed several &#8220;tens&#8221; of people around the world at its
height. He declined to give specific details of staffing numbers
because the information is confidential. 
He plans to develop his own company, Real Options
International, offering carbon securities analysis, and may tap
the emissions market that California is due to start in 2013. 
The U.S.&#8217;s failure to join a global market &#8220;was a large
disappointment,&#8221; Knudsen said. &#8220;You&#8217;re starting over again.&#8221;

Johnson Matthey Plc (JMAT), the producer of
a third of all autocatalysts, reported a 43 percent increase in
fiscal first-half profit and said it expects earnings to be
&#8220;slightly ahead&#8221; in the current six-month results period. 
Net income for the half through September rose to 149.4
million pounds ($233 million) from 104.7 million pounds a year
earlier, the London-based company said in a statement today.
Sales expanded 29 percent to 5.9 billion pounds. 
Johnson Matthey, which produced the world&#8217;s first catalysts
for curbing pollution in 1974, benefited from growing demand in 
the first half as international car sales rose 2 percent. It&#8217;s 
also seeing increased use of heavy-duty diesel models for trucks 
and buses in a market set to expand threefold through 2015, 
according to company estimates. 
&#8220;The short-term prospects for the global economy are
difficult to predict,&#8221; it said in the statement. &#8220;Nonetheless,
we believe that Johnson Matthey is well placed and we currently
anticipate that the group&#8217;s results in the second half will be
slightly ahead of those for the first six months of the year.&#8221; 
Earnings will be buoyed as rare-earth costs are passed onto
customers, leading to operating profit at the Environmental
Technologies division &#8220;well ahead&#8221; of the first half. Those
costs cut profit by about 15 million pounds in the first half. 
Demand for light-duty vehicles is &#8220;reasonable&#8221; in Asia
and the U.S. with some &#8220;concern&#8221; about the European market,
Finance Director Robert Macleod said in a phone interview. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen some early signs of a little bit of softness
particularly in southern Europe, but northern Europe so far has
been OK,&#8221; he said. 
Johnson Matthey rose 1.1 percent to 1,790 pence by 8:49
a.m. in London, giving it a value of 3.8 billion pounds.

Chevron Corp., the U.S. oil producer
operating the $3.6 billion Frade oilfield off the coast of
Brazil, was blocked from drilling in the South American country
while the government probes a recent spill. 
The company needs to pay more attention to safety after its
&#8220;negligence&#8221; contributed to the accident, Brazil&#8217;s oil
regulator, the Agencia Nacional do Petroleo, said yesterday. The
ban will remain in place until the regulator identifies the
causes and considers it safe to resume drilling, ANP said. 
&#8220;This is a setback for Chevron in Brazil,&#8221; Gianna Bern,
president of Chicago-based risk management adviser Brookshire
Advisory and Research, said yesterday in a telephone interview
from Buenos Aires. &#8220;It will be challenging for Chevron to
emerge unscathed from the accident.&#8221; 
Brazil is seeking to ensure foreign oil companies such as
BP Plc, Statoil ASA (STL) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), which are
exploring in deep waters off the coast of Brazil, help the
country maximize vast oil deposits located deep beneath the
ocean while avoiding disasters similar to BP&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico
oil spill, the worst offshore incident in U.S. history. Brazil
expects crude production to double during the next decade as it
develops the largest oil finds in the Western Hemisphere since
Mexico&#8217;s Cantarell in 1976. 
Chevron Meeting 
Chevron said today in a statement it &#8220;has not received any
formal notice from&#8221; the Brazilian regulator suspending its
drilling license, although it &#8220;acknowledges&#8221; the ANP posted a
suspension notice on its website. 
The oil producer &#8220;will adhere to all the rules and
regulations of the government of Brazil and its agencies,&#8221;
Lloyd Avram, a spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail. Chevron,
based in San Ramon, California, continues production from the
field, he said. The stock slid (CVX) 2.8 percent to $93.75 at the
close in New York yesterday. U.S. markets are closed today for
the Thanksgiving holiday. 
Ali Moshiri, Chevron&#8217;s president for Latin America and
African operations, is scheduled to meet with Brazil Mining and
Energy Minister Edison Lobao at 3 p.m. today, according to a
statement on the ministry&#8217;s website. 
Chevron hopes to continue operating in Brazil, George Buck,
the head of Chevron&#8217;s Brazil operations, said at a Congressional
hearing in Brasilia yesterday. 
&#8220;Sincere apologies to the Brazilian people and the
Brazilian government,&#8221; he said. 
Pressure &#8216;Kick&#8217; 
Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at a
reservoir at the Frade project about 230 miles (370 kilometers)
northeast of Rio de Janeiro, Buck told reporters on Nov. 20. The
well experienced a pressure &#8220;kick&#8221; at the reservoir, prompting
oil to leak to fissures on the ocean floor, he said. 
Chevron halted the flow of oil from the &#8220;source&#8221; at the
reservoir on Nov. 13 and reduced the spill to residual seepage,
he said. The company will continue to seal the well that caused
the spill, the ANP said. 
Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 off the coast of Rio. The company will be fined
for falsifying information to ANP and also for failing to meet a
plan to counter the accident, the regulator has said. 
An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima, head of
the ANP, said Nov. 22. Lima, Buck and Petroleo Brasileiro SA
Chief Executive Officer Jose Sergio Gabrielli are scheduled to
meet with state lawmakers in Rio today at 2 p.m. local time. 
BP&#8217;s Gulf Spill 
Chevron, the third-largest oil producer in Brazil after
state-controlled Petrobras (PETR4) and Shell, operates Frade with a
51.74 percent stake. Petrobras holds a 30 percent stake and
Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a joint venture including Inpex
Corp. (1605) and Sojitz Corp. (2768), holds 18.26 percent. 
The regulator&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t return phone calls
seeking comment on the order. 
Brazilian regulators are forcing Petrobras to shut
production equipment more frequently for maintenance after the
BP spill in April 2010, Gabrielli said in an Oct. 6 interview. 
&#8220;Here in Brazil laws are stricter than in the United
States,&#8221; Gabrielli told reporters yesterday in Rio before ANP
announced the drilling ban. &#8220;The plan continues to be strongly
oriented toward accident prevention.&#8221; 
The ANP also said it rejected Chevron&#8217;s request to drill a
so-called pre-salt well at the Frade project, where the
increased depth makes drilling more risky. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to see increasingly draconian measures,&#8221;
said Brookshire&#8217;s Bern. &#8220;Operators can&#8217;t afford to have any
accidents.&#8221;

Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (OZM) and Perry Capital a small

Bond insurer Assured Guaranty Ltd. (AGO)
has come forward with three dozen new witnesses who it says will
back a legal claim that it was defrauded by JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMC Mortgage unit in a $337 million mortgage-backed
securities deal. 
Lawyers for Hamilton, Bermuda-based Assured Guaranty filed
a new complaint on Nov. 18, unsealed today, in a lawsuit
accusing EMC and its parent at the time, Bear Stearns  Co., of
misleading the bond insurer. The complaint, which also names
JPMorgan as a defendant, includes a new fraud claim and new
allegations from insiders at EMC and elsewhere. 
&#8220;The truth is now coming directly from Bear Stearns&#8217; own
former employees,&#8221; the insurer said in the complaint. &#8220;Seven
confidential witnesses who were responsible for underwriting at
EMC each have affirmed that they faced intense pressure to
approve the purchase of high volumes of loans for Bear Stearns&#8217;
securitizations without adequate review.&#8221; 
Bear Stearns is a defendant in two other lawsuits in
federal court in Manhattan by guarantors of mortgage-backed
deals who say they were defrauded by the bank, which collapsed
in 2008, according to the complaint. Assured Guaranty said its
complaint adds to those suits by citing accounts from insiders
and other sources. 
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the new complaint. 
The suit focuses on a 2005 transaction known as SACO I
Trust 2005-GP1, one of hundreds of securitizations by Bear
Stearns from 2004 to early 2007. Assured Guaranty claims EMC
knew that thousands of home-equity lines of credit that served
as collateral for $337 million in securities it guaranteed were
&#8220;junk&#8221; or otherwise flawed. 
The case is Assured Guaranty Corp. v. EMC Mortgage Corp.,
10-cv-05367, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Industry groups with members
including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Google Inc. (GOOG) warned the European
Union against setting &#8220;overly strict&#8221; data privacy rules,
claiming they would harm technology development in the region. 
&#8220;Overly strict, static and bureaucratic data-protection
rules will have a detrimental impact on Europe&#8217;s economy,&#8221; said
11 industry associations, including the Business Software
Alliance, which counts Microsoft among its members, and IAB
Europe, which has Google and Yahoo! Inc. on its roster. 
Viviane Reding, the EU&#8217;s justice commissioner, has promised
to propose changes to the region&#8217;s 16-year-old data-protection
law before February. Reding reiterated earlier this month her
stance that U.S. companies that operate in the 27-nation EU will
have to stick to the rules. 
The industry groups responded today with a set of
recommendations urging the European Commission, the EU&#8217;s
executive agency, &#8220;to achieve the right balance&#8221; between
preserving privacy and enabling the free flow of information.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expanded
coverage of Turkish stocks to 60, adding 41 new companies
including 13 new &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendations, the company said in a
report dated November 25 and received by e-mail today. 
Top picks are based on macroeconomic themes and include the
&#8220;increasing importance of Turkish industry,&#8221; rising domestic
consumption and increasing per capita growth, Goldman said. 
Goldman now rates 15 Turkish stocks at &#8220;buy.&#8221; They
include builder Enka Insaat  Sanayi AS (ENKAI), fertilizer producer
Gubre Fabrikalari AS (GUBRF), gold miner Koza Altin Isletmeleri AS (KOZAL),
pharmaceuticals distributor Selcuk Ecza Deposu Ticaret  Sanayi
AS (SELEC), glassmakers Turkiye Sise  Cam Fabrikalari AS (SISE), Trakya Cam
Sanayi AS and Anadolu Cam Sanayii AS. (ANACM) 
The list also includes automobile companies Tofas Turk
Otomobil Fabrikasi AS (TOASO) and Dogus Otomotiv Servis  Ticaret AS (DOAS),
farm vehicle maker Turk Traktor  Ziraat Makineleri AS (TTRAK), acrylic
fiber producer Aksa Akrilik Kimya Sanayii (AKSA) AS, white goods
producer Arcelik AS (ARCLK), airport operator TAV Havalimanlari Holding
AS (TAVHL) and the holding companies Alarko Holding AS (ALARK) and Yazicilar

The average potential gain for the new buy-rated stocks is
58 percent compared with an average of 13 percent for Turkish
stocks under coverage, the bank said. 
No banks were listed with a &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation. Turkiye
Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB), a state-owned bank, is the preferred bank in
Turkey, Goldman said. 
Turkey&#8217;s economy will &#8220;slow sharply and may even enter a
relatively mild recession in late 2011 and early 2012,&#8221;
according to the report. Growth should reach about 1.5 percent
in 2012, below the global average, and then return to a higher
rate in the medium term.

Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s biggest
theme-park operator, sold bonds for the third time this year
after reporting fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts&#8217;
estimates on growth in cable television and at U.S. resorts. 
The owner of ESPN issued $1 billion 0.875 percent, three-
year notes and $600 million of 4.125 percent, 30-year bonds,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A Deere  Co. (DE) unit
joined the Burbank, California-based entertainment company in
marketing a benchmark-sized offering today. 
Companies are racing to sell debt as borrowing costs hover
within 60 basis points of a record low, propelling bond sales
this month to $98.6 billion as of yesterday, the highest since
May. Yields on investment-grade debt of 4.01 percent yesterday
compare with the record low of 3.45 percent reached in August,
and are down from 4.15 percent on Oct. 11, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. 
Disney said on Nov. 10 that profit in the fourth quarter
totaled 59 cents a share, exceeding analysts&#8217; projections of 55
cents, the average of 26 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Higher
fees from pay-TV operators, advertising gains and improved
results at resorts drove revenue and profit higher. 
Rising Earnings 
A rise in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is improving Disney&#8217;s leverage without the company
working toward any debt reduction, Dave Novosel, an analyst at
Gimme Credit LLC wrote in a Nov. 14 note. 
&#8220;Revenue and margins are increasing nicely, aided by an
improving economy and a much better advertising environment,&#8221;
he wrote. 
Disney sold $1.85 billion of bonds in August and $500
million of notes in May, Bloomberg data show. The company&#8217;s 30-
year bonds priced to yield 125 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, and compare with $350 million of 4.375
percent bonds issued in August at an 87.5 basis-point spread. 
John Deere Capital Corp. issued $500 million of 2 percent
debt due in January 2017 and $600 million of 1.25 percent debt
due in 2014, Bloomberg data show. 
Borrowers issued $159 billion of corporate bonds in May,

Stephen Hickey, head of global
leveraged finance at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), plans to retire
at the end of the year, after about two decades at the firm. 
Hickey, 50, was named a partner at the fifth-biggest U.S.
bank by assets in 2004, according to a memo obtained by
Bloomberg News. Michael DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, confirmed
the contents of the memo and declined further comment. 
Hickey has been leading Goldman&#8217;s America&#8217;s middle-market
lending effort, according to the memo from Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg, co-heads of investment banking at the
New York-based firm. That role will now be handled by Craig
Packer, according to the memo. Hickey didn&#8217;t immediately return
an e-mail seeking comment. 
While at Goldman, Hickey served as global head of loan
trading and head of bank loan syndicate, sales and trading,
according to a 2006 news release. He also was a member of the
board of directors of the New York-based Loan Syndications and
Trading Association between 2003 and 2007. 
Hickey first joined Goldman in 1987 working in investment
banking and the fixed income divisions in New York and London
until 1996, according to the memo. 
In that year, Hickey helped start the lending business at
Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette where he served as head of loan
syndications, sales and trading before returning to Goldman as a
managing director in 2000. 
Hickey has worked on a joint venture with the Yale Pre-MBA
Leadership Program, promoting diversity at the Yale School of
Management, through Goldman Sachs Gives, a donor-advised fund,
according to the memo. He will continue in his role as chairman
of that program on behalf of the organization, the Goldman memo
said.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the third-largest oil
producer in Brazil, has delayed three wells at the offshore
Frade project while it waits for the government to lift a
drilling ban following an oil spill earlier this month. 
Chevron put on hold plans to develop the water injection
wells at Frade after the Brazilian oil regulator&#8217;s Nov. 23 ban
on the company&#8217;s drilling, Ali Moshiri, head of operations in
Latin America and Africa, said in a telephone interview from
Houston yesterday. Water injection wells help to maintain
reservoir pressure and separate water from oil at other wells. 
As many as 3,000 barrels of oil were leaked during the Nov.
7 spill, according to the regulator, which suspended Chevron&#8217;s
drilling in the country until a probe into the leak is
completed. San Ramon, California-based Chevron is cooperating
with authorities to investigate the causes of the spill and
still plans to invest $3 billion in existing projects in Brazil
and expand when the country offers new areas, Moshiri said. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re hoping it won&#8217;t last very long, because I&#8217;m not
quite sure why it was suspended in the first place,&#8221; Moshiri
said. &#8220;Not even one drop has reached the beach, a reaction of
this magnitudes is really surprising.&#8221; 
The two largest oil producers in Brazil are state-
controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA)
Brazil plans to double oil production in the next ten years as
it taps the largest discoveries in the Western Hemisphere in
over 30 years that are located in deep waters of the Atlantic
Ocean.

The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index (SPX) will
probably be stuck in a 250-point range next year as Europe&#8217;s
debt crisis offsets optimism about U.S. earnings, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. 
The benchmark index for U.S. equities will most likely
fluctuate between 1,100 and 1,350, forming an &#8220;inside-range
year&#8221; by staying roughly within the band seen this year, said
Michael Krauss, JPMorgan&#8217;s New York-based head of technical
research. He sees a 12 percent chance of an economic recession
that would push the SP 500 as low as 800. The odds of the index
rising to 1,500 because of progress on the crisis or stimulus
from central banks are 8 percent, Krauss said. 
&#8220;The markets now are like ships caught in the
treacherously stormy seas of headline risk,&#8221; Krauss wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. &#8220;It will be difficult for equities
to sustain back above the 1,300-1,350 trendlines, as long as the
European sovereign debt crisis and recession lurks in the
background. Similarly, it will be tough to move below strong
1,075-1,100 clustered support, as long as the U.S. avoids an
economic recession, earnings stay elevated, and investors remain
defensively positioned.&#8221; 
The measure surged 2.9 percent to 1,192.55 yesterday,
ending a seven-day losing streak, after Thanksgiving retail
sales climbed to a record and speculation grew that European
leaders will intensify efforts to end the debt crisis. 
Asset Purchases 
Federal Reserve asset purchases meant to boost the economy
and better-than-expected earnings helped drive the SP 500 to a
34-month high of 1,363.61 at the end of April. The index sank to
1,099.23 last month as the European debt crisis, which began
more than two years ago in Greece, spread to Italy and Spain. 
Krauss said in December that the index would likely peak at
about 1,350 in the middle of 2011 before dropping to 1,100. He
boosted his year-end projection to more than 1,400 in April,
then scrapped that target three months later. 
The market&#8217;s trend and momentum now suggest higher odds of
more losses, Krauss said. The SP 500 remains below its 200-day
average and that level has been falling since Aug. 9, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. 
The index&#8217;s monthly stochastic and Moving Average
Convergence/Divergence line charts, which track the market&#8217;s
momentum, continue to show a sell signal that began in July.
Such signals tend to last seven to nine months, suggesting the
market may be under pressure during the first four months of
next year, Krauss said. 
The index reached an intraday peak of 1,370.58 on May 2,
surging 106 percent from a 12-year low of 666.79 on March 6,
2009. It has since fallen 13 percent. 
&#8220;Absent a resolution to the European debt crisis, and a
market-friendly outcome to the November 2012 presidential
election, we believe it will be extremely difficult to exceed
this May&#8217;s 1,371 SP 500 peak during 2012,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;If our
favored 1,100-1,350 range proves incorrect, it is technically
more likely that the downside support breaks, rather than the
upside barrier.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
clients should exit a bet that Hong Kong-listed companies in
China will gain as UBS AG and Citigroup Inc. cut growth
forecasts for the world&#8217;s second-biggest economy. 
&#8220;We are closing our recommended long position in Chinese
equities&#8221; after the trade lost 5 percent, Goldman analysts
including Noah Weisberger wrote in an e-mailed report dated
yesterday. In a Nov. 6 report, the analysts favored shares in
the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index. (HSCEI) 
Premier Wen Jiabao&#8217;s crackdown on property speculation is
damping home sales and construction just as Europe&#8217;s soveriegn-
debt crisis threatens exports. The central bank triggered
speculation that monetary policy may be further loosened to spur
growth by allowing reserve requirements for some rural credit
cooperatives to fall this month. 
Gross domestic product will increase 8 percent in 2012,
less than a previous call of 8.3 percent, Hong Kong-based
economist Wang Tao, of UBS, said in a note today. Citigroup cut
its forecast to 8.4 percent from 8.7 percent. The banks have
also reduced global growth estimates. 
&#8220;We think the balance of risks is no longer attractive,&#8221;
the Goldman analysts wrote in yesterday&#8217;s report, referring to
their previous stock call. 
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, a gauge of 40
mainland companies listed in Hong Kong, dropped 9.7 percent from
Nov. 5 through yesterday on concern Chinese growth may falter.
It climbed 1.8 percent as of 2:40 p.m. local time today. 
Euro Zone Woes 
In a Nov. 6 report, the analysts highlighted the shares&#8217;
underperformance relative to the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. 
&#8220;Much weaker euro zone growth will affect the rest of the
world, including China,&#8221; UBS economist Wang said today. &#8220;We
think more obvious and persistent easing will likely occur in
the first quarter of 2012, when export, construction and
industrial production should have decelerated significantly.&#8221; 
China&#8217;s economy grew 9.1 percent in the third quarter from
a year earlier. Expansion has slowed from 11.9 percent in the
first quarter of last year. 
The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.1 percent as
of 1:25 p.m. local time, paring this year&#8217;s decline to about 14
percent. 
Morgan Stanley yesterday lowered its China growth estimate
for next year to 8.4 percent from 8.7 percent. The nation is
unlikely to be immune from weaker external demand although
domestic demand will &#8220;hold up well,&#8221; Hong Kong-based
economists led by Helen Qiao and Yuande Zhu said in a note. 
Sliding Sales 
Poly Real Estate Group Co. (600048), China&#8217;s second-largest
developer by market value, said its contracted sales fell 39
percent in October from a year earlier. Barclays Capital
estimates home prices may decrease by 10 percent to 30 percent
in the next year. Home prices fell in 33 of 70 cities in
October, government data shows. 
&#8220;We think a sharper deceleration in property investment is
the biggest risk to China&#8217;s economy,&#8221; Johanna Chua, Hong Kong-
based chief economist for Asia at Citigroup, said in today&#8217;s
report. &#8220;But a hard landing can be averted in the near term
with sufficient policy flexibility to provide offsetting support
for growth, especially on the fiscal front.&#8221; 
UBS&#8217; Wang said the government may relax fiscal policy and
bank lending quotas next year.  She estimates additional fiscal
spending of about 1 percent of gross domestic product over a 12-
month period and that the central bank will raise its new
lending target for 2012 to 8 trillion yuan ($1.25 trillion) from
7.3 trillion to 7.4 trillion this year. 
Reserve Requirements 
Citigroup said the central bank may cut banks&#8217; reserve
requirements before the Chinese New Year in late January if
recent capital outflows continue and raise interest rates to
stabilize deposits. 
UBS predicts the world economy will expand 2.7 percent next
year, down from a previous estimate of 3.1 percent. Citigroup is
forecasting 2.5 percent after the sixth consecutive monthly
downgrade, economists led by Willem Buiter and Michael Saunders
said in a report dated yesterday. 
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
says that growing doubts about the survival of Europe&#8217;s monetary
union has caused global growth to stall and represents the main
risk to the world economy. 
The Paris-based organization has lowered its estimate for
China&#8217;s 2012 expansion to 8.5 percent from a 9.2 percent
forecast in May. A slowdown in property sales could trigger
developer collapses and lead to bad loans, it said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six others may be
questioned under oath by lawyers for the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Rajat Gupta, who was charged with insider trading
as part of the Galleon Group LLC investigation. 
Lawyers for Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, sought
to depose Blankfein and other firm executives including Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar, President Gary Cohn, Managing
Director David Loeb and John Bryan, as part of a related suit
brought by the SEC. While U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New
York authorized the questioning of Blankfein before the April 9
criminal trial, he said depositions of the other officers must
be conducted afterwards. 
Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury
last month on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Rakoff is
presiding over Gupta&#8217;s criminal case as well as the SEC lawsuit. 
In addition to Blankfein, Rakoff granted SEC requests to
question Gary Rosenbach, Galleon&#8217;s co-founder, and Ian Horowitz,
a former trader who worked for Rajaratnam and was recorded on a
U.S. wiretap. The judge said lawyers may also depose three other
individuals associated with Galleon -- Ananth Muniyappa, Brock
Vandervliet and Leon Shaulov. Also to be deposed is Greg Ormond
of Exemplar Wealth. 
&#8216;No Material Argument&#8217; 
&#8220;The court sees no material argument whatsoever for
delaying the depositions,&#8221; Rakoff said in his ruling. 
Gupta, 62, of Westport, Connecticut, was a close friend and
business associate of Rajaratnam, prosecutors said. He made
multimillion-dollar investments with the hedge fund manager and
also passed him inside information after attending Goldman Sachs
board meetings from 2008 through January 2009, according to the
indictment. 
Rakoff today said the SEC couldn&#8217;t depose Ragakanthan
Rajaratnam, the younger brother of Raj Rajaratnam&#8217;s who once
worked as a Galleon portfolio manager. 
The judge today also delayed a request to question Caryn
Eisenberg, the former assistant to Rajaratnam; ex-Galleon trader
Michael Cardillo; and James McNerney, presiding director of
Procter  Gamble. 
Eleven Years 
David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,

Chevron Corp. (CVX) was &#8220;irresponsible&#8221;
and acted with an &#8220;absolute lack of caution&#8221; in operations that
led to a leak in the Frade oilfield off the coast of Rio de
Janeiro, the state&#8217;s governor said. 
&#8220;The company&#8217;s going to pay for this and it&#8217;s going to be
expensive,&#8221; Rio de Janeiro Governor Sergio Cabral told reporters
in New York today, according to a statement e-mailed by his
office. He said Chevron used &#8220;medieval techniques&#8221; in the
operations. 
Chevron was fined 50 million reais ($27.6 million) by
Brazilian environmental authorities for the spill, which
occurred Nov. 7 about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro. An estimated 3,000 barrels leaked, Haroldo Lima,
head of Brazil&#8217;s oil regulator, Agencia Nacional do Petroleo,
said Nov. 22. 
The company will be fined for falsifying information to ANP
and also for failing to meet a plan to counter the accident, the
regulator has said. 
Cabral&#8217;s statement did not specify if further actions would
be taken against Chevron. 
In an e-mailed statement, Chevron said it quickly moved to
address the leak. 
&#8220;Our combined efforts greatly diminished the size of the
sheen and stopped the source of the seep flow within only four
days of first detection,&#8221; the company said in an e-mail from its
press department. &#8220;Up to 18 vessels have been in rotating
operation to support well plugging operations and sheen
cleanup.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc., after this
year&#8217;s losing endorsement of U.S. bank stocks, recommends as its
top trade for 2012 a bet against European high-yield corporate
debt and forecasts a &#8220;deeper recession&#8221; for the region. 
The fifth-biggest U.S. bank in terms of assets recommended
in a research note that investors speculate on the rising cost
of insuring against the default of European junk bonds by using
the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50 companies with mostly
high-yield credit ratings. The gauge of derivatives will climb
to 950 basis points, or 9.5 percentage points, from 770 basis
points, according to Goldman Sachs, which urges investors to
exit the trade if the index falls to 680 basis points. 
&#8220;The ongoing shocks from the region&#8217;s sovereign crisis --
and policy responses to them -- are likely to be the biggest
determinant of the outlook over the next few months,&#8221; Dominic Wilson and Jan Hatzius, economists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in
the research note, published today. 
Goldman Sachs said a year ago that the U.S. economy would
expand 2.7 percent in 2011, and U.S. bank stocks, junk bonds,
commodities, Japanese equities and China&#8217;s currency were its top
recommendations. America&#8217;s gross domestic product is forecast to
grow 1.8 percent in 2011, according to the median forecast of 63
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. 
Drop in Financials 
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials Index has lost 18
percent this year in the worst performance among 10 industry
groups. U.S. banks, measured by the 24-company KBW Bank Index,
have fallen 26 percent on a total return basis. 
America&#8217;s high-yield corporate debt has returned 1.4
percent as of yesterday, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Total Return Index
of commodities has gained 1 percent. Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock
Average has dropped 16 percent, while China&#8217;s yuan has
appreciated 3.6 percent against the dollar this year, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. 
The U.S. economy will expand 1.5 percent next year, while
Europe&#8217;s will contract 0.8 percent, according to Goldman Sachs.
The bank lowered its worldwide economic growth estimate to 3.2
percent from 3.4 percent. 
The financial crisis in the euro zone will weigh on the
U.S. economy through early 2012, according to Hatzius. 
Hatzius on Crisis 
&#8220;There will be an intensification over the next few
months,&#8221; Hatzius said today in a conference call with clients.
A &#8220;tightening of financial conditions&#8221; will limit the
&#8220;willingness of banks to lend,&#8221; he said. 
Europe may stem its debt crisis by moving to a &#8220;full
fiscal union&#8221; in which all countries assume responsibility for
the euro area&#8217;s sovereign debt or by &#8220;a much larger
commitment&#8221; by the European Central Bank to support sovereign-
debt markets, according to the Goldman Sachs note. 
The bank&#8217;s European growth estimate &#8220;is conditional on
major policy changes in the region, probably involving a partial
&#8216;mutualization&#8217; of the existing debt stock supported by the
ECB,&#8221; the Goldman Sachs economists wrote. &#8220;The alternative
scenario is that the euro area breaks up and there is a much
deeper recession.&#8221; 
Junk, or high-yield, bonds are rated below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service and less than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. 
Goldman Sachs also recommended betting on German 10-year
bund yields climbing to 2.8 percent from 2.3 percent and exiting
the trade if they fall to 2 percent. The bank predicted the euro
will rise to 1.35 Swiss francs from 1.2260 and said investors
should abandon the trade if the euro falls to 1.20 francs. 
Investors should go long on Canadian stocks versus Japanese
equities, bet on the Malaysian ringgit and the yuan against the
dollar and pound and speculate on a gain in Brent crude oil,
according to Goldman Sachs. A long is a bet an asset will gain
in value.

Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s (PFE) long dependence on the
cholesterol pill Lipitor to produce almost one-fifth of the
company&#8217;s revenue begins eroding today when the drug&#8217;s patent
protection ends in the U.S. 
The next step will be rebuilding the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker into a smaller, faster-moving company that focuses on
development of biologic drugs and specialty medicines while
expanding sales of existing products, such as Lipitor and the
erection drug Viagra, in emerging countries such as China,
executives said in interviews. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to be a one-product company,&#8221; said Geno Germano, Pfizer&#8217;s president of specialty care and oncology,
interviewed at the company&#8217;s New York headquarters. &#8220;We&#8217;re
poised to deliver significant new pipeline assets in the coming
year, and in coming years.&#8221; 
Pfizer rose 3.5 percent to $20.07 at the close in New York,
and has gained 15 percent this year. 
The drugmaker is depending on four products to generate $4
billion in new revenue by 2014, said Timothy Anderson, a Sanford
C. Bernstein analyst in New York, in a note to clients. 
The drugs are Prevnar, a bacterial infection vaccine gained
in Pfizer&#8217;s 2009 Wyeth purchase; the blood-thinner Eliquis, co-
developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY); the rheumatoid
arthritis drug tofacitinib; and the cancer drug Xalkori for non-
small-cell lung tumors. Pfizer is awaiting U.S. regulatory

General Catalyst Partners, the
venture-capital firm co-founded by Joel Cutler, is seeking to
raise $650 million for a new fund that will invest in technology
companies. 
The firm, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is targeting
about $450 million for its General Catalyst Group VI LP fund,
which will focus on consumer Internet, social media and
technology businesses, according to marketing materials sent to
investors in October and reviewed by Bloomberg News. It is also
attempting to gather about $200 million for a supplemental
vehicle that will invest in larger deals with the main fund,
according to the marketing document. 
General Catalyst, which also has offices in Palo Alto,
California, is trying to raise money following the slowest
quarter for venture-capital fundraising in eight years. Venture
firms collected $1.72 billion in the third quarter, down 53
percent from the same period a year earlier, according to the
National Venture Capital Association. 
&#8220;Since July, when publicly traded market volatility
increased dramatically, venture-capital fundraising has been
quite slow, as it has been in all areas of private equity,&#8221;
said Kelly DePonte, a partner at Probitas Partners LLC in San
Francisco, which raises money for alternative-investment firms. 
General Catalyst expects a December close for the fund,
according to two prospective investors who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Its previous fund
and supplemental vehicle collected about $722 million in 2007. 
Targeting Software, IT 
Michelle Daubar, a spokeswoman for the firm, didn&#8217;t return
phone calls or e-mails seeking comment on the fundraising. 
In addition to consumer Internet and new-media companies,
the latest fund will target software and information technology
firms, as well as companies &#8220;that create fundamentally new
breakthrough-oriented ways&#8221; of doing business, according to the
document. General Catalyst could increase the amount on both the
main and supplemental funds by 10 percent each. 
Since its founding in 1999, the firm has raised five funds
and invested about $1.2 billion in 143 companies and start-ups,
according to the document. They include ProfitLogic Inc., which
was sold to Oracle Corp. in 2005; UPromise Inc., later sold to
Sallie Mae; SiteAdvisor Inc., which was sold to McAfee Inc. in
2006; and GroupMe Inc., which was bought by Skype Technologies
SA in August. 
While General Catalyst lacks a stable of hot social-media
companies such as Twitter Inc., Zynga Inc. and Facebook Inc. to
help boost fundraising, investors point to Kayak Software Corp.,
the online travel website, as one of the firm&#8217;s more promising
holdings. 
Kayak Investment 
Kayak, which first registered for an initial public
offering in November 2010, was generating a 41 percent gross
internal rate of return and 5.65 times multiple for Fund III as
of Sept. 30, according to the marketing document. 
General Catalyst first invested in Norwalk, Connecticut-
based Kayak from its third fund in 2004, with additional
investments from its fifth fund and supplemental vehicle in
December 2007. The firm said in its marketing document that it&#8217;s
weighing market conditions before taking Kayak public. 
&#8220;While the company is actively in the registration period,
it is assessing current market conditions before it proceeds
with its offering,&#8221; according to the document. 
General Catalyst has investments in several other companies
that have filed for IPOs, according to the document. They
include Brightcove Inc., an online video-management company;
Demandware Inc., an e-commerce platform; and Mascoma Corp., a
biofuels producer.

U.S. Supreme Court justices debated
an effort to make investment banks, including units of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan Stanley (MS), pay back money they earned
by allegedly manipulating dozens of initial public offerings. 
Hearing arguments yesterday in Washington, the justices
questioned whether Vanessa Simmonds could press ahead with what
originally were 55 lawsuits filed in federal court in Seattle. 
The dispute stems from a provision in federal securities
law that requires corporate insiders to give back &#8220;short-
swing&#8221; profits -- money from the sale of stock held for less
than six months. The 1934 Securities Exchange Act gives
investors two years to sue over violations. 
In letting some of the suits go forward, a federal appeals
court said the time limit hadn&#8217;t kicked in because the
defendants didn&#8217;t file required disclosure forms. The panel
threw out 30 of the suits on other grounds. 
In an hour-long session in Washington, the justices
signaled they were reluctant to erect a rigid rule on the time
limit. Justice Elena Kagan suggested the court might return the
dispute to the lower courts to determine whether Simmonds had
enough information about the alleged wrongdoing to file her suit
earlier, even without the disclosure forms. 
The justices are considering an appeal filed by units of
Citigroup Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Deutsche Bank AG (DB),
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp. (BAC), as well as
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. 
Simmonds was a college student when she bought the stock in
55 companies that went public at the height of the IPO boom in
the late 1990s and 2000. Her father, David Simmonds, is one of
the lawyers pressing the case. 
The case is Credit Suisse v. Simmonds, 10-1261, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington).

Schaeuble Defends EFSF Panel at German Constitutional Court 
German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble defended giving
a parliamentary subcommittee the ability to quickly approve
emergency or classified euro rescue-fund actions at the nation&#8217;s
top court. 
Germany&#8217;s Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe heard
arguments in a case filed by two opposition lawmakers, who say
the rules curb their parliamentary rights and put power in the
hands of too small a group. 
The government argues the subcommittee must be allowed to
make decisions privately so that the European Financial
Stability Facility can take actions requiring strict
confidentiality, such as bond purchases on the secondary market. 
&#8220;Confidentiality is the prerequisite that you can use
those instruments at all,&#8221; Schaeuble told the judges.
&#8220;Announcing beforehand that you&#8217;ll buy bonds in the secondary
market may be suitable at a Carnival speech, but not for
responsible operation of the EFSF.&#8221; 
The court on Sept. 7 cleared Germany&#8217;s participation in the
EFSF while stressing the legislature, the Bundestag, must keep
authority over budgetary aspects of the rescue plan. The nine-
member, all-party subcommittee was established to comply with
the ruling while giving the panel powers to approve emergency or
classified decisions. The 41-member budgetary committee must
have a say in EFSF decisions, the court said in its ruling. 
The court&#8217;s judges in October halted committee activities
while the suit is pending. 
The judges are expected to issue a ruling later this year. 
The case is: BVerfG, 2 BvE 8/11.

Consultant Made $780,000 on Julius Baer, Swatch Bets, FSA Says 
A management consultant on trial for insider trading made
about 500,000 pounds ($780,000) betting on tips from a hedge-
fund employee about companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd.
and Swatch Group AG (UHR), prosecutors said. 
Rupinder Sidhu, who faces 23 counts of insider trading,
used Hotmail accounts and MSN Messenger to covertly communicate
with Anjam Ahmad, a trader at AKO Capital LLP, Michael Brompton,
a prosecutor for the Financial Services Authority, told a jury
in London. 
Ahmad told Sidhu, a childhood friend, when AKO was about to
buy or sell a stock so he could benefit from the effect on its
share price, Brompton said. This was &#8220;carried out on an
increasingly large scale and for increasingly large profits&#8221;
between June and August in 2009. 
The 40-year-old, who also faces one count of money
laundering, pleaded not guilty in April. The trial is expected
to last for three weeks. 
Sidhu is accused of using spread-betting sites to speculate
on stocks including Julius Baer, Swatch, Reed Elsevier Plc and
Michael Page International Plc, making sums ranging from 1,600
pounds to 137,000 pounds, Brompton said 
It is a &#8220;classic example of insider trading,&#8221; Brompton
told jurors yesterday.

New Suits 
Cargill Accused of Job Discrimination at Arkansas Plant 
Cargill Meat Solutions, processor of Honeysuckle White and
Riverside turkeys, discriminated against 4,069 qualified job
applicants, the Labor Department said as it sought to strip the
company of its U.S. contracts. 
Female, white, black, Hispanic and American Indian
applicants at the Cargill Inc. unit were denied entry-level jobs
at a production plant in Springdale, Arkansas, according to a
statement yesterday on an agency complaint. The company has $550
million in contracts to supply the U.S. military, the department
said in the statement. 
The department filed the complaint after it was unable to
arrange back pay, with interest, for the rejected job
applicants, according to the statement. The Wichita, Kansas-
based company didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for
comment. 
&#8220;This is an unfortunate case in which thousands of
qualified workers were denied the opportunity to compete fairly
for jobs in a tough economy,&#8221; said Patricia Shiu, director of
the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. 
The Labor Department is seeking to cancel Cargill Meat
Solutions&#8217; government contracts and bar it from future work
until the company resolves violations and changes employment
practices, according to the statement. 
Glencore Unit Should Be Liquidated, Thai Bitumen Says 
Glencore International Plc&#8217;s Singapore unit should be
liquidated after failing to pay a $20.2 million arbitration
award, Thai Bitumen Co. said in a lawsuit. 
Glencore Singapore, a unit of the largest publicly traded
commodities company, is &#8220;therefore deemed to be insolvent and
unable to pay its debts,&#8221; Thai Bitumen director Chaiwat
Srivalwat said in the Nov. 23 winding-up petition filed in the
Singapore High Court. A closed hearing is scheduled for Dec. 9. 
The Singapore unit of Baar, Switzerland-based Glencore was
ordered to pay $20.2 million and interest to Thai Bitumen by
arbitrator Kenneth Rokison on Sept. 21, according to the
lawsuit. Glencore failed to deliver 600,000 barrels of
Venezuelan crude oil to Thai Bitumen, breaching an October 2008
sale contract, Rokison ruled in the London arbitration
proceedings. 
Glencore hasn&#8217;t filed its reply to the Singapore lawsuit.
Spokesman Charles Watenphul declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Thai Bitumen&#8217;s Chaiwat and the company&#8217;s lawyer Cavinder Bull
didn&#8217;t reply to an e-mail seeking comment. 
Thai Bitumen, a unit of Thailand&#8217;s biggest asphalt producer
Tipco Asphalt Pcl. (TASCO), and Glencore couldn&#8217;t agree on the interest
amount to be paid on the arbitration award, according to court
papers. Glencore&#8217;s lawyers claimed Thai Bitumen had over-
calculated the interest by $42,785, according to court filings. 
Glencore declared force majeure on the delivery to Thai
Bitumen, a legal clause that allows delays because of an
incident outside a supplier&#8217;s control, after a decision by
Venezuelan state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA to cut
production in 2008, according to the filing. 
The case is Thai Bitumen Co. v Glencore Singapore Ltd.
CWU152/2011 in the Singapore High Court.

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Olympus Whistle-Blower Woodford Meets With U.S. Prosecutors 
Olympus Corp. (7733) whistle-blower Michael Woodford said he met
for two hours yesterday with U.S. prosecutors and investigators
for the Securities and Exchange Commission in New York. 
The former head of the Tokyo-based camera maker arrived at
the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office in Lower Manhattan for a briefing
with eight investigators from the Justice Department, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the SEC, he said in an
interview. It was Woodford&#8217;s second meeting with prosecutors; a
prior meeting lasted three hours, he said. 
&#8220;Different elements or parts of the Olympus story appeal
to different jurisdictions,&#8221; Woodford said, declining to detail
his talks with the U.S. government. &#8220;I&#8217;ve passed on everything
I know.&#8221; 
Woodford was fired as president and chief executive officer
on Oct. 14 after he confronted the Olympus board about oversized
payments made to advisers in the acquisition of Gyrus Group Plc
in 2008. Olympus revealed this month that it used the purchase
of Gyrus and three other takeovers to hide decades-old
investment losses. 
Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in New York, and SEC spokesman John Nester declined to
comment on yesterday&#8217;s meeting.

Wells Fargo Challenges NCUA&#8217;s Claims Over Failed Credit Unions 
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) said it will challenge a U.S. regulator&#8217;s
claim that Wachovia Corp. misrepresented mortgage-backed
securities in 2006 sales to a pair of credit unions that later
collapsed. 
The National Credit Union Administration sued Wachovia,
accusing the lender acquired by Wells Fargo during the subprime
mortgage crisis of &#8220;pervasive disregard of underwriting
standards&#8221; and issuing offering documents with &#8220;material
untrue statements,&#8221; according to a statement released
yesterday. 
The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Kansas,
details about $200 million in purchases by the U.S. Central
Federal Credit Union and Western Corporate Federal Credit Union,
which were placed under conservatorship in 2009. NCUA, which is
serving as liquidating agent for the failed lenders, has filed
similar suits against firms including Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) 
Ancel Martinez, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, said the San
Francisco-based bank believes the claims are without merit. 
&#8220;We look forward to defending ourselves vigorously in this
matter,&#8221; Martinez said yesterday in a telephone interview.

BP Pipeline Rupture May Force It to Pay More for 2006 Spill 
BP Plc, still facing fallout from the 2010 explosion of its
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico, is fighting a U.S. bid to
revoke its probation over a five-year-old spill in Alaska
following a more recent pipeline rupture. 
BP pleaded guilty in 2007 to violating the Clean Water Act
by spilling 200,000 gallons of oil from its Prudhoe Bay field
into water on Alaska&#8217;s North Slope in 2006. It paid a $12
million fine and $8 million for restitution and community
service and was put on three years&#8217; probation. 
The U.S. government began arguing yesterday in federal
court in Anchorage that the U.K.-based company violated its
probation by allowing a pipeline rupture two years ago in the
same area. 
Authorities last year filed a petition to revoke BP&#8217;s
probation 12 days before it was to expire, claiming the company
failed to take precautions and implement safeguards. Prosecutors
may seek more money from the company if the judge agrees the
terms of the probation were violated. 
&#8220;BP&#8217;s 2006 spill was the result of a lack of maintenance
and a failure to heed warning alarms indicating that the
pipeline was leaking oil,&#8221; U.S. lawyers said in a Nov. 14
filing. &#8220;The 2009 spill vividly demonstrates that BP has not
adequately addressed the management and environmental compliance
problems that have plagued it for many years.&#8221; 
The spill &#8220;was an unfortunate incident, but it was not a
crime,&#8221; the company said in court papers. 
&#8220;It was an accident,&#8221; Steve Rinehart, a BP spokesman,
said in a phone interview. &#8220;No one was hurt, and there was
minimal environmental impact.&#8221; 
BP didn&#8217;t violate any conditions of its probation, the
company said in court filings. BP wasn&#8217;t negligent and didn&#8217;t
discharge oil in the waters of the U.S., the company said. 
BP spilled about 13,500 gallons of oil near Prudhoe Bay in
November 2009 when a section of the company&#8217;s pipeline at its
Lisburne Processing Center ruptured, &#8220;creating a two-foot hole
in the pipe that allowed the contents to spill onto the tundra
and surrounding wetlands,&#8221; the U.S. said. 
The case is U.S. v. BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc., 3:07-
cr-00125, U.S. District Court, District of Alaska (Anchorage).

Anglo Irish Bank Noteholder&#8217;s Lawsuit Dismissed by U.S. Judge 
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., the bank nationalized by the Irish
government in 2009, won dismissal of a noteholder lawsuit that
sought to block the sale of its U.S. loan portfolio. 
U.S. District Judge Paul G. Gardephe in Manhattan said in
an order Nov. 28 that the claims were prohibited by the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act. 
&#8220;Defendant is a &#8216;foreign state&#8217; within the meaning of
the&#8221; act, Gardephe said. &#8220;Plaintiffs have not demonstrated
that Ireland has waived sovereign immunity for purposes of this
action or that any exception to sovereign immunity is
applicable.&#8221; 
Fir Tree Partners, a New York investment firm, sued Anglo
Irish Bank in February, claiming it owns $200 million of notes
the bank issued in the U.S. Fir Tree sought an order blocking
Anglo Irish Bank from transferring any U.S. assets out of the
country so it can force the bank to honor its debt obligations. 
Paul Smith, a lawyer for Fir Tree, didn&#8217;t return a call to
his office seeking comment on the ruling after regular business
hours Nov. 28. 
The case is Fir Tree Capital Opportunity Master Fund LP v.
Anglo Irish Bank Corp., 11-CV-0955, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). 
Del Monte, KKR Deal Faces U.S. Antitrust Probe, Lawyer Says 
Del Monte Foods Co. (DLM)&#8217;s $5.3 billion sale to a group of
private-equity firms led by KKR  Co. is the target of a U.S.
Justice Department antitrust probe, a lawyer who sued over the
deal said in a court filing. 
Federal prosecutors have been &#8220;investigating the facts and
circumstances surrounding the sale of Del Monte,&#8221; Stuart Grant,
a lawyer for Del Monte shareholders, said in a Nov. 23 court
filing as part of an $89.4 million settlement of investors&#8217;
claims over the deal. 
Investors in San Francisco-based Del Monte argued in the
lawsuit in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington they weren&#8217;t
getting enough for their shares in the buyout. Other
shareholders, who filed a related federal court suit in San
Francisco, questioned whether private-equity firms rigged bids
to artificially lower the price paid for the maker of Meow Mix
cat food and Milk Bone dog biscuits. 
Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment Nov. 28 on whether the antitrust division was
investigating the Del Monte buyout. Kristi Huller, a KKR
spokeswoman, and Chrissy Stengel, a Del Monte spokeswoman,
didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment on the filing Nov. 28. 
The settlement also resolves investors&#8217; claims that
Barclays Plc (BARC), which served as Del Monte&#8217;s financial adviser
while providing some financing for the buyers, had conflicting
interests in the deal. The private-equity group led by New York-
based KKR included Vestar Capital Partners and Centerview
Partners LLP. 
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster ordered Del
Monte in February to delay a shareholder vote on the deal so
investors could consider whether to back it in light of
disclosures about London-based Barclays&#8217;s dual roles. Laster
will decide whether to approve the settlement at a hearing
tomorrow. 
The Delaware case is In re Del Monte Foods Co. Shareholder
Litigation, CA6027, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

Verdicts/Settlements 
Facebook Settles Privacy Complaints of U.S. Regulator 
Facebook Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest social-networking site,
agreed to settle complaints by the Federal Trade Commission that
it failed to protect users&#8217; privacy or disclose how their data
could be used. 
The proposed 20-year agreement would require Palo Alto,
California-based Facebook to get clear consent from users before
sharing material posted under earlier, more restrictive terms,
the FTC said yesterday in a statement. It would also compel
independent reviews of Facebook&#8217;s privacy practices. 
&#8220;Companies must live up to their promises about privacy,&#8221;
FTC Chairman Jon Leibowitz said on a conference call with
reporters. The settlement &#8220;will protect consumer choices and
ensure they have full and truthful information about their
data.&#8221; 
The settlement is part of an effort to resolve legal issues
that could be a distraction as Facebook moves toward an initial
public offering, said Francis Gaskins, president of Los Angeles-
based IPODesktop.com, a Web site that tracks IPOs. Facebook is
considering an IPO that would raise $10 billion and value the
company at more than $100 billion, a person familiar with the
matter said. 
In a blog posting, Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark
Zuckerberg said the company should have been more vigilant in
protecting users&#8217; privacy. 
&#8220;I&#8217;m the first to admit that we&#8217;ve made a bunch of
mistakes,&#8221; he said.

Geronzi, Arpe Convicted in Parmalat-Related Case 
An Italian court convicted bankers Cesare Geronzi and
Matteo Arpe in a case related to the 2003 bankruptcy of Parmalat
SpA (PLT), Radiocor news agency reported. 
Geronzi was sentenced to five years in jail, while Arpe was
given a sentence of three years and seven months by the court in
Parma, Radiocor said. The bankers were accused of fraudulent
bankruptcy connected to the sale of water company Ciappazzi to
Parmalat. 
Ennio Amodio, a lawyer for Geronzi, termed the sentencing
&#8220;profoundly unfair,&#8221; Radiocor said. Both of the bankers
previously have denied any wrongdoing. Spokesmen for Geronzi and
Arpe weren&#8217;t immediately available for comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News.

Fortress Credit Suit Against Dechert Thrown Out on Appeal 
Dechert LLP won an appeal dismissing a lawsuit by Fortress
Investment Group LLC (FIG) that claimed the law firm issued a false
opinion letter endorsing a transaction with convicted lawyer
Marc Dreier. 
Fortress claimed the 2008 letter caused it to lend $50
million to what it believed was the firm of Sheldon Solow, a New
York developer who was a client of Dreier&#8217;s defunct firm, Dreier
LLP. Dreier, 61, is serving a 20-year sentence in federal prison
after pleading guilty to selling more than $400 million in phony
notes to hedge funds. 
A state appeals court in Manhattan yesterday reversed a
ruling in which a lower-court judge declined to dismiss
Fortress&#8217;s claims. 
&#8220;As Dreier was Solow Realty&#8217;s attorney and the guarantor
of the loan, defendant had no reason to suspect that Solow
Realty was not in fact a party to the loan transaction or that
Dreier forged the signatures of its principal and CEO,&#8221; a
unanimous five-judge panel said yesterday in an opinion. 
&#8220;This decision is of tremendous importance to the lawyers
and law firms who give closing legal opinions, a fundamental
aspect of many financial transactions,&#8221; said Joel Miller, lead
counsel for Dechert. Miller said Fortress tried to use the
Dechert letter as an &#8220;insurance policy against anything going
wrong with the transaction, including Fortress&#8217;s own lack of due
diligence which allowed it be defrauded by Marc Dreier.&#8221; 
&#8220;Dechert told Fortress that it was acting as &#8216;special
corporate counsel&#8217; to Solow Realty in the transaction -- a
statement that Fortress relied on in entering into the
transaction and that proved to be utterly false,&#8221; Marc
Kasowitz, who represents Fortress in the case, said in a
statement yesterday. 
Dreier&#8217;s firm, which had 250 attorneys, filed for
bankruptcy protection in December 2008. 
The case is Fortress Credit Corp. v. Dechert, 603819/2009,
New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First
Department (Manhattan).

On The Docket 
Allen Stanford Mental Fitness Hearing Scheduled for Dec. 20 
R. Allen Stanford, the Texas financier accused of leading a
$7 billion investment fraud, faces a Dec. 20 hearing to
determine whether he is mentally fit to stand trial next year. 
Stanford, 61, returned to Houston earlier this month after
an almost nine-month stay at a U.S. Bureau of Prisons hospital
at Butner, North Carolina. He was treated there for a dependency
on anti-anxiety drugs given to him in prison and evaluated for
the after-effects of a head injury sustained in a jailhouse
assault. 
Houston U.S. District Judge David Hittner yesterday
scheduled the competency hearing to determine if Stanford can
assist in his defense. In a separate order, the judge said
Stanford&#8217;s criminal trial would start with jury selection on
Jan. 23. 
The former chairman and chief executive officer of Houston-
based Stanford Group Co. is accused of misleading investors
about the nature and oversight of certificates of deposit issued
by his Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. 
Stanford, who maintains his innocence, has been in custody
since June 2009, when he was indicted by a federal grand jury in
Houston. The court has twice postponed previously scheduled
trial dates. 
Ali Fazel, one of his defense attorneys, yesterday declined
to comment on the hearing and trial dates, citing an earlier
order from Hittner barring attorneys from discussing the case
publicly. 
Justice Department spokeswoman Laura Sweeney didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a request for comment on the trial date.
She has previously declined to comment because of the gag order. 
The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09cr342, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Texas (Houston).

BP&#8217;s Macondo Legal Proceedings May Last to 2014 
BP Plc&#8217;s legal proceedings over the Macondo well that
caused the worst U.S. oil spill may last into 2014, Citigroup
Inc. (C) said, citing the company&#8217;s lead lawyer. 
Blame for the accident will likely be apportioned in late
2013, with punishment decided the following year. That&#8217;s later
than analyst Alastair Syme had expected and is &#8220;slightly more
favorable&#8221; for the company than an earlier decision, he said in
a research note published yesterday. 
BP has set aside about $40 billion for costs from the
disaster that spewed almost 5 million barrels of oil into the
Gulf of Mexico last year. Shares are down more than 30 percent
since the spill. 
&#8220;There is still a risk that ultimate fines and penalties
could be above BP&#8217;s current financial provisioning,&#8221; Syme
wrote. 
The company is counting on $5 billion in fines and $7
billion in compensation. If BP is found to be grossly negligent,
its costs may rise by another $10 billion, Syme said.

Commodities show limited potential
for gains in 2012 as the global economy slows and risk aversion
boosts the dollar, according to Morgan Stanley. 
A comprehensive solution to Europe&#8217;s debt crisis remains
elusive, while economic indicators signal a slowdown and
deleveraging and fiscal austerity should impair growth,
providing a &#8220;myriad of headwinds&#8221; for expansion, said analysts
led by Hussein Allidina in a report. 
Commodities had their worst quarter since 2008 in the three
months to Sept. 30 on concern that Europe&#8217;s debt crisis was
spreading, while 18 of 24 commodities tracked by the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s GSCI Index dropped in November. JPMorgan Chase  Co., the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, cut its recommendation on
commodities to &#8220;underweight&#8221; on Nov. 22, while Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. trimmed its forecast for gains in the next 12 months
to 15 percent from 20 percent in a report Nov. 14. 
&#8220;Upside for commodities as an asset class is likely
limited given the fragile state of the OECD,&#8221; said Allidina,
referring to the 34 economies in the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. &#8220;The non-OECD should continue to
support global growth, but the pace is slowing.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley (MS) reiterated its call for gold as a top pick
as investors seek a store of value and haven against debt risk
and a slowing economy in Europe and the U.S. The bank expects
bullion to average $2,200 an ounce next year. Spot gold, which
rallied to an all-time high of $1,921.15 on Sept. 6 and traded
at $1,707.69 at 5:38 p.m. in Singapore, is heading for an 11th
annual gain. The bank also backed corn, soybeans and cattle as
supplies may lag behind demand. 
Goldman&#8217;s Call 
While Goldman pared its 12-month forecast for returns on
the SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index this month, it kept a
&#8220;neutral&#8221; call on commodities in three to six months, and an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation over 12 months, as &#8220;global growth
will provide enough support to demand to drive key commodity
prices higher,&#8221; said analysts led by Jeffrey Currie. 
Commodities are beating equities for a fifth consecutive
year. While the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities has
dropped 13 percent this year and yields on Treasuries fell to
near-record lows, the SP GSCI index rose 3.1 percent. 
Raw materials are heading for a second monthly increase as
crude oil in New York had a &#8220;non-fundamental adjustment,&#8221;
Societe Generale SA&#8217;s commodity strategist Jeremy Friesen said
in an interview yesterday. &#8220;Fundamentally, you can&#8217;t get really
optimistic or really bullish about the commodity markets with
current state of the world,&#8221; he said. 
West Texas Crude 
West Texas Intermediate futures rose 6.3 percent this month
after plans were announced to reverse the direction of a
pipeline to start shipping oil from the contract&#8217;s delivery
point, easing a bottleneck that weighed on prices. 
Expectations for a stronger dollar may provide an
&#8220;additional headwind&#8221; for commodities, said Allidina. Dollar-
denominated commodities tend to move inversely to the currency. 
The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Total Return Index lost 12
percent in the three months to Sept. 30, the biggest drop since
2008, as the dollar rallied 5.7 percent against a six-currency
basket including the euro. 
&#8220;Historically, we have seen periods where both the U.S.
dollar and commodities have rallied, owing to strength in the
U.S. economy,&#8221; wrote Allidina. &#8220;Conversely, any dollar
strength in 2012 is more likely to be a flight to quality. The
implication for the global economic environment under such a
scenario is a bearish signal for commodity demand.&#8221; 
Commodity correlations with other risky assets,
particularly equities, have been rising and are likely to
continue as long as macroeconomic concerns linger, said Allidina.
Increased volatility is likely to persist into 2012, he said.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
and most-profitable U.S. bank, is damping employees&#8217; salary and
bonus expectations as the lender wraps up year-end performance
reviews, said three executives familiar with the process. 
Managers are telling workers at the New York-based firm
that total average compensation may be lower to unchanged from
last year and that year-end bonuses mostly will depend on the
company&#8217;s profit (JPM) and the performance of their divisions. 
JPMorgan, which posted a record $17.4 billion in net income
last year, may earn $19.1 billion in 2011 even as revenue and
profit margins shrink, according to projections by 12 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey. Average 2011 compensation for the bank&#8217;s
256,000 employees will drop or stagnate as the company resists
an industry trend of mass layoffs, the people said. Financial
companies have cut more than 200,000 jobs worldwide this year. 
&#8220;Firms are going to have to base bonuses much more on
merit than strategy,&#8221; Paul Sorbera, president of Wall
Street executive search firm Alliance Consulting, said yesterday
in a phone interview. &#8220;There are groups and departments that
will do well, and groups and departments not doing well, that&#8217;s
where you see challenges to the bonus pool.&#8221; 
Employees in JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank are bracing for a
smaller-than-usual share of the bonus pool, even as net income
for the division during the first nine months of the year
climbed 18 percent to $6.1 billion from a year earlier, said one
of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the
company&#8217;s compensation practices aren&#8217;t public. 
Paper Gains 
The board of directors, led by Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon, opted to exclude certain paper gains from
its performance equations, such as a so-called debt-valuation
adjustment that added $1.9 billion of pretax profit to the
investment bank&#8217;s third-quarter results, two of the people said. 
The unit, which had 26,615 employees at the end of
September, set aside $7.71 billion for compensation in the first
three quarters, a 2 percent drop from a year earlier. The
expense, which includes salaries, bonuses and benefits, was
enough to give each of the division&#8217;s employees $289,611 for the
first nine months of this year, compared with average
compensation of $298,866 for the same period last year. 
While the bank isn&#8217;t planning layoffs, &#8220;we always trim our
sails,&#8221; Dimon, 55, told reporters during an Oct. 13 conference
call. The unit reduced its workforce 4 percent in the third
quarter from the previous three-month period. 
JPMorgan will be &#8220;squeezing a little bit here and
squeezing a little bit there&#8221; to further trim staff at the
investment bank by about 1,000 people, or &#8220;maybe a little bit
more,&#8221; in the next 18 months, Dimon said. 
Credit-Card Unit 
Average bonuses for employees in JPMorgan&#8217;s asset
management division, which is projected to have weaker year-end
results, also will be lower than last year, one of the people
said. Executives in JPMorgan&#8217;s credit-card unit, where profit
more than doubled, may see bonuses rise slightly due to their
division&#8217;s stronger overall performance, the person said. 
Average compensation figures are derived by dividing the
overall compensation pool by the number of employees, and they
don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. Investment banks
set aside revenue throughout the year for pay and typically
decide bonuses at year-end. 
Almost every week since August has brought news of firings
by the world&#8217;s biggest banks. HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s
biggest lender, announced that month it would eliminate 30,000
jobs by the end of 2013. In September, Bank of America Corp.,
the second-biggest U.S. lender, said it would cut the same
number of jobs. Both banks are trimming about 10 percent of
their employees. 
BNP Paribas, France&#8217;s largest bank, said this month that it
will cut about 1,400 jobs at its corporate and investment-
banking unit, and UniCredit SpA, Italy&#8217;s biggest lender, said it
plans to eliminate 6,150 positions by 2015. 
&#8220;The firms that are stable and are performing well overall
have some retention strength versus firms that are struggling,
so that gives them a little flexibility on how deep they have to
go on layoffs and how much they&#8217;re able to allocate to
bonuses,&#8221; Sorbera said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and HSBC
Holdings Plc forecast that China will cut interest rates in
2012, putting the banks at odds with most of their rivals, who
see elevated inflation preventing a reduction. 
The People&#8217;s Bank of China reduced lenders&#8217; reserve
requirements on Nov. 30 for the first time since 2008 as
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis deepened. Eleven economists of 20 in a
Bloomberg News survey conducted yesterday and today say rates
will stay unchanged through next year and another four predict
increases. Goldman and HSBC are among five that see cuts. 
China&#8217;s challenge in loosening monetary policy is to
sustain the expansion of the world&#8217;s second-largest economy
without spurring price gains, fueling bad loans or reigniting a
real estate boom that has started to deflate. Inflation will
remain too high for the benchmark one-year deposit rate to be
lowered from the current 3.5 percent, according to Mizuho
Securities Asia Ltd. 
&#8220;The authorities should be careful that the loosening does
not go too far in order to prevent a repeat of mistakes during
the 2008 global financial crisis,&#8221; said Ma Xiaoping, a Beijing-
based economist with HSBC. Ma said rates may be cut after
inflation falls below 3 percent in the second half of next year. 
Across Asia, policy makers are moving to preserve growth.
In Tokyo, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda yesterday ordered a
fourth extra budget, a step unprecedented since postwar
reconstruction, while Thailand cut interest rates this week and
Indonesia did the same on Nov. 10. 
Spending Cuts 
In a signal that Japan's post-earthquake rebound may be
fading, companies cut spending at a faster pace in the most
recent quarter, data released in Tokyo showed today. Capital
spending fell 9.8 percent from a year earlier, the Finance
Ministry said. 
The MSCI Asia Pacific Index swung between gains and losses
and was little changed at 11:11 a.m. in Tokyo. 
Data due today may show the U.S. jobless rate holding
steady at 9 percent, according to analysts&#8217; median estimate.
A better-than-forecast manufacturing expansion reported
yesterday indicated the world&#8217;s largest economy is weathering
the crisis that prompted a Federal Reserve-led effort this week
to ease borrowing costs for financial firms. 
In the euro area, a report today may show that producer-
price inflation cooled as austerity measures and weakness in
global demand threaten to trigger a recession in the region. 
Worse Than Lehman 
&#8220;The current crisis is grimmer and more challenging than
the global financial crisis triggered by the Lehman Brothers
bankruptcy in 2008,&#8221; Zhu Guangyao, a Chinese vice finance
minister, said at a forum in Beijing yesterday. &#8220;So the most
imperative task now is to try our best to stimulate global
economic growth.&#8221; 
HSBC&#8217;s Ma said three more reserve-ratio cuts are likely in
the first half of next year, along with tax breaks and fiscal
stimulus, after a report yesterday indicated Chinese
manufacturing contracted for the first time since March 2009. 
While China&#8217;s inflation has slowed to 5.5 percent from a
three-year high of 6.5 percent in July, the rate remains 2
percentage points higher than the one-year deposit rate,
discouraging saving and adding to the risk of asset bubbles. 
&#8220;Inflation will decline quickly in coming months as
cooling economic growth caps demand,&#8221; said Song Yu, a Beijing-
based economist for Goldman, who says a rate reduction may come
in the second quarter of 2012, when year-on-year consumer-price
gains may fall below the level of the benchmark deposit rate. 
HSBC sees the one-year lending rate falling by a quarter
percentage point to 6.31 percent in the second half of 2012,
with the deposit rate declining to 3.25 percent. Credit Agricole
CIB, Capital Economics Ltd. and Hang Seng Bank also see cuts. 
Property Slowdown 
Besides weakness in export demand, China&#8217;s real-estate
market is cooling because of a government campaign to limit the
risk of asset bubbles and make housing more affordable after
record lending in 2009 and 2010 triggered price gains. Property
risks overshadow the economy as declines in home sales threaten
to trigger developer collapses, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said this week. 
&#8220;Monetary easing and more expansionary fiscal policy is
necessary to avoid a sharp downturn as external uncertainty is
increasing and domestic growth momentum slowing,&#8221; said Shen Jianguang, an economist at Mizuho who previously worked for the
International Monetary Fund. &#8220;Yet, inflation remains high and
is expected to stay above 4 percent next year which could be
still too uncomfortable for an interest rate cut.&#8221; 
Benchmark rates have been on hold since July after five
increases that began in October last year. Deutsche Bank AG and
Morgan Stanley are in the majority arguing that the central
bank&#8217;s pause will continue through 2012. 
&#8216;Excessive Speculation&#8217; 
Credit Suisse Group AG says the reserve-ratio move is
policy fine-turning and not a reversal of a monetary stance that
the government describes as &#8220;prudent.&#8221; Credit Suisse, Mizuho,
Citigroup Inc. and Australia  New Zealand Banking Group predict
interest rates will rise by the end of next year, the survey
showed. 
Deposit rates are too low, fueling &#8220;excessive&#8221;
speculation in financial assets and making an increase
inevitable,  Dong Tao, a Credit Suisse economist in Hong Kong,
said in a note. 
The half percentage point reserve-requirement cut that
takes effect on Dec. 5 may pump about 350 billion yuan ($55
billoin) into the financial system, according to an estimate by
UBS AG. In yesterday&#8217;s survey, Capital Economics forecast five
more reductions in reserve ratios before the end of next year. 
&#8220;The speed at which the euro-zone crisis is escalating
suggests external conditions will be more challenging over the
next year than previously seemed likely,&#8221; Mark Williams, a
London-based economist for Capital Economics, said in a note.
&#8220;In turn, policymakers are likely to respond more forcefully.&#8221;

Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) agreed to
operate a 360-room London hotel that will be the first Mondrian
location in Europe as the company expands its management
business. 
The hotel will be at Sea Containers on the South Bank near
the River Thames, New York-based Morgans said in a statement
today. The 412,000-square-foot (38,000-square-meter) office
building is being converted into a mixed-use development, with
the hotel scheduled to open in early 2014. 
Morgans, operator of Delano South Beach in Miami Beach,
Florida, and Royalton New York, has been selling some properties
and using proceeds to expand its management business. The
company last month acquired control of Light Group, an operator
of restaurants and nightclub bars, for about $46.5 million to
enhance its hotel-management business. 
&#8220;Sea Containers is an exceptional property in a key
gateway city,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Michael Gross said in
the statement. &#8220;We believe the Mondrian brand has unique appeal
and significant potential for global expansion."&#160;&#160; 
Morgans plans to invest about $15 million in the London
development, which will be the sixth Mondrian. The hotelier has
a 25-year management agreement and two 10-year extension options
for the property.

Walton Street Capital LLC hired CBRE
Group Inc. to sell 95 industrial properties that it acquired for
about $2.8 billion in 2007, when commercial real estate prices
peaked, as a debt payment on the buildings comes due in June. 
The properties are 82 percent leased, according to a CBRE
marketing document, a copy of which was obtained by Bloomberg
News. Occupancy was 91 percent when Chicago-based Walton Street
bought the buildings, known as the CalWest portfolio, Real
Estate Alert reported at the time. 
Property owners have had difficulty refinancing debt amid
the decline in U.S. real estate values from their highs and
upheaval in the commercial mortgage-backed securities market
since July. Walton Street has a $2.45 billion loan repayment
deadline in June. Blackstone Group LP (BX), the world&#8217;s largest
private-equity firm, has acquired almost $600 million of debt on
the buildings, putting it in a position to take control if the
borrower defaults. 
&#8220;Walton Street would have to come up with a lot more money
to hang onto this,&#8221; said Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real
Capital Analytics Inc., a property-research firm in New York.
&#8220;The problem is they bought this portfolio very much at the
height of the market, and I&#8217;m not sure these assets are worth
that anymore.&#8221; 
Commercial real estate prices in the U.S. have fallen 42
percent from their peak in October 2007, according to an index
compiled by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service. 
California Properties 
Walton Street paid about $120 per square foot for the
CalWest properties, which total 23.4 million square feet (2.2
million square meters) and are mostly located in California.
While it&#8217;s difficult to generalize, Fasulo estimates industrial
assets are now valued at about $80 to $100 per square foot. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re actually fortunate that most of the assets are in
California, where there is significant demand,&#8221; Fasulo said.
&#8220;They&#8217;re hoping someone will come along and see the value and
help them work out of a difficult situation.&#8221; 
Eric Mogentale, managing principal at Walton Street, didn&#8217;t
respond to telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.
Christy Ingle, a spokeswoman for CBRE, declined to comment. 
The portfolio is made up of single-building and
multibuilding warehouses and business parks. There are 527
buildings in all and one land parcel, according to the CBRE
document. 
Port Cities 
Many of the properties are located in or near port cities,
including in Orange County, California; Los Angeles; Oakland,
California; San Diego; Seattle; and Portland, Oregon. 
Walton Street bought the assets from a joint venture of the
California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System and Deutsche Bank
AG&#8217;s RREEF unit. The acquisition was funded with the $2.45
billion loan from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., Barclays
Capital Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. About $275 million of
debt was packaged into bonds and sold to investors. 
Some industrial property owners tried unsuccessfully to
sell assets earlier this year, Fasulo said. 
&#8220;After the market got hot earlier in the year, there were
a handful of major industrial offerings that came to market and
the buyers basically pushed back,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lot of stuff
fell apart.&#8221;

Turkey has the highest rates in
emerging Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS) said, after it started following the country&#8217;s overnight
money market rates instead of the central bank&#8217;s benchmark. 
Goldman showed Turkish rates as the highest regionally
after switching from forecasting the one-week repo lending rate,
which the central bank labels as its benchmark rate, according
to the e-mailed report today. Goldman expects the overnight
rate, which it says is now the policy rate for Turkey, to
decline to 9.5 percent by the end of next year compared to the
current 11.27 percent, it said. 
&#8220;We expect overnight Istanbul Stock Exchange interest
rates to hover around 13 percent over the next six months,&#8221;
Goldman economist for the region Ahmet Akarli said in the report
from London. &#8220;However, if we are right about Europe, the
central bank would likely ease policy once again in the second
half of 2012, as balance of payments pressures subside and the
lira finds better fundamental support. Between six to 12 months
therefore we expect the bank to ease overnight ISE rates to
around 9.5 percent.&#8221; 
Turkey&#8217;s central bank introduced a more flexible interest
rate policy on Oct. 26, lending to banks at rates between the
5.75 percent one-week repo rate and overnight rates of as much
as 12.5 percent. Governor Erdem Basci labeled the move as a rate
increase, though he said the 5.75 percent rate was still his
benchmark. 
Turkey now has the highest interest rates in the region
followed by Hungary on 6.5 percent and South Africa on 5.5
percent, Goldman said in the report. 
The central bank may widen its so-called interest rate
corridor to between 5 percent and 14 percent from between 5
percent and 12.5 percent to &#8220;reinforce tight monetary
conditions,&#8221; Goldman said. 
Yields on Turkey&#8217;s two-year lira bonds fell 7 basis points
to 10.32 percent at 5 p.m. in Istanbul. The yield was 9.62
percent before the central bank switched to its more flexible
policy in October.

Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six others may be
questioned under oath by lawyers for the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Rajat Gupta, who was charged with insider trading
as part of the Galleon Group LLC investigation. 
Lawyers for Gupta, a former Goldman Sachs director, sought
to depose Blankfein and other firm executives including Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar, President Gary Cohn, Managing
Director David Loeb and John Bryan, as part of a related suit
brought by the SEC. While U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New
York authorized the questioning of Blankfein before the April 9
criminal trial, he said depositions of the other officers must
be conducted afterwards. 
Gupta, who also sat on the board of Procter  Gamble Co.
and led McKinsey  Co., was indicted by a federal grand jury in
October on five counts of securities fraud and one count of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud for passing inside
information to Galleon co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. Rakoff is
presiding over Gupta&#8217;s criminal case as well as the SEC lawsuit. 
In addition to Blankfein, Rakoff granted SEC requests to
question Gary Rosenbach, Galleon&#8217;s co-founder, and Ian Horowitz,
a former trader who worked for Rajaratnam and was recorded on a
U.S. wiretap. The judge said lawyers may also depose three other
individuals associated with Galleon -- Ananth Muniyappa, Brock
Vandervliet and Leon Shaulov. Also to be deposed is Greg Ormond
of Exemplar Wealth. 
&#8220;The court sees no material argument whatsoever for
delaying the depositions,&#8221; Rakoff said in his ruling. 
Gupta, 62, of Westport, Connecticut, was a close friend and
business associate of Rajaratnam, prosecutors said. He made
multimillion-dollar investments with the hedge fund manager and
also passed him inside information after attending Goldman Sachs
board meetings from 2008 through January 2009, according to the
indictment. 
David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. John Nester, a spokesman
for the SEC, declined to immediately comment on the judge&#8217;s
decision. 
Raj Rajaratnam was sentenced to 11 years in prison, the
longest ever for insider trading, after he was convicted earlier
this year. He is set to surrender to prison officials Dec. 5. 
The cases are U.S. v. Gupta, 11-cr-00907, and SEC v. Gupta,
11-cv-07566, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). 
Appeals Panel to Review Bid to Return BofA Accord to State 
Bank of New York Mellon Corp. (BK) persuaded a federal appeals
court to review its request to return an $8.5 billion bond
settlement with Bank of America Corp. to state court from
federal court for a judge&#8217;s approval. 
The Manhattan-based U.S. Court of Appeals in New York
yesterday granted the petition for expedited review. BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) had also asked the court to reverse U.S. District Judge
William Pauley&#8217;s ruling in October keeping the accord in federal
court for review, rather than remanding it to New York State
Supreme Court. 
The proposed agreement, first filed in New York state
court, would settle claims from investors in the mortgage bonds
of Countrywide Financial Corp., which Charlotte, North Carolina-
based Bank of America (BAC) bought in 2008. The deal was reached with
an institutional investor group that includes BlackRock and
Pacific Investment Management Co. and would apply to 530
mortgage-securitization trusts. 
&#8220;Delay in the resolution of this appeal will prejudice the
institutional investors and other beneficiaries of the trusts,&#8221;
New York-based BlackRock said in papers filed with the appeals
court on Nov. 1. 
Bank of New York, the trustee for the mortgage-bond trusts,
filed the settlement in state court and planned to seek approval
at a November hearing. Under the state proceeding, approval
would bind investors outside the group that negotiated the
agreement. 
An investor group, Walnut Place LLC and related entities,
moved the case to federal court and is fighting a bid by Bank of
New York to return it to state court. 
The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-4554, 11-4571, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
(Manhattan). 
News Corp. (NWSA) Defeats Lawsuit Over Shine Group Acquisition Records 
Rupert Murdoch and his News Corp. persuaded a judge to
throw out an investor lawsuit seeking information about the $675
million purchase of a U.K.-based television production company
owned by Murdoch&#8217;s daughter. 
Delaware Chancery Court Judge John Noble concluded that a
suit filed by an Illinois-based pension fund seeking to inspect
News Corp. documents about the purchase of Elisabeth Murdoch&#8217;s
Shine Group Ltd. was moot since it and other shareholders had
also sued the company&#8217;s directors over the deal. 
Lawyers for Central Laborers Pension Fund can no longer
&#8220;tender a proper purpose for pursuing efforts to inspect the
books and records of News Corp.&#8221; on the acquisition, Noble
ruled yesterday. 
The ruling comes as New York-based News Corp. continues to
be investigated and sued over claims that thousands of people&#8217;s
phones were hacked by its News of the World tabloid, which was
shuttered in July. 
Teri Everett, a News Corp. spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a
call for comment on Noble&#8217;s decision to throw out the investor
suit. 
News Corp. officials announced in February the media
company would acquire Shine Group, which supplies television
content to U.K. TV companies including the British Broadcasting
Corp., in an all-stock deal valued at about $675 million. 
The case is Central Laborers Pension Fund v. News Corp, CA
6287, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington).

New Suits 
Ally Financial Units Sued by Insurer Over Mortgage Loans 
Ally Financial Inc., the auto and home lender that received
a government bailout, was sued by Financial Guaranty Insurance
Co., which claims Ally misrepresented the quality of mortgage
loans underlying securities that Financial Guaranty insured. 
In lawsuits filed Nov. 29 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan, Ally Financial&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage and Residential
Funding units are accused of breach of contract in connection
with policies issued by New York-based Financial Guaranty
related to about $3.8 billion worth of residential mortgage-
backed securities. 
GMAC Mortgage &#8220;fraudulently induced FGIC&#8217;s agreement to
provide this insurance through willful and material
misrepresentations and omissions concerning the nature of its
business practices and the credit quality of tens of thousands
of mortgage loans that provided the collateral&#8221; for securities,
Financial Guaranty said in court papers. 
&#8220;There are substantial legal and factual defenses related
to the FGIC claims and we intend to defend our position
aggressively,&#8221; Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based
Ally, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We have reviewed loan level &#8216;put-
back&#8217; claims from FGIC in the normal course as contractually
required and have met our contractual obligations at all times,
including repurchasing loans where a claim was valid.&#8221; 
FGIC Corp., the holding company for Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co., sought bankruptcy protection from creditors in
August 2010 after suffering losses from the drop in the U.S.
housing market. 
The cases are Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. v. GMAC
Mortgage LLC, 653302/2011; Financial Guaranty Insurance Co. vs.
Residential Funding Co. LLC, 653303/2011; and Financial Guaranty
Insurance Co. vs. Residential Funding Co., 653304/2011, New York
State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). 
Penn State Sued by Man Alleging Years of Sandusky Sex Abuse 
Pennsylvania State University and its former assistant
football coach Jerry Sandusky were sued by an unidentified man
who claims Sandusky sexually abused him more than 100 times over
four years. 
The plaintiff sued yesterday as a John Doe in the
Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, saying he met Sandusky
through the Second Mile youth charity at the age of 10 and was
sexually abused from 1992 to 1996. The abuse occurred in and out
of Pennsylvania, including on university property, according to
the complaint. Second Mile, which Sandusky founded, is also a
defendant. 
Sandusky, 67, is charged with 40 criminal counts tied to
alleged sexual molestation of eight boys from 1994 to 2009. He
has denied wrongdoing. The plaintiff in yesterday&#8217;s suit, the
first against Penn State stemming from the Sandusky case,
accused Second Mile and the university of negligence in failing
to protect children from sexual abuse. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t want other kids to be hurt and abused by Jerry
Sandusky, or anybody like Penn State to allow people like him to
do it -- rape kids!&#8221; the accuser said yesterday in a statement.
&#8220;I never told anybody what he did to me over 100 times at all
kinds of places until the newspapers reported that he had abused
other kids, and the people at Penn State and Second Mile didn&#8217;t
do the things they should have to protect me and the other
kids.&#8221; 
Joseph Amendola, an attorney for Sandusky, didn&#8217;t return a
phone call seeking comment on the suit 
Lisa Powers, a spokeswoman for the State College,
Pennsylvania-based university, declined to comment on the suit,
saying the school hadn&#8217;t received the court documents. 
&#8220;We will review the lawsuit and respond appropriately when
we have done so,&#8221; Eric Herman, a spokesman for Second Mile,
said in an e-mail. &#8220;The Second Mile will adhere to its legal
responsibilities throughout this process. As always, our
thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families.&#8221;

Trials 
BTA Bank (BTAS) Seeks Jail for Ex-Chairman Ablyazov at U.K. Trial 
BTA Bank, the Kazakh lender that defaulted on $12 billion
of debt before restructuring last year, asked a U.K. judge to
jail its former chairman, Mukhtar Ablyazov, for contempt of
court in a fraud lawsuit. 
Ablyazov, who fled Kazakhstan to escape prosecution and
lives in the U.K., violated a 2009 court order freezing his
assets by failing to reveal ownership in a Moscow skyscraper
project and more than 600 shell companies used to conceal his
wealth, BTA&#8217;s lawyer said yesterday at the start of a two-week
trial in London. Ablyazov attended the hearing with an
interpreter. 
&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t quite been a case like this before,&#8221; BTA&#8217;s
lawyer, Stephen Smith of New Square Chambers, said at the
hearing. &#8220;The bank&#8217;s primary purpose is to coerce Ablyazov into
complying with the court order.&#8221; 
BTA, based in Almaty, filed a series of U.K. lawsuits
against Ablyazov and Roman Solodchenko, its former chief
executive officer, claiming they took more than $5 billion from
the bank using fake loans, back-dated documents and a web of
offshore companies. The men deny the claims, while BTA has said
its accountants are still unwinding the transactions behind the
alleged theft. 
Ablyazov claims the bank&#8217;s case is politically motivated
because he was part of the democratic opposition to Kazakhstan&#8217;s
president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who has ruled the country for
more than two decades and was re-elected in April with 95.5
percent of the vote. 
The bank&#8217;s &#8220;true motive&#8221; for seeking to put Ablyazov in
jail during the case is to win &#8220;a knockout blow in order to
impact Ablyazov&#8217;s ability to operate commercially or politically
or to defend himself,&#8221; his lawyer Duncan Matthews said at
yesterday&#8217;s hearing.

Deutsche Bank Lawyer Says HMRC Warning Didn&#8217;t Change Trade 
A Deutsche Bank AG tax lawyer said that in 2009 the lender
considered its German carbon-trading businesses safe and wasn&#8217;t
prompted to change its policies by a warning from British tax
authorities. 
After talking with a German tax investigator in December
2009 and January 2010, he had no indication that the bank&#8217;s
trades were linked to fraud, Goetz Weitbrecht, Deutsche Bank&#8217;s
head of tax for continental Europe, said at a Frankfurt criminal
trial yesterday. That assessment was backed by the fact a tax
review by German officials wasn&#8217;t continued and Value Added Tax
refunds were paid out at the time, he said. 
&#8220;I personally had an all-clear signal,&#8221; Weitbrecht said.
&#8220;Had we gotten the indication that something was wrong, we
would have stopped the trades.&#8221; 
Six managers at emissions-trading companies are on trial in
Frankfurt in what prosecutors call an international scheme to
evade VAT when trading the certificates with Deutsche Bank.
Neither the bank nor Weitbrecht are accused of wrongdoing at the
trial. 
The U.K. Revenue  Customs office, or HMRC, told Deutsche
Bank tax managers in London at a Nov. 18, 2009, meeting that 90
percent of emission trading in some countries was done to commit
VAT fraud, according to a memo read in the court by a defense
lawyer yesterday. 
Weitbrecht said yesterday that, while he may have been
informed about the London HMRC meeting, he doesn&#8217;t remember it.
He relied on information he received from Harald Gebbers, a
German tax investigator with whom he spoke twice on the phone in
December 2009 and January 2010, and on the fact that tax
authorities paid out VAT refunds to Deutsche Bank at the time,
Weitbrecht said. 
&#8220;We had a good and trusting relationship with the
authorities, so I relied on the information I got there,&#8221;
Weitbrecht said. 
German prosecutors formally started their probe of the
trading on Nov. 19, 2009. Tax investigators had already looked
earlier into the issue. Prosecutors are probing 170 suspects,
including seven Deutsche Bank employees. 
Presiding Judge Martin Bach said yesterday he expects
closing arguments to start tomorrow. A verdict may come before
Christmas.

Verdicts/Settlements 
SocGen Wins Defamation Suit Over Report Questioning Solvency 
Societe Generale SA (GLE) won a defamation suit against an online
news site over a September report that France&#8217;s second biggest
bank was shut out of the interbank lending market. 
ElectronLibre.info, published by Paris-based EL Publishing
SAS, must pay 1 euro ($1.35) to Societe Generale for publishing
the report, a Paris court ruled yesterday. 
EL Publishing and director Emmanuel Torregano were ordered
to pay Societe Generale legal costs and to remove the Sept. 7
article from the site within three days or risk an additional
1,000-euro-a-day fine. The site must also run a paragraph on its
homepage saying the court condemned it for running the article
and to pay for that to appear in a publication of Societe
Generale&#8217;s choosing. 
Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis has hit French banks hard.
Societe Generale has fought to maintain customer confidence as
shares have dropped almost 46 percent since Aug. 1 and its
third-quarter profit fell 31 percent on a 333 million-euro
pretax writedown on Greek sovereign debt and lower trading
revenue. The bank sued Associated Newspapers Ltd.&#8217;s Mail on
Sunday in London in October for an August report that it was in
a &#8220;perilous&#8221; state and possibly on the &#8220;brink of disaster.&#8221; 
&#8220;Given the current situation and all that we have
learned&#8221; about banks during the sovereign-debt crisis, &#8220;I will
advise my client to appeal,&#8221; ElectronLibre lawyer Hasna Boulet
said in a telephone interview. 
Rajaratnam Asks Court to Let Him Remain Free During Appeal 
Raj Rajaratnam, the former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund
manager convicted of directing the biggest insider-trading ring
in a generation, asked a federal appeals court to let him remain
free while he challenges the government&#8217;s use of wiretaps in his
trial. 
Rajaratnam, 54, scheduled to begin an 11-year sentence in a
Massachusetts prison next week, claims improper wiretapping of
his phone conversations will lead to reversal of his May
conviction and that he should remain free in the meantime. A
panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York declined to rule
immediately after a 20-minute hearing yesterday. 
Patricia Millett, a lawyer for Rajaratnam, told the court
his appeal presents a &#8220;substantial question of law&#8221; and said
he&#8217;s unlikely to flee to his native Sri Lanka before the appeal
is decided. 
&#8220;His passport was surrendered ages ago. All his family are
here,&#8221; Millett told a three-judge panel of the court.  &#8220;He has
nothing to go to in Sri Lanka.&#8221; 
U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell, who presided over the
case and sentenced Rajaratnam in October, rejected his request
for bail pending the appeal. Rajaratnam claims a March 7, 2008,
wiretap application by FBI special agent B.J. Kang contained
&#8220;glaring omissions&#8221; that would likely lead the appeals court
to reverse his conviction, justifying his release on bail. 
Millett argued the omissions violated Rajaratnam&#8217;s
constitutional rights and the legal requirement that the
government show wiretapping is necessary before getting a
warrant. 
&#8220;There is no substantial question of law likely to result
in a new trial,&#8221; said Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan
Streeter, who argued that the court should let Rajaratnam begin
his prison term. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 11-4416, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-court case
is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).

Litigation Departments 
Ex-Ropes  Gray Lawyer Gets 6 Months in Goffer Tipping Case 
Brien Santarlas, a former lawyer at Ropes  Gray LLP, was
sentenced to six months in prison for passing information on
pending mergers to stock traders. 
Santarlas, 34, pleaded guilty to insider-trading charges in
December 2009 and cooperated with the U.S. investigation of
illegal tips to hedge funds. 
Calling that cooperation &#8220;very, very important,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan yesterday said that
as a lawyer, Santarlas should be held to a high standard and his
sentence should send a message to other attorneys. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s important that those legal professionals understand
they breach those duties at their peril,&#8221; Sullivan said before
he handed down Santarlas&#8217;s sentence. &#8220;You don&#8217;t get a pass.&#8221; 
Santarlas and Arthur Cutillo, a fellow attorney at Ropes 
Gray, passed tips about two pending mergers that the firm was
working on to Cutillo&#8217;s college roommate, Jason Goldfarb, who
passed along the information to Zvi Goffer, a former trader at
Galleon Group LLC. The deals were Bain Capital Partners&#8217;
acquisition of 3Com Corp. and TPG Capital&#8217;s purchase of Axcan
Pharma Inc. 
Santarlas pleaded guilty to securities fraud and agreed to
forfeit $32,500. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forgive myself,&#8221; Santarlas told the judge
yesterday. &#8220;I violated my oath as an attorney.&#8221; 
The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
three, six and 12-month price forecasts by 9.3 percent on the
growing potential for supplies to outpace demand in the 2011-12
season started last month. 
Cocoa will be at $2,450 a ton on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York in three, six and 12 months, down from a previous estimate
of $2,700 a ton, Goldman said in a report dated today. 
In November, cocoa prices fell to their lowest levels since
March 2009. 
&#8220;The growing likelihood that global cocoa production
exceeds demand for a second year in the 2011-12 season that
started last month is leading us to lower our three- to 12-month
forecasts,&#8221; said Damien Courvalin, an analyst at the bank. 
The implementation of the Ivorian reform of the cocoa and
coffee sectors, which includes a price guarantee to farmers of
as much as 60 percent of the international price, may support
investment in cocoa, he said. 
Cocoa has fallen 11 percent in New York over the past
month.

 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) cut its
estimate for Turkey&#8217;s gross domestic product growth next year to
0.5 percent from 1.5 percent, according to an e-mailed statement
today. 
Turkey is likely to experience a &#8220;sharp economic slowdown
on the back of tightening domestic and external financing
conditions,&#8221; Goldman said in a report on central and eastern
Europe and the Middle East by analysts including Ahmet Akarli
dated Nov. 30. &#8220;The Euro-area crisis has recently taken a turn
for the worse,&#8221; the analysts said, adding that &#8220;the crisis
will culminate in output losses, especially in the periphery.&#8221; 
Balance sheet strength and economic interconnectivity will
be key factors for emerging economies in weathering the crisis,
with interconnections being detrimental as it leaves economies
exposed to &#8220;ripple effects throughout the region.&#8221; 
A resolution of the European crisis could lead to a
&#8220;significant recovery in asset prices&#8221; in Turkey, the analysts
said, &#8220;which could be the trigger for recovery through 2013.&#8221; 
The Turkish economy may rebound in the second half of 2012
as external conditions normalize, Goldman said. There is
&#8220;limited scope&#8221; for appreciation of the lira, the world&#8217;s
second worst-performing currency this year after the South
African rand, over the next six to 12 months, it said. 
Turkey&#8217;s recovery from the 2008 global financial crisis was
strong though &#8220;not particularly well-balanced; it was primarily
driven by domestic demand, which led to a significant
deterioration in Turkey&#8217;s external imbalances,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. 
Sticky Inflation 
The coming year may be one of &#8220;two halves&#8221; for Turkey,
according to the report, with the first half of the year
characterized by economic challenges and the second possibly
bringing a &#8220;solid rebound,&#8221; depending on Europe&#8217;s response to
the debt crisis, it said. 
Inflation is likely to remain &#8220;sticky&#8221; at around 10
percent through the middle of next year, pushing Turkey&#8217;s
central bank to reinforce tighter monetary conditions, which
will contribute to a slowdown in economic activity, the report
said. 
Goldman also adjusted its forecasts for the lira downward,
predicting it weakening to 1.95 per dollar in three months.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) forecast
that commodities may rally 15 percent in the next 12 months,
sticking with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on raw materials
and predicting Brent crude may surge to highest level since 2008. 
Commodities may gain as the global economy avoids recession
next year and in 2013, analysts led by London-based Jeffrey Currie said in a report today. Brent, the benchmark used to
price two-thirds of global oil supplies, may jump to $127.50 a
barrel at the end of next year and $135 in 2013, it said. 
Goldman&#8217;s bullishness contrasts with the view from JPMorgan
Chase  Co., which cut commodities to &#8220;underweight&#8221; on Nov. 22
citing policy failures in the U.S. and crisis-hit Europe. Data
today showed manufacturing in China, the largest user of energy
and base metals, shrank for the first time since February 2009. 
&#8220;The European debt crisis remains a significant downside
risk in 2012,&#8221; Goldman said. &#8220;However, as long as the risks
manifest themselves in economic weakness and not in financial
stress that would likely precipitate a global recession, it is
unlikely to severely impact commodity markets.&#8221; 
Commodities as measured by the SP GSCI Spot Index are
beating equities for a fifth consecutive year, signaling that
demand from developing economies is sustaining global growth.
The gauge rallied 9.6 percent in October and 1.6 percent last
month even as the euro-zone debt crisis intensified. 
&#8216;Large Driver&#8217; 
&#8220;The risks to this view are skewed to the upside,
particularly given the return of significant backwardation to
the oil market that could become a very large driver of
returns,&#8221; Goldman said, referring to a pattern where near-term
prices are higher than those further out. 
Brent for January delivery, the most-active contract,
traded at $110.95 at 2:19 p.m. in Singapore as the December 2012
contract was at $105.73. Brent peaked this year at $127.02 in
April, and hasn&#8217;t traded at more than $127.50 since August 2008. 
Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April and turned more bullish the next month before prices
rebounded. The New York-based bank lowered its commodity gain
forecast from 20 percent for the SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity
Index earlier this month. 
JPMorgan Chase cut its commodity outlook citing Europe&#8217;s
worsening debt crisis and slowing growth across emerging markets,
according to the report last month. Raw materials show limited
potential for gains in 2012 as the global economy slows and risk
aversion boosts the dollar, Morgan Stanley analysts led by New
York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report yesterday. 
&#8216;Potential Shortages&#8217; 
Goldman economists reduced their forecast for global
economic growth next year to 3.2 percent from 3.4 percent, the
report said. &#8220;This reduced outlook, but avoidance of global
recession, makes it more likely that commodity markets can
maintain a central course between the whirlpool of a world
economic recession and the rocks of potential shortages.&#8221; 
The 12-month target for copper was retained at $9,500 per
metric ton on China&#8217;s demand growth, the Goldman report said.
The metal for three-month delivery fell as much as 1.3 percent
to $7,781.50 on the London Metal Exchange today. 
The forecast for Comex gold was held at $1,940 an ounce in
12 months, the report said. Futures traded at $1,746.90 at 2:15
p.m. Chicago-traded corn may rise to $6.85 per bushel in three
months, before sliding to $5.50 in 12 months, the bank said,
expecting &#8220;large&#8221; supplies from non-U.S. countries. 
In China, the Purchasing Managers&#8217; Index fell to 49 in
November from 50.4 in October, the China Federation of Logistics
and Purchasing said. That was below the median estimate of 49.8
in a Bloomberg survey of 18 economists. A level above 50
indicates expansion.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $375
million of bonds tied to the Palisades Center shopping mall in
New York, according to a person familiar with the transaction. 
A $242.9 million portion of top-ranked debt with a
projected life of 4.9 years yields 195 basis points more than
benchmark swap rates, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the deal was private. The issuer initially
proposed paying a spread of about 215 basis points, or 2.15
percentage points. 
Developer Pyramid Management Group LLC owns the property
and J.C. Penney Co., Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. (TGT) are the
largest tenants of the 1.9-million square-foot shopping center
in West Nyack, New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. 
Wall Street banks have arranged about $26 billion of
commercial-mortgage backed securities this year. While that&#8217;s up
from $11.5 billion in 2010, issuance totaled more than $200
billion in 2007 when commercial-real estate prices peaked, the
data show. 
The extra yield investors demand to hold top-ranked
commercial-mortgage bonds rather than Treasuries fell yesterday
to 2.77 percentage points from 2.88 percentage points in the
prior week, according to the Barclays Capital CMBS AAA Super
Duper Index.

OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) fell the most
in three weeks in New York after agreeing to take on debt of the
telecommunications holding company it bought yesterday almost
equal to the cost of the acquisition. 
American depositary receipts of the Russian mobile-phone
provider known as MTS fell 3.8 percent to $16 in New York, the
biggest drop since Nov. 9. 
MTS said in a statement on its website yesterday that it
had acquired CJSC Sistema-Inventure, which owns 29 percent of
Moscow City Telephone Network, for 10.6 billion rubles ($342
million). The Moscow-based company also agreed to repay 10.4
billion rubles of CJSC Sistema debt owed to AFK Sistema, CJSC
Sistema&#8217;s former owner and the controlling shareholder in MTS,
by the end of the year, the statement said. 
&#8220;While the price of the acquisition seems adequate, MTS
had to take on a debt load equal to the purchase price, and this
is concerning the investors,&#8221; said Kirill Bakhtin, an analyst
at Moscow brokerage TKB Capital. &#8220;Sistema was faced with this
debt load and through this sale is taking off that debt load and
transferring it to MTS.&#8221; 
MTS declined 1.9 percent to close at 209.02 rubles, or the
equivalent of $6.76, on Russia&#8217;s Micex index. One ADR is equal
to two ordinary shares. 
AFK Sistema is Russian billionaire Vladimir Yevtushenkov&#8217;s
holding company.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Citigroup Inc. (C) were among five banks sued by
Massachusetts for allegedly conducting unlawful foreclosures and
deceiving homeowners. 
Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley filed the
lawsuit yesterday against the three banks, as well as Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC) and Ally Financial Inc., in state court in Boston.
The banks are accused of engaging in unfair and deceptive trade
practices in violation of state law, according to the attorney
general. 
&#8220;We believe the stakes could not be higher at this stage
of the game,&#8221; Coakley said at a press conference in Boston.
&#8220;The foreclosure crisis continues to be at the root of the
economic mess that we find ourselves in and our inability to
turn it around.&#8221; 
State attorneys general across the country have been
negotiating a possible settlement with the five banks that would
resolve a probe into foreclosure practices that began more than
a year ago following disclosures that faulty documents were
being used to seize homes. 
Wells Fargo Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John
Stumpf said in a CNBC interview yesterday that he is
disappointed the lawsuit was filed. Wells Fargo is based in San
Francisco. 
&#8220;We&#8217;ve worked hard to come to an agreement that I think
would be good for the country and good for housing,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We can work through that better together than working it out
in court.&#8221; 
Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Ally, said its
GMAC Mortgage unit, which was named as a defendant, will
&#8220;vigorously defend&#8221; itself against the lawsuit and has worked
&#8220;in good faith&#8221; with Coakley&#8217;s office during the past year to
discuss mortgage servicing and ways to assist borrowers. 
Tom Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, said
the bank is disappointed Coakley filed the lawsuit while
negotiations with state and federal officials continue. 
&#8220;We continue to believe that collaborative resolution
rather than continued litigation will most quickly heal the
housing market and help drive economic recovery,&#8221; Lawrence
Grayson, a spokesman for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America, said in a statement. 
Citigroup hasn&#8217;t had time to review the lawsuit, Mark
Rodgers, a spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in an e-
mail. The bank has been cooperating with the attorney general,
he said.

Wells Fargo Sues U.S. Claiming $350 Million in Excess Taxes 
Wells Fargo  Co. sued the U.S. government claiming it&#8217;s
owed more than $350 million in refunds for tax overpayments. 
Some excess payments were caused by &#8220;computational and
data entry errors&#8221; by the Internal Revenue Service, and the
government hasn&#8217;t acted on its claim for a refund, Wells Fargo
said yesterday in a lawsuit filed in the U.S. Court of Federal
Claims in Washington. 
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, says the overpayments
involve the interest rates on taxes paid and stem from
acquisitions by the bank from 1996 through 2008. 
&#8220;Wells Fargo, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
predecessors whose assets and liabilities were assumed by Wells
Fargo&#8221; filed claims for refunds &#8220;based on application of a net
zero rate of interest,&#8221; according to the complaint. 
Ancel Martinez, a Wells Fargo spokesman, declined to
comment immediately on the lawsuit. Sara Eguren, an IRS
spokeswoman, said the agency doesn&#8217;t generally comment on
litigation. 
The case is Wells Fargo  Co. v. U.S., 11-808, U.S. Court
of Federal Claims (Washington). 
Barclays Sued Over Competing Bid for Carbon Trader 
A Barclays Plc (BARC) unit was accused of using its role as a deal
adviser to a carbon-trading firm to get confidential data about
a takeover target and then buying the company itself, according
to a lawsuit filed by CF Partners (U.K.) LLP. 
CF Partners hired Barclays to work on its plan to buy
Tricorona AB, a Sweden-based emissions trader, in 2008. When the
deal stalled, Barclays began secret negotiations with Tricorona,
according to papers filed by CF Partners&#8217; lawyers. 
Barclays, based in London, completed a $173 million deal
for 85 percent of Tricorona in July 2010. Barclays spokeswoman
Aurelie Leonard declined to comment on the dispute. 
The bank used confidential research from CF Partners about
the value of Tricorona&#8217;s portfolio, according to the lawsuit. CF
Partners wants damages of least 82.4 million euros ($111
million) from Britain&#8217;s second-largest bank for breach of
confidence. 
James McRobbie, general counsel of CF Partners, declined to
comment. 
The case is CF Partners (UK) LLP v Barclays Bank Plc  Anr,
HC11C03443, High Court of Justice, Chancery Division. 
Ex-Millennium Global Manager Charged With Securities Fraud 
Federal prosecutors charged Michael Balboa, a former
portfolio manager at Millennium Global Investments Ltd., with
participating in a securities fraud scheme involving Nigerian
sovereign debt. 
A criminal complaint unsealed yesterday in federal court in
Manhattan alleges that Balboa and his co-conspirators sent
multiple e-mails to an independent valuation agent who inflated
month-end market prices for Nigerian warrants. 
The complaint, filed by U.S. Postal Inspector Jessica
Brown, charges that Balboa engaged in an eight-month scheme in
2008 to commit securities and wire fraud with two unidentified
co-conspirators who are cooperating with the government. 
Millennium Global in 2008 liquidated Balboa&#8217;s hedge fund,
which buys emerging-market debt, after lenders withdrew credit,
two people familiar with the situation said in October 2008.
Millennium Global, a London-based money manager, was founded by
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) executive Michael Huttman in
1994. 
Balbao was also sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. 
The case is U.S. v. Balboa, 11-mag-3038, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Greenberg&#8217;s AIG Bailout Suits Pursue Unique Theories 
Maurice R. Greenberg, the former American International
Group Inc. (AIG) chief executive officer, seeks to break new ground in
lawsuits challenging the U.S. takeover of the insurer in a
bailout that reached $182 billion. 
Greenberg&#8217;s Starr International Co. sued the government
Nov. 21, calling the public assumption of 80 percent of stock in
the insurer in 2008 an unconstitutional &#8220;taking&#8221; of property
that requires $25 billion in compensation. 
Starr also sued the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
saying it breached its duty to AIG shareholders by loaning $85
billion at 14.5 percent while offering better terms to banks in
a &#8220;backdoor bailout.&#8221; AIG almost collapsed after bets tied to
the housing market soured, and the bailout was revised at least
four times before reaching $182 billion. 
Both complaints were filed by attorney David Boies, who
represented the U.S. in its Microsoft Corp. 1999 antitrust trial
and Al Gore in the Florida presidential recount litigation in
2000. 
&#8220;Any time David Boies is asking for $25 billion, I would
say this is not a normal case,&#8221; said Robert H. Thomas of the
Honolulu firm Damon Key Leong Kupchak Hastert. 
&#8220;He takes cutting edge cases in unexplored areas of law,&#8221;
said Thomas, who specializes in land-use and eminent domain.
&#8220;It&#8217;s audacious. As someone who represents plaintiffs in these
kinds of cases, I&#8217;d say more power to him. But it&#8217;s a stretch.&#8221; 
Boies didn&#8217;t respond to requests for comment on his chances
of success in the Starr cases. 
Jack Gutt, a spokesman for the New York Fed, said the
allegations have no merit. 
&#8220;AIG&#8217;s board of directors had an alternative choice to
borrowing from the Federal Reserve, and that choice was
bankruptcy,&#8221; Gutt said. &#8220;Bankruptcy would have left all AIG
shareholders with worthless stock. The Federal Reserve&#8217;s actions
with regard to AIG helped to restore financial stability in the
United States during a period of intense volatility and
vulnerability in the U.S. economy.&#8221; 
The federal claims case is Starr International Co. v. U.S.,
1:11-cv-00779, U.S. Court of Federal Claims (Washington). The
Federal Reserve case is Starr International Co. v. Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, 1:11-cv-08422, U.S. District Court,

Online Gambling Trial Judge &#8216;Unlikely&#8217; to Dismiss Indictment 
A federal judge said he&#8217;s unlikely to dismiss an illegal
gambling case involving the three largest Internet poker
companies doing business in the U.S. 
&#8220;I think it extraordinarily unlikely the entire indictment
will be dismissed,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in
Manhattan said at the end of a hearing yesterday on a request to
dismiss the case. He said he would rule later on the motion and
that a trial, if held, would begin March 12. 
Eleven defendants were accused in April of bank fraud,
money laundering and illegal gambling through the online
companies PokerStars, Full Tilt Poker and Absolute Poker. 
Lawyers for two of the defendants, Chad Elie and John
Campos, argued in court yesterday that the U.S. law making it a
crime for businesses to accept payment in connection with
unlawful Internet gambling doesn&#8217;t apply to poker. 
The case is U.S. v. Scheinberg, 10-cr-00336, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Madoff Trustee Can Appeal $19 Billion JPMorgan Ruling 
The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm, who lost the
right to demand $19 billion in damages from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM), can appeal the ruling to a higher court, a judge said. 
JPMorgan last month won dismissal of trustee Irving
Picard&#8217;s damage claims in his lawsuit alleging the biggest U.S.
bank aided Madoff&#8217;s fraud. Picard can&#8217;t sue for common-law
damages on behalf of the defunct Madoff firm&#8217;s customers, U.S.
District Judge Colleen McMahon ruled in New York. 
The judge directed a clerk to enter a final judgment
dismissing eight claims from Picard&#8217;s complaint and said he can
appeal the ruling under a deal struck with JPMorgan, according
to court papers. Her decision followed a telephone conference
Nov. 30, she said. 
Picard agreed to put his remaining claims against JPMorgan
on hold while he appeals. He told McMahon in a filing last month
he has &#8220;no choice but to appeal the order.&#8221; 
&#8220;Permitting an immediate appeal would provide much-needed
finality for the trustee and the BLMIS estate as to the
viability of these claims,&#8221; he said. BLMIS refers to Madoff&#8217;s
firm. 
Rulings by district judges McMahon and Jed Rakoff have
knocked more than $28 billion off of Picard&#8217;s claims against
banks and may cost him as much as $11 billion in recoveries from
other cases to benefit investors who lost money in the Ponzi
scheme, according to the trustee&#8217;s estimates. 
The amount sought from JPMorgan, Madoff&#8217;s primary banker,
represented Picard&#8217;s estimate of principal lost by all Madoff
investors by the time the Ponzi scheme collapsed in December
2008, according to a complaint filed in June. The bank could
have stopped the fraud if it had passed on its suspicions to
regulators, he alleged. 
JPMorgan said it didn&#8217;t know about or in any way become a
party to the fraud and couldn&#8217;t be held responsible for a scheme
orchestrated by Madoff alone. 
Madoff pleaded guilty and is serving a 150-year prison
term. Picard and his firm have made about $224 million in fees
since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. 
The McMahon cases are Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-
cv-913; Picard v. UBS Fund Services (Luxembourg) SA, 11-cv-4212,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Trials/Appeals 
Lindsey Manufacturing Wins Dismissal of Foreign Bribery Case 
Lindsey Manufacturing Co., the first corporation to go to
trial on charges it violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, won dismissal of its conviction after the judge found the
prosecution had engaged in &#8220;flagrant&#8221; misconduct. 
U.S. District Judge Howard Matz in Los Angeles yesterday
threw out the convictions of the Azusa, California-based maker
of emergency electricity towers; Keith Lindsey, the closely held
company&#8217;s president; and Steve Lee, its finance chief, and he
dismissed the indictment. 
Matz said it was &#8220;with deep regret&#8221; that he was compelled
to find that the government had allowed an Federal Bureau of
Investigation agent to testify untruthfully before a grand jury,
inserted falsehoods in requests for search warrants, improperly
reviewed e-mails between a defendant and her lawyer, and made
misrepresentations to the court, among other misconduct. 
&#8220;Dr. Lindsey and Mr. Lee were put through a severe
ordeal,&#8221; the judge said in his ruling. &#8220;Charges were filed
against them as a result of a sloppy, incomplete and notably
over-zealous investigation, an investigation that was so flawed
that the government&#8217;s lawyers tried to prevent inquiry into
it.&#8221; 
At a Nov. 29 hearing, where the judge had issued his
tentative decision to dismiss the case, Jeffrey Goldberg, a
Justice Department lawyer, argued that the government had made
only &#8220;honest mistakes&#8221; that didn&#8217;t warrant a finding of
misconduct. 
The government is appealing the ruling, according to a
notice of appeal filed yesterday. 
A jury in May found the company and the two executives
guilty of paying bribes, through an intermediary, to executives
with a state-owned Mexican utility to win contracts. Lindsey and
Lee faced as long as five years in prison for each of five
counts of bribing a foreign official, as well as five years for
a conspiracy count. 
The case is U.S. v. Aguilar, 10-1031, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Los Angeles).

Verdicts/Settlements 
Rajaratnam Must Report to Prison After Bail Request Denied 
Raj Rajaratnam, the former Galleon Group LLC hedge fund
manager convicted of directing the biggest insider-trading ring
in a generation, must go to prison while he challenges the
government&#8217;s use of wiretaps in his trial, an appeals court
ruled. 
Yesterday&#8217;s decision clears the way for Rajaratnam, 54, to
report to federal prison in Massachusetts to begin serving an
11-year sentence. He has been ordered to surrender Dec. 5. 
&#8220;The defendant shall surrender at such time and place as
shall be instructed by the district court,&#8221; a panel of U.S.
appeals court judges in New York said, denying him a chance to
remain free on bail. Terence Lynam, a lawyer for Rajaratnam,
declined to comment on the ruling. 
In a 20-minute hearing Nov. 30 before the appeals court in
Manhattan, a defense lawyer said improper wiretapping of
Rajaratnam&#8217;s phone conversations would lead to reversal of his
May conviction and that he should remain free in the interim. 
Patricia Millett, another lawyer for Rajaratnam, told the
three-judge panel that the appeal presented a &#8220;substantial
question of law&#8221; and that Rajaratnam was unlikely to flee to
his native Sri Lanka before a ruling. 
U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell, who presided over the
case and sentenced Rajaratnam in October, had rejected a request
for bail pending the appeal. 
The appeals court panel included U.S. Chief Judge Dennis
Jacobs and Circuit Judges Robert Katzmann and Peter Hall. 
The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 11-4416, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). The lower-court case
is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).

Roomy Khan&#8217;s Sentencing Delayed as Cooperation Continues 
Roomy Khan&#8217;s sentencing for her role in the Galleon Group
LLC insider-trading case was postponed after U.S. prosecutors
said she&#8217;s still helping them investigate at least one person
who hasn&#8217;t been charged. 
Khan, a former Intel Corp. (INTC) executive and stock trader, was
among the first people to plead guilty and cooperate with the
U.S. against Raj Rajaratnam, Galleon&#8217;s co-founder. She was
scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 5. Yesterday, U.S. District Judge
Richard Berman, who is presiding over her case, granted the
government&#8217;s request and set her sentencing for March 1. 
While Khan didn&#8217;t testify at Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial, she played
a crucial role for the U.S. as prosecutors and agents with the
FBI used her information to obtain a court-authorized wiretap of
Rajaratnam&#8217;s phone, according to testimony from a pretrial
hearing in his case last year. 
&#8220;Khan is continuing to cooperate in connection with the
investigation of at least one individual who has not yet been
charged,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Michaelson said. 
Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of directing the
biggest insider-trading ring in a generation and sentenced to
serve an 11-year prison term. He lost a bid yesterday to remain
free pending his appeal and was ordered by a panel of judges at
the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York to surrender to U.S.
prison officials on Dec. 5. 
The case is U.S. v. Khan, 09-cr-991, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Del Monte Wins Approval of Settlement of KKR Buyout Suits 
Del Monte Foods Co. (DLM) and Barclays Plc won a judge&#8217;s approval
of a $89.4 million settlement of investor lawsuits over the
buyout of the pet-food maker by a group of private-equity firms
led by KKR  Co. 
The accord, which gave Del Monte investors about 50 cents
more a share, &#8220;provides excellent consideration,&#8221; Delaware
Chancery Court Judge Travis Laster said before approving the
settlement yesterday at a hearing in Wilmington. 
Investors in San Francisco-based Del Monte, maker of Meow
Mix cat food and Milk Bone dog biscuits, alleged they were
shortchanged in KKR&#8217;s buyout, for which London-based Barclays
provided some financing. Shareholders received a total $19.50 a
share as a result of the accord, according to court filings. 
Kristi Huller, a KKR spokeswoman, couldn&#8217;t immediately
comment on Laster&#8217;s decision to approve the settlement yesterday
and Kerrie-Ann Cohen, a Barclays spokeswoman, declined to
comment. Chrissy Stengel, a Del Monte spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment. 
The accord resolves claims that Barclays, which also served
as Del Monte&#8217;s financial adviser, had conflicting interests in
the $5.3 billion deal because of its financing for the buyers.
The private-equity group led by New York-based KKR included
Vestar Capital Partners and Centerview Partners LLP. 
As part of the settlement, Laster yesterday approved a
total of $22.3 million to cover Del Monte investors&#8217; legal fees
and costs in bringing the case. 
The case is In re Del Monte Foods Co. Shareholder
Litigation, CA6027, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). 
Ingersoll-Rand Reaches Settlement in Employee Payout Dispute 
Ingersoll-Rand Plc (IR) reached a settlement with 130 employees
who sued for as much as $72 million in pay under an incentive
plan tied to the sale of the company&#8217;s Dresser-Rand Group Inc. (DRC)
unit. 
Terms weren&#8217;t disclosed in court documents. The accord was
reached on Nov. 29 during the third week of a trial in federal
court in Newark, New Jersey. U.S. District Judge Dickinson
Debevoise dismissed jurors before they could weigh whether
Ingersoll-Rand owed from $11 million, as the company argued, to
$72 million, as workers claimed. 
&#8220;This was a good settlement,&#8221; attorney Mark Lanier, who
represented a group of employees, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;We were excited to finish the case. But by settling at this

appeal.&#8221; 
Ingersoll-Rand, a Swords, Ireland-based maker of heating
and ventilation equipment, offered the plan, dated in 2000, to
retain workers when it began trying to sell Dresser-Rand. After
Dresser-Rand, which makes oilfield equipment, was sold in 2004
for $1.2 billion, Ingersoll-Rand said the 2000 plan no longer
applied. Workers sued and Debevoise ruled the plan remains in
effect, setting up the trial. 
Misty Zelent, a spokeswoman for Ingersoll-Rand, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment on the settlement.

Litigation Departments 
Two Rothstein Employees Charged in Lawyer&#8217;s Ponzi Scheme 
Federal prosecutors charged two more associates of Scott
Rothstein, the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, attorney who last year
admitted to selling investors interest in bogus settlements in
sexual-harassment and whistle-blower cases. 
William Boockvor, 66, was charged yesterday with one count
of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and helping Rothstein&#8217;s
scheme by preparing false documents purportedly from TD Bank (TC),
where Rothstein&#8217;s firm held about 38 trust accounts, prosecutors
said in a statement. 
The statements were used to convince investors that
Rothstein&#8217;s law firm was holding money in trust when in fact the
money was being spent on his lavish lifestyle and political and
charitable contributions. Boockvor worked for the firm doing a
variety of administrative tasks, according to prosecutors. 
Marybeth Feiss, 42, one of Rothstein&#8217;s administrative
assistants, was charged with violating federal election campaign
laws and conspiring to defraud the U.S. by helping to bundle
more than $1 million in contributions to the presidential
campaign of U.S. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican. 
The government said Feiss organized political fundraisers
where contributions were solicited for McCain&#8217;s campaign. The
law firm allegedly reimbursed its associates and employees for
their contributions, disguising those payments as bonuses or
expense reimbursements. 
Feiss, reached at home, declined to comment on the charges.
No attorney was listed in federal records for Boockvor, and he
couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached for comment. 
Boockvor used unidentified co-conspirators who worked for
TD Bank to convince potential investors that the bank statements
were legitimate, the government said. 
The latest cases bring to eight the number of people
charged in the scheme. &#8220;We are not done yet,&#8221; U.S. Attorney
Wifredo A. Ferrer in Miami said yesterday in a statement. 
The cases are U.S. v. Boockvor, 0:11-cr-60281, and U.S. v.
Feiss, 0:11-cr-60282, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
Florida (Fort Lauderdale).

Investment banks are cutting traders
and analysts in climate-related businesses as a slump in shares
and carbon emission permits coincides with a deadlock in
international climate talks. 
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Managing Director for Environmental
Markets Odin Knudsen left his post in New York by mutual accord
after his team was shrunk, while UBS Securities LLC fired Vice
Chairman Jon Anda and his Climate Policy Group co-workers, Anda
and Knudsen said in interviews. Ben Lynch left his London job as
an alternative-energy analyst for Commerzbank AG (CBK) and it was
taken over by a utilities analyst, company spokeswoman Claire
Tappenden said. The departures took place since September. 
The biggest banks, trying to recover from trading losses
and a clampdown on investing their own money, are clipping
resources from emissions-related businesses as United Nations
talks have failed for years to extend Kyoto Protocol greenhouse-
gas curbs beyond their expiration in 2012. The International
Emissions Trading Association, the main carbon-market trade
group, has seen its membership slide about 6 percent this year. 
&#8220;People are leaving the industry because they&#8217;ve been
fired or because they see no prospects,&#8221; said Emmanuel Fages,
head of energy research for Europe at Societe Generale SA in
Paris. &#8220;That is the sad story.&#8221; 
Climate Talks 
Fages said he used to work full-time on carbon at the
French bank&#8217;s emissions trading unit Orbeo and the industry now
occupies about 20 percent of his time. 
JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony declined to comment. 
UBS officials confirmed Anda&#8217;s departure and declined to
give details about his department. &#8220;Jon Anda has left the bank
and is seeking new opportunities,&#8221; UBS&#8217;s New York-based
spokesman Christiaan Brakman said in an e-mailed response to
questions. &#8220;UBS remains committed to address climate change.&#8221; 
The Kyoto emissions caps for industrialized nations, which
underpin carbon trading, are set to end in December 2012 unless
United Nations-led talks under way in South Africa produce an
extension. 
Clean-power stocks and emission permits have plunged as the
European Union, the biggest advocate for climate action among
developed nations, is ravaged by its own sovereign debt crisis. 
Benchmark EU carbon permits lost 44 percent in the year
through yesterday and fell to a record last week while the
Bloomberg Industry solar energy index (BISOLAR) plunged 65 percent,
damping investor demand for research and advisory services. 
EU allowances for delivery this month fell 0.4 percent to
7.90 euros a metric ton today as of 8:14 a.m. on London&#180;s ICE
Futures Europe exchange. The Bloomberg Industry Global Leaders
Large Solar Energy index     fell 0.6 percent, headed for its first
decline this week. 
&#8216;Shakeouts, Departures&#8217; 
&#8220;There are shakeouts and departures happening as you would
expect to be the case during any market that was a little bit
unsure about where it was going,&#8221; Henry Derwent, president of
the International Emissions Trading Association, said in a
telephone interview. Carbon trading &#8220;is currently suffering, as
so many other markets are, from low economic activity in the
main area which is the European Union.&#8221; 
About 10 institutions have withdrawn from the Geneva-based
trade group this year, cutting membership to about 150
companies, spokeswoman Noria Mezlef said. 
EU countries, which subsidize clean energy and bought more
than 80 percent of solar panels last year as well as running the
biggest carbon market, are facing pressure to rein in budget
deficits as investors dump their sovereign debt. The turmoil
wracking the bloc has hurt photovoltaic equipment stocks and
businesses that service that industry. 
&#8216;Little Companies&#8217; 
&#8220;It been a tough time for everyone doing solar,&#8221; John Hardy, who lost his job in New York as an alternative energy
analyst at Gleacher  Co. in August, said in an interview.
&#8220;Market capitalizations have dropped to a point where funds
can&#8217;t touch these little companies.&#8221; 
He said he expects some of his colleagues and competitors
will also be let go because the market valuation of the industry
can no longer sustain their research. 
Dennis Mignon left his job as a carbon trader at First
Climate in Bad Vilbel, Germany, to trade government bonds at DZ
Bank AG in Frankfurt, he said last week. 
The value of carbon trading fell 8 percent to 23.7 billion
euros ($32 billion) in the third quarter from the previous three
months as the price of European emission permits tumbled,
according to New Energy Finance data. 
ClimateCare 
UBS shut its climate-change advisory practice and fired its
staff after theSwiss bank lost $2.3 billion from unauthorized trading this year. 
JPMorgan, which sold its ClimateCare carbon offset
developer to the unit&#8217;s management in August, tied for second
place producing new credits last year, behind Vitol Group and
alongside Climate Change Capital Ltd., according to Bloomberg
New Energy Finance data. 
The New York bank cut back its environmental markets team
to just &#8220;a few&#8221; people compared with several &#8220;tens&#8221; of
people around the world at its height, Knudsen said in an
interview. 
Societe Generale said Nov. 25 it agreed to sell its 50
percent stake in carbon trading joint venture Orbeo to its
partner Solvay SA. The Paris-based lender will develop emissions
trading as part of its gas and power business, deputy head of
commodities Jonathan Whitehead said in a telephone interview. 
&#8220;The emissions market, whatever shape or form it ends up
continuing in, is going to be an important part of our offering
for our clients,&#8221; he said Nov. 25. &#8220;The emissions market goes
hand in hand with the power market in Europe.&#8221; 
A record 1.5 billion tons of EU carbon permits was traded
on the ICE Futures Europe exchange from July to September even
as the price slump cut the value of the transactions, exchange
data show. Trade in UN carbon credits was a record 348 million
tons in the same period.

Edward C. Forst, co-head of the
investment management division at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), will
leave at the end of the year and cede his role to Eric S. Lane,
according to internal memos obtained by Bloomberg News. 
Forst, 50, who first joined Goldman Sachs in 1994, is the
third member of the New York-based bank&#8217;s management committee
to resign since the beginning of November, after Kevin W. Kennedy, who ran the business in Latin America, and Yusuf A. Alireza, co-head of the Asia-Pacific business outside Japan. 
Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein has said that building the investment management
division, which oversees private equity and hedge funds and also
handles money for wealthy individuals, is a priority for the
firm. Timothy O&#8217;Neill, who has served as a co-head of the unit
since 2008, will remain in the role alongside Lane, the memos
said. 
Lane, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and was promoted to
partner in 2002, is a longtime employee of the investment
management division, known as IMD. In that sense he represents a
change from recent leaders of the business, including Forst,
O&#8217;Neill and former managers such as Marc A. Spilker and Peter S. Kraus, who were transferred from positions in trading or
investment banking. 
Leader, Clients 
&#8220;As a long-tenured leader in IMD, Eric has demonstrated
dedication to our clients and a deep understanding of markets,&#8221;
Blankfein and Gary D. Cohn, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s president and chief
operating officer, said in one of the memos to staff yesterday.
&#8220;His extensive experience in the division positions him
well to lead IMD with Tim.&#8221; 
Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, confirmed the memos&#8217; contents and declined to comment
further. The New York Times wrote about the changes yesterday. 
Forst, who worked at Bankers Trust before joining Goldman
Sachs, started his Goldman Sachs career in capital markets and
later held senior roles in the equities and fixed-income,
currencies and commodities, or FICC, trading divisions. 
He became co-head of investment management in 2007 and then
left the firm in 2008 for a role at Harvard University. A year
later, he returned to Goldman Sachs as the firm&#8217;s senior
strategy officer and in 2010 returned to his current role at the
investment management division.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s advanced kidney cancer
treatment may not be effective at prolonging the time some
patients live without the disease getting worse, a Food and Drug
Administration staff report said today. 
The FDA said it was concerned that the number of U.S.
patients who benefited from the therapy, chemically known as
axitinib, was small. People who showed the most response were
first treated with medicines known as cytokines, which are not
used as much as newer treatments. 
&#8220;Advice is sought on whether the issue of&#8221; survival free
from disease progression is &#8220;being driven by a subset of
patients that is likely to be scarce in the United States,&#8221;
according to the report. 
The medicine from New York-based Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
biggest drugmaker, may compete with tivozanib from Aveo
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is also
being tested to treat advanced kidney cancer. Both block
receptors in the body thought to play a role in spreading
tumors. Kidney cancer affects 296,000 people in the U.S.,
according to the American Cancer Society. 
An advisory panel is scheduled to meet on axitinib Dec. 7
and make recommendations to the agency on the risks and benefits
of the treatment. The FDA isn&#8217;t required to follow the panel&#8217;s
advice. 
Pfizer fell less than 1 percent to $19.84 at the close in
New York. The shares have gained 13 percent this year. 
More than a third of patients in the trial had received
cytokines. 
Kidney Cancer Treatments 
Typical kidney cancer treatments, according to the National
Institutes of Health, include surgery to remove part of all of
the kidney, radiation, chemotherapy and other drugs such as
Bayer AG (BAYN)&#8217;s Nexavar. Pfizer compared axitinib to Nexavar, which
the FDA approved in 2005, in its final-phase clinical trial. 
Results &#8220;indicate that axitinib has demonstrated a
statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement
in efficacy&#8221; compared with Nexavar, Pfizer said in the report
that it will present to the advisory panel Dec. 7. 
The trial found axitinib kept the disease from progressing
for a median of 6.7 months compared with 4.7 months for Nexavar,
according to results released in June. The study included 723
patients. The FDA is expected to decide whether to approve
Pfizer&#8217;s drug by March 13.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Wyeth unit and Teva
Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. were accused by a group of prescription
drug retailers of illegally keeping a generic version of the
Effexor XR antidepressant off the market. 
&#8220;Wyeth engaged in an overarching anticompetitive scheme to
prevent and delay the approval and marketing of generic versions
of Effexor XR,&#8221; the retailers, including Walgreen Co. (WAG) and
Kroger Co. (KR), said in a complaint filed Nov. 30 in federal court
in Trenton, New Jersey. 
The retailers allege that Wyeth fraudulently obtained
patents and engaged in &#8220;sham litigation&#8221; to delay generic
versions of the extended release drug. They also alleged that
Wyeth and the U.S. unit of Israel-based Teva Pharmaceuticals
Industries Ltd. colluded to keep Teva (TEVA)&#8217;s generic version off the
market until June 2010. 
Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for New York-based Pfizer, and

Research Affiliates Sues WisdomTree Over Portfolio Patents 
Research Affiliates LLC, the asset-management company, sued
WisdomTree Investments Inc. for allegedly infringing three of
its patents. 
The patents include a method for using accounting-data-
based indexing to create a portfolio of assets, Newport Beach,
California-based Research Affiliates said in a complaint filed
Dec. 1 in federal court in Santa Ana, California. 
&#8220;Our main focus is product quality and performance, but we
will protect our intellectual property and the interests of our
business partners when our patents are infringed,&#8221; Research
Affiliates&#8217; Chairman Rob Arnott said in a statement. 
Research Affiliates, a closely held company majority owned
by its employees, said $78 billion in assets are managed using
investment strategies it developed. The company told WisdomTree
in 2005 that it was applying for one of the patents at issue,
according to the complaint. 
WisdomTree responded by saying that Research Affiliates&#8217;
intellectual property rights were &#8220;speculative at best&#8221; and
that WisdomTree was submitting prior public information about
inventions related to the proposed patent to the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, according to the complaint. The office issued
the patent to Research Affiliates, according to the filing. 
Stuart Bell, a spokesman for New York-based WisdomTree,
didn&#8217;t respond to messages seeking comment. 
Financial products that Research Affiliates claims infringe
its patents include WisdomTree Dividend Index and WisdomTree
Earnings Index. Research Affiliates is seeking a jury trial and
a court order to stop WisdomTree from using the methods alleged
to be patented. 
WisdomTree, a firm specializing in exchange-traded funds,
said it manages about $11.4 billion in ETF assets. Michael
Steinhardt, the former hedge-fund manager, is chairman.

Trademark 
Multiple &#8216;Occupy&#8217; Trademark Applications Filed at USPTO 
The &#8220;Occupy&#8221; movement has spawned more than 25 different
applications to register trademarks containing various
permutations of the name in such phrases as &#8220;Occupy Wall
Street,&#8221; according to the database of the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. 
Among the most recent applications are one filed Nov. 22 to
register &#8220;Occupy Los Angeles&#8221; for use with &#8220;political action
committee services.&#8221; The applicant lists only a general-
delivery address in Los Angeles. 
On that same date, Kop-N-Go Inc. of New York filed an
application to register &#8220;Occupy Hip Hop&#8221; tor use with hats,
sweatshirts and t-shirts. 
A resident of Bloomington, California, filed an application
that day to register &#8220;Occupy Any Wear&#8221; for use on clothing.
ERB  Sons LLC of Los Angeles filed an application Nov. 21 to
register &#8220;Occupy America&#8221; to be used on long and short-sleeved
t-shirts. 
&#8220;Occupy the Outdoors&#8221; is a trademark sought by Whitetail
Institute of North America Inc. The Pintlala, Alabama-based
company, which filed its application Nov. 17, appears from its
website to be a producer of seeds for food plants intended to
attract deer. 
A mark containing &#8220;Occupy the Dance Floor&#8221; is sought by a
resident of Baltimore, Maryland. He says in his application --
filed Nov. 15 -- that it will be used for T-shirts. 
Other pending applications are to register &#8220;Occupy Las
Vegas,&#8221; &#8220;Occupy the Vote 2012,&#8221; &#8220;Occupy Together,&#8221; and
&#8220;Occupy as One.&#8221; There is also an application, filed Oct. 19
by a resident of Powell, Ohio, to register &#8220;Everywhere I Go I
Occupy&#8221; as a mark, also to be used on t-shirts. 
Bob Marley&#8217;s Family Sues Performer&#8217;s Half Brother for Infringing 
The holders of the intellectual property rights related to
the Reggae singer Bob Marley sued the late performer&#8217;s half
brother for trademark infringement. 
The suit, filed Dec. 1 in federal court in Ft. Lauderdale,
Florida, is related Richard Booker&#8217;s applications to register
&#8220;Mama Marley&#8221; and &#8220;Nine Mile&#8221; as trademarks in the U.S. 
According to court papers, Booker operates a restaurant in
Jamaica named &#8220;Mama Marley&#8217;s&#8221; and conducts tours of the Nine
Mile region of Jamaica, a region of the island country
associated with the late singer and where he is buried. 
The IP rights holders also complain that Booker has
advertised his restaurant in the U.S. and operates the Nine Mile
Music Festival and the &#8220;www.bobmarleymovement.com&#8221; website
they say infringe their marks. They claim that to no avail they
engaged in &#8220;extensive settlement talks&#8221; with Booker over his
use of the name and likeness of the late performer. 
The rights holders -- Marley&#8217;s widow and nine of his 11
children -- asked the court to bar further trademark
infringement by Booker, and for an order cancelling Booker&#8217;s &#8220;9
Mile Music&#8221; trademark and barring the registration of several
pending trademark applications. Additionally, they seek awards
of money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. 
They are represented by Bruce G. Hermelee of Hermelee 
Geffin LLC of Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. 
The case is Fifty-Six Hope Road Music Ltd. v. Richard
Booker, 1:11-cv-24326-MGC, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Florida (Ft. Lauderdale).

Copyright 
Anti-Piracy Group BREIN Accused by Composer of Infringing 
Bescherming Rechten Entertainment Industrie Nederland, the
Dutch anti-piracy group known as BREIN, has itself been accused
of copyright infringement by a musician who said the group is
using his work without permission, the anti-copyright Torrent
Freak website reported. 
Melchior Rietveldt was asked by BREIN to compose music for
an anti-piracy video to be shown at a local music festival, and
is now objecting to its use by the organization in other
contexts, according to Torrent Freak. 
He found his music included in an anti-piracy message
embedded in a DVD of one of the Harry Potter films, Torrent
Freak reported. 
The composer is seeking at least 1 million Euros ($1.4
million) in compensation for what he says is unauthorized use of
his work, according to Torrent Freak. 
Lawmakers Float Alternative to Google-Opposed Online Piracy Bill 
U.S. lawmakers are circulating an alternative approach to
Hollywood-backed anti-piracy legislation after Internet
companies including Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. objected to
the bills. 
Under the draft proposal from a bipartisan group of Senate
and House members, U.S. intellectual-property holders could
petition the U.S. International Trade Commission to investigate
foreign websites accused of trafficking in pirated content and
counterfeit goods. The commission is an independent agency set
up to protect U.S. markets from unfair trade practices. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to be able to handcuff the bad actors that
are selling fake movies and Viagra,&#8221; Senator Ron Wyden, an
Oregon Democrat who helped draft the proposal, said in an
interview Dec. 1. &#8220;This is a model that gets us a chance to go
after them without doing so much damage to the architecture of
the Internet.&#8221; 
Anti-piracy bills in the House and Senate have pitted the
nation&#8217;s biggest Internet companies against the U.S. film and
music industries, which want the government to do more to halt
the online sale of goods such as knockoff watches and illegally
copied music. Web companies say the proposed legislation would
require them to police the Internet, undermining the growth of
the U.S. technology industry. 
The House bill would let the U.S. attorney general seek
court orders requiring U.S. Internet-service providers, search
engines, payment processors and ad networks to block or cease
business with websites linked to online piracy. The measure,
introduced in October by House Judiciary Committee Chairman
Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican, also would give intellectual-
property holders ways to compel payment and ad services to sever
ties with such websites. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee approved in May a similar
bill, S. 968, known as the Protect IP Act. Both the House and
Senate measures have multiple co-sponsors from both parties.
Wyden has threatened to block the Protect IP Act from reaching a
vote in the full Senate. 
Under the alternative proposal, the International Trade
Commission would be authorized to issue cease-and-desist orders
against foreign websites that could be used to force payment
processors, such as Visa Inc. or PayPal Inc., and online
advertising networks to cease providing services to such
websites. 
The trade agency has the power to block imports of products
found to infringe intellectual property rights, can propose
tariffs on products to counter subsidized imports and
investigates trade-related issues for Congress and the
president. 
Wyden said the group intends to circulate the draft and
request feedback, and introduce legislation in the coming weeks. 
The alternative proposal was signed by 10 lawmakers from
both parties, including Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell of
Washington and Mark Warner of Virginia; Republican
Representatives Darrell Issa of California and Jason Chaffetz of
Utah; and Democratic Representatives Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren
of California. 
The House bill is H.R. 3261.

Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage 
Colorado Holds Hearing on Fracking Formula Trade Secrets 
Colorado&#8217;s oil company regulators are to hear testimony
today about the confidentiality of formulas for fluids used to
fracture underground rock structures in the search for oil, the
Coloradoan reported. 
Governor John Hickenlooper has proposed a new rule that
would mandate disclosure of chemicals used for hydraulic
fracturing, or &#8220;fracking,&#8221; which many oil-exploration
companies maintain should be exempted as trade secrets,
according to the Coloradan. 
Some environmental groups contend it&#8217;s vital to disclose
these chemicals as some of them could contaminate drinking
water, according to the newspaper. 
Under the proposed rule, energy companies would have to
disclose their fracking formulas on a publicly accessible
website, the Coloradoan reported.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE) must pay $72.6 million in
damages to three women who said they developed breast cancer
after taking the company&#8217;s menopause drugs, a Philadelphia jury
decided. 
Jurors today in state court deliberated over two days
before finding hormone-replacement drugs made by Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth
and Pharmacia Upjohn units were responsible for Susan Elfont,
Bernadette Kalenkoski and Judy Mulderig developing cancer. The
panel awarded Elfont $20 million in compensatory damages;
Kalenkoski, $27.85 million; and Mulderig, $24.75 million. 
&#8220;We are obviously disappointed with the verdict in this
case,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said in a written
statement. &#8220;Once the verdict is finalized, the company will
weigh its legal options to determine how it will continue with
the case.&#8221; 
More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. 
Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. 
Litigation Scorecard 
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now lost 10 of the 18
Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006. The
drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out after trial or
had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the verdicts through
settlements, while other decisions are on appeal. It also has
had cases thrown out before trial. 
Pfizer announced in May that it had settled a third of the
pending Prempro cases and had set aside $772 million to help
resolve the claims. 
Elfont, 66, is a former teacher who once lived in Northeast
Philadelphia, Tobi Millrood, a lawyer for the three women, said
during the trial. She took Premarin and Provera for more than
two years before being diagnosed with breast cancer in 1997,
Millrood said. 
Retired Teacher 
Kalenkoski, 68, is a former nursing home aide who took
Prempro for more than four years and was diagnosed with cancer
in 2002, Millrood said. Mulderig, 68, a retired teacher from
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, took Premarin and Provera for 11 years
starting in 1988, the lawyer added. 
Millrood told jurors during the first phase of the two-week
trial that none of the three women had a family history of
breast cancer and experts concluded their use of menopause drugs
led to the development of the disease. 
Millrood declined today to comment on the verdict because
jurors must further consider Wyeth&#8217;s liability for damages in
the second phase of the case, slated to begin Dec. 9. 
Diane Sullivan, one of the lawyers for the Pfizer units,
said the evidence was unclear on how long the women had taken
menopause drugs because of gaps in their pharmacy records. She
said the women&#8217;s individual cases differed from those covered by
the WHI study and plaintiffs shouldn&#8217;t be able to rely on that
study to make their case. 
&#8220;They are trying to make these women fit with the WHI
study and they don&#8217;t fit,&#8221; Sullivan told the seven-man, five-
woman jury in closing arguments. 
The last Prempro verdict against the Pfizer units came a
year ago in Puerto Rico, where a jury awarded $1.5 million in
damages to a pharmacist who took the menopause drug. The company
won the next two cases before today&#8217;s verdict. 
The Philadelphia case is Elfont v. Wyeth Pharmaceuticals
Inc., 00924, Jury Term 2004, Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas
(Philadelphia).

Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world&#8217;s
biggest company by market value, expects Abu Dhabi to change the
terms for the Persian Gulf emirate&#8217;s main oil producing
concession when the current agreement expires in 2014, its chief
executive officer said. 
&#8220;The concession structure and terms that served all
parties well in the past are just no longer appropriate in
today&#8217;s environment, both in terms of cost and prices,&#8221; Rex Tillerson said today at the World Petroleum Congress in Doha.
&#8220;Everyone is committed to finding that new structure that
allows us to continue to work together.&#8221; 
Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and BP Plc produce oil at
onshore fields in Abu Dhabi under a concession agreement that
dates back to 1939. The fields began commercial production in
1960 and Abu Dhabi&#8217;s state-run oil company joined as a partner
in the 1970s, forming the current operating venture Abu Dhabi
Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, or ADCO. ADCO holds the
concession for six main onshore fields until 2014. 
The joint venture agreement is &#8220;under very active
discussion with the national oil company and government of Abu
Dhabi,&#8221; Tillerson said, without giving further details. Shell&#8217;s
Chief Executive Officer Peter Voser, also attending the Doha
conference, declined to comment on the concession. 
Abu Dhabi holds more than 90 percent of crude in the United
Arab Emirates, one of the few Middle East states that allow
foreign companies to explore for and produce oil within its
borders. State-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc, holds
60 percent of ADCO, with the international oil companies Exxon,
Shell, BP, Total SA (FP) and Partex Oil  Gas holding the rest. 
Abu Dhabi is the largest sheikhdom of the United Arab
Emirates.

General Motors Co. (GM) reported China
sales in November rose at the fastest pace in 10 months, led by
deliveries of Wuling light trucks and Buick Excelle sedans. 
Deliveries to Chinese dealers last month climbed 20 percent
from a year ago to 237,130 vehicles, the Detroit-based company
said in a statement today. That&#8217;s the fastest increase China&#8217;s
largest foreign carmaker has reported since January. 
Sales of mini commercial vehicles and sedans at SAIC-GM-
Wuling Automobile Co. jumped 40 percent after GM,  poised to
overtake Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) in global annual sales, cut prices
of Wuling light trucks. The gains were a contrast to Ford Motor
Co. (F) and Honda Motor Co., which posted drops in deliveries last
month as overall demand in the country slows. 
&#8220;GM gained a lot of market share from their minivan
competitors this year through discounts and a strong
reputation,&#8221; said Marvin Zhu, a Shanghai-based analyst at
researcher LMC Automotive. Wuling&#8217;s quality and service is
perceived to be better than other local brands, Zhu said. 
For the first 11 months of 2011, GM&#8217;s deliveries increased
8.2 percent to 2.35 million in the world&#8217;s largest automobile
market. Still, that&#8217;s slowing from 2010, when sales climbed 29
percent, after the government phased out sales-tax breaks and
rebates for rural buyers in January. 
The carmaker aims to expand its luxury car and sport-
utility vehicle lineup to double deliveries in the country to 5
million by 2015. 
Chinese Slowdown 
Not all carmakers saw demand rise, adding to indications
that the world&#8217;s second-largest economy is cooling. China&#8217;s
central bank last week cut lenders&#8217; reserve requirements for the
first time since 2008 to pump money into the financial system. 
Ford&#8217;s China sales fell 7 percent in November to 43,338
units, led by a 19 percent decline in deliveries at its
commercial-vehicle joint venture, according to an e-mailed
statement today. 
Honda, Japan&#8217;s third-largest automaker, said it sold 58,228
vehicles in China last month, 3.3 percent fewer than a year
earlier. The Tokyo-based company said deliveries decreased by
8.4 percent to 539,442 units in the first 11 months. 
Auto sales in China surged 32 percent to 18.06 million
vehicles in 2010, according to the China Association of
Automobile Manufacturers. Growth slowed to 3.2 percent during
the first 10 months of this year, according to the association,
which will report November industry figures later this month. 
Chinese auto demand may expand 5 percent to 10 percent in
2012, led by demand for passenger cars, Kevin Wale, president of
GM&#8217;s China unit, said in an interview on Nov. 17. Sales of
commercial vehicles will probably grow 5 percent, he said. 
Slowing Growth 
GM is banking on China to offset a shrinking market in
Europe, where researcher IHS Automotive estimates car demand
will fall 1 percent in 2012, the fifth straight annual decline. 
Sales by SAIC-GM-Wuling, GM&#8217;s minivan venture with SAIC
Motor Corp. (600104), rose to 119,133 vehicles, a record for November,
according to the statement. The partnership makes China&#8217;s best-
selling vehicle in 2010, the Wuling Sunshine minivan. 
Shanghai GM, the U.S. carmaker&#8217;s sedan venture with SAIC
that produces Buick and Chevrolet-branded cars, boosted sales
7.6 percent to 113,120 vehicles. Sales of Buick Excelle
passenger cars climbed 25 percent to 23,885 units. 
Sales growth at Shanghai GM may slow to 12 percent next
year as the automaker faces capacity constraints and few model
rollouts, LMC&#8217;s Zhu said. The passenger carmaker is expected to
deliver 19 percent more cars this year, he forecast. 
GM&#8217;s Buick, Chevrolet and Wuling are among the most
successful international brands in China, and their dealerships
are well-positioned in less-developed cities with high growth
prospects, Alexander Potter, senior research analyst with Piper
Jaffray Cos., said in a report on Dec. 5. 
&#8220;When the European debt crisis passes, GM will be well-
situated to ride China&#8217;s growth for at least the next five
years,&#8221; Potter wrote.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, won a U.S. panel&#8217;s backing for an experimental
medicine for advanced kidney cancer in patients who have failed
prior treatments. 
The benefits of the drug, known as axitinib, outweigh its
risks, 13 outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration
said today in a unanimous vote in Silver Spring, Maryland. The
FDA isn&#8217;t required to follow advisory panels&#8217; recommendations. 
The medicine from New York-based Pfizer may compete with
Aveo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AVEO)&#8217;s tivozanib, a kidney-cancer drug in
late-stage clinical trials. Both treatments block receptors in
the body thought to play a role in spreading tumors. Kidney
cancer affects 296,000 people in the U.S., according to the
American Cancer Society. 
&#8220;It met the regulatory bar&#8221; for approval &#8220;and offers an
important or useful alternative&#8221; to approved treatments, said
Wyndham Wilson, the panel chairman, who is chief of lymphoma
therapeutics at the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Center for
Cancer Research, in Rockville, Maryland. 
Pfizer gained 1.2 percent to $20.47 at the close in New
York. The shares have increased 17 percent this year. 
Sales of axitinib, if approved, may reach $576 million in
2014, according to the average estimate of three analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Pfizer is seeking to sell the treatment
under the name Inlyta. 
Additional Options 
&#8220;We are pleased with the panel&#8217;s recommendation in support
of axitinib for the treatment of previously treated advanced
renal cell carcinoma, as additional therapeutic options are
still needed for this patient population,&#8221; Mace Rothenberg,
senior vice president of clinical development and medical
affairs at Pfizer, said in an e-mail after the vote. 
FDA staff reviewers questioned the significance of efficacy
data in a trial that compared axitinib with kidney-cancer drug
Nexavar from German drugmaker Bayer AG. In the study of 723
patients who had failed one prior therapy, those treated with
axitinib lived a median of 6.7 months before their tumors got
worse, two months longer than those who received Nexavar, agency
staff said in a Dec. 5 report. 
That two-month benefit was &#8220;driven by a subset of patients
that is likely to be scarce in the United States,&#8221; the
reviewers said. 
Previous Treatments 
Axitinib was most effective in people previously treated
with cytokines, immune-boosting drugs that aren&#8217;t as widely used
as newer therapies such Pfizer&#8217;s Sutent. Patients in the
cytokine group who received axitinib lived a median of 5.6
months longer without tumor progression than those in that group
who were treated with Nexavar, agency reviewers said. 
Axitinib&#8217;s benefits were &#8220;meager&#8221; in the larger group of
patients treated previously with Sutent, delaying tumor growth
just 1.4 months longer than Nexavar did, according to the
report. 
The FDA&#8217;s concerns about axitinib may have &#8220;positive
implications&#8221; for the competing drug being developed by
Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Aveo, said Thomas Wei, an analyst
at Jefferies  Co. in New York. 
&#8220;We remain bullish on the prospects for tivozanib to
become the standard of care in the first-line treatment of renal
cell carcinoma,&#8221; Wei said Dec. 5 in a note to clients.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
derivatives dealer among U.S. banks, has bought and sold
notional credit derivatives on about $100 billion of sovereign
and non-sovereign debt in the five troubled European nations,
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said today. 
The bank had about $13.9 billion of mark-to-market
derivative exposure as of Nov. 17, offset by $6.3 billion of
collateral, Dimon said at an investor conference in New York.
JPMorgan would likely have a direct loss of about $3 billion if
a &#8220;disaster&#8221; occurred in the region&#8217;s debt crisis, he said. 
&#8220;I get asked the question with derivatives of $14 billion,
people say &#8216;my God, that&#8217;s your net because you have huge long
and short,&#8217; and we do. It&#8217;s maybe $100 billion by $100 billion,
I forgot the exact number,&#8221; Dimon said. 
The disclosure is the first by a major U.S. bank regarding
the notional derivatives it bought and sold on the region as
investors seek to judge banks&#8217; risks linked to the European debt
crisis. Banks provide their global notional credit derivatives
bought and sold, and have begun providing net exposure figures
to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain, sometimes called
the GIIPS. 
Dimon said the bank doesn&#8217;t net its derivative exposure
across counterparties, so it would not sell protection on
Italian debt to one bank and buy credit-default swaps on Italian
debt from another and consider those exposures offsetting. 
&#8220;The default of a counterparty is not going to sink our
hedges,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have a lot of wrong-way risk.&#8221; 
Counterparties 
Credit derivatives counterparties are primarily outside the
GIIPS and are either investment-grade or are supported by
collateral arrangements, according to a presentation from the
bank. Dimon also said all the firm&#8217;s hedging was done with
counterparties outside the five countries. 
As of Sept. 30, JPMorgan said worldwide it had sold $3.13
trillion of credit-derivative protection and purchased $3.07
trillion, up from $2.75 trillion sold and $2.72 trillion bought
at the end of 2010, filings show. The firm was the largest
dealer of credit derivatives among U.S. banks in the second
quarter, according to data from the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency.

JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest
U.S. lender by assets, will have &#8220;essentially flat&#8221; investment
bank revenue this quarter excluding accounting adjustments,
according to Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. 
The comparison is to this year&#8217;s third quarter, said
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the New York-based firm.
That period was the worst for trading and investment-banking
revenue at the biggest Wall Street firms since the depths of the
financial crisis in 2008, excluding accounting gains. 
Dimon&#8217;s remarks in a presentation today show U.S.
investment banks still face pressure as corporations delay
raising capital and investors sell riskier assets amid concern
that the U.S. economy is weakening and Europe&#8217;s debt crisis may
spread. JPMorgan&#8217;s private-equity unit also expects to post a
&#8220;modest loss&#8221; in this year&#8217;s fourth quarter, Dimon wrote in
the presentation. 
The company&#8217;s investment bank generated about $4.5 billion
in revenue during the third quarter after backing out a $1.9
billion gain in debt-valuation adjustments. Dimon excluded that
accounting effect in forecasting the unit&#8217;s revenue in the
presentation at a New York investor conference sponsored by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) 
Debt Ceiling 
Revenue at the investment-banking unit has slid this year
from $8.2 billion in the first quarter as concerns mounted in
the third quarter that Greece would default and U.S. lawmakers
would fail to raise the debt ceiling. JPMorgan told investors in
October that the division will face similar market conditions
for the rest of the year. 
The unit&#8217;s long-term prospects show promise, Dimon said in
the presentation. Global credit needs may expand by about $160
trillion over the next 10 years and worldwide investment demand
may increase from 20 percent of gross domestic product in 2010
to 25 percent by 2030, according to the presentation. 
JPMorgan climbed 1.7 percent to $33.80 at 1:22 p.m. in New
York, making it the day&#8217;s biggest gainer (INDU) in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. 
The bank has a &#8220;battleship&#8221; balance sheet (JPM), and by next
year can meet proposed international capital standards that take
full effect in 2019, if the board wants to meet them early,
Dimon said in the presentation. Dimon has previously referred to
JPMorgan as having a &#8220;fortress&#8221; balance sheet to tout the
bank&#8217;s overall financial health. The company is the largest and
most profitable U.S. bank and was among the only major U.S.
lenders to remain profitable throughout the recession. 
&#8216;We&#8217;re Sorry&#8217; 
JPMorgan may buy back an additional $950 million in stock
approved as part of a $15 billion capital-distribution program
by the Federal Reserve, according to the presentation. The
allowance &#8220;represents a reallocation of previously approved
capacity&#8221; from the Fed&#8217;s 2011 capital tests, he wrote. 
The bank completed its $8 billion stock-repurchase plan
approved by the Fed in March after buying back $4.4 billion of
common equity in the third quarter, for which Dimon apologized. 
&#8220;We spent a whole $8 billion buying back stock,&#8221; he said
in an Oct. 13 conference call with analysts. &#8220;And yes, it would
have been wiser to wait. We&#8217;re sorry.&#8221;

International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
will reach a settlement with European Union antitrust regulators
next week to end a probe into mainframe software, according to
two people familiar with the matter. 
The European Commission intends to accept an offer made by
IBM in September to resolve a dispute over anti-competitive
behaviour that may have blocked rival mainframe software makers,
said the people who couldn&#8217;t be identified because the talks are
private. 
Regulators have sought comments from rivals and customers
on IBM&#8217;s commitments to ensure the availability of certain spare
parts and technical information. The Brussels-based regulator
closed a separate probe over IBM&#8217;s mainframe computers after
three competitors dropped complaints. 
The commission in 2010 opened investigations into Armonk,
New York-based IBM over possible anti-competitive behavior that
may have blocked competitors in mainframe software and
maintenance contracts by &#8220;restricting or delaying access to
spare parts.&#8221; 
Joe Hanley, a spokesman for IBM in London, declined to
comment. Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the commission, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a call and e-mail seeking comment. 
Reuters reported the settlement earlier today.

senior U.S. investment strategist, said in a research note to

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are among 22 financial firms
that received top marks today as the best workplaces for
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees. 
The three banks were among 207 U.S. companies that offer
health insurance covering medical services for transgender
employees seeking sexual reassignment, according to the 10th
annual Corporate Equality Index from the Human Rights Campaign
Foundation, a nonprofit that backs civil rights for lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. 
Financial firms outperformed most other industries in
adopting and enforcing non-discrimination policies, offering
health insurance for same-sex partners and recruiting and
retaining lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender employees,
according to the report. 
&#8220;This rating reflects equal health-care coverage for all
LGBT employees and their families, including full parity for
domestic partner benefits not only in basic medical coverage,
but in dependent care, retirement and other benefits that affect
families&#8217; financial and medical well-being,&#8221; Joe Solmonese,
president of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, said in the
report. 
AmEx, Google 
The Human Rights Campaign gave 88 Fortune 500 companies
scores of 100 percent and the designation as the &#8220;Best Places
to Work for LGBT Equality.&#8221; Among the 190 companies that
received perfect scores are financial firms including American
Express Co., (AXP) Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley. (MS) Google Inc.,
Ford Motor Corp. and Gap Inc. (GPS) also received top marks. 
JPMorgan is one of nine companies to achieve the highest
rating for 10 straight years, along with Aetna Inc. (AET), Alcatel-
Lucent, American Airlines parent AMR Corp. (AMR), Apple Inc. (AAPL), Eastman
Kodak Co. (EK), Nike Inc. (NKE), Replacements Ltd. and Xerox Corp. (XRX),
according to Paul Guequierre, a foundation spokesman. 
The 2012 index ranked 850 firms. More than half of
companies in the Fortune 500 submitted surveys voluntarily and
the rest were rated based on publicly available data, according
to the foundation. 
NYSE Euronext, owner of the New York Stock Exchange, and
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ), which runs the Nasdaq Stock Market, were
among firms with the lowest scores at 15 percent. 
&#8220;We believe the low score reflects the fact that we were
not aware of the survey&#8221; and that NYSE didn&#8217;t give data to the
foundation, Richard Adamonis, a spokesman for NYSE Euronext (NYX),
said in an e-mail. &#8220;We have a diverse workforce and support

others.&#8221;

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer services provider, agreed to buy
DemandTec Inc. (DMAN) for $440 million, adding Internet-based tools to
help businesses adjust promotions based on buying patterns. 
The all-cash transaction amounts to $13.20 a share, and is
expected to close in the first quarter of 2012, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. That&#8217;s 57 percent
higher than DemandTec&#8217;s closing price yesterday. IBM said last
year it plans to spend about $20 billion on acquisitions through
2015, as it expands offerings to business customers. 
The purchase is IBM&#8217;s biggest since the takeover of
analytics-technology provider Netezza Corp. last year for about
$1.7 billion. DemandTec will extend IBM&#8217;s Smarter Commerce
initiative, allowing companies to quickly adjust prices,
promotions and other marketing efforts by analyzing online and
in-store buying trends. 
&#8220;DemandTec assets could be a good fit,&#8221; Mark Moskowitz,
an analyst at JPMorgan  Chase Co. with an &#8220;overweight&#8221; rating
on IBM shares, said in a note to clients today. &#8220;DemandTec is
another example of IBM finding quality assets.&#8221; 
IBM fell 1.3 percent to $191.58 at the close in New York.
DemandTec jumped 56 percent to $13.15. 
IBM is paying a premium of 72 percent compared with the 20-
day trading average price before the announcement. The average
premium of 52 acquisitions of decision-support software
companies in the U.S. was 45 percent in the past five years. 
DemandTec, based in San Mateo, California, employs more
than 350 people and has about 450 customers worldwide, including
Best Buy Co., ConAgra Foods Inc. and Target Corp. 
The overall market for Smarter Commerce software is worth
$20 billion, IBM estimates. The company spent $2.5 billion on
three Internet commerce acquisitions last year, buying Sterling
Commerce, Coremetrics Inc. and Unica Corp.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, persuaded a Pennsylvania appeals court to review an
$8.6 million punitive-damages award to a woman who blamed her
cancer on the company&#8217;s menopause drugs. 
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit that a judge erred in allowing a
Philadelphia jury to award punishment damages to Mary Daniel, a
former bank manager from Arkansas who sued the drugmaker
alleging its Prempro pills caused her breast cancer. Jurors also
awarded Daniel more than $1.6 million in compensatory damages on
her claim. 
More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. 
&#8220;The company is pleased the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
will hear the company&#8217;s appeal regarding whether punitive
damages are warranted,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement today. &#8220;The company has said all along
that Wyeth acted responsibly&#8221; in its handling of the drug, he
added. 
Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. 
Prempro Scorecard 
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have lost 10
out of the 18 Prempro cases that juries have considered since
trials began in 2006. The most recent verdict came earlier this
week when a Philadelphia jury awarded three women more than
$72 million in damages on their claims over the drugmaker&#8217;s
hormone-replacement medications. 
The drugmaker has gotten some of those verdicts thrown out
after trial or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the
verdicts through settlements, while other decisions are on
appeal. It also has persuaded some judges to throw cases out
before trial. 
In Daniel&#8217;s case, jurors found Wyeth&#8217;s Prempro and Premarin
drugs were a cause of the woman&#8217;s cancer and awarded her a total
of $10.2 million in damages. A judge in the case later threw out
of the award. 
Award Reinstated 
Earlier this year, a lower Pennsylvania appeals court
reinstated Daniel&#8217;s jury award after finding the judge in the
case didn&#8217;t err in refusing to give a drugmaker a new trial. 
The state&#8217;s highest appellate court agreed Dec. 5 to review
whether Daniel was entitled to receive punitive damages for a
product that had been approved by federal regulators. 
&#8220;We are pleased the court declined to consider any issue
relating to Wyeth&#8217;s negligence in causing her breast cancer or
Mrs. Daniel&#8217;s compensatory award,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of the
woman&#8217;s lawyers, said in an e-mailed statement today. 
The case is Daniel v. Wyeth, 040602368, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia).

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-largest U.S. mall owner, said that its funds from
operations excluding some items may rise to as much as $1.03 a
share next year as occupancies rise. 
The forecast, which has a low end of 99 cents, compares
with expected 2011 &#8220;core&#8221; FFO of 93 cents to 95 cents, the
real estate investment trust said in an investor presentation
filed today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection 13 months
ago, is refinancing debt to cut expenses and plans to expand,
redevelop and refurbish properties to boost growth. In October,
the Chicago-based company sold Faneuil Hall Marketplace in
Boston, the office and garage components of Westlake Center in
Seattle and a shopping center in Provo, Utah, as it focuses on
regional malls. 
Occupancy probably will rise to 92 percent in 2012 from
90.5 percent this year, according to General Growth, which is
holding an investor conference today in Chicago. The company&#8217;s
properties include Water Tower Place on Michigan Avenue in
Chicago and Fashion Show in Las Vegas. 
The REIT was expected to have 2012 FFO of 98 cents a share,
the average estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. FFO
is a measure of a property owner&#8217;s ability to generate cash. 
General Growth is planning to spin off 30 malls to
shareholders through a special dividend. They will be
transferred to a new publicly traded REIT, Rouse Properties Inc.
General Growth spent $11.3 billion to buy developer Rouse Co. in
2004. Excluding properties to be included in Rouse, core FFO is
likely to be 90 cents to 94 cents next year, General Growth
said. 
General Growth rose 0.6 percent to $14.29 in New York
trading yesterday. 
Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG), based in Indianapolis, is the
only U.S. mall owner larger than General Growth.

U.S. researchers gained access to a
database of 2.4 million chemical formulas and diagrams that
International Business Machine Corp. (IBM) culled from 24 years&#8217; worth
of patent applications and medical journals. 
The catalogue of compounds will be housed at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Scientists can use
the data to identify new candidates for drug development or new
uses for existing drugs. 
&#8220;The applications are very wide reaching, from life
sciences to chemicals, petroleum, to food, to health,&#8221; said
Chris Moore, a partner and vice president in Armonk, New York-
based IBM&#8217;s global life sciences division, in a telephone
interview. 
The NIH has made development of drugs for rare diseases
such as sickle cell anemia a priority since Francis Collins
became director of the $31 billion research agency in 2009.
Collins has asked Congress to create a new institute for drug
development and pressed manufacturers to open catalogs of
abandoned compounds. 
IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider,
created the database by &#8220;Watson-type technology,&#8221; Moore said,
referring to the supercomputer that beat human competitors on
the game show &#8216;Jeopardy.&#8217; The data was extracted from about 4.7
million U.S., European and United Nations patents and 11 million
biomedical journal abstracts from 1976 to 2000. 
Researchers can search the database for free. IBM plans to
sell a product that will produce more sophisticated analysis of
the database that can tell customers who is conducting research
on specific therapies, Moore said. He wouldn&#8217;t disclose the
price.

Microsoft Corp. is seeking to hire a
television executive to develop original shows as part of a
drive to expand its Xbox Live game and video service, according
to people with knowledge of the company&#8217;s plans. 
Microsoft has hired Tom Schneider, a partner at Stratis
LLC, to conduct the search, said the people, who weren&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. Two former NBC executives, Marc Graboff and Jeff Gaspin, have been approached, they said. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is trying to turn
the Xbox console into an entertainment hub, rather than mostly a
game machine. The company, the world&#8217;s largest software
producer, is introducing a TV service with programs from almost
40 TV and entertainment suppliers to draw more users to the Web-
enabled product. 
Original programming would help Microsoft differentiate the
service from those offered by competitors including Apple Inc.
and Google Inc. (GOOG) Some of the Xbox&#8217;s top-selling games were
created by Microsoft and the company is looking to replicate
that success with program it develops. 
The TV service will include content from partners like Time
Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s HBO, Sony Corp.&#8217;s Crackle and the BBC. 
Microsoft is only interested in making a hire if it can
find the right person and it&#8217;s possible no one will be chosen
for the job, one of the people said. 
Gaspin was chairman of NBC Universal TV Entertainment. He
stepped down after Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) took control of NBC in January.
Graboff, president of west coast business operations for NBC
Entertainment, announced plans to leave last month. 
David Dennis, a Microsoft spokesman, declined to comment.
Schneider didn&#8217;t respond to phone and e-mail requests for
comment. 
Microsoft rose 1.2 percent to $25.70 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The stock has declined 7.9 percent this year.

Chevron Corp., the second-largest (CVX)
U.S. oil company, may need to drill a relief well at its $3.6
billion Frade project in deep water off Brazil&#8217;s coast as part
of measures to counter a spill. 
The cementing at the Frade well that leaked last month
currently &#8220;doesn&#8217;t guarantee 100 percent efficiency,&#8221; Magda Chambriard, a director at the regulator known as ANP, told
reporters today in Rio de Janeiro. Drilling a relief well is
&#8220;one possibility&#8221; if Chevron doesn&#8217;t convince ANP that the
cementing is solidly stuck to the ground, Chambriard said. 
A decision on the cementing may be reached as early as next
week, Chambriard said. 
Chevron may have to pay as much as 350 million reais
($193.5 million) in fines and damages for the Nov. 7 leak of at
least 2,400 barrels of crude at the Frade project off the coast
of Rio de Janeiro. 
Brazil has tightened safety conditions at oil projects
following the spill at BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in the Gulf of
Mexico last year, Chambriard said. The agency has shut 11
drilling rigs and production platforms over the past year
because of safety concerns, she said. 
&#8220;Our analysis so far indicates that the cement plugs have
been properly placed,&#8221; Scott Walker, a spokesman for San Ramon,
California-based Chevron, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today. &#8220;Chevron will continue to discuss this and
other issues with regulators and hopes to get their approval
soon to proceed with the proposed well abandonment plan,&#8221;
Walker said in the e-mail. 
A relief well off of Brazil&#8217;s coast will cost at least $50
million, according to Hernani Chavez a former exploration and
production manager at Petroleo Brasileiro SA. 
&#8220;Cementing the well should be totally sufficient,&#8221; Chavez
said in a telephone interview from Rio de Janeiro today. &#8220;At
Macondo, a relief well was necessary because they were unable to
halt the flow, the situation was completely different.&#8221;

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) plans to
issue four certificates of deposit linked to stocks as record
low interest rates drive investor demand for the potentially
higher-yielding CDs. 
The structured CDs are the bank&#8217;s first and are set to
price at the end of the month, said a person with knowledge of
the offerings who declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t
set. One four-year CD is linked to changes in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average, with annual returns at a minimum of about
0.5 percent and a possible maximum of 24 percent, according to a
preliminary sales document. That compares with the average yield
of 1.15 percent for a three-year, fixed-rate deposit,
Bankrate.com data show. 
Demand for CDs tied to assets such as equities, commodities
and exchange-traded funds has soared as the Federal Reserve has
held its benchmark rate at zero to 0.25 percent since 2008. Bank
revenue from the investments has more than tripled to $99 per
million dollars in retail deposits in October from $30 in
January, according to Kehrer-LIMRA Research compiled from
approximately 30 lenders, including Wells Fargo  Co. and
SunTrust Banks Inc. 
The market-linked or structured CD market has had &#8220;healthy
growth,&#8221; said Glenn Lotenberg, a managing director at Incapital
LLC in Boca Raton, Florida, which expects to sell $2.5 billion
of structured CDs this year, from $2 billion in 2010. 
Data on the market is incomplete as the investments aren&#8217;t
registered by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. doesn&#8217;t track market-linked
deposits separately. 
Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. 
Banks Benefit 
Banks benefit from issuing structured CDs, which the FDIC
insures up to $250,000, by raising deposits at lower funding
levels and collecting commissions, said Tim Bonacci of CD
Funding Securities LLC, who&#8217;s helped about 30 financial
institutions set up their own proprietary CD business since
2005. The average fee on a five-year deposit is about 3 percent,
Bonacci said in an interview last month. 
Goldman Sachs, which was the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history before it converted to a bank in
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc., had $41.8 billion in deposits in the third
quarter. That&#8217;s up from $38.6 billion at the end of 2010. 
The four-year CD tracks the monthly percentage change in
the Dow, with gains capped at 1.5 percent to 2 percent and no
floor on the declines. That means if the Dow advanced 5 percent,
the monthly return would be recorded as no more than 2 percent,
while a drop of the same amount would be taken in full. 
Banks create market-linked CDs by combining zero-coupon
bonds with derivatives to offer customized bets to investors.
Derivatives are contracts whose value is derived from stocks,
bonds, currencies and commodities.

Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. plans to
provide funding for a hedge fund being started by Todd Edgar, a
former commodities trader at Barclays Plc, said two people with
knowledge of the preparations. 
Goldman Sachs will make an investment through a so-called
seeding fund that the New York-based firm started this year
after raising money for it from pension funds and wealthy
individuals, the person said. Edgar will get $150 million to
$200 million from Goldman Sachs in return for a cut of the fees
his hedge fund generates, said the people who declined to be
identified because the negotiations are private. 
The U.S. Congress last year restricted banks&#8217; investments
in hedge funds through the so-called Volcker rule after
lawmakers concluded that financial institutions shouldn&#8217;t be
using federally backed deposits for wagers on markets. The
Goldman Sachs seeding fund is permitted under the law because it
uses client money rather than the firm&#8217;s capital. 
Edgar and his team of commodities traders left Barclays (BARC) in
the third quarter of this year. His fund will trade futures and
options on metals based on the firm&#8217;s views of global economic
trends, the people said. The fund will be based in New York and
plans to start trading next year, the people said. 
Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
and Edgar declined to comment. He joined Barclays, Britain&#8217;s
second-largest bank by assets, from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in
2009. 
Blackstone Group 
Some hedge funds are turning to firms such as Goldman Sachs
and Blackstone Group LP (BX) that provide startup financing because
pension funds and other investors have shied away from smaller
money managers since the credit crisis in 2008. Two-thirds of
the asset growth for hedge funds since 2009 has been at firms
managing more than $5 billion, according to Chicago-based Hedge
Fund Research Inc. 
Blackstone, the world&#8217;s largest private-equity firm,
invests in hedge funds for a slice of a manager&#8217;s fees and an
equity stake in the company. Hedge funds, private pools that try
to make money whether markets are rising or falling, typically
charge clients 2 percent of assets managed and 20 percent of any
investment gains. 
Edgar&#8217;s fund will be the second to receive an investment
from Goldman Sachs this year. In September, Goldman Sachs
invested $100 million in New York-based Palestra Capital
Management LLC, a fund focused on stocks run by Jeremy Schiffman
and Andrew Immerman, one of the people said. 
Goldman Sachs has received about $600 million from clients
to invest in startup hedge funds with plans to raise more money,
the person said. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s hedge-fund investment effort is
being led by two executives, Kent Clark in New York and Ali Raissi in London. 
The firm shut an earlier seeding fund in 2008, a year when
hedge funds lost 20 percent on average after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

Jon Corzine and four other former
executives of bankrupt MF Global Holdings Ltd. were sued by a
group of commodity traders seeking damages for lost funds. 
Henning-Carey Proprietary Trading LLC, a clearing firm and
member of CME Group Inc. (CME), joined with eight traders in seeking
recovery of an unaccounted-for $1.2 billion in customer funds at
the brokerage unit MF Global Inc. 
&#8220;Defendants were responsible for insuring that the
plaintiffs&#8217; property was properly segregated and accounted
for,&#8221; the traders said in the complaint filed yesterday in
federal court in Chicago. 
The suit is one of several filed by brokerage customers and
former employees against Corzine, MF Global executives or the
company since it filed for bankruptcy protection on Oct. 31. 
Corzine told the House Agriculture Committee at a hearing
in Washington yesterday that he &#8220;would never have intended&#8221;
transfers from segregated accounts and had teams in place at the
firm to ensure they didn&#8217;t occur. 
He wouldn&#8217;t say if he and other executives were willing to
share customers&#8217; losses. 
Corzine and his executives were responsible for looking
after customers&#8217; segregated accounts, yet the money went missing
as the company tried to salvage its business after &#8220;engaging in
highly leveraged and speculative trading in foreign sovereign
bonds,&#8221; the traders claimed in the complaint. 
Andrew Levander, an attorney for Corzine, didn&#8217;t respond to
an e-mail yesterday seeking comment on the traders&#8217; allegations. 
The plaintiffs&#8217; accounts were frozen along with about
38,000 others on Oct. 31, after &#8220;apparent segregation
violations,&#8221; making it impossible for customers to access their
accounts or the assets in them, the plaintiffs said. 
The case is Henning-Carey Proprietary Trading LLC v.
Corzine, 11-cv-08717, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
Illinois (Chicago).

Julius Baer, Falcon Sued by Trustee for Madoff-Related Funds 
Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), the 121-year-old Swiss wealth
manager, and Falcon Private Bank Ltd. were sued by the trustee
liquidating Bernard Madoff&#8217;s former investment firm who is
seeking to recover $76 million in redemptions. 
Irving Picard filed two lawsuits yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan for a return of funds that were
transferred to the two Swiss banks by investors in Fairfield
Sentry Ltd., a feeder fund for Madoff&#8217;s firm. The trustee seeks
about $37 million from Julius Baer and about $39 million from
Falcon, a Zurich-based private bank owned by the government of
Abu Dhabi. 
&#8220;We cannot comment on pending legal cases,&#8221; said Jan
Vonder Muehll, a Zurich-based spokesman for Julius Baer, which
manages 166 billion Swiss francs ($179 billion) for private
clients. 
In 2010, the liquidators of the Fairfield funds started
separate litigation against Julius Baer, the bank said in its
2010 annual report. 
Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $19 billion in principal, Picard has said.
Fairfield is in liquidation in the British Virgin Islands.
Picard has filed similar lawsuits to recover investments taken
out of Madoff&#8217;s firm before the fraud was exposed. 
Irene Franco, a spokeswoman for Falcon, said the firm
hasn&#8217;t been informed about the claim. 
The cases are Picard v. Bank Julius Baer  Co., 11-2922,
and Picard v. Falcon Private Bank, 11-2923, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Stichting Pensioenfonds Sues JPMorgan Chase Over Securities 
Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, the Netherlands&#8217; biggest
retirement fund, sued JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), alleging violations
of securities laws and fraud involving sales of residential
mortgage-backed securities. 
The suit, filed in New York state court in Manhattan Dec.
7, accused the New York-based bank of negligent
misrepresentation, alleging the sales were based on false and
misleading statements. Damages should be determined at trial,
according to the filing. 
&#8220;ABP purchased securities that were far riskier than had
been represented, backed by mortgage loans worth significantly
less than had been represented and that had been made by
borrowers who were much less creditworthy than had been
represented,&#8221; ABP said. 
Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment about the lawsuit. 
The Heerlen, Netherlands-based pension fund sued Deutsche
Bank AG over similar allegations in New York State Supreme Court
in September. ABP serves as the pension fund for Dutch public
educational and government workers and has more than 250 billion
euros ($332.8 billion) in assets under management, according to
the complaint. 
The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. JPMorgan Chase 
Co., 653383/2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan)

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
HSBC Allowed by Judge to Join JPMorgan in Madoff Appeals 
HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) can join JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG
in appeals of decisions dismissing most of the lawsuits brought
by the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities Inc., a judge ruled. 
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in July dismissed most of
the Madoff trustee&#8217;s $9 billion suit against London-based HSBC.
In November, U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon threw out most
of the trustee&#8217;s $19 billion suit against New York-based
JPMorgan and dismissed most of the suit against UBS. 
The two judges ruled on the same grounds, accepting the
banks&#8217; arguments that the claims underlying the trustee&#8217;s suits
could only be brought by individual Madoff creditors. 
Irving Picard, the Madoff trustee, couldn&#8217;t appeal
immediately because neither judge dismissed all of the suits. To
lift the bar to appeal, McMahon previously entered a final
judgment in the JPMorgan case, allowing Picard to seek a review
by a U.S. Court of Appeals. 
Yesterday, at the request of HSBC, Rakoff did the same by
entering a final dismissal judgment so Picard can appeal. HSBC
said it wanted to have its case heard at the same time as
JPMorgan&#8217;s. 
The HSBC case lacked &#8220;factors that might lead the court to
deny such relief&#8221; in Picard&#8217;s suit against New York Mets owners
Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, Rakoff said. In September, Rakoff
knocked out about $700 million of the $1 billion in claims in
the Wilpon case and scheduled a jury trial for March. 
Rakoff said he is still considering whether to allow Picard
to appeal his decision that the trustee can only sue to recover
fictitious profits that customers took out within two years of
the Madoff firm&#8217;s bankruptcy. Picard sought to go back six years
in disgorging bogus profits from the Ponzi scheme. 
Picard argued in court papers that Rakoff should allow an
immediate appeal because another district judge disagreed with
Rakoff&#8217;s conclusion that suits can only look back two years.
Until the question on timing is resolved, hundreds of suits by
the trustee against customers are in limbo. 
The HSBC suit in U.S. District Court is Picard v. HSBC Bank
Plc, 11-763, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The UBS suit in district court is Picard v. UBS AG (UBSN),
11-04213, in the same court. The JPMorgan lawsuit in district
court is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 11-00913, in the same
court. The JPMorgan lawsuit in bankruptcy court was Picard v.
JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-04932, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The Wilpon suit in district
court is Picard v. Katz, 11-03605, U.S. District Court, Southern
District New York (Manhattan). 
The Madoff liquidation case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc., 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The criminal case is U.S. v. Madoff, 09-

Samsung Loses Bid to Block Apple IPhone 4S Sales in France 
Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) failed to win a court order
blocking Apple Inc. (AAPL) from selling its newest smartphone, the
iPhone 4S, in France. 
The Paris court rejected Samsung&#8217;s request for an emergency
order against Apple while it considers the South Korean
company&#8217;s patent-infringement claims. 
Samsung, the biggest maker of smartphones, sought to block
sales of the new handset in France, Italy and the U.K. days
after it was unveiled in October, arguing Apple violated its
wireless-communications patents. Suwon, South Korea-based
Samsung sued in Paris in July over earlier versions of the
iPhone and Apple&#8217;s iPad tablet. 
&#8220;The disproportionate character of the ban sought by
Samsung against Apple is clear,&#8221; Judge Marie-Christine
Courboulay said in the decision yesterday. 
The Paris court ruled Samsung must pay Apple 100,000 euros
($134,100) for legal fees while denying Apple&#8217;s request for
damages. Samsung&#8217;s claim wasn&#8217;t &#8220;abusive&#8221; and the company&#8217;s
infringement claims can move forward as a regular lawsuit,
Courboulay said. 
Florence Catel, a Samsung spokeswoman in Paris, declined to
comment on the decision. Calls to Apple&#8217;s office in London for
comment weren&#8217;t immediately returned. 
Samsung has been locked in a global legal battle with Apple
since the Cupertino, California-based company claimed in an
April suit that Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy devices copied the iPad and
iPhone. Samsung was the world&#8217;s biggest maker of smartphones in
the last quarter, while Apple dominates the tablet market.

Education Management Should Face Recruitment Suit, U.S. Says 
Education Management Corp. (EDMC), the second-largest U.S. for-
profit college chain, should be forced to defend a lawsuit
alleging its recruiting policies helped the company wrongfully
secure more than $11 billion in student aid, government lawyers
said in a court filing. 
U.S. officials have properly outlined claims that
Pittsburgh-based Education Management created an illegal
compensation system for admission recruiters to ensure a steady
flow of students who receive government aid to pay college
expenses, Justice Department attorneys said in the filing made
public yesterday. 
&#8220;EDMC&#8217;s unlawful compensation scheme emanates from the
highest levels of the corporation and represents a conscious
effort to do exactly what&#8221; federal regulations prohibit in
terms of providing bonuses to recruiters, the government said in
the filing in federal court in Pittsburgh opposing the firm&#8217;s
request to have the case thrown out. 
For-profit colleges have been under scrutiny by Congress,
state lawmakers and attorneys general who are investigating
sales practices and students&#8217; debt loads. Eleven states and the
District of Columbia joined the U.S. as plaintiffs in the case. 
The government, which intervened in suits filed by two EDMC
whistleblowers, contends the company systematically violated
federal law by paying recruiters based on their success in
persuading prospective students to enroll in the for-profit
school. 
EDMC argued in court filings that prosecutors haven&#8217;t
properly stated claims supporting allegations that the
institution started a companywide campaign to defraud the
government and violate Department of Education regulations. 
&#8220;We are reviewing the governments&#8217; responses to EDMC&#8217;s
motion to have the court dismiss this lawsuit, and we will have
an opportunity to file a reply with the court,&#8221; Bonnie
Campbell, a legal adviser to the company, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;Based on what we have seen, we continue to believe
the case should be dismissed.&#8221; 
The case is U.S. v. Education Management Corp., 07-00461,
U.S. District Court, Western District of Pennsylvania
(Pittsburgh).

Trials 
Pfizer Wins Review of Punitive-Damages Award in Prempro Case 
Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, persuaded a
Pennsylvania appeals court to review an $8.6 million punitive-
damages award to a woman who blamed her cancer on the company&#8217;s
menopause drugs. 
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments by
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth unit that a judge erred in letting a Philadelphia
jury award punishment damages to Mary Daniel, a former bank
manager from Arkansas who sued the drugmaker alleging its
Prempro pills caused her breast cancer. Jurors also awarded
Daniel more than $1.6 million in compensatory damages on her
claim. 
More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. 
&#8220;The company is pleased the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
will hear the company&#8217;s appeal regarding whether punitive
damages are warranted,&#8221; Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &#8220;The company has said all
along that Wyeth acted responsibly&#8221; in its handling of the
drug, he added. 
Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. 
Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have lost 10 of
the 18 Prempro cases that juries have considered since trials
began in 2006. The most recent verdict came this week when a
Philadelphia jury awarded three women more than $72 million in
damages on their claims over the drugmaker&#8217;s hormone-replacement
medications. 
&#8220;We are pleased the court declined to consider any issue
relating to Wyeth&#8217;s negligence in causing her breast cancer or
Mrs. Daniel&#8217;s compensatory award,&#8221; Zoe Littlepage, one of the
woman&#8217;s lawyers, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. 
The case is Daniel v. Wyeth, 040602368, Court of Common
Pleas (Philadelphia).

&#8216;Oddball&#8217; Hedge-Fund Friend Chose Stocks, Sidhu Tells Court 
Rupinder Sidhu, who is accused of insider trading, said he
had no idea stock tips from his &#8220;eccentric&#8221; friend at hedge
fund AKO Capital LLP were based on confidential information. 
Prosecutors allege AKO trader Anjam Ahmad told Sidhu when
the fund was about to place large buy or sell orders so Sidhu
could benefit from the effect on the shares. The pair split
profits of about 500,000 pounds ($783,500) from spread bets on
companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd., Swatch Group AG (UHR) and
Michael Page International Plc (MPI) between June and August 2009, the
U.K. Financial Services Authority said in a London trial. 
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know about any AKO orders,&#8221; Sidhu testified
yesterday. &#8220;I was basing my trades on Ahmad&#8217;s decisions and his
rationale.&#8221; 
Sidhu denies 23 counts of insider trading and one money-
laundering charge for which he&#8217;s on trial. The 40-year-old
management consultant from Osterley, West London, admitted
contacting Ahmad using unregistered mobile phones and instant-
messaging accounts under false names to discuss trades. In one
MSN Messenger conversation, they made a coded reference to a
potential purchase as a &#8220;party.&#8221; 
Sidhu told jurors this was because he wanted to keep the
spread betting secret from his family, who banned the practice
after he racked up heavy trading losses in 2008. Ahmad told
Sidhu his contract with AKO prevented him from trading for
himself. 
Ahmad, a former equity strategist at Citigroup Inc. (C), was a
gifted mathematician who was known for being &#8220;quirky and
eccentric&#8221; and &#8220;an oddball,&#8221; Sidhu said in testimony Dec. 7.
They had been friends since secondary school and Sidhu regularly
sought his advice on trading.

Verdicts/Settlements 
Pfizer Settles Prempro Case After Losing $72.6 Million Verdict 
Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, agreed to
settle claims that its menopause drugs caused cancer in three
women who won a $72.6 million jury award earlier this week, a
lawyer said. 
The New York-based company agreed to resolve claims by
Susan Elfont, Bernadette Kalenkoski and Judy Mulderig that
hormone-replacement drugs made by two Pfizer units caused their
breast cancer, Ted Meadows, a lawyer for the women, said in an
interview yesterday. A Philadelphia jury awarded the three women
$72.6 million in compensatory damages on Dec. 6. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re just glad to be able to go on with their lives,&#8221;
said Meadows, who declined to disclose the amounts of the
settlements because they are confidential. 
The accord comes a day before jurors were to begin hearing
testimony in a second phase of the case. The panel would have
been asked to decide whether Pfizer should face punitive damages
over its handling of the menopause drugs. 
&#8220;The parties have entered into a mutual agreement to
resolve this case under confidential terms,&#8221; Chris Loder, a
Pfizer spokesman, said in a telephone interview. The earlier
verdict will be set aside as part of the settlement, he said. 
More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. 
The Philadelphia case that settled is Elfont v. Wyeth
Pharmaceuticals Inc., 00924, Jury Term 2004, Philadelphia Court
of Common Pleas (Philadelphia).

Garrett Bauer Pleads Guilty to Trading on Stolen Merger Tips 
Garrett Bauer, a New York stock trader, pleaded guilty to
his role in an insider-trading scheme that the U.S. says
generated $37 million in illegal profits by relying on corporate
merger tips stolen from four law firms. 
Bauer, 44, joined middleman Kenneth T. Robinson and
attorney Matthew H. Kluger in using nonpublic data to trade
ahead of more than 30 corporate transactions over 17 years, he
admitted in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Robinson, who
cooperated with prosecutors, pleaded guilty in April. 
In charging the men in April, prosecutors said the scheme
involved companies such as Sun Microsystems Inc., 3Com Corp. and
Acxiom Corp. They said Bauer made more than $30 million on the
scheme, while Robinson earned more than $875,000 and Kluger more
than $500,000. 
&#8220;After taking the lion&#8217;s share of the $37 million in
profits, Bauer now faces punishment for conduct that undermines
the fairness of our financial markets and the public&#8217;s trust in
the safety of its investments,&#8221; U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said
in a statement. 
Bauer admitted securities fraud, conspiracy to commit
securities fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering, and
obstruction of justice. He faces as many as 20 years in prison
on the fraud and obstruction counts when he is sentenced March
13. He forfeited cash and property worth more than $23 million. 
Bauer, who is free on $4 million bail, regrets his actions
and has been giving lectures to students and traders about
insider trading, said his attorney Michael Bachner. He has
spoken at business schools, law schools, churches and synagogues
to audiences ranging from 20 to 200 people, Bachner said. 
The cases are U.S. v. Bauer, 11-mj-03536, and U.S. v.
Robinson, 11-cr-00223, U.S. District Court, District of New
Jersey (Newark).

Wells Fargo to Pay $148 Million in Muni Bid-Rigging Case 
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) agreed to pay $148 million to settle
criminal charges and civil claims for conspiring to overcharge
state and local governments on investments, becoming the fourth
bank to enter a settlement in the case. 
The deal will resolve investigations into Wachovia Bank,
which Wells Fargo acquired in 2008, by U.S. agencies, including
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice
Department, as well as attorneys general in 26 states, the
Justice Department said in a statement. 
The case is the latest in a more than five-year
investigation into how Wall Street banks conspired with local-
government advisers to reap excessive fees on investments sold
to public agencies by rigging competitive auctions and carving
up the market among themselves. JPMorgan Chase  Co., UBS AG and
Bank of America Corp. (BAC) previously settled similar cases. 
&#8220;Wachovia won bids by playing an elaborate game of &#8216;you
scratch my back and I&#8217;ll scratch yours,&#8217; rather than engaging in
legitimate competition to win municipalities&#8217; business,&#8221; Robert
Khuzami, director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement, said in
a statement. 
The settlement by Wells Fargo will bring to $673 million
the amount that banks have paid to settle the case, some of
which is being returned to localities that were overcharged in
the scheme. 
Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, said the conduct was
by former employees of Wachovia before its acquisition. About
$59 million from the settlement will go to state attorneys
general, the bank said. 
&#8220;Wells Fargo is pleased to have fully resolved this
investigation of Wachovia Bank,&#8221; the bank said in a statement. 
The charges are connected to investment contracts that
states and cities bought with proceeds raised in the $3.7
trillion municipal-bond market, allowing them to earn a return
until the cash is needed for public-works projects.

KME, Halcor Lose EU Top Court Challenges of Antitrust Fines 
KME Group SpA (KME) and Greek metals processor Halcor SA (XAKO) lost
European Union top court appeals over cartel fines. 
The antitrust penalties against the companies should stand,
the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said in rulings yesterday. 
KME appealed fines levied in two separate cartels in 2003
and in 2004, respectively. A lower EU court in 2009 rejected the
company&#8217;s first challenge to the 2003 fine of 39.8 million euros
($53.3 million). In 2004, KME was fined 67.1 million euros and
Halcor 9.16 million euros in another cartel. Halcor&#8217;s fine was
cut to 8.25 million euros by a lower EU court in 2010. 
The European Commission, the 27-nation EU&#8217;s antitrust
regulator, fined three companies in 2003, including Outokumpu
Oyj (OUT1V) and Wieland-Werke AG, a total of 79 million euros for a
cartel between 1988 and 2001 in the market for copper tubes used
in air conditioning and refrigeration. A few months later, the
regulator levied a 222.3 million-euro penalty on companies
including KME and Halcor in the water, heating and gas tubes
market. 
Yesterday&#8217;s ruling confirms the lower court&#8217;s decision
which largely backed the EU antitrust authority, the Brussels-
based regulator said in an e-mailed statement. 
Halcor will examine the ruling and has already set aside 5
million euros to cover part of the fine, according to a filing
the company made to the Athens bourse. Francesco Giubilei, a
spokesman for Florence, Italy-based KME said he couldn&#8217;t comment
because it&#8217;s a national holiday. 
The cases are: C-272/09 P, KME and Others v. European
Commission, C-389/10 P, KME Germany and Others v. Commission.

processing plants. 
The liquefied petroleum gas treatment unit has been

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s blood-cancer drug
Mylotarg, pulled from the market last year after it was linked
to deaths, helped a different group of patients, a study found. 
Patients newly diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia who
received Mylotarg with chemotherapy lived for 25 months after
treatment, compared with 15 months for those given chemotherapy
alone, according to the study released today at the American
Society of Hematology meeting in San Diego. Mylotarg had
previously been used in patients ages 60 and older only after
their cancer had returned. 
Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, will talk with U.S.
regulators about whether the medicine may return to the market,
said Mace Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical
development and medical affairs for the New York-based company&#8217;s
oncology unit. 
&#8220;We are working closely with investigators to better
understand the findings from this study,&#8221; Rothenberg said in a
telephone interview. The next step would be &#8220;taking these data
forward as a potential new submission, working with regulators,
if we choose to go that path,&#8221; he said. 
The study results may presage new life for what was an $83
million product in 2009, according to Evaluate Pharma. 
Pfizer pulled the drug in June 2010 after 10 years on the
market. The Food and Drug Administration requested the company
stop selling the therapy after a clinical trial showed it didn&#8217;t
help patients and was tied to deaths from liver complications. 
Expedited Review 
Mylotarg was approved in 2000 under an expedited review
process, which requires companies to conduct follow-up studies.
One such trial that began in 2004 was stopped early after
patients died and others didn&#8217;t appear to benefit. Pfizer
obtained Mylotarg in 2009 when it bought Wyeth. 
The drug originally was approved for patients 60 and older
who had a relapse of acute myeloid leukemia, a blood cancer that
begins growing in the bone marrow. The disease will be diagnosed
in 13,000 people in the U.S. this year and has a five-year
survival rate of 23 percent, according to the National
Institutes of Health. 
Mylotarg was the first therapy approved to treat patients
whose cancer had returned and was the first drug to be withdrawn
after winning approval under the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration&#8217;s accelerated review program. 
The study released today involved 280 patients ages 50 to
70 who were first diagnosed with the disease. The group was
treated with chemotherapy and some patients also received
Mylotarg. 
Treatment Dosage 
Pfizers&#8217;s drug was given to patients over a week, in 3
milligram increments, said Sylvie Castaigne, the principal
investigator. &#8220;We used a small dose, and repeated the dose a
short intervals,&#8221; said Castaigne, a professor in the department
of hematology at H&#244;pital de Versailles in Versailles, France. 
Next &#8220;will be to test the drug in younger patients,
because we know that younger patients respond better than older
patients to chemotherapy,&#8221; Castaigne said in a telephone
interview from San Francisco. Researchers also examine whether
they can get similar results with a lower dose. &#8220;We are right
at the limit of toxicity now,&#8221; she said. 
The drug must be resubmitted to the FDA with the new data
before it could return to the U.S. market, Rothenberg said. 
&#8220;Our knowledge is always moving forward, and sometimes we
may not always have the best insights of how best to use the
drug when it first arrives,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In this case, it was
right on that margin, and it fell back. Now it&#8217;s just a question
of finding that right dose in the right patients, and clearly
demonstrating a benefit.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley (MS) can&#8217;t ask a court in
Singapore to block investors there from suing outside the
country over their losses on $154.7 million in synthetic
collateralized debt obligations, a judge in New York ruled. 
The New York-based bank&#8217;s attempt is vexatious, U.S.
District Judge Leonard Sand said yesterday, granting a request
by investors including the Singapore Government Staff Credit
Cooperative Society Ltd. to stop Morgan Stanley from seeking a
Singapore High Court order. 
Several Morgan Stanley units created a &#8220;classic bait and
switch scheme secretly designed to benefit Morgan Stanley&#8221; at
customers&#8217; expense, according to the lawsuit filed in October
2010. The investors claim Morgan Stanley didn&#8217;t tell them it was
a counter-party to the agreements, meaning that for each dollar
the investors lost, the bank gained a dollar. 
Morgan Stanley disagrees with the ruling and its Singapore
court action was entirely appropriate, Hong Kong-based spokesman
Nick Footitt said today. 
&#8220;This dispute involved plaintiffs who are all based in
Singapore, who purchased notes in Singapore, and who
contractually agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Singapore courts,&#8221; he said. 
Morgan Stanley, which had sought to have the investors&#8217;
lawsuit thrown out because the Monetary Authority of Singapore
investigated the sale of structured financial products and
created a resolution system, this month denied any wrongdoing. 
&#8216;Fare Better&#8217; 
Morgan Stanley has &#8220;a sense they would fare better in
Singapore,&#8221; said Eugene Tan, assistant professor of law at the
Singapore Management University. 
Any alleged misstatements by Morgan Stanley on the notes
&#8220;were mere puffery or were vague statements of optimism,&#8221; the
bank said in a court filing. &#8220;Defendants had no duty to
disclose the allegedly omitted information.&#8221; 
In October, Sand dismissed some of the investors&#8217; claims
and permitted the rest of the case to go forward. One month
later, Morgan Stanley asked the Singapore court for an order
blocking the investors from pursuing the case. 
&#8220;Rather than availing themselves of the remedies available
here, defendants are attempting to require the plaintiffs to
begin anew in Singapore,&#8221; Sand said yesterday in his ruling. He
also denied the New York-based bank&#8217;s request that he certify
his October decision for pretrial appeal. 
Pinnacle Notes 
The plaintiffs seek to represent a class of all investors
who bought the Pinnacle Notes from Aug. 1, 2006, to the end of
2007. 
A group of investors in Singapore last month lost a bid to
recoup losses on Lehman-related products with an appeal court in
the city state ruling that &#8220;the principle of caveat emptor
applies equally to literates and illiterates,&#8221; using the Latin
phrase for &#8216;buyer beware.&#8217;&#8217; 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore banned 10 financial
institutions from selling structured investments in 2009
following claims by investors that they were misled on products
tied to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. 
The authority lifted the ban last year after the
institutions boosted internal procedures of their advisory
services across all investment products. 
Tan said the disputes surrounding collateralized debt
obligations were unique. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think investors are going to have a different
investment climate in Singapore based on this lawsuit&#8221; against
Morgan Stanley, he said. 
The case is Dandong v. Pinnacle Performance Ltd., 10-
cv-08086, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest
software maker, replaced Andy Lees as head of its Windows Phone
Division after losing share to Google Inc. (GOOG) in the market for
mobile operating systems. 
Terry Myerson, a vice president, will take charge of the
division, while Lees takes on a new role, reporting to Chief
Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said in an e-mail posted to its website. 
Microsoft&#8217;s share of the market for mobile-phone operating
systems dropped to 1.5 percent in the third quarter from 2.7
percent a year earlier, according to Gartner Inc. Share for
Google&#8217;s Android more than doubled to 53 percent from 25 percent
in the same period. Ballmer, in the blog posting, thanked Lees
&#8220;for his contributions to the phone team.&#8221; 
Myerson will be in charge of operations including Windows
Phone development and marketing, Ballmer said. Lees, who will
retain his title of president, will work with Ballmer on Windows
Phone and the coming Windows 8 software designed for tablets,
the company said. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to deliver this whole seamless experience
across devices and they&#8217;re probably better off having one person
trying to oversee that,&#8221; said Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams
Wright Ragen in Seattle. 
Share Losses to Google 
Microsoft is aiming to regain share lost to Android and
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPhone with updated software and a partnership with
handset maker Nokia Oyj. (NOK1V) Apple had 15 percent of the mobile-
software market last quarter, while Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) had
11 percent share, according to Gartner. 
Ballmer&#8217;s deputies are also working on Windows 8 to run
tablet machines capable of rivaling Apple&#8217;s iPad. 
Myerson, who joined Microsoft in 1997, had previously
overseen Windows Phone engineering. He was shifted to that role
from Microsoft&#8217;s Exchange e-mail product as the company decided
to scrap previous work on Windows Mobile and redo phone software
to better appeal to consumers in the wake of the iPhone&#8217;s
success.

Thomas Lee, chief U.S. equity
strategist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), estimated the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will rally to 1,430 next year and recommended
financial stocks. 
Lee&#8217;s forecast is 14 percent higher than the closing level
on Dec. 9 of 1,255.19. He estimated combined profit by companies (SPX)
in the benchmark equity gauge will be $105 a share in 2012 and
$110 in 2013. Based on his projection for earnings in 2013, the
SP 500 will trade at a price-earnings multiple of 13 times,
according to a note dated Dec. 9. 
&#8220;The consensus view is that visibility remains murky and
with significant tail risks&#8221; such as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and
fiscal tightening in China, Lee said. &#8220;2012 may look a bit like
2009,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Emergence from a financial crisis and the

Europe exiting a recession and China easing&#8221; may boost cyclical
stocks. Financials, which may be helped by Republican gains in
the U.S. election, are his &#8220;top pick,&#8221; he said. 
Financials have plunged 21 percent in 2011, the most of the
10 groups in the SP 500 (SPXL1), as investors fled banks and insurers
on concern Europe&#8217;s debt crisis will spread. Material and
industrial shares had the next biggest declines, falling 13
percent and 5 percent, respectively. In 2009, from the SP 500&#8217;s
bottom on March 9, 2009, through the end of the year, financials
surged 131 percent, while consumer discretionary, industrials
and materials jumped at least 83 percent. 
Lee&#8217;s SP 500 estimate is the second-highest of 11
strategists surveyed by Bloomberg, who on average forecast the
measure will climb to 1,350 next year. 
The SP 500 fell 1.5 percent to 1,236.47 at 4 p.m. New York
time. The measure has lost 1.7 percent in 2011.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, authorized a new share buyback program for as much as
$10 billion as Lipitor lost about 15 percent of its market in
the first week the cholesterol pill faced generic competition. 
The quarterly dividend was increased to 22 cents a share
from 20 cents, according to a statement today. The stock
repurchase plan is in addition to Pfizer&#8217;s existing program, the
New York-based company said. Chief Executive Officer Ian Read,
58, also was named board chairman. 
Pfizer lost U.S. patent protection on its biggest seller,
the Lipitor cholesterol pill, at the end of last month. Generic
versions of the drug accounted for about 15 percent of the
Lipitor market in the week ended December 2, the first week
copies were available, according to a report today from Chris Schott, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) 
The buyback &#8220;is on first thought higher than what most
people were anticipating,&#8221; said Damien Conover, an analyst at
Morningstar Inc. (MORN) in Chicago, in a telephone interview. &#8220;It will
be viewed as a positive by the investment community.&#8221; 
Pfizer has been working to minimize losses from Lipitor by
making deals with insurers to block the use of generic versions
in exchange for lowering the price of branded Lipitor. 
&#8220;This is a very complicated generic launch, the way Pfizer
is going after retaining share, this is rather unprecedented,&#8221;
said Conover. &#8220;It is probably a little too early to tell&#8221; how
well the company will do in holding off generics. 
New Repurchase Plan 
Under its existing program, Pfizer had repurchased $6.5
billion of shares as of November 1, and it anticipates
repurchasing between $7 billion and $9 billion this year, said
Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, in a phone interview. 
Under the new repurchase program Pfizer plans to buy about
$5 billion of its stock in 2012 with the rest of the $10 billion
amount available in 2013 and beyond, the company said in its
statement. 
&#8220;The dividend increase and new share repurchase program
are a testament to our continued commitment to enhancing
shareholder value and to our continued confidence in the
business,&#8221; Read said in a statement. 
Read took over the board chairman position from George Lorch, who will become an independent director, the company said
in a separate statement. Read became CEO after Jeffrey Kindler
resigned as chief executive officer and chairman in December
2010. Lorch was named to the board post a few days later. 
Pfizer shares declined less than 1 percent to $20.39 at
4:00 p.m. New York time.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s money-
management unit agreed to buy the mutual-fund management
business of Dividend Growth Advisors LLC to increase its income-
oriented offerings. Terms were not disclosed. 
The acquired business includes the Rising Dividend Growth
Fund, which had $153 million in assets of Oct. 31, New York-
based Goldman Sachs Asset Management said today in a statement.
Dividend Growth Advisors is a closely held money-management
company based in South Carolina. 
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which has $821 billion in
assets, said the purchase will broaden its mutual-fund offerings
to include strategies that provide investors with an income
stream through the payment of dividends. The fund, which will
now be called the Goldman Sachs Rising Dividend Growth Fund,
invests in companies that have paid dividends that increase by
at least 10 percent a year for a minimum of 10 consecutive
years. 
The fund&#8217;s reorganization must be approved by its
shareholders, with a vote expected in the first quarter of 2012,
according to the statement. 
The Rising Dividend fund has advanced at an average annual
rate of 4.6 percent over the past five years, beating 98 percent
of similarly-managed funds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. This year, the fund has increased 2.5 percent, better
than 72 percent of peers.

Russian political risk sparked by
ballot-rigging allegations in parliamentary elections may remain
&#8220;repellent&#8221; for stocks for months to come, even after
nationwide protests ended peacefully, JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said. 
&#8220;Large-scale political protests have taken their toll on
the market, with Russia massively underperforming global
emerging market peers in the past week,&#8221; said Alex Kantarovich,
a strategist at JPMorgan in Moscow, in an e-mailed note today. 
President Dmitry Medvedev said yesterday he ordered an
investigation into allegations of electoral fraud in the Dec. 4
elections to parliament, which was won by the dominant United
Russia party that he and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin promoted.
About 25,000 people gathered in near-freezing weather in central
Moscow the day before to protest the results of elections, with
tens of thousands more doing the same in St. Petersburg and
other major cities, according to police. 
The Micex Index rallied today, rising 1.5 percent, the most
this month, to 1,416.49 at 12:49 p.m., after nationwide protests
Dec. 10 concluded peacefully. That measure tumbled 7.3 percent
last week, the most in almost three months, as earlier protests
led to the detention of hundreds of activists. 
The protests will probably continue sporadically into the 
first quarter of 2012, yet fail to broaden, JPMorgan said. 
The most likely scenario is that Putin&#8217;s plan to return to
the Kremlin in the March vote for president will go according to
plan and stocks will &#8220;experience a drag until then,&#8221;
Kantarovich said.

Mark Machin, who ran Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s investment banking business in Asia for six years,
is leaving after two decades with the company. 
Machin, 45, is stepping down from his position as vice-
chairman for the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, according
to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Edward Naylor, a
spokesman for the firm in Hong Kong, confirmed the contents of
the document. 
A Goldman Sachs partner since 2002, Machin is considering
taking a position with an investment business, two people with
knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be identified as no
final decision has been made. He will move to Hong Kong from
Beijing in January, one of the people said. 
Machin is the most senior manager at Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
investment bank in Asia to depart since Ravi Sinha, co-head of
the division for the region, stepped down in April 2010. Yusuf Alireza, the New York-based firm&#8217;s co-president of operations
for the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan, left last month. 
Machin, who trained as a doctor at Oxford University before
joining Goldman Sachs, moved to Beijing from Hong Kong in 2009
to oversee the expansion of the advisory business in China,
which was the world&#8217;s biggest generator of initial public
offering fees last year according to researcher Freeman  Co. 
Top MA Adviser 
Goldman Sachs is the second-largest arranger of stock and
convertible bond sales overseas by Chinese companies this year
behind Morgan Stanley and is third in advising on mergers, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The firm ranks 29th in the league
table for domestic equity and convertible bond offerings. 
For the first time since 2004, Goldman Sachs this year
captured the top spot among arrangers of equity and equity-
linked offerings in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan,
according to Bloomberg data. The firm also ranks first in
mergers advisory in the region. 
Machin, who became regional co-head of investment banking
in 2005, stepped down from that position in February. In that
role he had worked with William Wicker, Richard Ong and Sinha,
all former co-heads of investment banking in Asia who left the
firm as partners. 
David Ryan, who was previously co-head of investment
banking for Asia together with Machin, became sole president of
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s operations in the region when Alireza left.

</body></entry><entry author="By Michael J. Moore" category="US, FINANCE, INSURANCE" date="Dec 13, 2011  4:16 PM ET" keywords="MBIA Inc, Morgan Stanley, Bonds, Financial Services, Insurance, Legal Affairs, Litigation, Markets, New York, North America, Securities Firms, Subprime Lending, U.S. Mid-Atlantic, United States" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-13/morgan-stanley-agrees-to-settle-mbia-suit-forecasts-1-2-billion-charge.html"><headline>Morgan Stanley Agrees to Settle MBIA Suit, Forecasts $1.2 Billion Charge</headline><body>
Morgan Stanley (MS) reached a settlement
with MBIA Inc. (MBI) over credit-default swaps that led to billions of
dollars of losses for the bank, agreeing to terminate the
contracts and drop a challenge to the insurer&#8217;s restructuring. 
MBIA will make a $1.1 billion cash payment to Morgan
Stanley as part of the settlement, according to a person
familiar with the agreement who asked not to be named because
the amount hasn&#8217;t been made public. Morgan Stanley will take a
$1.2 billion loss this quarter related to the deal, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s exposure to MBIA, and its attempts to
hedge those risks, have resulted in losses of about $3 billion
since the start of 2008, not including today&#8217;s announcement. The
settlement will increase Morgan Stanley&#8217;s capital, boosting the
Tier 1 common ratio under new rules by about 75 basis points,
according to the statement. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s critical that we reposition for the new regulatory
environment and do so quickly,&#8221; Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman said in the statement. &#8220;A top priority for
2011 was to address this large outstanding legacy exposure and
this settlement is consistent with our efforts to build capital
and de-risk the balance sheet.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley fell 21 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $15.17 at
4:15 p.m. in New York, after climbing as much as 7.6 percent.
MBIA increased 0.7 percent to $11.48. 
MBIA Hedges 
The bank&#8217;s loss will come from writing down the value of
the swap contracts with MBIA. Morgan Stanley had $4.9 billion of
gross derivative counterparty risk to MBIA as of Sept. 30, and
$2.7 billion after credit valuation adjustments, according to
its quarterly filing with the SEC. The bank also had about $700
million of hedges against MBIA. 
The agreement &#8220;removes a legal headache, and should give a
boost to Morgan&#8217;s balance-sheet efficiency&#8221; Glenn Schorr, an
analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note to investors.
The deal &#8220;could also cause the firm&#8217;s CDS spread to tighten as
earnings volatility should decline,&#8221; Schorr said. 
MBIA, based in Armonk, New York, will withdraw a suit
against Morgan Stanley relating to $223 million of residential
mortgage-backed securities. Morgan Stanley plans to end its
participation in litigation challenging the split of the
insurer&#8217;s business. 
&#8220;This settlement is good for Morgan Stanley, good for MBIA
and good for the markets and our financial system, allowing
firms to move forward and rebuild,&#8221; Benjamin Lawsky, New York
state&#8217;s financial services superintendent, said in a separate
statement. 
Kevin Brown, a spokesman for MBIA, declined to comment. 
Bank of America 
The settlement &#8220;significantly&#8221; reduces Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
risk-weighted assets under new rules from the Basel Committee on
Banking Supervision, known as Basel III, according to the
statement. Morgan Stanley had a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of
more than 7 percent as of Sept. 30, and the increase brings it
closer to the range of 8 percent to 10 percent the firm said it
planned to reach by the end of 2012. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s MBIA exposure would have accounted for as
much as 15 percent of the firm&#8217;s risk-weighted assets under
Basel III, and the risk may have lasted for more than 10 years,
Howard Chen, a Credit Suisse Group AG analyst, wrote in a note
to investors. 
Buyback Speculation 
The deal increases the likelihood that Morgan Stanley will
buy back shares or increase the dividend next year, according to
Ed Najarian, an analyst at International Strategy  Investment
Group Inc. Morgan Stanley has authorization for $1.6 billion of
share repurchases. The firm hasn&#8217;t bought back any stock in the
first nine months of this year, and would need regulatory
approval to do so. 
Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, made a preliminary offer to MBIA earlier this year aimed
at settling their legal dispute tied to defective mortgages, two
people briefed on discussions said in July. The companies were
split on how much the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank would
have to pay to resolve the disagreement. 
About two dozen banks and investment firms sued MBIA and
regulators after the 2009 split of its main bond-insurance unit
into two businesses. The division created a new company holding
the state and municipal-bond guarantee business the insurer
seeks to maintain, and left the old unit holding soured
mortgage-backed debt that caused them to be shut out of the
market. Lenders claimed the restructuring was a &#8220;fraudulent
conveyance&#8221; that rendered the old insurer, MBIA Insurance
Corp., insolvent. 
Ending Lawsuits 
Units of Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), Credit Agricole SA (ACA), KBC Groep
NV (KBC), HSBC Holdings Plc, and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc have
pulled out of the suits in the past four months, according to
court papers. Funds run by New York-based Fir Tree Partners
dropped out of a similar lawsuit by hedge funds and Third Avenue
Trust, also based in New York, ended a separate case in October.
Five of 18 banks that sued MBIA and the New York State Insurance
Department including UBS AG, BNP Paribas SA, and Bank of America
are still fighting the split. 
&#8220;The remaining plaintiff policyholders will continue to
fight to restore the billions fraudulently taken from MBIA
Insurance,&#8221; Robert J. Giuffra, lead counsel for the banks and a
partner at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP in New York, said in a
separate statement. 
Settlements 
Banks have discontinued litigation as MBIA negotiates
settlements over the credit-default swaps it sold to the lenders
to protect against losses on mortgage securities and other debt.
MBIA said Nov. 10 that it had settled $10.6 billion of
transactions since Sept. 30 at an undisclosed cost, bringing the
amount of bets terminated this year to $23 billion. 
The cost to protect against a default by the MBIA unit that
sold the guarantees fell. Credit-default swaps eased 8
percentage points to a mid-price of 35 percent upfront as of
9:37 a.m. in New York, according to broker Phoenix Partners
Group. That&#8217;s in addition to 5 percent a year, meaning it would
cost $3.5 million initially and $500,000 annually to protect $10
million of MBIA&#8217;s debt.

The liquidator of the MF Global Inc.
brokerage said that &#8220;certain&#8221; actions of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
a lender to the broker-dealer&#8217;s parent, &#8220;are likely to be the
subject of investigation.&#8221; 
The trustee, James Giddens, said he would &#8220;act with the
respect to&#8221; those actions to recover money for brokerage
customers if necessary. If the bank received so-called
preferential payments before the brokerage went into
liquidation, or other payments, he would deal &#8220;appropriately&#8221;
with the transfers or other issues, he said. 
&#8220;HHR may threaten or bring an action against JPM in the
context of a potential dispute between&#8221; the bank and the
brokerage, he said in a court filing yesterday. Giddens&#8217;s law
firm is Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP, or HHR. 
JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, was agent for a $1.2
billion loan to the broker-dealer&#8217;s parent, and also for a $300
million loan to the brokerage, according to the filing. Giddens
made the statement about suing the bank after a judge asked him
if he was disinterested enough to litigate in light of past work
for JPMorgan. 
The broker-dealer paid JPMorgan and the other secured
lenders back for the $300 million loan, Giddens said. He didn&#8217;t
know yet if the bank was still a creditor of the brokerage. 
Not a Client 
JPMorgan isn&#8217;t a &#8220;current client&#8221; of the law firm,
Giddens told the Manhattan federal judge. Giddens&#8217;s firm ended
&#8220;minor&#8221; patent and other work for JPMorgan and collected less
than $2,000 in fees from the bank in 2011 and less than $35,000
in 2009 and 2010, Giddens said. 
The brokerage&#8217;s parent, MF Global Holdings Ltd., is in a
separate court proceeding. 
Joseph Evangelisti, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment on Gidden&#8217;s statement about lawsuits. 
Three transfers of collateral made and pending will give
commodity customers about $4 billion of their assets, according
to court filings. Giddens is due to testify on his progress in
Washington today before the Senate Agriculture Committee. 
The parent company&#8217;s Oct. 31 bankruptcy filing, the eighth-
largest in U.S. history, listed assets of $41 billion. Jon Corzine, the former co-chief executive officer of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., quit as MF Global&#8217;s CEO on Nov. 4. 
The brokerage case is Securities Investor Protection Corp.
v. MF Global Inc., 11-02790, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). The parent&#8217;s bankruptcy case
is MF Global Holdings Ltd., 11-bk-15059, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Morgan
Stanley (MS) are getting a chilly reception at top colleges,
including Harvard University and Princeton University, as campus
offshoots of Occupy Wall Street target investment-bank
recruiting events. 
Goldman Sachs canceled visits to Harvard and Brown
University last week following a November incident where Occupy
Harvard protesters attempted to enter a recruitment session.
Students at Yale University, Princeton and Cornell University
have also rallied at campus events by investment firms. 
Students of the eight elite colleges composing the Ivy
League in the northeastern U.S., such as Sandra Korn of Harvard
and Tom Moore of Cornell, are criticizing their universities for
sending high numbers of graduates to Wall Street, rather than to
jobs that emphasize community service. Careers in financial and
consulting firms are frequently presented as the best or only
option, said Korn, a sophomore majoring in history of science
and gender studies who participated in the Nov. 28 protest. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of frustrating for students who think this is
not the most ethical profession,&#8221; Korn, 19, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;When some people are making money by taking risks
with other people&#8217;s lives and livelihoods, that&#8217;s detrimental to
society.&#8221; 
About 22 percent of Harvard 2011 graduates who planned to
enter the workforce were headed into finance and consulting,
down from a high of 47 percent in 2007, according to a Harvard
Crimson survey published in May. Half the students entering
those fields said they would have chosen to work in other
professions if salary weren&#8217;t a concern. 
Targeting Blankfein 
More than 11 percent were planning for jobs in education,
and one in four were ticketed for graduate programs, according
to the survey. 
A Dec. 8 Goldman Sachs recruiting visit to the Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based university was canceled &#8220;due to proximity
to the Reading Period and commencement of exams,&#8221; according to
an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News. A session days earlier on
Brown&#8217;s campus in Providence, Rhode Island, was scuttled hours
before it was to begin, the Brown Daily Herald reported Dec. 5.
Both sessions were rescheduled as Internet-based seminars. 
Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, a graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School,
canceled an October appearance at Barnard College in New York.
Students at Columbia University, with which Barnard is
affiliated, organized a weeklong protest against Blankfein, the
Columbia Daily Spectator reported on its website. Barnard
President Debora L. Spar joined Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board in June. 
West Coast Shipping 
David Wells, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs,
declined to comment on the campus protests. 
Protests spawned by the Occupy Wall Street movement that
began in September have focused attention on Americans who lost
homes and jobs as credit froze after the bankruptcy of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, contributing to the worst
recession since the Great Depression, even as many U.S. banks
rebounded. The movement that began in a New York park has spread
to cities worldwide including Boston, London, Sydney and
Toronto. 
Occupy demonstrators yesterday protested to halt shipping
operations at ports in Oakland and Long Beach, California, and
Portland, Oregon, where Goldman Sachs owns a stake in the
largest cargo-terminal operator. The economic value of
containerized cargo at West Coast ports is about $705 million a
day, according to Martin Associates, a Lancaster, Pennsylvania-
based consulting firm. 
Job Opportunities 
College students are saying that Wall Street banks haven&#8217;t
been held accountable for promoting the high-risk investments
that led to the financial crisis. 
&#8220;In general, they play a role in the crashing of the
economy and the broadening of the income distribution gap,&#8221;
said Luciana Chamorro, a senior at Princeton. &#8220;It&#8217;s the
maximization of profit at the expense of social equality.&#8221; 
Chamorro said she&#8217;s been disappointed by the focus on Wall
Street and consulting jobs among the opportunities presented by
the Princeton, New Jersey-based university&#8217;s career office. She
was among about 20 students who interrupted a Dec. 7 JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) recruitment session on campus to voice their
concern. There were about 25 students there who had come to
learn about the investment bank, and five people from the
company, three of them recent Princeton graduates, she said. 
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we seemed threatening in any way to them,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;We both gave each other the space to say what we
were thinking and I think that was really good.&#8221; 
Yale&#8217;s Approach 
Morgan Stanley experienced some &#8220;peripheral&#8221; protest
activity at an event at Yale in New Haven, Connecticut, last
month, said Jeanmarie McFadden, a spokeswoman for the firm. 
&#8220;We have not changed our recruitment activities and we
have not seen any impact on attendance,&#8221; she said. 
Yale respects the rights of students to protest peacefully,
said Allyson Moore, associate dean of Yale College and director
of career services. 
&#8220;None of the companies were distressed by it,&#8221; Moore
said. &#8220;They anticipated it.&#8221; 
About 11 percent of Yale undergraduates take jobs in
finance, less than the 18 percent that go to work in education,
Moore said. 
&#8220;Our philosophy is to support each individual student&#8217;s
career aspirations,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;If they want a career in the
arts, we&#8217;ll do our level best to help them achieve that and if
they aspire to a career in business, we&#8217;ll work equally as
hard.&#8221; 
Public Service 
Korn, the Harvard student, said she has slept in a tent in
Harvard Yard about 14 times as part of the Occupy protest. She
said she heard speeches by university President Drew Faust that
emphasized the importance of public-service careers. 
Under Faust, Harvard has increased opportunities and
support for students seeking experiences and careers in public
service, said Jeff Neal, a university spokesman. Efforts last
year included a series of new Presidential Public Service
Fellowships. She has also said that the university&#8217;s next
fundraising campaign will include increasing summer public-
service opportunities, according to Neal. 
On Nov. 28, Korn said she and about 25 other Occupy Harvard
protesters tried to enter the Goldman Sachs event. She said a
staff member told her group they couldn&#8217;t enter because they
weren&#8217;t properly dressed and didn&#8217;t have resumes. 
The protesters remained outside, chanting anti-Goldman
Sachs slogans, she said. Students who had come to hear the
bank&#8217;s presentation were unhappy, she said. 
&#8220;There were certainly some students who were a little
annoyed,&#8221; she said. 
Strained Friendships 
Colleges should consider banning corporate recruiting, as
they did military recruiters, as antithetical to the purposes of
a university, said Moore, the Cornell sophomore. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s a sense that they&#8217;re appealing to people who
don&#8217;t have a lot of options, that graduation is coming near and
debt is piling up,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;People are becoming part of
this profoundly unjust institution because they don&#8217;t see an
alternative.&#8221; 
Moore said his views have caused friction with classmates
interested in Wall Street jobs. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ve definitely had some friendships strained,&#8221; he said.

Morgan Stanley lowered its price
forecasts for agricultural commodities including corn and wheat
because of rising global supplies. 
Corn prices on the Chicago Board of Trade may average $6.60
a bushel in the 2011-12 marketing year, soybeans will average
$12.75 a bushel and wheat will average $6.70 a bushel, Morgan
Stanley said an e-mailed report today. The bank previously
forecast corn at $7.25, soybeans at $14.25 and wheat at $7.50. 
&#8220;We are lowering our price forecasts across the
agricultural commodities, accounting for higher global supply,&#8221;
Morgan Stanley analysts led by Hussein Allidina in New York
wrote in the report. &#8220;We still see upside to prices, as the
recent sell-off, particularly in corn and soybeans, is overdone
in the face of still-tight U.S. stocks and strong U.S. feed and
ethanol demand.&#8221; 
Corn futures are down 5.1 percent this year at $5.97 and
soybeans have dropped 20 percent to $11.155 in Chicago. Wheat
has declined 24 percent to $6.005 on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The drop in prices this year &#8220;presents a buying opportunity,&#8221;
according to the bank. 
World wheat stockpiles will total 208.5 million metric
tons, up 2.9 percent from a November estimate, according to the
U.S. Department of Agriculture. The USDA raised its estimate for
corn inventories by 4.6 percent to 127.2 million tons and its
soybean stockpiles forecast by 1.5 percent to 64.5 million tons. 
Grains lagged other commodities this year &#8220;as the market
digests expectations of better-than-expected global supply,&#8221;
Morgan Stanley said. &#8220;The negative impact of this supply on
U.S. exports has sidelined concerns over poor U.S. production,
diverting the focus from still-tight U.S. balances.&#8221; 
Corn in the 2012-13 marketing year will average $5.75, down
from a prior forecast of $6, the bank estimates. Soybeans will
average $12.70, down from $13.50, and wheat will average $6.30,
down from the prior forecast of $7, Morgan Stanley said.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has lost at least 38 partners in
2011 as the firm heads toward the end of its worst year for
profit and share performance since 2008. 
The number is an estimate based on internal memos, company
filings and news reports as the New York-based bank doesn&#8217;t
publicize departures. The company added nine partners from
outside the firm this year, including six when Goldman Sachs
took full control of its Australian joint venture. 
Goldman Sachs, more than a dozen years since its initial
public offering, still promotes top performers every even-
numbered year to join a so-called partnership and share in a
bonus pool that&#8217;s envied on Wall Street. Partners swelled to 475
last year from 221 as of the IPO. They&#8217;re among the biggest
shareholders, with a combined stake of about 13.8 percent on
Nov. 20, up from 10.2 percent on Jan. 27, filings show. 
&#8220;I retired from GS after a fantastic 15 years entirely for
family reasons,&#8221; Robert A. McTamaney, who was named partner in
2002, said in an e-mailed response to questions after confirming
that he stepped down in June. &#8220;I plan to do something on my own
related to helping people manage their money.&#8221; 
The retirement of McTamaney, a U.S. citizen who helped run
the equities trading business in Asia after being co-head of
global foreign exchange and European emerging markets trading
from London, is among those that haven&#8217;t been reported. Others
include Ken N. Murphy, Dioscoro-Roy I. Ramos, Gary B. Schermerhorn, Devesh P. Shah and David H. Voon. 
&#8216;Good Fortune&#8217; 
&#8220;These guys have created a pretty good fortune and they&#8217;ve
got liquidity and can move out in a way that they couldn&#8217;t when
they were a partnership,&#8221; said Jay W. Lorsch, a Harvard
Business School professor who helped run an education program
for new partners in the 1980s. It&#8217;s not &#8220;a huge number&#8221; of
retirements as it&#8217;s less than 10 percent of the total, he said. 
Banks face new regulations and capital requirements that
may crimp profits. Protests, some aimed at Goldman Sachs, have
decried Wall Street bonuses after taxpayers rescued the
financial system in 2008. Demonstrators have disrupted bank
recruiting on college campuses and about 250 gathered this week
in front of the company&#8217;s headquarters chanting &#8220;Take the ax to
Goldman Sachs.&#8221; 
Goldman Sachs shares have dropped 45 percent this year and
net earnings tumbled 43 percent in the nine months ended Sept.
30. The company set aside $10 billion for compensation in the
first three quarters, enough to pay each worker $292,836 for the
period, down from $370,706 a year earlier. 
Highest-Paid 
Partners, typically the highest-paid employees, receive
most of their compensation in stock and must hold at least a
quarter of the after-tax shares they receive from the company
until they retire, according to a proxy statement. 
Goldman Sachs promoted 110 people to partner last year, the
second-largest class after 115 people were added in 2006. 
The firm, with 34,200 employees at the end of September,
has said it aims to trim $1.2 billion in annual expenses, which
could lead to at least 1,000 job cuts. Some of the partner
departures, including retirements, may be tied to the cost-
saving effort. 
New partners include Daniel P. Petrozzo, chief information
officer at Fidelity Investments before joining Goldman Sachs in
June, and Boston Consulting Group Chairman Carl Stern, 65, who
became a Chicago-based vice chairman in the investment-banking
division in September, according to company filings and LinkedIn
profiles. Ronald Hua, a citizen of the U.S. and Taiwan, joined
in September as chief investment officer and head of the
quantitative equity alpha business within asset management. 
Class of &#8216;88 
Goldman Sachs doesn&#8217;t publish statistics on how many
partners leave each year and the company stopped announcing
partner promotions in press releases after 2006. David Wells, a
spokesman for the firm, declined to comment. 
Five people who left or are leaving this year became
partners before the 1999 IPO, including Milton R. Berlinski, 55,
who heads the team that advises private-equity firms. Berlinski,
who became a partner in 1996, is stepping down at year-end, he
said in an interview today. 
The departure of Kevin W. Kennedy, 63, who became partner
in 1984, leaves Goldman Sachs with two partners from that
decade, both from the class of 1988: Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 57, and John P. Curtin Jr., 61, a U.S. citizen who is the Toronto-based chairman and
CEO of the firm&#8217;s Canadian business. 
Kennedy is one of four members of the management committee
who will be gone by year-end, along with Yusuf A. Alireza,
Edward C. Forst and Richard M. Ruzika. 
&#8216;Terribly Hard&#8217; 
&#8220;The work is terribly hard and so people don&#8217;t stay around
usually in this line of work for all that long,&#8221; Charles D. Ellis, author of the 2008 book &#8220;The Partnership: The Making of
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The intensity
gets to you.&#8221; 
Some partners who retire maintain ties to the company
through business relationships, alumni events or so-called
advisory-director or senior-director roles. An example is Joseph H. Gleberman, who worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 29 years
and became a partner in 1990. 
Gleberman, who most recently was chief risk officer for the
company&#8217;s merchant-banking division, said he will serve as an
advisory director on the investment committee after retiring at
year-end. 
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a very gratifying career at GS but I decided
that if I was going to have a significant next career
(unidentified as yet), now was the time to make the change,&#8221; he
wrote in response to an e-mailed question.

are leaving this year:

Chevron Phillips Chemical Co., a
joint venture equally owned by Chevron Corp. (CVX) and ConocoPhillips (COP),
will spend about $5 billion to build one of the first new
ethylene production facilities in the U.S. since 2001. 
The company selected its site in Baytown, Texas, for new
factories to convert ethane into ethylene starting in 2017, The
Woodlands, Texas-based Chevron Phillips said today in a
statement. The cost includes an ethylene plant, known as a
cracker, capable of producing 1.5 million metric tons of the
gaseous chemical a year, and two plants for making polyethylene
plastic, said Melanie Samuelson, a company spokeswoman in an
interview. 
The industry is investing in U.S. production of ethylene,
the most widely used petrochemical, as natural gas costs have
dropped. Ethane is derived from gas, which has dropped in price
as new technologies have boosted production from shale
formations. The U.S. has a cost advantage relative to producers
in Asia and Europe where ethylene is made from oil-derived
naphtha. 
&#8220;We are pleased that the development of shale-gas
resources in the U.S. has set the stage for major petrochemical
investment and job creation in our backyard,&#8221; Peter L. Cella,
chief executive officer of Chevron Phillips, said in the
statement. The chemical company announced in March plans to
consider the project. 
Pipeline Access 
Chevron Phillips plans to convert ethylene from its new
cracker into 1 billion metric tons a year of polyethylene at
plants to be built at either the company&#8217;s Cedar Bayou site in
Baytown or at the nearby Sweeny site in Old Ocean. A final
selection will be made by March, the company said. Polyethylene
is a plastic used in grocery bags and food packaging. 
Shaw Energy  Chemicals Ltd. is designing the ethane
cracker. Federal and state permit applications for air emissions
will be filed this week, with approvals anticipated in 2013,
according to the statement. 
Chevron Phillips said it chose to build adjacent to an
existing cracker in Baytown, located about 30 miles (48
kilometers) east of downtown Houston, because the site has
access to ethane and ethylene pipelines and storage caverns, as
well as to the Mont Belvieu gas-processing hub. 
The plants will employ 400 people and the construction
project will create 10,000 jobs, the company said. 
Dow Chemical Co. (DOW), the world&#8217;s largest ethylene producer,
plans to spend $4 billion in the U.S. to build a Gulf Coast
cracker by 2017, two propylene plants and to reopen an idled
Louisiana cracker. Sasol Ltd. (SOL) may spend as much as $4.5 billion
to build a cracker and related plants in Louisiana. 
LyondellBasell Industries NV is among companies expanding
existing U.S. facilities to benefit from low-cost ethane.

Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG)
should halt operations in Brazil and pay 20 billion reais ($10.7
billion) in damages after an oil spill last month, prosecutors
urged a federal court. 
&#8220;Chevron and Transocean weren&#8217;t capable of controlling the
damages from a spill of 3,000 barrels of oil, which proves a
lack of environmental planning and management,&#8221; the federal
prosecutors&#8217; office in Campos, Rio de Janeiro state, said today
in a statement on the Federal Public Ministry&#8217;s website. The
prosecutors didn&#8217;t say in which court the suit was filed. 
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. crude producer after Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM), is being audited by Brazil&#8217;s petroleum regulator
for the oil leak at the Frade project off the coast of Rio de
Janeiro last month. Brazil has tightened safety conditions at
crude projects following the spill at BP Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in
the Gulf of Mexico last year. 
Brazilian prosecutors said in today&#8217;s statement they are
asking a court to immediately suspend Chevron and Transocean&#8217;s
operations in the country and order a &#8220;definitive halt&#8221; after

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s U.K. arm
hired a French-speaking markets regulator from Britain&#8217;s
Financial Services Authority, as rule-setting powers move from
London to Paris and Brussels. 
The bank hired Martine Doyon, a specialist in European
Union market rules and an international strategist for the
regulator, to head up its EU government-affairs department, an
FSA spokesman said in a telephone interview. She becomes at
least the ninth senior official to leave the regulator since the
government said in 2010 it would abolish the agency. 
&#8220;A French or German speaker is probably a good place to
start&#8221; in recruiting a lobbyist, Fred Ponzo, an adviser on
capital-markets regulation at Greyspark Partners, said in a
telephone interview in London. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs
declined to comment. 
The EU, led by its internal markets commissioner and the
former French foreign minister, Michel Barnier, is in the
process of overhauling laws governing financial firms, including
a review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and
derivatives legislation. The Paris-based European Securities and
Markets Authority was set up earlier this year to harmonize
implementation of the new market rules across the 27 nations. 
The hire comes after the U.K. regulator lost Alan Cathcart,
a senior official who worked on banking stress tests, to HSBC
Holdings Plc. (HSBA) 
EY, JPMorgan 
Thomas Huertas, formerly the head of the U.K. watchdog&#8217;s
international group, is set to start work at accounting firm
Ernst  Young in January. Sally Dewar, the FSA managing director
for risk, resigned last year to join JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) 
The FSA restructured into two divisions to prepare for a
government-mandated handover of lender supervision to the Bank
of England and the creation of the Financial Conduct Authority. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s U.S. arm last year hired Theo Lubke, who
previously headed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s efforts
to reform the private derivatives market.

Morgan Stanley&#8217;s (MS) $4.7 billion real-
estate fund, known as MSREF VII, will probably win approval to
extend the deadline for finding new investments into 2013, a
person familiar with the discussions said. 
Investors in Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund VII have
indicated they will allow the New York-based company to approve
extending by one year the June 2012 deadline in exchange for
lower management fees and a $700 million reduction in its size,
according to the person, who declined to be named because the
talks are private. 
MSREF VII closed fundraising in June 2010, raising less
than half the $10 billion target it had before the financial
crisis after steep declines in previous Morgan Stanley funds and
a falling real-estate market. Morgan Stanley, which manages a
total of $43 billion in real-estate assets, has invested just
$2.5 billion of the $4.7 billion of the fund&#8217;s committed
capital, the person said. 
Final votes on the extension aren&#8217;t due until the end of
this month, the person said. Investors in Fund VII include the
Pennsylvania Public School Employees&#8217; Retirement System, China
Investment Corp. and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. 
The Wall Street Journal reported the discussions about cuts
to fees and the fund&#8217;s size earlier today. Matt Burkhard, a
Morgan Stanley spokesman, declined to comment. 
German Buildings 
MSREF VII has made investments including a portfolio of
retail buildings in Germany and a 150 million euro ($195
million) mezzanine loan for a European luxury hotel owner
controlled by a Blackstone Group LP fund. It also has purchased
a shopping mall in St. Petersburg, Russia, and a set of
distressed real-estate loans in Australia. 
Morgan Stanley recorded about $4.4 billion in real-estate
losses in 2008 and 2009, including losses from its investment in
the MSREF funds. The firm told investors last year that it
expects to lose $5.4 billion of its $8.8 billion MSREF VI
International fund from 2007, a person familiar with the
situation said at the time. 
Last year the firm named John Klopp and Olivier de Poulpiquet co-chief executive officers of its real-estate
investing business to stabilize the unit after billions of
dollars of losses in its funds. 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s real-estate investing business had $43
billion of assets under management as of June 30, with 37
percent in Asia, 36 percent in the Americas and 27 percent in
Europe. MSREF VII invests in property in the U.S. and
internationally. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s own investment in the fund
amounted to less than 10 percent of its total capital.

Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, agreed to acquire about half of the equity in
the beverage business of Saudi Arabia-based Aujan Industries in
what the companies described as a $980 million transaction. 
Coca-Cola will purchase 50 percent of the Aujan entity that
holds the rights to the Rani and Barbican brands and 49 percent
of Aujan&#8217;s bottling and distribution unit, the companies said
today in a statement. The deal, which excludes Aujan&#8217;s Iranian
manufacturing and distribution business, is expected to close in
the first half of 2012, the companies said. 
&#8220;The Middle East is a high-growth region with some of the
highest rates of non-alcoholic ready-to-drink per-capita
consumption,&#8221; Ahmet C. Bozer, Coca-Cola&#8217;s group president for
Eurasia and Africa, said in the statement. &#8220;This transaction
creates a platform for further cooperation between Coca-Cola
Co., Aujan and existing bottling partners across the region.&#8221; 
The deal will give Atlanta-based Coca-Cola a stake in one
of the Middle East&#8217;s leading soft-drink businesses and provide
closely held Aujan with a platform to accelerate the
international growth of brands including Rani and Barbican, the
companies said. Royal Bank of Scotland Plc (RBS) advised Aujan on the
transaction, the beverage company said in a separate statement. 
Aujan, established in 1905 as a commodities trading firm,
is one of the 100 biggest companies in Saudi Arabia, employing
more than 2,500 people. Revenue will exceed $850 million this
year, more than double the figure reached in 2007, Aujan said.
The company also holds the license for Nichols Plc-owned Vimto
in the Middle East via its bottling and distribution unit. 
Antoine Tayyar, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in the Middle
East, and Kent Landers, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in the U.S.,

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the biggest computer services provider, settled a
European Union antitrust probe into conduct that may have
hindered rival mainframe-software makers. 
The European Commission accepted IBM&#8217;s offer to supply
spare parts and technical information to other manufacturers on
reasonable and non-discriminatory terms for five years, the EU
said in an e-mailed statement today. 
&#8220;I am pleased that we could find a swift solution with IBM
to our competition concerns,&#8221; said EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia in the statement. &#8220;Timely interventions are
crucial in fast-moving technology markets.&#8221; 
While IBM has shifted its focus away from hardware toward
its more profitable software and services businesses, the
mainframe operations have high gross margins and help pull in
revenue for other IBM divisions. Armonk, New York-based IBM
began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and 1950s and
is among the few companies selling the systems. 
IBM&#8217;s offer ends a probe that started last year into what
the EU said were &#8220;unreasonable&#8221; supply conditions that may
have restricted or delayed rivals&#8217; access to spare parts. IBM
made the proposal in September. The Brussels-based regulator
also closed a separate probe over IBM&#8217;s mainframe computers
after three competitors dropped complaints. 
&#8220;IBM welcomes this final resolution of the inquiry into
certain IBM mainframe maintenance practices and is pleased that
the commission&#8217;s investigation of the IBM mainframe is now
concluded,&#8221; Joe Hanley, a spokesman for the company in London,
said in an e-mail.

International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services company, won a
contract to build a food-monitoring system in China as the
nation toughens supervision of food safety after scandals. 
The system for Shandong Commercial Group Co. will ensure
the safety of pork products in the coastal province, Harriet Ip,
a spokeswoman in Singapore for Armonk, New York-based IBM, said
in an e-mail today. Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed for the
project, scheduled for completion in 2013. 
The government in China, the world&#8217;s largest pork consumer,
said this month it will revise laws to improve food safety after
one person was sentenced to death and 77 others handed jail
terms over meat harmed by an illegal additive. China has
reported other food safety problems this year including toxic
fish, tainted bean sprouts and Sichuan peppercorns dyed with a
coloring agent. 
&#8220;Food supply-chain management technology and services is a
big market,&#8221; IBM&#8217;s Ip said in the e-mail. &#8220;Demand for food
safety products in China is expected to increase 15 percent per
annum through 2013,&#8221; when the market will reach 13 billion yuan
($2 billion), she said. 
IBM said its project is part of a 195 million yuan cold-
supply chain that Shandong province is building in line with
China&#8217;s efforts to improve food safety. The contract forms a
&#8220;very small portion&#8221; of the project, which will have full
monitoring and tracing capabilities, from farms to warehouses
and retailers, Ip said. 
System Tested 
Shandong Commercial has already tested IBM&#8217;s food-
monitoring system at 6 slaughter houses, 6 warehouses and about
100 hypermarkets or supermarkets across the province, Ip said. 
Pork consumption in China may gain almost 10 percent from
last year to 57 million metric tons in 2015, Wang Yinji, deputy
general manager at COFCO Ltd., the country&#8217;s largest grain
trader, said last month. 
State-owned Shandong Commercial&#8217;s main business interest is
in retail, according to its website. The company also has
operations in the pharmacy and real estate industries and
employs more than 130,000 people, it said.

bond insurer. 
Today&#8217;s move followed Morgan Stanley&#8217;s settling litigation
with MBIA on Dec. 13 over credit-default swaps that led to
billions of dollars of losses. The bank agreed to terminate the
swap contracts and drop its challenge to the insurer&#8217;s
restructuring. 
HSBC Bank USA NA agreed on Dec. 14 to withdraw from two
lawsuits in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan opposing
the MBIA restructuring, becoming the fifth plaintiff to drop out
of the litigation since August. 
Banks including UBS AG and Bank of America Corp. remain
plaintiffs in the suits, according to court filings. The banks
claimed in their suits that the restructuring of Armonk, New

More banks or other companies disputing MBIA&#8217;s
restructuring may drop their lawsuits by the end of the year,
Jay Brown, the bond insurer&#8217;s chief executive officer, said last
month. Banks have discontinued litigation as MBIA negotiates
settlements over the credit-default swaps it sold to the lenders
to protect against losses on mortgage securities and other debt. 
The cases are ABN Amro Bank NV v. MBIA Inc., 601475/2009,
and ABN Amro Bank NV v. Dinallo, 601846/2009, New York State

Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOF), Latin America&#8217;s
largest Coke bottler, sees as much as 2.7 billion pesos ($193.8
million) in cash flow from three acquisitions announced this
year, Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said. 
&#8220;The sum of the three Mexican companies will represent
about 2.5 billion to 2.7 billion pesos in Ebitda in addition to
what Coca-Cola Femsa used to generate before these mergers,&#8221;
Trevino said in a telephone interview today from Queretaro,
Mexico. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is a measure of cash flow known as Ebitda. 
Coca-Cola Femsa bought the beverage division of Mexico&#8217;s
Grupo Fomento Queretano for 6.6 billion pesos ($474 million) and
will pay for the acquisition by issuing new shares, according to
a statement to regulators today. Earlier this week, Coca-Cola
Femsa said its shareholders approved an agreement to buy the
bottling operations of Mexico&#8217;s Grupo Cimsa with new shares, a
transaction announced in September. 
In June, Coca-Cola Femsa agreed to pay 6.55 billion pesos
in stock for the Coke bottling operations of Grupo Tampico SA,
marking the company&#8217;s first all-share transaction. 
The Queretano purchase should be completed by the first
quarter of next year, Trevino said. 
Trevino said he&#8217;s open to seeking out additional mergers or
acquisitions in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America to foster
growth. 
Coca-Cola Femsa reported a 7.1 percent increase in third-
quarter profit as sales volumes increased in Mexico, Colombia
and Argentina. Net income rose to 2.28 billion pesos as revenue
climbed 17 percent to 30.3 billion pesos.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold $1.25
billion of 30-year bonds as yields on the longest-maturity
investment-grade company debt are at about record lows. 
The biggest U.S. bank by assets issued 5.4 percent
debentures that yield 250 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
JPMorgan has raised $4.25 billion by selling 30-year notes, the
most among its peers since issuance of the securities by banks
resumed in October 2010 after a 15-month pause, Bloomberg data
show. 
JPMorgan, the most creditworthy of the six biggest U.S.
lenders in the eyes of derivatives traders, is taking advantage
of yields on investment-grade bonds due in 15 years that average
5.19 percent, after falling from 6.16 percent in February,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. Banks
have sold $323.9 billion of debt in the U.S. this year, with 97
percent coming due within 10 years, Bloomberg data show. 
Yields on the long-maturity debt reached a record low of
5.02 percent on Nov. 1. 
In its last offering of 30-year bonds, New York-based
JPMorgan sold $1.75 billion of 5.6 percent debt that paid 140
basis points, or 1.4 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity Treasuries on July 14. The bank issued $1.25 billion of
5.5 percent, 30-year bonds at a 165 basis-point spread on Oct.
14, 2010. 
Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell to 149 basis points yesterday from 182
basis points on Nov. 25, according to data provider CMA. That
means investors pay $149,000 a year to protect $10 million of
the bank&#8217;s debt for five years. 
Credit Swap Prices 
Contracts on San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) were at
150 while those for Bank of America Corp. (BAC) reached 407. Swaps on
Citigroup Inc. (C) were 276, contracts protecting the debt of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) traded at 322 and those on Morgan
Stanley (MS) were at 426, according to CMA, which is owned by CME
Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline as
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates.

General Maritime Corp. (GMR), the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, won approval of financing
agreements with Oaktree Capital Management LP after changing
terms to address creditors&#8217; objections. 
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Martin Glenn in Manhattan today
approved a $75 million loan from lenders including Nordea Bank
Finland Plc and a $175 million equity investment from Oaktree.
Glenn questioned expense reimbursements and a breakup fee for
Oaktree, a junior secured lender to General Maritime that will
be the lead, or stalking-horse, bidder at an auction to sell the
company. 
&#8220;This has all the hallmarks of a loan-to-own structure,&#8221;
Glenn said. &#8220;Even if the committee is satisfied, I&#8217;m not
necessarily satisfied.&#8221; 
General Maritime negotiated the loan and Oaktree&#8217;s
investment before filing for bankruptcy last month. Kenneth Eckstein, a lawyer for General Maritime, told Glenn today that
under an agreement with creditors, some loan terms were changed
and the New York-based company now has until Jan. 18 instead of
Jan. 4 to file a reorganization plan. 
The official creditors&#8217; committee will get $125,000 to
investigate actions before the bankruptcy, more than the $75,000
previously allotted, and will hire Lowenstein Sandler PC to
handle the probe. 
Auction Planned 
General Maritime still plans to auction itself to the
highest bidder and still has a baseline bid from Oaktree,
Eckstein said. The breakup fee for Oaktree if a higher bidder
wins was reduced to $7.75 million from $12.5 million. 
Some issues connected with the loan still need to be worked
out, such as a provision that gives Oaktree all the equity in
the reorganized company, Eckstein told Glenn. General Maritime
on Nov. 18 won court permission to draw $30 million of the loan. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re still resolving a dispute over equity, and how
unsecured creditors will be treated,&#8221; Eckstein said. 
The creditors&#8217; committee initially argued against the loan,
saying it would give Oaktree all the equity in a reorganized
company while blocking creditors from suing the Los-Angeles
based investment manager over transactions it made with General
Maritime before the bankruptcy filing. 
Supporting Lenders 
Under the restructuring support agreement reached before
the bankruptcy filing, all of General Maritime&#8217;s debt would be
converted into stock in a newly created company, and lenders
would agree to vote in favor of a reorganization plan under
certain terms. Supporting lenders include parties involved in a
$550 million loan made in May of this year and a $372 million
loan made in May 2010, according to court papers. 
General Maritime&#8217;s $300 million in 12 percent notes due in
2017 traded at less than 2 cents on the dollar today, a 66
percent decline from 6 cents on Dec. 8, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The notes traded at about 10 cents when the company
filed for bankruptcy on Nov. 17. 
General Maritime, which operates in more than 230 ports of
call in over 70 countries, filed for bankruptcy in November. It
listed assets of $1.71 billion and debt of $1.41 billion in a
Chapter 11 petition. 
The case is In re General Maritime Corp., 11-15285, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Morgan Stanley (MS), the financial firm
whose shares have declined 45 percent this year, plans to cut
about 1,600 jobs amid an industrywide drop in revenue from
investment banking and trading. 
Reductions will occur in the first quarter of 2012 at all
levels of the firm, Mark Lake, a company spokesman, said in an
interview today. The figure amounts to about 2.6 percent of the
62,648 employees New York-based Morgan Stanley had at the end of
September. 
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman is grappling with
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and concern that U.S. economic growth will
slow, reducing demand for trading and investment-banking
services. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s revenue from those businesses dropped
36 percent in the third quarter from the previous three months,
excluding accounting adjustments. 
The decision to reduce staff comes as &#8220;we conduct our
year-end performance-management process and evaluate the right
size of the franchise for 2012,&#8221; Lake said. 
Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets and
owner of the world&#8217;s largest brokerage, advanced 0.7 percent to
$15.17 at 11:25 a.m. in New York trading. 
Financial firms have disclosed plans to eliminate more than
200,000 jobs globally this year in response to market turmoil,
economic weakness and fallout from Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt
crisis. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank, told
regulators this week it may dismiss 413 employees in New York
City as the firm starts eliminating 4,500 jobs. 
Smith Barney 
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s job reductions won&#8217;t affect financial
advisers in the firm&#8217;s joint venture with New York-based
Citigroup&#8217;s Smith Barney, according to a person familiar with
the plans. Morgan Stanley previously said it would eliminate at
least 300 low-producing brokers, and the number of advisers fell
by 828 in the 12 months ended Sept. 30. 
The cuts in fixed-income trading will come primarily from
businesses such as securitization that the firm is looking to
shrink as it faces new capital rules, said the person, who
declined to be named because the details haven&#8217;t been made
public. The firm won&#8217;t eliminate a significant number of jobs in
the interest-rate and foreign-exchange trading businesses that
it expanded in 2009 and 2010, the person said. 
Equities trading will likely be less affected by the cuts
than other areas, the person said. Revenue from that business,
excluding accounting adjustments, jumped 29 percent in the first
nine months of this year, the most of any major U.S. firm. 
Return on Equity 
Gorman said in October that he wasn&#8217;t wedded to the current
size of the company and would make necessary cuts if the
slowdown in the capital markets was prolonged. Morgan Stanley
had a 6 percent return on average common equity in the first
nine months of the year, below Gorman&#8217;s goal of &#8220;mid-teens.&#8221; 
Morgan Stanley said in a June presentation it had begun a
three-year cost-saving project that sought to eliminate $1
billion from annual expenses. The firm increased that target to
$1.4 billion in October. 
Revenue from investment banking and trading at the 10
largest global firms fell 12 percent in the first nine months of
this year, after a 23 percent decline in 2010, according to
industry consultant Coalition Ltd.

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
and most profitable U.S. bank, named Michael Cleary to a new
position running the retail unit&#8217;s digital, online and mobile
strategy. 
&#8220;Customers&#8217; use of Internet and mobile banking has
skyrocketed,&#8221; Todd Maclin, the chief executive officer of
JPMorgan&#8217;s retail unit, said in an internal memo to employees
today. &#8220;In fact, three quarters of our customers actively use
chase.com and active mobile households have more than doubled
since the first quarter of 2010.&#8221; 
Cleary, who previously ran small-business lending, will
handle the retail bank&#8217;s Internet and mobile teams, according to
the memo. He will work with Paul Heller, head of the corporate
Internet group; Jack Stephenson, who runs mobile e-commerce; and
Guy Chiarello, who supervises technology across the company.
Maclin cited Cleary&#8217;s expansion of business banking in growth
markets such as California, Florida and Texas. 
Scott Geller, chief risk officer for New York-based
JPMorgan&#8217;s commercial bank, will replace Cleary in overseeing
lending to companies with less than $20 million in annual
revenue. A successor for Geller is being sought, Maclin wrote.
The retail bank lends money to businesses with less than $20
million in annual revenue while the commercial bank lends money
to middle-market companies with revenue of $20 million to about
$2 billion. 
Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for JPMorgan, confirmed the
contents of the memo.

Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, has settled almost half of the lawsuits over its
menopause drugs and increased the funds set aside to resolve the
cases, the company said in a regulatory filing. 
Pfizer and its Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have
resolved about 46 percent of suits that claimed the companies&#8217;
hormone-replacement medicines, including Prempro and Premarin,
caused breast cancer, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. Pfizer said it added $68 million to the
$772 million it already reserved for the cases. 
&#8220;We have recorded a charge of $260 million in the first
nine months of 2011 that provides for the minimum expected costs
to resolve all the remaining hormone-replacement actions,&#8221;
Pfizer officials said in the Nov. 10 filing. 
More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. 
Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Wyeth&#8217;s
Premarin, an estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera,
made by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. Pfizer, based in
New York, acquired Wyeth in 2009. 
10,000 Claims 
At the height of the litigation, Pfizer faced more than
10,000 claims that its menopause drugs caused breast cancer,
according to lawyers for former users. Those lawsuits included
more than 8,000 cases consolidated in federal court in Arkansas
and suits in state courts in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Minnesota. 
Pfizer in May disclosed the $772 million reserve and said
it had resolved a third of the cases, or about 3,300. The
November filing indicates Pfizer officials have now settled
almost 5,000 of the suits. 
&#8220;Pfizer continues to have a strong record of success in
defending these cases,&#8221; Chris Loder, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;While we will continue to look for
opportunities to enter into favorable settlements where
appropriate, we will also continue to vigorously defend these
medicines in litigation.&#8221; 
Jury Verdicts 
Wyeth and Upjohn have now lost 10 of the 18 Prempro cases
decided by juries since 2006. Pfizer got some of those verdicts
thrown out or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the
verdicts through settlements, while other decisions are on
appeal. Pfizer also has had cases thrown out before trial. 
Earlier this month, a Philadelphia jury ordered the Pfizer
units to pay $72.6 million in compensatory damages to three
women who blamed the drugs for their breast cancers. Pfizer
agreed to settle the case before jurors were asked to decide
whether the company should face punitive damages. Terms of the
settlements weren&#8217;t released. 
The $260 million Pfizer has reserved for the remaining
Prempro cases is only &#8220;an estimate&#8221; and &#8220;additional charges
may be required,&#8221; the company said in the Nov. 10 filing. 
Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer representing women suing Pfizer
over the menopause drugs, said that reserve doesn&#8217;t provide
enough compensation to spur settlements of outstanding claims. 
&#8220;Based upon the size of the jury verdicts to date, and the
fact that multiple appellate courts have now affirmed some of
those verdicts, this new amount of money set aside by Pfizer
seems grossly insufficient to resolve the remaining claims,&#8221;
Littlepage said in an e-mailed statement. 
The consolidated case in Arkansas is In Re Prempro
Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Arkansas (Little Rock).

billion ($29 billion) Wheatstone project. 
Chevron&#8217;s Vos-1 well found 453 feet (138 meters) of gas in

ConocoPhillips and Inpex Corp. are among energy companies

Chevron decided earlier this year to go forward with
Wheatstone, targeting first LNG shipments to Asia in 2016. The

A Brazilian lawsuit that seeks to
halt Transocean Ltd. (RIG) and Chevron Corp. (CVX) operations after an oil
spill would reduce the country&#8217;s offshore drilling at a time
when it wants to double output in ten years. 
Federal prosecutors in Campos, in the oil region of Rio de
Janeiro state, are suing both companies for 20 billion reais
($10.6 billion) in environmental and social damages and asked a
court to suspend their operations, according to a statement
yesterday. Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, and 
Transocean, based in Vernier, Switzerland, said they haven&#8217;t 
been notified and are cooperating with authorities. 
The case imperils Brazil&#8217;s plan to boost crude output
because Transocean operates 10 out of the 61 rigs working in the
country and it would be hard to replace them in a tight market
for oil equipment, said Judson Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies 
Co Inc. Brazilian oil production growth has slowed after the
country increased safety requirements following the spill at BP
Plc&#8217;s Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year. 
&#8220;The rig market is pretty tight, so if Transocean were
banned, the oil companies wouldn&#8217;t be happy at all,&#8221; Bailey
said in a phone interview from Houston. &#8220;Chevron and Petrobras
can&#8217;t get a rig elsewhere, so it messes with the state-owned oil
company.&#8221; 
Chevron, Brazil&#8217;s third-largest producer behind state-
controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc,
will see production wane in Brazil until the government lets it
drill again, said Cleveland Jones, an oil specialist and
professor at Rio de Janeiro State University. 
&#8216;Opening Shot&#8217; 
Chevron fell 3 percent to $100.53 at the close in New York
yesterday. Transocean declined 3.9 percent to $40.19. 
Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
3,000 barrels of oil leaked last month from an oil field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin. The company underestimated the
amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude
leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the
head of Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20. 
BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to the
April 2010 blowout of the Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico.
The accident killed 11 workers aboard Transocean&#8217;s Deepwater
Horizon well and spilled 4.9 million barrels of crude. That&#8217;s
about $8,163 per barrel spilled, compared to $3.57 million per
barrel if the Brazilian fine were to hold. 
Still Operating 
&#8220;Ultimately this is an opening shot, Chevron&#8217;s attorneys
are probably not at all fazed by this,&#8221; said Jones. &#8220;The
prosecutor&#8217;s office will be a positive development for Chevron,
because they will ensure that the letter of the law is followed
and the letter of the law is reasonable.&#8221; 
Chevron said in an e-mailed statement that it &#8220;responded
responsibly to the incident at its Frade Field and has dealt
transparently with all Brazilian authorities.&#8221; Guy Cantwell, a
Transocean spokesman, said the company&#8217;s rigs are operating in
Brazilian waters and the company continues to cooperate with the
government. 
Chevron holds a 51.74 percent stake in Frade. Petrobras
holds a 30 percent stake, and Frade Japao Petroleo Ltda., a
joint venture including Inpex Corp. and Sojitz Corp, holds 18.26
percent. Frade is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of
Rio de Janeiro in the Campos Basin and produced 76,000 barrels a
day of oil and natural gas in October. 
Criminal Lawsuit 
In the next few weeks, prosecutors will probably file a
criminal lawsuit against Chevron for alleged environmental crime,
said Romulo Sampaio, a law professor at Brazil&#8217;s Getulio Vargas
Foundation. 
&#8220;In this case, everything conspires against the company:
it&#8217;s a foreign company, drilling for oil in Brazilian waters.
That may bring about emotional responses,&#8221; Sampaio, who
coordinates the university&#8217;s Environmental Law program, said in
a telephone interview. 
Prosecutors&#8217; track record in lawsuits against companies
involving environmental issues has been at best mixed. Federal
prosecutors twice this year sought to halt construction of the
Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon, and on both
occasions federal judges ruled that the project should proceed. 
Federal prosecutors in 2009 convinced Brazilian cattle
ranchers in Para, the state that has lost the most forestland to
illegal logging, to halt Amazon forest destruction and replant
trees to avoid an international ban on meat after prosecutors
took action. 
Brazil&#8217;s five largest meatpackers -- JBS SA, the world&#8217;s
largest beef producer, Marfrig Alimentos SA, Bertin SA, Minerva
SA and Frigol Comercial Ltda. -- agreed to stop buying cattle
from suppliers that contributed to stripping the Amazon forest. 
A lawsuit against Alcoa Inc. is still pending after six
years of legal haggling. Federal and state prosecutors sued
Alcoa&#8217;s Brazilian mining subsidiary in 2005 in an effort to
block construction of the Juruti bauxite mine in the state of
Para, saying the company had circumvented the law by not
applying for a federal permit and instead seeking a license from
the state of Para.

A bondholder group said it may seek
reimbursements from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) for soured home-loan
securities, after Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay $8.5
billion to resolve similar claims this year. 
Investors holding $95 billion of mortgage bonds instructed
the trustees for the debt to investigate whether JPMorgan
included ineligible loans in the securities, according to a
statement released today by Gibbs  Bruns LLP, which says it
represents the group. The law firm helped secure the settlement
with Bank of America in June. 
&#8220;Our clients continue to seek a comprehensive solution to
the problems of ineligible mortgages,&#8221; Kathy Patrick, a partner
at Gibbs  Bruns, said in the statement. &#8220;Today&#8217;s action is
another step toward achieving that goal.&#8221; 
JPMorgan, based in New York, is a defendant in more than
10,000 legal proceedings, the company said in its third-quarter
report. Demands from private investors over mortgage bonds have
been &#8220;limited,&#8221; the bank said. 
Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. 
The bondholders asked Bank of New York Mellon Corp., U.S.
Bank NA, Wells Fargo  Co., Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc
to open investigations into the pools debt issued by affiliates
of JPMorgan, today&#8217;s statement said. 
Bank of America&#8217;s proposed $8.5 billion settlement would
resolve claims from investors in Countrywide Financial Corp.
mortgage bonds. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
acquired Countrywide in 2008. 
The settlement has drawn criticism from insurer American
International Group Inc. (AIG) and other investors. New York Attorney
General Eric Schneiderman and Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden have also intervened in the case, which is pending in
federal court. The bondholder group has defended the settlement
saying in a court filing that rejection of the deal would be
&#8220;devastating&#8221; for investors.

Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist
at JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in New York, said he doesn&#8217;t expect the
Federal Reserve to undertake new asset purchases next year
unless Europe&#8217;s situation deteriorates or inflation falls too
quickly. 
&#8220;So far, the European crisis has had a limited impact on
the U.S.,&#8221; he said in an interview today with Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;But you never know with Europe. We are as
concerned as anyone.&#8221; 
&#8220;For Europe, I think we are just getting started in terms
of the slowdown,&#8221; Feroli said. &#8220;Whether we see more QE,&#8221; or
quantitative easing, &#8220;I&#8217;m not convinced. Right now, the growth
picture is not bad enough for the Fed to do more asset
purchases.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), deemed by
derivatives traders to be the most creditworthy of the six
biggest U.S. banks, locked in the lowest interest rate its
industry has seen since 2005 on 30-year debt. 
The biggest U.S. bank by assets sold $1.25 billion of 5.4
percent debentures yesterday to yield 250 basis points, or 2.5
percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the only other U.S.-based bank to have issued 30-year debt
in 2011, sold $2.5 billion of 6.25 percent bonds at a 170 basis-
point spread on Jan. 21. 
JPMorgan is pushing out the maturities of its debt as
yields on investment-grade corporate bonds due in 15 years or
more approach the lowest on record while the Federal Reserve
holds down interest rates to stimulate the economy. The New
York-based bank has raised $4.25 billion by selling 30-year debt
since issuance of the securities by banks resumed in October
2010 after a 15-month pause, Bloomberg data show. 
&#8220;JPMorgan is one of the few in the market now that can
issue these bonds, and a big reason is investors think they&#8217;re
one of the best banks out there,&#8221; Rob Crimmins, a New York-
based money manager at RS Investment Management Co., which
oversees $30 billion. &#8220;In this environment, there aren&#8217;t many
banks that would be able to sell 30-year bonds.&#8221; 
Justin Perras, a spokesman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment on the sale. 
Lowest Coupon 
JPMorgan wasn&#8217;t among nine large banks including Bank of
America Corp. (BAC), Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG downgraded
yesterday by Fitch Ratings, which found they are &#8220;particularly
sensitive to the increased challenges the financial markets
face,&#8221; according to a statement. 
The debt sold yesterday has the lowest coupon among 30-year
U.S. bank bonds since San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
issued $750 million of 5.375 percent debt at an 80 basis-point
spread in January 2005, Bloomberg data show. The securities
climbed 1.36 cents to 101.2 cents on the dollar to pay a 245
basis-point spread as of 10:53 a.m. in New York, according to
Trace, the bond price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. 
In its previous offering of 30-year bonds, JPMorgan sold
$1.75 billion of 5.6 percent debt that paid 140 basis points, or
1.4 percentage points, more than similar-maturity Treasuries on
July 14. The bank issued $1.25 billion of 5.5 percent, 30-year
bonds at a 165 basis-point spread on Oct. 14, 2010, the first
sale since Citigroup Inc. (C) issued $2.5 billion of the debt in
July 2009, Bloomberg data show. 
Average Maturity 
JPMorgan&#8217;s offerings extended the average maturity of its
outstanding bonds to 6.5 years at the end of the third quarter
from 5.66 years in the first quarter of 2010, Bloomberg data
show. The bank&#8217;s average coupon fell to 5.01 percent from 5.19
percent. It has sold the most 30-year debt among its peers since
October 2010. 
HSBC Holdings Plc based in London and Utrecht, Netherlands-
based Rabobank Nederland NV also issued debentures of that
maturity this year. 
Banks have sold $323.9 billion of debt in the U.S. this
year, with more than 97 percent coming due within 10 years,
Bloomberg data show. 
The extra yield investors demand to own U.S. bank bonds
instead of Treasuries has risen to 395 basis points from 210
basis points since the end of 2010, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data. Spreads touched 403 on Nov. 29, the
widest since July 2009. 
Yields on investment-grade bonds due in 15 years or more
averaged 5.21 percent yesterday, after falling from 6.16 percent
in February, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. They touched 5.02 percent, the lowest in daily data
extending to October 1986, on Nov. 1. 
&#8216;Good Value&#8217; 
Spreads have widened on financial company bonds as concern
among investors mounted that Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis
would spread, imperiling the global economy. That has made
JPMorgan and other U.S. banks more attractive to fixed-income
investors, said Anthony Valeri, a market strategist at LPL
Financial, which manages $330 billion. 
&#8220;Financials in general and certainly the stronger ones are
good value in this market,&#8221; Valeri said in a telephone
interview from San Diego. &#8220;We don&#8217;t think the bank sector&#8217;s
going to implode. We think exposure to Europe is manageable for
U.S. banks, and therefore this risk premium is significantly
large right now to where it offers an opportunity.&#8221; 
Credit-default swaps on JPMorgan, which investors use to
hedge against losses on the company&#8217;s debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, fell to 145.9 basis points yesterday from 182
basis points on Nov. 25, according to data provider CMA. That
means investors pay $145,900 a year to protect $10 million of
the bank&#8217;s debt for five years. 
Other Bank Swaps 
Contracts on Wells Fargo were at 146.2 while those for Bank
of America reached 402.5. Swaps on Citigroup were 274.7,
contracts protecting the debt of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) traded
at 313.4 and those on Morgan Stanley (MS) were at 416.6, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market. 
Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt.
The contracts, which investors use to hedge against losses on
corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness, decline as
investor confidence improves and rise as it deteriorates. 
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service assigns JPMorgan a rating of Aa3,
its highest grade on any of the six biggest U.S. banks. Fitch
holds a rank of AA- on it and Wells Fargo. Standard  Poor&#8217;s
ranks Wells Fargo A+ and JPMorgan A. 
&#8216;Trust Management&#8217; 
JPMorgan&#8217;s ratio of tangible common equity to tangible
assets, a measure of its ability to absorb losses, is the lowest
among the six biggest U.S. banks at 5.49, Bloomberg data show.
Jim Leonard, a Chicago-based credit analyst at Morningstar Inc.,
cited the ratio when downgrading the lender to A from A+,
calling the level &#8220;a cause for some concern&#8221; in a note
yesterday. 
Investors buying JPMorgan&#8217;s bonds are looking past any
financial weaknesses and giving it credit for Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon&#8217;s performance in the wake of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s 2008 bankruptcy, when the firm avoided losses,
Leonard said. 
&#8220;Their credit metrics are OK, but not stellar,&#8221; Leonard
said in a telephone interview. &#8220;What is stellar is their
reputation and their performance during the credit crisis. When
you think about the credit quality of banks, at some point you
have to trust management knows what it&#8217;s doing.&#8221;

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, told a German court that Android-based
smartphones and tablets from Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.
infringe its European patents. 
Microsoft claimed in the first of three cases heard
yesterday that software Motorola Mobility uses protected
technology that helps computers switch between languages in the
same program. Presiding Judge Peter Guntz in Munich said the
patent may have been drafted so narrowly that its language may
not cover the solution Motorola Mobility uses. 
It was the first time the two U.S. companies faced each
other in a German court in the patent dispute. The country has
become a center for European smartphone and tablet lawsuits with
Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung Electronics Co. are involved in similar
cases in Mannheim and Munich. 
A suit between Microsoft and Motorola Mobility in the U.S.
is pending before the International Trade Commission in
Washington where a judge is scheduled to release his findings
tomorrow. Microsoft sued Motorola Mobility in Munich, while
Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google Inc., filed
several suits against Microsoft in Mannheim. 
An offer by the court to mediate settlement talks was
rebuffed by both parties yesterday. While the companies have
talked, not much progress has been made since their last meeting
in October, Motorola Mobility attorney Marcus Grosch said. 
&#8220;The German cases are just a fraction of all the
litigation. The bulk of suits is pending in the U.S.,&#8221; said
Peter Hess, a lawyer for Microsoft. &#8220;Motorola Mobility cannot
settle as long as Google hasn&#8217;t gained control, so talks here
don&#8217;t make much sense.&#8221; 
Google said Aug. 15 it would buy Libertyville, Illinois-
based Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion to obtain patents that
may be used to fend off suits targeting handsets and tablet
computers that use Android. 
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, makes its own
mobile-operating system, Windows Phone 7, which competes with
Android. 
In a second hearing yesterday, Microsoft argued that
Android-based devices illicitly use its technology for sending
short messages with an unlimited number of characters. Motorola
Mobility, which denies wrongdoing, argues Android&#8217;s uses a two-
step procedure, whereas Microsoft&#8217;s patent protects a one-step
solution. The third case concerned technology used for intents
notifications. 
The court scheduled separate hearings for each case in
March and April. 
Yesterday&#8217;s cases are: LG Muenchen, 7 O 7019333/11,
7019334/11 and 70020429/11. 
Cephalon, Acusphere Claim Celgene&#8217;s Abraxane Infringes Patent 
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA)&#8217;s Cephalon unit and
Acusphere Inc. (ACUS) sued Celgene Corp. for patent infringement
related to the breast cancer drug Abraxane. 
The lawsuit claims Celgene&#8217;s Abraxane violates an Acusphere
patent for a drug formulation of paclitaxel particles, according
to the complaint filed Dec. 14 in federal court in Boston.
Abraxane&#8217;s active ingredient is the compound paclitaxel. 
The injected drug, used to treat metastatic breast cancer,
was obtained by Summit, New Jersey-based Celgene as part of its
purchase of Abraxis BioScience Inc. in 2010. The drug generated
$282 million in sales in the first nine months of this year,
according to the company&#8217;s quarterly reports. 
Cephalon, acquired in October by Petah Tikva, Israel-based
Teva, is the exclusive licensee of Watertown, Massachusetts-
based Acusphere&#8217;s patent. The companies are seeking cash
compensation and an order to block further use of the invention. 
The case is Cephalon Inc. v. Celgene Corp. (CELG), 11cv12226, U.S.
District Court for the District of Massachusetts (Boston). 
DuPont, Honeywell Said to Face EU Car-Refrigerant Probe 
DuPont Co. (DD), the largest U.S. chemicals company by market
value, and Honeywell International Inc. (HON) face a European Union
antitrust probe over a refrigerant for car air-conditioning
systems, according to four people familiar with the plan. 
The European Commission will soon open a formal
investigation to examine whether DuPont and Honeywell may have
concealed their ownership of patents for the refrigerant before
the car industry agreed to use the technology as a standard,
said the people who couldn&#8217;t be identified because the issue
isn&#8217;t yet public. 
Honeywell and DuPont are expecting growth from the
technology they jointly developed to meet EU environmental rules
to cut greenhouse gases from air-conditioning systems. DuPont
told investors this week that the low-emission refrigerant
promises &#8220;nice growth and some healthy margins.&#8221; Honeywell&#8217;s
specialty chemicals division has said it expects coolants to
help it make &#8220;extremely solid&#8221; profits. 
EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said earlier
this month he planned to open &#8220;a high-profile case on
standards&#8221; to follow an investigation into standards in the
banking industry 
DuPont &#8220;will continue to cooperate fully with this inquiry
and is confident that the commission will conclude that actions
taken by DuPont complied with applicable laws,&#8221; said Janet
Smith, a spokeswoman for the Wilmington, Delaware-based company. 
Honeywell is confident that its &#8220;practices are consistent
with the law and that the commission will conclude that we acted
in full compliance with European Union competition rules,&#8221;
Peter Dalpe, a spokesman for the Morristown, New Jersey-based
company said in an e-mail. 
The refrigerant developed by Honeywell and DuPont was
designed to replace ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons, which
can&#8217;t be included in new cars sold in the 27-nation EU from
2017. 
Honeywell and DuPont agreed last year on a joint venture to
produce the refrigerant from the fourth quarter this year. 
The Brussels-based antitrust authority can fine companies
as much as 10 percent of yearly sales or require them to change
the way they do business if it concludes that they harmed
competition.

Yahoo May Win Case Over U.K. Soccer Data, EU Court Aide Says 
Yahoo! Inc. may win a bid to access annual schedules of the
English and Scottish soccer leagues, an adviser at the European
Union&#8217;s highest court said. 
Soccer leagues can&#8217;t claim copyright protection for match
schedules, Paolo Mengozzi of the EU Court of Justice said in a
non-binding opinion yesterday. The creation of soccer fixture
lists is a &#8220;data creation activity&#8221; and not an &#8220;original
intellectual creation.&#8221; The Luxembourg-based EU court follows
this advice in a majority of cases. 
&#8220;The effort expended in the creation of the data cannot be
taken into consideration for the purposes of assessing the
eligibility for protection of the database as such,&#8221; Mengozzi
said in his opinion. 
Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, and a number of
betting companies who want to access the information, are at
loggerheads with the soccer leagues over whether their lists&#8217;
data is protected by copyright. While Yahoo&#8217;s U.K. unit argued
the data isn&#8217;t protected and can be published without payment,
the English and Scottish leagues said they own the rights to the
data on the annual fixture lists and can charge for its use. 
A London court in 2010 ruled the data is protected by
copyright under the EU&#8217;s database law. The case is now pending
at the Court of Appeal in London, which last year referred the
case to the EU court for guidance. 
Any ruling by the EU Court of Justice, which usually
follows within six months of the opinion, will be binding. 
&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that the Advocate General shares our
opinion that there are no intellectual property rights in
football fixtures,&#8221; Yahoo said in an e-mailed statement. 
Football DataCo, which is responsible for the Premier
League and Football League fixture lists, declined to comment. 
The case is C-604/10, Football DataCo Limited, Football
Association Premier League Ltd, Football League Limited,
Scottish Premier League Limited, Scottish Football League, PA
Sport UK Limited v. Yahoo UK Limited, Stan James (Abingdon)
Limited, Stan James Plc, Enetpulse APS. 
Red Bull Loses EU Court Ruling Over Dutch Trademark Breach 
Red Bull GmbH, an Austrian energy-drink maker, lost a
challenge at the European Union&#8217;s highest court over an alleged
breach of its trademark by a Dutch company. 
&#8220;A service consisting of the mere filling of cans bearing
a sign protected as a trademark is not use of that sign which is
liable to be prohibited,&#8221; the EU Court of Justice, the region&#8217;s
top court, said in a ruling in Luxembourg yesterday. 
Red Bull, based in Fuschl am See, Austria, sued Dutch
company Frisdranken Industrie Winters BV after it filled up cans
bearing logos and texts such as &#8220;Bullfigter,&#8221; and &#8220;Red Horn&#8221;
with drinks for another company, called Smart Drinks. Red Bull,
whose logo is a red bull, argued its Benelux trademark rights
had been infringed. 
Frisdranken didn&#8217;t use the protected trademark and couldn&#8217;t
have infringed it, the court said. 
&#8220;The service provided by Winters consists of the filling
of cans and this service does not have any similarity with the
product for which Red Bull&#8217;s trademarks were registered,&#8221; said
the EU court. 
Tina Deutner, a spokeswoman for Red Bull, declined to
comment. 
The case is pending at the Dutch Supreme Court, which last
year sought the EU court&#8217;s guidance whether a company that fills
up cans provided by another company, can breach trademark
rights. 
The case is C-119/10, Frisdranken Industrie Winters BV v.
Red Bull GmbH.

Ex-Judiciary Committee Staffers Lobbying House on SOPA 
Sixteen former staff members of the U.S. House of
Representatives Judiciary Committee are presently lobbying
Congress with reference to the Stop Online Piracy Act, the
Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group reported. 
Eight ex-staffers of the committee are lobbying in support
of the bill, representing such organizations as the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce, the Motion Picture Association of America and the
Recording Industry Association of America, according to Sunlight
Foundation, a Washington-based non-profit group aimed at
governmental transparency. 
The group also found eight different ex-staffers lobbying
against the bill, representing organizations that include Google
Inc. (GOOG), the Digital Media Association and Microsoft Corp. 
Hollywood-Backed Bill on Web Piracy Debated as Amendments Added 
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Lamar Smith urged U.S.
lawmakers to approve Hollywood-backed legislation aimed at
stopping Internet piracy of movies and goods that Google Inc.
opposes as promoting censorship. 
Smith&#8217;s panel was debating 60 proposed amendments to the
Stop Online Piracy Act yesterday before deciding whether to send
the measure to the full House for consideration. Lawmakers on
the panel raised concerns that a provision on blocking websites
may damage the security of the Internet&#8217;s domain-name system and
requested a delay to hear technical testimony. 
Lobbying by the entertainment and Internet industries
intensified ahead of yesterday&#8217;s hearing. Movie studios,
including Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc., want a crackdown on
non-U.S. websites that sell illegally copied films and TV shows.
Web companies say the House measure would harm innovation. 
&#8220;Laws equip U.S. authorities and rights-holders to take
action against criminals who operate within our borders,&#8221;
Smith, a Republican from Texas, said in an opening statement at
the hearing. &#8220;But there is no parallel authority that permits
effective action against criminals who operate from abroad.&#8221; 
The bill would let the Justice Department ask courts to
order Internet-service providers, search engines, payment
services and advertising networks to block or cease business
with non-U.S. websites trafficking in stolen content or
counterfeit goods. 
Sixteen Internet executives, including Google co-founder
Sergey Brin, PayPal Inc. co-founder Elon Musk, and EBay Inc.
founder Pierre Omidyar, published an open letter to Congress in
major newspapers yesterday saying the House and Senate bills
would give the U.S. government power to censor the Web. 
Google, Facebook Inc. and other Internet companies rallied
around an alternative draft bill from Senator Ron Wyden, an
Oregon Democrat, and Representative Darrell Issa, a California
Republican, which would make the U.S. International Trade
Commission the arbiter of complaints about non-U.S. websites
linked to piracy. 
The proposal from Wyden and Issa &#8220;fails to provide an
effective way to target foreign rogue websites and goes easy on
online piracy and counterfeiting,&#8221; Michael O&#8217;Leary, senior
executive vice president for global policy and external affairs
at the Motion Picture Association of America, said in a
statement last week.

IP Moves 
Openwave Appoints Mendez, Robbins to Run IP Portfolio Business 
Openwave Systems Inc. (OPWV), a provider of Internet-based

The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission appealed a federal judge&#8217;s decision to reject its
proposed $285 million settlement with Citigroup Inc. (C) 
The appeal, filed yesterday in the U.S. Court of Appeals in
New York, challenged U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff&#8217;s rejection
last month of the settlement, which involved claims that
Citigroup misled investors in a $1 billion financial product
linked to risky mortgages. 
&#8220;We believe the district court committed legal error by
announcing a new and unprecedented standard that inadvertently
harms investors by depriving them of substantial, certain and
immediate benefits,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert Khuzami
said yesterday in a statement. 
Rakoff criticized the agency&#8217;s practice of resolving cases
without requiring the subject of the allegations to admit
wrongdoing. In his ruling, Rakoff said the settlement didn&#8217;t
provide him with &#8220;any proven or admitted facts&#8221; to inform his
judgment. 
Khuzami said the judge&#8217;s decision &#8220;is at odds with decades
of court decisions that have upheld similar settlements.&#8221;.
Rakoff&#8217;s approach &#8220;could in practical terms press the SEC to
trial in many more instances, likely resulting in fewer cases
overall and less money being returned to investors,&#8221; he said in
the statement. 
The SEC said a settlement such as the one struck with
Citigroup &#8220;puts money back in the pockets of harmed investors
without years of courtroom delay and without the twin risks of
losing at trial or winning but recovering less than the
settlement amount -- risks that always exist no matter how
strong the evidence.&#8221; 
Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, said the
New York-based bank disagrees with the court&#8217;s rejection of the

Lawsuits/Pretrial 
Chevron Oil Spill Spurs Lawsuit to Freeze 17% of Brazil&#8217;s Rigs 
The Brazilian prosecutor who filed a lawsuit against
Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) said he&#8217;s seeking a
&#8220;permanent&#8221; ban on the companies&#8217; operations in the South
American nation after an oil spill last month. 
The lawsuit has been assigned to a federal judge and there
is no timeline yet for a possible ruling, Eduardo Santos, the
federal prosecutor in Campos, in Rio de Janeiro state, told
reporters yesterday. Santos, who is suing Chevron and Transocean
for 20 billion reais ($10.8 billion), said previous fines in the
millions of reais against other companies haven&#8217;t been enough in
preventing such accidents. 
&#8220;Brazil has to change the paradigm from millions to
billions,&#8221; Santos said 
The case imperils Brazil&#8217;s plan to boost crude output
because Transocean operates 10 of the 61 rigs working in the
country and it would be hard to replace them in a tight market
for oil equipment, said Judson Bailey, an analyst at Jefferies 
Co. Brazilian oil production growth has slowed after the country
increased safety requirements following the spill at BP Plc&#8217;s
Macondo well in the Gulf of Mexico last year. 
&#8220;The rig market is pretty tight, so if Transocean were
banned, the oil companies wouldn&#8217;t be happy at all,&#8221; Bailey
said in a phone interview from Houston. &#8220;Chevron and Petrobras (PETR4)
can&#8217;t get a rig elsewhere, so it messes with the state-owned oil
company.&#8221; 
Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, and Transocean,
based in Vernier, Switzerland, said Dec. 14 that they haven&#8217;t
been notified and are cooperating with authorities. 
Chevron has come under increased scrutiny in Brazil after
3,000 barrels of oil leaked last month from an oil field in deep
waters of the Campos Basin. The company underestimated the
amount of pressure at an oil deposit it was exploring, and crude
leaked from the reservoir for about eight days, George Buck, the
head of Chevron for Brazil, said on Nov. 20. 
In the next few weeks, prosecutors will probably file a
criminal lawsuit against Chevron for alleged environmental
crime, said Romulo Sampaio, a law professor at Brazil&#8217;s Getulio Vargas Foundation.

Allen Stanford Amnesia Claim &#8216;Not Credible,&#8217; Prosecutors Say 
R. Allen Stanford may be faking amnesia and should be tried
in January as scheduled on charges he led a $7 billion
investment fraud, prosecutors said, citing a prison medical
evaluation. 
Stanford&#8217;s scores on medical and neuropsychological tests
&#8220;were sufficiently low as to evidence that he either was not
trying or was faking,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Costa
said, citing a doctor&#8217;s report. The prosecutor, in the proposed
court order filed yesterday, asked U.S. District Judge David
Hittner in Houston to find Stanford competent to stand trial. 
A doctor who evaluated the defendant at a federal prison in
Butner, North Carolina, &#8220;concluded that Stanford&#8217;s performance
indicated that he was &#8216;blatantly simulating cognitive
defects/known to be malingering,&#8217;&#8221; Costa said. 
Stanford, 61, has been imprisoned as a flight risk since
his June 2009 indictment on charges of defrauding investors
through a scheme built on allegedly bogus certificates of
deposit at Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. 
Hittner delayed the trial, which had been set for last
January, after three doctors testified that Stanford was
incapable of assisting in his defense. They said Stanford had
become addicted to anxiety drugs prescribed in prison and could
be suffering lingering effects of a head injury suffered in a
2009 inmate assault. 
Ali Fazel, Stanford&#8217;s lead criminal-defense attorney, urged
Hittner in a separate court filing to reject the Butner medical
evaluation and continue delaying Stanford&#8217;s trial. Fazel asked
the judge to rely on the testimony of experts Stanford&#8217;s defense
team plans to present at a competency hearing next week in
Houston. 
Prosecutors claim Stanford skimmed more than $1 billion of
investor funds to finance a lavish lifestyle that included a
fleet of jets and yachts, several mansions and a private
Caribbean island, as well as financial support for women with
whom he has had children. 
The case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-342, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston).

Ex-Cuomo Aide Said to Be Among Possible Foreclosure Monitors 
A former aide to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is among
candidates being considered to ensure that banks including
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) comply with any
settlement of a nationwide foreclosure probe, a person familiar
with the matter said. 
Steven M. Cohen, who was the governor&#8217;s secretary, is one
potential foreclosure monitor, according to the person, who
declined to be identified because the negotiations are secret.
That person said North Carolina Commissioner of Banks Joseph A.
Smith Jr. is also a candidate, as did a second person who asked
not to be identified. 
Selection of a monitor is one of the final issues to be
worked out between the banks and state and federal officials,
said the people. Selection of the monitor is a key issue for the
regulators because success of the agreement will largely depend
on his or her work, one of the people said. 
Another candidate is Nicolas P. Retsinas, a former
assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, one of the people said. 
All 50 states last year said they were investigating bank
foreclosure practices following disclosures that the companies
were using faulty documents in seizing homes. State and federal
officials leading the talks are seeking an agreement that
provides mortgage relief to homeowners and sets standards for
foreclosure practices. 
The monitor would ensure compliance with any agreement with
mortgage servicers, according to a settlement proposal offered
to the banks in March. In addition to JPMorgan and Bank of
America, Citigroup Inc., Ally Financial Inc. and Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) are participating in the negotiations. 
Cohen declined to comment on whether he was a candidate for
the monitor post. Smith declined to comment on any nomination to
monitor the foreclosure agreement. Retsinas didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment on the monitor position.

BP, TNK Billionaires Seek to Defeat Oil-Company Theft Claims 
BP Plc and its billionaire partners in Russian oil venture
TNK-BP asked a New York judge to throw out claims against them
seeking more than $1 billion in damages over the alleged theft
of an oil company. 
The lawsuit by Norex Petroleum Ltd. stems from more than a
decade of litigation in Russia and the U.S. over Yugraneft,
which owns an oil field in Western Siberia. Norex claims its
controlling stake in Yugraneft was stolen through corruption and
armed force and that BP and its partners profited off the scheme
at Norex&#8217;s expense. 
BP and the other defendants in the lawsuit, including
billionaires Leonard Blavatnik and Victor Vekselberg, asked New
York State Supreme Court Justice Eileen Bransten in Manhattan
yesterday to dismiss the complaint. Norex has fought in Russian
and U.S. courts over Yugraneft and lost, they argue. 
&#8220;Norex cannot use this court as an appellate court to
overturn prior litigation decisions and outcomes,&#8221; said Owen
Pell, an attorney at White  Case LLP who argued for dismissal.
&#8220;They litigated all these issues in Russia.&#8221; 
Norex says that in 2001, militiamen wearing fatigues and
armed with AK-47 assault rifles, forcibly entered Yugraneft&#8217;s
corporate offices, telling employees that TNK had assumed
ownership of the company, according to the Norex complaint. The
men were acting at the direction of Blavatnik, Vekselberg and
Alfa Group, Norex said. 
&#8220;The assertions in Norex&#8217;s lawsuit are not only untrue,
they are simply a tired rehash of the same preposterous claims
they have been recycling for the past 12 years in both U.S. and
Russian courts,&#8221; Mike Sitrick, a spokesman for Blavatnik, said
in an e-mailed statement. Previous lawsuits have been dismissed,
and &#8220;we are confident plaintiff&#8217;s latest attempt will suffer
the same fate,&#8221; he said. 
Representatives of TNK-BP (TNBP) and Alfa Group couldn&#8217;t be
reached for comment. 
The case is Norex Petroleum Ltd. v. Blavatnik,
650591-2011, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan).

Trials 
Ex-Primary Global Executive Fleishman Seeks Home Detention 
James Fleishman, the former Primary Global Research LLC
executive convicted of conspiracy as part of a U.S. crackdown on
insider trading of consultants and fund managers, asked for a
sentence of 12 months&#8217; home detention. 
Fleishman, 42, of Santa Clara, California, is to be
sentenced Dec. 21 by U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff in
Manhattan. He asked for detention rather than prison in a court
filing Dec. 14 by his lawyer, Ethan A. Balogh 
&#8220;Mr. Fleishman does not present as a rogue employee,
secretly stealing his employer&#8217;s property for personal gain at
the expense of his employer, but instead as a man who worked for
essentially what became a rogue enterprise in which a legitimate
business model was structured in a way that misappropriation of
third-party information was likely to occur,&#8221; Balogh said in
court papers. 
Company management &#8220;sought to shield itself from
liability&#8221; when employees or consultants passed confidential
information, the attorney wrote. 
Fleishman was convicted in September of two conspiracy
charges for a scheme to obtain and pass confidential information
from technology company employees moonlighting as consultants
for Mountain View, California-based Primary Global, a so-called
expert-networking firm. 
Fleishman faces as long as 20 years in prison on the most
serious count, according to prosecutors. 
The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-cr-32, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan).

Verdicts/Settlements 
Chinese Drywall Maker to Pay $800 Million to Settle Suits 
Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin Co., a Chinese drywall maker,
agreed to pay at least $800 million to settle homeowner claims
that faulty building materials contaminated their homes with
corrosive sulfur fumes, plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers said. 
Knauf agreed to resolve claims involving about 4,500
properties that contain the tainted drywall, lawyers for
property owners said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
Homeowners said the faulty wallboard emits gases that corrode
copper coils and electrical and plumbing equipment. 
&#8220;KPT has agreed to provide thousands of families the
opportunity to recover losses caused by KPT drywall,&#8221; Russ
Herman, a New Orleans-based lawyer representing property owners,
said in the statement. 
The accord was announced yesterday before U.S. District
Judge Eldon Fallon in New Orleans, who is overseeing about
12,000 suits filed over the contaminated drywall that have been
consolidated for pretrial evidence gathering. KPT is a
subsidiary of Iphofen, Germany-based Knauf International, owned
by Knauf Group. 
The $800 million figure &#8220;is wildly speculative and
premature given the settlement terms,&#8221; Greg Wallance, a KPT
lawyer, said yesterday at a press conference. &#8220;We are confident
the figure will be considerably lower.&#8221; 
The agreement didn&#8217;t contain a minimum or maximum number on
the cost of repairing homes with the faulty drywall, Steven
Glickstein, another company lawyer, said in a telephone
interview. 
The amount of the settlement will range from $800 million
to $1 billion, depending on the number of homeowners who can
prove they had KPT drywall, Herman said yesterday at a press
conference. 
KPT payments won&#8217;t reach that level, Wallance said. Many
plaintiffs don&#8217;t have KPT drywall in their homes and actual
costs for remediation &#8220;will be controlled through a competitive
bidding process,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those who select a cash option
will receive a discounted settlement value.&#8221;

Products Liability Litigation, 2:09-md-02047, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans).

Madoff&#8217;s Former Controller to Plead Guilty, U.S. Tells Court 
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s ex-controller, Enrica Cotellessa-Pitz, is
expected to plead guilty to criminal charges stemming from her
former boss&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, the U.S. said in a court filing. 
Cotellessa-Pitz, who hasn&#8217;t been charged yet, will admit to
falsifying documents to aid Madoff&#8217;s fraud and to deceiving U.S.
regulators, as part of a cooperation agreement with the
government, assistant U.S. attorneys Lisa Baroni and Julian
Moore told a federal judge in a letter yesterday. 
Cotellessa-Pitz will plead guilty to four counts of
conspiracy, falsifying books and records of a broker-dealer,
falsifying books and records of an investment adviser and making
false filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
the prosecutors said. The charges carry as long as 50 years in
prison, according to the letter to U.S District Judge Laura
Taylor Swain. 
Madoff, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges, is serving 150
years in prison for the largest Ponzi scheme in U.S. history.
Investors lost about $20 billion in principal, the U.S. trustee
liquidating Madoff&#8217;s securities business has said. 
David Rody, a lawyer for Cotellessa-Pitz, didn&#8217;t respond to
voice-mail and e-mail messages seeking comment on the letter. 
The criminal case is U.S. v. O&#8217;Hara, No. 10-CR-228, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
bankruptcy claim is Picard v. Cotellessa-Pitz, 10-4213, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Bayer&#8217;s $750 Million Modified-Rice Settlement Now Binding 
A Bayer AG (BAYN) unit said a $750 million settlement with U.S.
rice farmers who sued after their crops became tainted by a
genetically modified strain is binding now that the requisite
number of growers has accepted the deal. 
First announced in July, the agreement ended scores of
cases filed against Bayer CropScience by growers in Arkansas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and Texas. 
&#8220;A sufficient number of now-verified registrations for the
settlement program have been filed by growers to represent 85
percent of U.S. long-grain rice acreage, a threshold point
established for the agreements to become binding,&#8221; Bayer
CropScience said yesterday in a statement. 
Bayer CropScience and a Louisiana State University facility
in Crowley were testing a strain of the rice for resistance to
Bayer&#8217;s Liberty-brand herbicide. 
The genetically modified variety cross-bred with and
&#8220;contaminated&#8221; more than 30 percent of U.S. rice lands, Don
Downing, lawyer for the farmers, said at the first trial in
November 2009. 
U.S. exports fell as the European Union, Japan, Russia and
other overseas buying ceased or was slowed for testing of U.S.-
grown long-grain rice, growers alleged. 
Bayer CropScience denied the testing program was
negligently managed and claimed sale prices rebounded after the
initial drop. The unit of Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer AG
said the trace amounts of the LibertyLink rice posed no threat
to people. 
The case is In re Genetically Modified Rice Litigation, 06-
md-01811, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Missouri (St.
Louis).

Pfizer Settled About Half of Prempro Cases, Adds to Reserve 
Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, has settled
almost half of the lawsuits over its menopause drugs and
increased the funds set aside to resolve the cases, the company
said in a regulatory filing. 
Pfizer and its Wyeth and Pharmacia  Upjohn units have
resolved about 46 percent of suits that claimed the companies&#8217;
hormone-replacement medicines, including Prempro and Premarin,
caused breast cancer, according to the Securities and Exchange
Commission filing. Pfizer said it added $68 million to the $772
million it already reserved for the cases. 
&#8220;We have recorded a charge of $260 million in the first
nine months of 2011 that provides for the minimum expected costs
to resolve all the remaining hormone-replacement actions,&#8221;
Pfizer officials said in the Nov. 10 filing. 
More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms including hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
exceeded $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. 
&#8220;Pfizer continues to have a strong record of success in
defending these cases,&#8221; Chris Loder, a company spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;While we will continue to look for
opportunities to enter into favorable settlements where
appropriate, we will also continue to vigorously defend these
medicines in litigation.&#8221; 
Zoe Littlepage, a lawyer representing women suing Pfizer
over the menopause drugs, said that reserve doesn&#8217;t provide
enough compensation to spur settlements of outstanding claims. 
&#8220;Based upon the size of the jury verdicts to date, and the
fact that multiple appellate courts have now affirmed some of
those verdicts, this new amount of money set aside by Pfizer
seems grossly insufficient to resolve the remaining claims,&#8221;
Littlepage said in an e-mailed statement.

Products, 03-CV-015070-WRW, U.S. District Court, Eastern

ArcelorMittal (MT), Anglo Win Case Overturning Sishen Right Award 
ArcelorMittal South Africa Ltd. (ACL) and Anglo American Plc (AAL) unit
Kumba Iron Ore won a bid to overturn the award of a right over
the country&#8217;s largest iron-ore mine to a company whose owners
include a business partner of President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s son. 
The High Court set aside the award of a 21.4 percent permit
to the Sishen mine to Imperial Crown Trading 289 (Pty) Ltd.,
whose owners include Jagdish Parekh, a business partner of
Duduzane Zuma. The right was previously held by ArcelorMittal
South Africa, a unit of the world&#8217;s biggest steelmaker. Its
stock surged the most in 11 months in Johannesburg. 
Sishen Iron Ore Co., owned by Kumba and Exxaro Resources
Ltd. (EXX), holds 100 percent of the right to the operation and the
21.4 percent portion was never available for conversion, Judge
Raymond Zondo said in the Pretoria court yesterday. 
&#8220;We are delighted that the judgment has confirmed that
Sishen Iron Ore is the only holder of the mining rights over
Sishen and that no other person including Imperial holds or may
be granted competing rights,&#8221; Kumba said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;With regards to the interpretation of the Mineral
and Petroleum Resources Development Act, we need to await the
full judgment and the reasons for the court&#8217;s decision.&#8221; 
Zondo&#8217;s full ruling will be available on Dec. 20, he said. 
ArcelorMittal South Africa is &#8220;pleased about the ruling,&#8221;
spokesman Themba Hlengani said in an interview. &#8220;It confirms
our long-held view Kumba applied for and was granted 100 percent
of the right in the first instance.&#8221; 
The Vanderbijlpark-based steelmaker&#8217;s Sishen right lapsed
after it failed to apply for a license by April 30, 2009, to
satisfy a change in legislation. 
Imperial will appeal the ruling &#8220;early in the new year,&#8221;
Ronnie Mendelow, the company&#8217;s lawyer, said in Pretoria. 
The Department of Mineral Resources, which opposed the
action, will await the full judgment on the ruling before
commenting and will take legal advice on how to proceed further,
it said in an e-mailed statement.

&#8216;Greedy&#8217; Insider Trader Jailed for Using Hedge-Fund Tips 
A London management consultant was sentenced to two years
in prison after being convicted of making about 500,000 pounds
($774,000) using confidential tips from a hedge-fund trader. 
Jurors found Rupinder Sidhu guilty on 22 of 23 insider-
dealing charges yesterday, said Chris Hamilton, a spokesman for
the U.K. Financial Services Authority, which filed the case. A
separate charge of money laundering wasn&#8217;t considered. 
&#8220;You are greedy,&#8221; Judge Michael Gledhill told Sidhu
yesterday. &#8220;Sheer greed is behind all these offenses.&#8221; 
Sidhu, 40, used information from AKO Capital LLP trader
Anjam Ahmad about the hedge fund&#8217;s trading plans to spread bet
on companies including Julius Baer Group Ltd. (BAER), Swatch Group (UHR) AG
and Michael Page International Plc (MPI) between June and August 2009,
prosecutors said. He is the eighth person sentenced to prison
for insider trading in a case brought by the FSA. 
Sidhu denied all the charges, claiming he didn&#8217;t know Ahmad
was passing on inside information. In a June 2010 trial, Ahmad
was given a suspended jail sentence of 10 months, 300 hours of
community service and fined 50,000 pounds after pleading guilty
to insider trading.

Sam Hurd&#8217;s arrest on a federal
charge of conspiracy to distribute cocaine will cause months of
public-relations headaches for the National Football League
without driving fans away from the most-watched sport in the
U.S., analysts said. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re not turning off the TV, they&#8217;re not shying away
from fantasy sports and they&#8217;re not giving up gambling on games
because of this,&#8221; David Carter, executive director of the
Sports Business Institute at the University of Southern
California&#8217;s Marshall School of Business, said in a telephone
interview yesterday. 
Hurd, a 26-year-old wide receiver for the Chicago Bears,
was charged in a criminal complaint filed yesterday in Dallas
with one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to
distribute 500 grams or more of a cocaine mixture. If convicted,
Hurd faces a minimum of five years and a maximum of 40 years in
federal prison. 
The NFL has more than $9 billion in annual revenue and the
charge against Hurd rivals other issues the league has faced,
such as dog fighting, shootings and performance-enhancing drug
use, Carter said. 
&#8220;This is not going to go away,&#8221; Carter said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going
to be an ongoing issue because they&#8217;re going to have to wait for
the legal process to play out and something like this would
appear to be pretty high profile, coming from a big market and a
guy who&#8217;s been in the league for several years.&#8221;

JPMorgan Chase  Co. named Gerry Murray to run its North America leveraged-finance business,
which includes capital markets, restructuring and origination of
high-yield bonds and leveraged loans 
The global investment-grade businesses for both loans and
bond originations will be led by Thomas Cassin and Huw Richards,
according to an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. Justin
Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan, confirmed the
moves. Richards will relocate to New York from London. 
JPMorgan, the largest and most profitable U.S. bank,

Murray has been with the bank for more than 17 years and
was part of the original high-yield team, according to Perras. 
JPMorgan leads underwriters in high-yield and high-grade
debt this year and is the largest syndicated-loan underwriter,
with a 20.1 percent market share, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. 
Leveraged loans and high-yield bonds are those rated below

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s push into cloud
computing will help the company compete with Google Inc. (GOOG), Apple
Inc. (AAPL) and Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM) It also will hurt profit margins. 
The company&#8217;s cloud software lets corporate customers pay a
subscription to do things like manage spreadsheets and corporate
websites with software stored and run on Microsoft&#8217;s servers.
The new services also help users view TV shows and edit photos
on the Web. 
While that may be great news for customers, the cost of
storing software in Microsoft&#8217;s own data centers, combined with
other expenses, means the company may miss profit estimates for
fiscal 2012, said Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. It also means the good old days of outsized margins
for the software giant may be a thing of the past, said Jason Maynard, an analyst at Wells Fargo (WFC) Securities. 
&#8220;Nothing will ever be as high as the old model,&#8221; said
Maynard, who&#8217;s based in San Francisco. 
Profit margins, which shrank to a 22-year low in 2011, are
set to fall further. Gross margins, or the percentage of sales
left after production costs, will narrow 1.6 points to 76
percent in fiscal 2012, the average estimate of analysts
compiled by Bloomberg. That&#8217;s after a 2.4-point drop in 2011. 
The challenge to Microsoft&#8217;s margins stems from decisions
Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has made in recent years
to invest in new businesses, such as adding content for Xbox and
acquiring Skype Technologies SA for $8.5 billion. 
Rising Costs 
The pressure will persist beyond this year as more
customers switch to cloud computing, which involves hosting
software on Microsoft&#8217;s servers and delivered it over the
Internet. That shifts the cost of storing and operating those
programs to Microsoft. 
Microsoft traditionally sold packaged software that, once
developed, costs little to manufacture and distribute. In moving
more business to the cloud, the world&#8217;s largest software maker
must take on the costs of running data centers. These expenses
include powering, cooling, housing and maintaining servers that
run the programs for clients. 
Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.,
estimates that cloud-related costs will range from 15 percent to
25 percent of revenue. That&#8217;s about 10 percent more than selling
standard packaged software, he said. 
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Bellini said analysts may not be taking
into account a large enough increase in cost of goods sold for
the fiscal year ending in June, which could cause Microsoft to
miss profit predictions. Even Bellini, who lowered her
projection for gross margins and trimmed 9 cents from her
overall profit estimate, said she may not have cut enough. 
Microsoft declined to comment for this story. 
Growth Challenges 
Margin pressure is making some investors leery of Microsoft
stock, and may weigh on the shares in coming months, said Walter
Price, who manages the $3 billion Allianz RCM Technology Fund at
RCM Capital Management in San Francisco. 
The shares, which gained 1.7 percent to $26 on Dec. 16,
have declined 6.8 percent this year before today. 
Microsoft was already facing a challenging year for profit
growth. The European debt crisis and a sluggish economic
recovery have prompted government and financial customers to
pare spending, while the PC industry is reeling from flooding in
Thailand that has slashed production of hard drives. 
Companies will boost spending on software and computers at
a slower rate next year than 2011, according to Gartner Inc.,
which said it may cut its forecast even further at the end of
the quarter. Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), the largest computer maker,
last month said it&#8217;s started to see businesses curb spending. 
Xbox Content Fees 
Microsoft&#8217;s product cycles also point to a year of slower
growth in its flagship Windows and Office software businesses,
according to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc.
The two divisions will expand more slowly this year as customers
wait for an update to the Windows operating system, which
Sherlund expects in October. Microsoft is likely to follow that
with a touch-enabled version of Office productivity software, he
said. 
At the same time, costs are rising across businesses.
Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox game consoles, which are selling well, are more
expensive to manufacture than software, and the company is
paying more licensing fees for content to run on the Xbox Live
service. 
The addition of Skype, increased demand for consulting
services in the server business, and costs of Microsoft&#8217;s search
partnership with Yahoo! Inc. are also adding to the jump in
expenses. 
Need for Scale 
Including the impact of Skype, operating expenses for the
year will be as much as $29.2 billion, up from a previous
forecast of $28.6 billion, Microsoft said in October. 
Reining in cloud computing costs will be key, and that will
depend on how efficient Microsoft can become at running its
massive data centers. The company will need to attract large
numbers of cloud customers to get the services running at scale.
And it will have to remain vigilant on data-center energy and
cooling costs, said Sanford C. Bernstein&#8217;s Moerdler. 
&#8220;They should be able to be pretty efficient and they
should be able to generate net more revenue so the margin will
go down, but earnings per share will go up,&#8221; he said. That&#8217;s in
line with Microsoft&#8217;s own forecasts since starting its move to
the cloud.

Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) won a ruling that
Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.&#8217;s Android phones violate one of
its smartphone patents, while failing to convince a judge that
six others are being infringed as well. 
Motorola Mobility, which is being acquired by Google Inc. (GOOG),
violated a patent for generating meeting requests and group
scheduling, U.S. International Trade Commission Judge Theodore Essex said in a notice today. The finding is the second in two
days from the ITC that has determined that some features of
phones running Google&#8217;s Android operating system are using
licensed technology without permission. 
&#8220;As Samsung, HTC, Acer and other companies have
recognized, respecting others&#8217; intellectual property through
licensing is the right path forward,&#8221; said David Howard, deputy
general counsel for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft. 
The ruling falls short of the broader claims originally
sought by Microsoft, which has said its inventions are being
widely used in Android phones. Motorola Mobility General Counsel
Scott Offer said the majority of the ruling is favorable to the
handset maker and may provide clarity on what Microsoft owns to
avoid potential infringement. 
&#8220;They&#8217;re talking about removing that feature from the
product very quickly to avoid infringement, but I&#8217;m not sure how
easy that is,&#8221; said David Mixon, a patent lawyer at Bradley
Arant Boult Cummings LLP in Huntsville, Alabama, who&#8217;s followed
the case. &#8220;Being found to infringe is never a good thing.&#8221; 
Settlement Is &#8216;Best&#8217; 
&#8220;Settlement is always the best way,&#8221; Mixon said. &#8220;At the
end of everything, this is still a business dispute and business
disputes are almost always settled with money.&#8221; 
The patent is among those that cover a Microsoft program
called ActiveSync, which is broadly licensed through the
industry, including to Apple (AAPL) Inc. and Google. 
The judge&#8217;s finding are subject to review by the six-member
commission, which can ban imports of products that infringe U.S.
patents. Google said it had no comment on the case. 
The Motorola Mobility ruling follows a loss yesterday for
HTC Corp. (2498), which was defending itself from claims that its
Android phones were using technology from Cupertino, California-
based Apple without permission. Taoyuan, Taiwan-based HTC said
yesterday it would be able to work around data-detection
technology that had been found to infringe. 
Microsoft also has a case against Barnes  Noble Inc. (BKS),
whose Nook e-reader runs Android. 
Smartphone Experience 
Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, has sought
to block U.S. sales of Motorola Mobility&#8217;s Android-based
devices, including Xoom tablets and the Atrix, Droid 2, Droid X,
Cliq XT, Devour, Backflip, Charm and Cliq smartphones. 
Microsoft had claimed the Motorola Mobility products
infringed seven patents that are &#8220;essential to the smartphone
user experience.&#8221; They include a patent issued in 1998 for a
system that lets people select file names without being limited
to 11 characters; one issued in 2005 for a technique to update a
contact database; and a patent issued in 2010 covering a way to
know the device&#8217;s signal or battery strength. 
The patent found to be infringed was issued in 2002 for a
way to generate meeting requests among a group. 
Microsoft filed the Motorola Mobility complaint in 2010
after the Libertyville, Illinois-based handset maker refused to
pay royalties. 
Xbox Case 
In a court hearing in Munich last week over German patent-
infringement claims brought by Microsoft, a Motorola Mobility
lawyer, Marcus Grosch, said the companies haven&#8217;t made much
progress on a possible settlement since a meeting in October. A
Microsoft lawyer, Peter Hess, told the court that any settlement
would have to wait until Google completes its $12.5 billion
acquisition of Motorola Mobility. 
Google, based in Mountain View, California, has said one
reason for buying Motorola Mobility was to obtain patents that
could be used as a bulwark against a surge of lawsuits targeting
handsets and tablet computers that use Android. 
Motorola Mobility has its own patent claims against
Microsoft in the U.S. and in Europe. A case at the ITC targets
the Xbox video-gaming system. Judge Essex, who is overseeing
that case, is scheduled to release his findings on Jan. 23,
according to the ITC&#8217;s website. 
&#8220;Microsoft continues to infringe Motorola Mobility&#8217;s
substantial patent portfolio,&#8221; the handset maker said in its
statement today. &#8220;Motorola Mobility remains confident in its
position and will continue to move forward with its
complaints.&#8221; 
Barnes  Noble 
A trial in Microsoft&#8217;s case against Barnes  Noble is
scheduled before Essex in February and involves different
patents. New York-based Barnes  Noble, the largest U.S.
bookstore chain, has accused Microsoft of misusing its patents
to obtain royalties on Android devices, and has asked the U.S.
Justice Department to investigate whether Microsoft is trying to
drive up the cost of Android to push out competition. 
Microsoft&#8217;s case against Motorola Mobility is In the Matter
of Certain Mobile Devices, Associated Software and Components
Thereof, 337-744, while Motorola Mobility&#8217;s case against
Microsoft is In the matter of Gaming and Entertainment Consoles,
337-752, both U.S. International Trade Commission (Washington).

General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP), the
second-biggest U.S. mall owner, said its board approved the
spinoff of its Rouse Properties Inc. subsidiary, to consist of
30 regional shopping centers in 19 states. 
The separation will be completed through a pro rata taxable
dividend on Jan. 12, to stockholders of record as of the close
of U.S. exchanges on Dec. 30, Chicago-based General Growth said
today in a statement. 
Under the plan, General Growth stockholders will receive
about 0.0375 shares of Rouse Properties common stock, the real
estate investment trust said. Rouse should have about 35.5
million common shares following the spinoff. 
General Growth, which left bankruptcy protection last year,
has been refinancing debt and selling properties, including
Boston&#8217;s Faneuil Hall Marketplace, to boost growth. The REIT,
second to Simon Property Group Inc. (SPG) in size, has stakes in 167
malls in 42 states totaling 169 million square feet (15.7 square
meters). 
If conditions of the spinoff are not satisfied by the
distribution date, General Growth will instead pay a special
cash dividend on Jan. 17 to stockholders of record as of Dec.
30, according to the statement.

Chevron Corp. (CVX), the operator of the
Brazilian offshore well that triggered oil leaks, and rig owner
Transocean Ltd. (RIG) will defend executives threatened with criminal
indictments in the South American nation. 
Chevron learned that Brazil&#8217;s federal police intend to
indict employees involved in the drilling that led to the Nov. 7
leaks from seafloor fissures near the $3.6 billion Frade
development, Kurt Glaubitz, a spokesman for the San Ramon,
California-based company, said in a statement late yesterday.
Transocean, in a separate statement late yesterday, said it will
&#8220;vigorously defend the company and its collaborators.&#8221; 
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. energy company by market
value, has been fined 50 million reais ($26.9 million) and
ordered to halt all drilling and crude production off Brazil&#8217;s
coast after discovering the leaks last month. Chevron estimated
the volume of the seeps at 3,000 barrels during the eight days
it took for the company to locate and halt the leaks. 
Chevron and other offshore oil explorers are facing
increased scrutiny of their drilling practices in the wake of BP
Plc&#8217;s 2010 blowout of a well in the Gulf of Mexico that killed
11 workers and led to the worst U.S. offshore crude spill. 
In Brazil, the concerns have been compounded as the coastal
city Rio de Janeiro prepares to host the 2014 World Cup and the
Olympic Games two years later. Chevron&#8217;s Frade oil field is
about 230 miles (370 kilometers) northeast of Rio in a region of
the Atlantic Ocean known as the Campos Basin. 
Employees Indicted 
Chevron underestimated the amount of pressure at an oil
deposit it was exploring, and crude leaked from the reservoir
for about eight days, George Buck, president of Chevron&#8217;s
Brazilian subsidiary, said on Nov. 20. Buck was among 17 Chevron
and Transocean employees targeted for indictments, the Folha de
S. Paulo newspaper reported yesterday. Glaubitz declined to
identify the employees targeted for indictment. George wasn&#8217;t
available to comment, the spokesman said. 
Anthony Dovkants, a spokesman for Vernier, Switzerland-
based Transocean, said in an e-mailed statement that the
allegations were without merit. 
Chevron rose 0.8 percent to $106.31 at the close as oil
prices climbed above $100 a barrel in New York. Transocean rose
0.4 percent to $40.04. 
BP has booked more than $40 billion in losses related to
last year&#8217;s Gulf disaster that sank Transocean&#8217;s Deepwater
Horizon rig and spilled an estimated 4.9 million barrels of
crude. The London-based oil producer also faces hundreds of
lawsuits by fishermen, hoteliers and property owners in coastal
areas where crude washed ashore. 
Other Oil Spills 
ConocoPhillips, the third-largest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday it&#8217;s taking responsibility for two oil spills in
China&#8217;s Bohai Bay in June and is setting up compensation funds
to support environmental research and affected communities. 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company, shut
its 200,000 barrel-a-day Bonga field off Nigeria after a leak
during a tanker loading caused what may be the country&#8217;s worst
offshore spill in more than a decade. The Bonga deep-water
discovery produces almost 10 percent of Nigeria&#8217;s crude. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) of Irving, Texas, is the biggest U.S.
energy company by market value.

Brazil&#8217;s threatened indictment of
Chevron Corp. (CVX) and Transocean Ltd. (RIG) executives after offshore oil
leaks shows that regulators from the North Sea to the Indian
Ocean are stepping up scrutiny after BP Plc&#8217;s 2010 disaster. 
Brazilian authorities have said they may prosecute
employees, shut operations and exact more than $10 billion in
fines after the leaks at the Frade field 230 miles (370
kilometers) off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The spill occurred
19 months after an explosion in the Gulf of Mexico killed 11
workers and triggered the biggest offshore U.S. oil spill. 
Governments around the world are paying closer attention to
how energy explorers drill into high-pressure deposits of crude
and natural gas as much as 8 miles beneath the sea surface.
Chevron&#8217;s Brazil incident took place after a ConocoPhillips (COP) leak
in China and prior to what may be Nigeria&#8217;s biggest spill in a
decade at a Royal Dutch Shell Plc facility. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s been just such a rash of them that governments
have got to act tough&#8221; with oil companies, Allen Brooks, a
managing director at energy-investment bank PPHB LP in Houston
and Chevron shareholder, said in a phone interview. Since the BP
accident &#8220;every spill after that is heightened in terms of
media attention and obviously government concern.&#8221;

A Morgan Stanley (MS) real estate fund
relinquished its 80 percent stake in European mall developer
Multi Corp. BV as part of an 850 million-euro ($1.11 billion)
debt restructuring this week, two people with knowledge of the
agreement said. 
NIBC Bank NV led a group of 11 lenders that took over
Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund V International&#8217;s holding in a
deal that was completed Dec. 20, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information is private. 
As part of the accord, the Morgan Stanley fund gained a
stake of more than 10 percent in the Forum Turkey Fund, which
owns seven malls in the country, the people said. Canada Pension
Plan Investment Board previously held 27 percent of Forum Turkey
Fund and Multi owned the rest. 
Multi spokesman Mark Cunningham declined to comment, as did
Morgan Stanley spokesman Tom Walton. 
The banks agreed in September to back Multi Chairman Hans van Veggel and the company&#8217;s senior management. Together the
executives hold the remaining shares in the Gouda, Netherlands-
based company, which owns, manages and develops malls in 14
European countries. 
Morgan Stanley may recover its losses in Multi through the
stake in Forum Turkey Fund, which plans to get real estate
investment trust status in Turkey and sell shares in an initial
public offering in Istanbul in coming years. 
Morgan Stanley was part of the group that acquired Dutch
publicly traded real estate developer AM Development BV in early
2006. 
AM Development was split in two, with the Morgan Stanley
fund backing the separate international mall development
business led by van Veggel and his management team. That became
Multi, while AM Development remained a separate company
specializing in residential and office projects. 
Multi reduced its debt in October after raising about 300
million euros from the sale of two malls in the Czech Republic
to a venture between Meyer Bergman BV and Healthcare of Ontario
Pension Plan.

backed by government donors and aims to boost research and
access to HIV treatments in poor countries, the FT said.

World War II&#8217;s Battle for Cassino
leveled the Italian town and its hilltop abbey. Now, the 33,000
residents are digging out from the rubble left by Wall Street. 
Six decades after U.S.-led forces ousted the Nazis from
Cassino, a new generation is grappling with the fallout from the
debts of postwar rebuilding -- borrowings that grew because of a
derivative that backfired. Soaring costs forced Cassino, 80
miles southeast of Rome, to settle an interest-rate swap with
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) in 2009, leaving the town unable to pay for
daycare for 60 infants and services for the poor. 
For Iris Volante, who chairs Cassino&#8217;s assembly finance
committee, the bankers who share responsibility for peddling the
derivatives should pay with their jobs. She, like Occupy Wall
Street protesters around the world, is demanding an overhaul of
the financial system to stop history from repeating itself. 
&#8220;Heads rolling is the least we would expect,&#8221; Volante, a
57-year-old gynecologist who also has worked for the city for
more than a decade, said in an interview in a Cassino cafe
earlier this month. &#8220;When people&#8217;s attitude is to cheat others,
new rules are needed to prevent it happening again.&#8221; 
Cassino, whose government office overlooks a U.S. tank and
other war relics in the town&#8217;s central square, plans to cut
funding for its daycare center and may ask families to pay
several hundred euros a month per child after running out of
other cost-cutting measures, said Volante. The town already has
reduced staff to about 250 employees from about 450 by not
replacing those who left or retired, she said. 
Milan Trial 
While the New York-based bank led by Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon has no retail branches in Italy, it didn&#8217;t
hesitate to sell complex swaps to municipalities over the past
decade. In Milan, JPMorgan and its employees are on trial, along
with Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Germany&#8217;s Depfa Bank Plc
and Switzerland&#8217;s UBS AG, for allegedly tricking the city into
buying the contracts in 2005. The banks deny any wrongdoing. 
Across Italy, cities faced with shrinking income and rising
expenses bought swaps from JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by
assets, and other lenders to cut short-term interest costs,
putting them at risk of paying more in the long run. Cassino
purchased a 22 million-euro ($28.7 million) contract from New
York-based Bear Stearns Cos., acquired by JPMorgan in 2008,
which switched interest payments on the town&#8217;s debt from a fixed
rate to a variable one. The rate, a record low at the time the
contract was signed in 2003, soared over subsequent years. 
About 300 municipalities, from the toe of Italy&#8217;s boot to
the Alps, were losing a total of 912 million euros on such
derivatives as of March, Bank of Italy data show. 
Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment. 
Jefferson County 
Local governments and regulators in Germany and the U.S.
also have brought cases against banks, including JPMorgan, over
derivatives contracts. 
The German city of Pforzheim sued JPMorgan a year ago over
56 million euros of losses on interest-rate swaps. A hearing at
the Frankfurt Regional Court is scheduled for Jan. 16. Marchiony
declined to comment on the case. 
In the U.S., JPMorgan was investigated by the Justice
Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and attorneys
general in 25 states for its role in rigging the bids of
investment contracts. The bank agreed to a $228 million
settlement this year on charges that it conspired to overcharge
cities at taxpayer expense, acknowledging responsibility for
illegal, anticompetitive conduct by former employees. 
In 2009, JPMorgan entered a $722 million accord with the
SEC to end an investigation into its role in selling derivatives
that helped push Jefferson County, Alabama, to declare the
biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. The bank paid $75
million in fines and restitution and wrote off $647 million it
was owed by the county. 
Interest-Rate Swaps 
The sales happened before Dimon took over as CEO in 2006.
In September 2008, the bank said it would stop marketing
interest-rate swaps to municipalities. 
Banks globally sold $707.6 trillion of over-the-counter
derivatives as of June 30, about 18 percent more than the $601
trillion at the end of 2010, according to data published by the
Bank for International Settlements last month. Counterparties
would have to pay $19.5 trillion to replace the contracts at
market rates, the data show. 
Interest-rate swaps account for more than three-quarters of
the total, BIS data show. The Basel, Switzerland-based group
doesn&#8217;t break out what percentage is bought by municipalities. 
JPMorgan was the largest global dealer of interest-rate
derivatives among U.S. banks in the third quarter, according to
data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The
bank had $75.4 trillion in notional derivatives within its
JPMorgan Chase Bank NA subsidiary, of which 77 percent, or about
$58.1 trillion, were interest-rate contracts, the data show. 
&#8216;Without Thinking&#8217; 
Dimon, 55, led the charge in the U.S. against new banking
regulation, criticizing Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
in June for saddling lenders with too many proposed rules. The
rules, to be overseen by the Fed, are meant to avert future
financial crises and banking abuses. 
&#8220;Banks pitched deals without thinking about the well-being
of others and created lots of financial problems for many
towns,&#8221; said Carmelo Palombo, a former Cassino official who
helped negotiate the settlement with JPMorgan. The agreement
stopped the city from losing even more money, said Palombo,
without providing details. 
Secret Settlement 
A 2001 Italian law said local authorities could buy swaps
only if the transactions would improve municipal finances. Italy
banned governments from signing new derivatives contracts in
mid-2008, and the Senate finance committee approved
recommendations in March 2010 that would prevent towns that
aren&#8217;t provincial capitals and have fewer than 100,000 residents
from using derivatives. Those rules are still pending. 
Cassino sought to keep the settlement terms secret, citing
a confidentiality clause in its agreement with JPMorgan. An
administrative court in Latina, Italy, in September backed a
case brought by Bloomberg News under Italian freedom of
information law asking the town to make the swaps contract and
settlement public. 
The city plans to comply with the court order, said Enzo
Salera, Cassino&#8217;s finance chief. 
In Milan, Dimon&#8217;s bankers say they played by the book,
adhering to rules that allow swaps dealers to withhold details,
including how much they&#8217;re charging their customers. Hidden
charges on derivatives contracts are what Milan prosecutor
Alfredo Robledo says made them fraudulent. 
Robledo says banks charged 101 million euros in fees in
selling the derivatives that adjusted payments on the city&#8217;s 1.7
billion-euro bond offering in 2005 and in later restructurings. 
Gross Margin 
&#8220;Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, &#8216;How does the bank make money?&#8217;&#8221; Antonia Creanza, an executive director at JPMorgan in London said in
court Sept. 21 under questioning by her lawyer. &#8220;I would
explain that we would retain a margin. Never has a legal adviser
told me, &#8216;Look you need to detail the gross margin.&#8217;&#8221; 
Banks seek to earn a gross margin when they agree to a swap
with a client by skewing the terms to their advantage, Creanza,
42, a member of the bank&#8217;s interest-rate team at the time of the
Milan deal, testified on Sept. 28. 
The gross margin is &#8220;photographed&#8221; when the deal is
struck, Creanza said. That value is then managed by a trader
over the life of the contract, its magnitude varying as the
derivative agreement changes in value, she said. The final
profit for the bank can&#8217;t be known until maturity, said Creanza,
who declined to elaborate further. 
&#8216;Asymmetry of Information&#8217; 
The bank didn&#8217;t tell the city of Milan how much it was
charging, and the municipality could have sought competing bids
from other banks or independent advice, she said. 
Creanza said she earned a bonus that year, a payment
JPMorgan had guaranteed irrespective of her performance when the
firm lured her from a competitor in December 2004. She didn&#8217;t
say what the bonus was. 
The city of Milan is seeking damages as part of the
criminal trial. 
&#8220;There&#8217;s an asymmetry of information between banks and
local governments, which have stringent limits, not least in
their spending,&#8221; Letizia Moratti, 62, Milan&#8217;s mayor from 2006
through May of this year, said in court last month. &#8220;There was
a clear conflict that the banks didn&#8217;t highlight.&#8221; 
Watershed Events 
In Cassino, which lies on an ancient road connecting Naples
and Rome, residents curse two watershed events: the five-month
battle in 1944 that claimed more than 70,000 casualties and
turned the town into a moonscape, and the day in 2003 that the
government entered a seven-year swap with Bear Stearns. 
The contract, which adjusted payments on about 22 million
euros of debt, switched the city&#8217;s 4.7 percent fixed interest
rate for a variable one, according to a June 2009 report by
Italy&#8217;s financial police. The floating rate was based on the
U.S.-dollar London interbank offered rate, or Libor, an
&#8220;extremely risky&#8221; bet given that it was at a record low,
police said in testimony to the Italian Senate that month. 
Three-month U.S. dollar-Libor was at 1 percent in June 2003
and by January 2006 had surpassed 4.7 percent, according to data
compiled by the British Bankers&#8217; Association. The measure
climbed as high as 5.7 percent in September 2007 as credit
markets began to seize up, before declining to a record low of
0.25 percent by December 2009 after policy makers cut rates. 
Depleted Funds 
Cassino started losing money on the swap with the third
half-yearly payment, paying about 2 million euros after Libor
soared, according to police testimony. That depleted funds
intended for sanitation and road works that the city raises from
parking tickets and federal grants. 
The transaction was presented as advantageous to the
municipality at the time, said Volante, who worked as a city
culture chief when Bear Stearns pitched the deal. 
For Cassino, whose rundown postwar architecture bears
little of the ancient charm of neighboring towns, the challenge
now is to cut services without damaging the most vulnerable
residents, said Danilo Grossi, the city&#8217;s education chief. 
A new administration, which took over after May elections,
will boost charges for the city-run nursery starting next year
to help pay the 900,000 euros it costs to operate annually, said
Grossi. Talks with the families have begun, he said. The town is
still grappling with a shortfall that in 2010 forced out the
previous administration and led the federal government to take
financial control of the municipality. 
Helping the Poor 
Cassino&#8217;s pain has increased as Italy&#8217;s economy contracted
in the third quarter, signaling that the country may have
entered its fifth recession since 2001. Facing soaring borrowing
costs amid investor concern that the nation may struggle to
repay its debt, Prime Minister Mario Monti&#8217;s government is
adopting austerity measures that may further weigh on growth. 
While Cassino eventually extracted itself from the swap,
the damage may be lasting, according to Giuseppe Lauro, a
retired manager for Italy&#8217;s largest power company, Enel SpA (ENEL), who
now volunteers for church-sponsored charity Caritas Italiana.
The shrinking local economy and cuts in city spending are
creating a growing class of poor, he said. 
On a foggy December morning, as local politicians were busy
hosting Italy&#8217;s Chamber Speaker Gianfranco Fini to mark the
150th anniversary of the nation&#8217;s unification with songs in the
town&#8217;s Teatro Manzoni, Lauro was looking after the poor, picking
up the pieces of the city&#8217;s financial wreckage. 
About half of those who sought assistance from Caritas in
Cassino for the first time in 2009 were of working age, seeking
help with paying bills and food and clothes, a 2009 study by the
charity showed. More than half of those who relied on Caritas
were below 40. 
&#8220;We need more city funds,&#8221; Lauro, 66, said in an
interview at the charity&#8217;s shelter, a few hundred yards from
town hall. &#8220;The city&#8217;s demise means there are new poor and
they&#8217;re younger. They need jobs.&#8221;

Morgan Stanley, the bank whose
shares have declined 44 percent this year, said in a filing
today that 580 of the 1,600 job cuts announced earlier this
month may come from New York City. 
&#8220;Rolling layoffs&#8221; began Dec. 15, the New York-based firm
said in a submission to the state&#8217;s Labor Department. Affected
locations include 1221 Avenue of the Americas, 1 New York Plaza,
1585 Broadway and 750 Seventh Ave., the filing shows. 
Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, is grappling with
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis and concern that U.S. economic growth will
slow, crimping demand for trading and investment-banking
services. Financial firms have disclosed plans to eliminate more
than 200,000 jobs globally this year. 
Reductions will occur globally at all levels of the firm,
Mark Lake, a company spokesman, said on Dec. 15. The 1,600
figure amounts to about 2.6 percent of the 62,648 employees
Morgan Stanley (MS) had at the end of September. The decision to
reduce staff came as &#8220;we conduct our year-end performance-
management process and evaluate the right size of the franchise
for 2012,&#8221; Lake said at the time.

Electricite de France SA (EDF), Europe&#8217;s
biggest power generator, reached an agreement to raise its stake
in Edison SpA (EDN) to 80.7 percent for about 700 million euros ($915
million), ending a yearlong effort to take control of the
Italian utility. 
The French power producer will effectively exchange a 50
percent stake in Edipower, an Edison subsidiary, for Transalpina
di Energia Srl&#8217;s 50 percent stake in Edison, Thomas Piquemal,
EDF&#8217;s chief financial officer, said on a conference call today.
The purchase will raise EDF&#8217;s stake in Edison to 80.7 percent at
an &#8220;implied&#8221; share price of 84 euro cents, according to a
statement from the Paris-based company. 
EDF, which currently owns 50 percent of Edison, has been
trying to take full control for more than a year to gain access
to natural-gas resources and markets in southeastern Europe and
the Mediterranean basin. The value of the acquisition is a 1
percent premium to Edison&#8217;s 83.15 euro cent closing price on
Dec. 23. 
&#8220;The deal doesn&#8217;t look negative for EDF,&#8221; Benoit de Broissia, an analyst at KBL Richelieu Gestion in Paris, said by
phone today. &#8220;EDF wanted control of Edison without spending a
lot of cash. It was a difficult situation.&#8221; 
Standard  Poor&#8217;s cut Edison&#8217;s credit rating and Moody&#8217;s
Investors Services placed it on review for a downgrade after the
Italian utility reported a nine-month loss in October. The
agreement will reduce Edison&#8217;s debt by 1.1 billion euros and
&#8220;will reassure rating agencies,&#8221; Piquemal said. 
&#8216;Move Quickly&#8217; 
Edison fell 1.7 percent to 81.7 euro cents at the close in
Milan. EDF fell 1.5 cents to 18.4 euros. The preliminary accord
requires approval from the companies&#8217; boards before the end of
next month, with final contracts signed by Feb. 15, EDF said. 
&#8220;We want to move quickly,&#8221; Piquemal said. &#8220;We no longer
want to be under pressure by ratings agencies.&#8221; 
Edison is the latest Italian company to be taken over by
the French. Groupe Lactalis won control of Parmalat SpA and LVMH
Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA bought Bulgari SpA earlier this
year. 
Criticism of these purchases led EDF Chief Executive
Officer Henri Proglio to say in July he wouldn&#8217;t negotiate on
taking control of Edison until Italian authorities give their
approval. 
&#8220;We reached an agreement and authorities said they didn&#8217;t
want it because of cheese and jewelry,&#8221; Proglio said July 29
about a previous Edison deal that was scuttled. Another
agreement reached in October looked uncertain earlier this month
amid disagreements over debt and governance. 
Piquemal declined to comment on the politics behind today&#8217;s
deal. 
Consob Decision 
&#8220;I&#8217;m particularly satisfied with the success of the
negotiations between EDF and A2A and its main Italian
partners,&#8221; Corrado Passera, Italy&#8217;s Minister of Economic
Development, said in an e-mailed statement. A2A becomes the
country&#8217;s second biggest power company by taking control of
Edipower, he said. 
The transaction depends on EDF getting Italian market
regulator Consob to agree that a mandatory public tender offer
for Edison doesn&#8217;t exceed 84 euro cents a share, according to
the statement. 
&#8220;We are ready&#8221; to make a general offer &#8220;if the regulator
confirms this price,&#8221; Piquemal said. &#8220;It&#8217;s up to the Consob to
decide.&#8221; 
Transalpina, known as TdE, is currently half owned by EDF
and half by Delmi SpA, which in turn is owned by A2A and other
Italian companies. EDF currently owns 20 percent of Edison
directly and 30 percent through TdE. 
&#8216;Simplified&#8217; Agreement 
Delmi plans to acquire a 50 percent stake in Edipower from
Edison and 20 percent from Alpiq for 600 million euros and 200
million euros respectively, according to the statement. Edipower
will then be 70 percent owned by Delmi, 20 percent by A2A and 10
percent by Iren. 
The agreement is &#8220;simplified&#8221; compared to one reached in
October because Delmi shareholders will no longer have a stake
in Edison, Piquemal said. EDF will get nearly 8 gigawatts of
generation capacity in Edison while Edipower has about 7
gigawatts including 2 gigawatts on sites that will be be closed,
he said. 
Edison will sign a contract to supply a minimum of 50
percent of Edipower&#8217;s gas for six years, EDF said. 
Edison has a market value of about 4.3 billion euros. In
October, the company reported a 93 million euro loss because of
gas contracts, writedowns and higher taxes. Net debt as of Sept.
30 was 4.1 billion euros, up from 3.7 billion euros at the end
of 2010.

Mu Sigma, a company that helps
businesses make decisions by analyzing data, attracted a $108
million investment, the largest round of private-equity
financing in the analytic-services industry. 
The funding was led by General Atlantic LLC and followed a
$25 million round in April, Northbrook, Illinois-based Mu Sigma
said today in a statement. Sequoia Capital led the earlier
investment and participated in the new round, raising its stake
in Mu Sigma, according to the statement. 
Mu Sigma will use the capital to add 600 to 700 employees
to its 1,500 within the next year, said Dhiraj Rajaram, chairman
and chief executive officer of Mu Sigma. 
&#8220;The whole area of big data and data analytics and
support, we think, is very large and will continue to grow,&#8221;
Pat Hedley, a managing director at General Atlantic, based in
Greenwich, Connecticut, said in an interview. ``Mu Sigma has a
great client base and a strong management team.&#8221; 
The deal is the largest investment on record by a private-
equity or venture-capital firm in the data-processing and
enterprise-software services industries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The second-largest is Penta Capital LLC&#8217;s
$94 million investment earlier this year in Six Degrees
Technology Group Ltd., a company that specializes in cloud
computing. 
Board Seat 
William Ford, General Atlantic&#8217;s CEO, will join the Mu
Sigma board. 
Mu Sigma&#8217;s revenue will increase 35 percent to 40 percent
in 2012 and profit will &#8220;dip slightly&#8221; as the company
increases investments in a training program, marketing and
services for clients such as Microsoft Corp. and Dell Inc. (DELL),
Rajaram said. The money raised will also be used for hiring and
to buy out early investors, he said. 
Mu Sigma helps clients analyze larger sets of data than
software tools ordinarily are capable of handling. The amount of
data in the world is doubling every two years, according to EMC
Corp. 
&#8220;It&#8217;s a big problem that we&#8217;re trying to solve,&#8221; Rajaram
said in an interview.

Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services company, received a
patent on a method of paying people to eat more healthily. 
Patent 8,078,492, issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office Dec. 13, covers a computer system that can detect a
consumable item and provide the consumer with an electronic
monetary incentive based on the item and the consumer&#8217;s health
history. 
The system could also include exercise records for the
individual and recipes for healthy items, according to the
patent. 
The patent has taken more than 10 years to be issued.
Armonk, New York-based IBM applied for the patent in October
2001, according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office.

LVMH Sues Over Use of Fake Vuitton Luggage in &#8216;Hangover&#8217; Film 
LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) sued Time Warner Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s
Warner Brothers Entertainment unit for trademark infringement. 
The suit, filed Dec. 22 in federal court in New York, is
related to Warner&#8217;s &#8220;The Hangover: Part II&#8221; movie. The French
luxury-goods maker claims that a travel bag used in the film and
referred to as a genuine piece of Louis Vuitton luggage is a
fake. 
By referring to the fake as a Louis Vuitton bag, Warner
Brothers is &#8220;explicitly misleading the public about the
source&#8221; of the counterfeit product, Vuitton said in its
pleadings. While the fake uses the color scheme of genuine
Vuitton bags, it lacks the LV trademark, the company said in its
pleadings. 
The bag used in the movie is actually from a company
against which Vuitton brought an action before the U.S.
International Trade Commission, a body with the power to ban the
import of infringing items, the luxury-goods company said. 
Vuitton does authorize product placement in movies, only
with its permission and only with genuine products, according to
court papers. Warner is accused of stepping outside the general
practice in the movie industry of clearing the use of a branded
product with the brand owner. 
In addition to seeking an order barring the advertising,
promotion and distribution of the film containing any scenes
with the allegedly infringing bag, Vuitton asked the court to
order the destruction of all copies of the film that contain
images of the counterfeit bag and represent it as a genuine
Louis Vuitton product. 
Additionally, Vuitton asked for an award of Warner
Brother&#8217;s profits related to its alleged false designation or
origin, money damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. 
This isn&#8217;t the first time the film has been the target of
an infringement suit. In April, the tattoo artist who created
Mike Tyson&#8217;s distinctive tattoo sued over the use of that design
in the film. That case settled in June for undisclosed terms. 
That case was Whitmill v. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.,
4:11-cv-00752-DCP, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Missouri (St. Louis). 
In the new case, Vuitton is represented by Theodore C. Max
of Los Angeles-based Sheppard Mullin Richter  Hampton LLP (1215L), and
Robert E. Shapiro, Wendi E. Sloane and Vito S. Solitro of
Chicago&#8217;s Barack Ferrazzano Kirschbaum  Nagelberg LLP. 
The case is Louis Vuitton Malletier SA v. Warner Bros.
Entertainment Inc., 1:11-cv-09436-ALC, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). 
Japanese Police Say China Source of Most Counterfeit Goods 
Japan&#8217;s National Police Agency has identified almost 450
websites advertising in the Japanese language counterfeit
fashion items such as handbags, with most of them originating in
China, the Mainichi Daily News reported. 
Most of the sites use such phrases as &#8220;It&#8217;s a super copy -
- looks just like the original,&#8221; according to the newspaper. 
While the police have shut down 28 websites in Japan, 14 of
them reappeared soon after having changed from domestic servers
to overseas, the newspaper reported. 
Before 2006, most of the fake fashion items originated in
Korea. China now leads, producing 92 percent of all seized
counterfeit items in 2010, according to Mainichi News.

Singapore Press Says Yahoo! &#8216;Deliberately&#8217; Committed Plagiarism 
Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. (SPH), embroiled in a legal tussle
with Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) as both accused each other of copyright
infringement, said the Internet company &#8220;deliberately&#8221;
reproduced its news content without permission. 
&#8220;Yahoo had over an extended period of time consistently
and deliberately committed plagiarism by substantially
reproducing the words and expressions used in SPH&#8217;s articles
without permission,&#8221; Singapore Press said in a statement to the
stock exchange yesterday. Yahoo was &#8220;free-riding&#8221; on the
newspaper publisher to boost its website page views and
advertising revenue, according to the statement. 
Singapore Press sued Yahoo&#8217;s Southeast Asia unit Nov. 18,
claiming the company reproduced 23 articles from newspapers
including the Straits Times from November 2010 to October 2011
without authorization. On Dec. 13, Yahoo denied breaching
copyright laws and counter-sued Singapore Press for wrongly
using its images and articles on a website. 
&#8220;SPH is determined to pursue this suit vigorously and to
protect its copyrighted works,&#8221; the newspaper publisher said
after filing its defense to the Singapore High Court yesterday
in response to Yahoo&#8217;s countersuit. 
Yahoo said in a defense filed to the Singapore court Dec.
13 the articles that Singapore Press claimed were reproduced
without authorization were insubstantial and insignificant. 
&#8220;There is an important public interest in respect of the
right of the public to be informed of current events in
Singapore,&#8221; the Sunnyvale, California-based Internet company
said. &#8220;Copyright law does not protect facts and information.&#8221; 
Yahoo approached Singapore Press in April 2009 for a
license to reproduce news content, and negotiations between the
two companies broke down last year, according to the publisher&#8217;s
lawsuit. The Internet company relied on Singapore Press&#8217;s
articles to provide content on its website to raise traffic and
build readership without having to expend financial resources,
according to the lawsuit. 
&#8220;These acts of infringement were committed by Yahoo to
direct and maximize traffic to its website in order to drive up
its page views and advertising revenue,&#8221; Singapore Press said
today. &#8220;This was not done for the public interest, as claimed
by Yahoo, but instead in furtherance of its own vested financial
interest.&#8221; 
Singapore Press deliberately kept silent until a letter
from its lawyers Nov. 4, causing Yahoo to continue with the
alleged infringement for a year as it believed the publisher had
no complaints, according to the Internet company&#8217;s filing. 
The case is Singapore Press Holdings Ltd. v Yahoo!
Southeast Asia Ltd., S831/2011, Singapore High Court. 
Japanese Court Upholds Acquittal of Software Developer 
Japan&#8217;s highest court upheld a lower court&#8217;s ruling
clearing the developer of the Winny file-sharing software of
enabling criminal copyright infringement, the Mainichi News
reported. 
The court said the users are the ones who decide whether to
use the program legally or illegally, according to the
newspaper. 
Isamu Kaneko, 41, was first accused of aiding criminal
infringement in 2003 and was found guilty in 2006 and fined 1.5
million yen ($13,000), Mainichi News reported. The guilty
verdict was reversed by an intermediate court. 
Kaneko&#8217;s case was the first in Japan to test the liability
of a software developer for illegal use of the file-sharing
software he created, according to Mainichi News. 
Korean Music Companies Win Damages in U.S. Court Against Aussie 
A federal court in San Jose, California, entered a $645,000
judgment against an Australian defendant in a copyright
infringement suit brought by a group of Korean music companies. 
Six Korean music companies sued Kenny Tran, the operator of
the 1honeyjoo.com and 1honedew.com websites, for copyright
infringement in March 2011. 
They accused Tran, an Australian defendant, of operating
websites to disseminate unauthorized copies of their music,
calling him &#8220;one of the biggest illegal uploaders and free
download link providers of Korean music in the world.&#8221; 
They filed court documents in March attesting that Tran had
properly been served with a copy of the complaint. Tran has
never responded to the filing, according to the case docket. 
In her order granting the music companies a default
judgment against Tran, U.S. District Judge Lucy H. Koh addressed
the issue of whether her court was an appropriate forum for a
dispute between the two foreign defendants. 
She said that Tran used California companies -- including
Facebook Inc., Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube and Twitter Inc. -- to
advertise and direct people to his websites, and that his sites
encouraged Californians to download music without authorization.
She also noted that Tran had failed to come forward and ask for
an alternative forum. 
She found her court to be appropriate and issued a
permanent order barring Tran from further infringement of the
companies&#8217; copyrights, and awarded the companies the $645,000 in
damages they requested. 
The case is DFSB Kollective Vo. Ltd. v. Tran, 5:11-
cv-01049-LHK, U.S. District Court, Northern District of
California (San Jose). 
Bahamas Copyright Fund to Get Royalty-Payout Regulations 
While the Bahamas Copyright Royalty Fund hasn&#8217;t paid
performers any royalties in its 11 years of existence, the
situation is about to change with the establishment of
regulations governing payment rates, the Bahamas Tribune
newspaper reported. 
The Bahamas Attorney General&#8217;s Office has appointed an IP
specialist to develop the regulations and rates so the Copyright
Royalties Tribunal could begin to make payments from the fund,
according to the Tribune. 
The fund was established in 2000 to provide payments to
television performers and artists by Cable Bahamas, the
newspaper reported. 
The London-based Performing Rights Society for Music, which
represents Bahamian music creators and rights holders, sent the
chairman of the tribunal a letter raising concerns about the
lack of payouts from the fund, according to the Tribune.

Trade Secrets 
Synthes Accuses Stryker of Raiding California Sales Force 
A unit of Synthes Inc., the world&#8217;s largest maker of bone-
related medical devices, accused Stryker Corp. in a lawsuit of
raiding its San Francisco sales force and using confidential
information from former employees. 
Stryker seeks to obtain &#8220;an improper competitive
advantage&#8221; in the industry for medical implants and instruments
used in spinal surgery, Synthes USA Sales LLC said in the
complaint filed yesterday in federal court in Philadelphia.
Synthes also accused three former sales employees of
misappropriating trade secrets and breaching their contractual
and fiduciary obligations to the company. 
The former employees resigned from Synthes from August to
early October, according to the complaint. They immediately
began working for Stryker, one of the company&#8217;s direct
competitors, and are soliciting former customers, according to
the court filing. 
Representatives of Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail and phone message at the
company headquarters seeking comment on the lawsuit. 
Even though all three employees live and work in
California, the suit alleged the three ex-employees violated
Pennsylvania trade-secrets law rather than California&#8217;s. Courts
in California have tended to look less kindly than those in
other states on employment contracts that limit future
employment in the same industry. 
Johnson  Johnson agreed to buy Synthes, based in West
Chester, Pennsylvania, in April for $21.3 billion to become the
leader in the $5.5 billion market for devices to treat trauma
victims. 
The case is Synthes USA Sales LLC v. Stryker Corp., 2:11-
cv-07876-TJS, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).

Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s Prevnar 13 vaccine for
a bacterial infection that causes pneumonia won approval for use
in adults 50 and older, a population that may add almost $2
billion to sales in 2015. 
The Food and Drug Administration cleared the shot that will
compete with Merck  Co. (MRK)&#8217;s vaccine, which was approved almost 30
years ago, the agency said today in a statement. 
The FDA weighed approval on the condition New York-based
Pfizer studies the vaccine further to prove it protects against
pneumococcal pneumonia. About 300,000 U.S. adults 50 and older
are hospitalized with the infections each year, said Karen Midthun, director of FDA&#8217;s Center for Biologics Evaluation and
Research. 
&#8220;Pneumococcal disease is a substantial cause of illness
and death,&#8221; Midthun said in the statement. &#8220;Today&#8217;s approval
provides an additional vaccine for preventing pneumococcal
pneumonia and invasive disease in this age group.&#8221; 
Prevnar 13, approved in the U.S. last year for children 6
weeks to 5 years old, generated (PFE) $2.82 billion the first nine
months of 2011, according to the regulatory filings from Pfizer,
the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker. The vaccine may generate $5.9
billion by 2015, with adult use contributing $1.8 billion, said
Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse Group AG in New
York, in a note to investors. 
&#8220;The FDA approval of Prevnar 13 for these adults offers
the potential to contribute to the health of millions of aging
Americans,&#8221; Ian Read, Pfizer&#8217;s chairman and chief executive
officer, said today in an e-mail. 
Safety Results 
An FDA staff report released Nov. 14 determined the vaccine
was safe and effective in adults who received Pneumovax 23 from
Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck and in those never
immunized. Pfizer started an 85,000-subject trial in the
Netherlands to confirm the vaccine&#8217;s effectiveness in staving
off pneumococcal pneumonia, the agency said today. 
Pfizer hasn&#8217;t determined how long the shot will last and is
studying a five-year duration as part of the Netherlands trial,
said Peter Paradiso, of Pfizer&#8217;s vaccine development unit, in an
interview. 
Pfizer declined less than 1 percent to $21.64 at the close
in New York. The shares gained 24 percent this year. 
Merck&#8217;s Pneumovax 23 had $276 million in sales (MRK) in the first
nine months of this year, according to company filings. 
Insurance coverage for Prevnar 13 will depend on whether
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s vaccines panel
recommends Pfizer&#8217;s shot for those 50 and older. The 2010 health
law requires coverage of vaccines recommended by the panel
without a co-payment or deductible cost to patients. 
Merck&#8217;s vaccine is recommended for people 65 and older and
for people 2 years and older at high risk for pneumonia, such as
those with sickle cell disease, HIV infection and other
conditions that compromise the immune system, according to the
CDC. It is also recommended for adults 19 to 64 who smoke, have
asthma or live in nursing homes or long-term care facilities.

Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA) must pay
about $750 million to Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), a tenth of what the
U.S. company is seeking, for assets nationalized by Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez in 2007, according to two people with
knowledge of the case. 
The International Chamber of Commerce in New York, an
international arbitration court, gave a &#8220;favorable&#8221; ruling to
Venezuela&#8217;s state oil company, a company spokesman said today.
The World Bank&#8217;s International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes, or ICSID, is also due to rule on the claim
in a suit filed against the Venezuelan government. 
The people, who declined to be identified because they&#8217;re
not authorized to speak about the case publicly, said the
decision was handed down late this month. 
Chavez, who has nationalized assets in the energy, metals,
cement and telecommunications industries, faces about 20
arbitration cases at the ICSID, according to the Washington-
based center&#8217;s website. Venezuelan Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez
said in September that the country was willing to pay Exxon $1
billion after Carlos Escarra, the country&#8217;s prosecutor general,
told reporters that the two companies were negotiating a
settlement of about $6 billion.
