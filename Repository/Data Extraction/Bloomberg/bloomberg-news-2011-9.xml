<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) returned workers to some oil and natural gas platforms
as Tropical Storm Lee accelerated to the east-northeast, out of
the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>Crews are resuming production in the western Gulf after
inspecting equipment for damage, David Eglinton, a spokesman for
Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas-based said today in an e-
mail. Exxon moved about 140 employees to shore from
approximately 20 structures ahead of Lee. Shell, based in The
Hague, confirmed it began returning staff after evacuating as
many as 858 workers. </p>
<p>About 60 percent of oil production from the Gulf,
equivalent to 843,223 barrels per day, remained shut as of 11:30
a.m. New York time, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Gas curtailments totaled
2.35 billion cubic feet, or 44 percent, down from 2.9 billion
cubic feet, or 55 percent, yesterday. The bureau said 239 of the
617 platforms in the Gulf were evacuated and 25 of the 70 rigs
currently drilling in the ocean. </p>
<p>The interruptions will be brief, said James Williams, an
economist at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. We''re not
talking about Hurricane Gustav here, moving pipelines up and
down Louisiana like it was spaghetti, Williams said in a
telephone interview. This one isn''t a big story. It''s a wet
story. Gustav struck in 2008. </p>
<p>Production Resumes </p>
<p>Production resumed at Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)''s Nansen,
Boomvang and Gunnison platforms, the operator said today on its
website. Its Constitution, Marco Polo, Independence Hub, Neptune
and Red Hawk installations will be staffed and started as soon
as possible, The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko said. </p>
<p>Platforms become accessible as weather clears west to east,
Mike Hurst, chief pilot of PHI Inc. in Lafayette, Louisiana.
It''s the largest provider of helicopters to Gulf of Mexico oil
producers. </p>
<p>Normal flights may resume tomorrow over western and central
platforms with service to eastern platforms Tuesday, he said. </p>
<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX)''s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, is
operating normally, Katherine W. Swetman, a spokeswman, said
today in an e-mail. The unit can process as much as 360,000
barrels per day. More than 10 inches of rain fell in the area
the past four days, the National Weather Service said. </p>
<p>All Exxon Mobil refineries were operating normally today,
spokeswoman Claire Hassett said in an e-mail. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) plans to retain
ownership of German unit Adam Opel GmbH for at least 10 years,
Opel spokesman Stefan Weinmann said, confirming comments by GM''s
vice president of global public policy Robert Ferguson to Bild
Zeitung today. </p>
<p>Ferguson gave the assurance to Volker Bouffier, the premier
of the German state of Hesse where Opel has its headquarters,
during a visit to the U.S. last week, Weinmann said by phone. </p>
<p>Weinmann also confirmed comments by Opel''s Chief Executive
Officer Karl-Friedrich Stracke that the German carmaker''s access
to the Brazilian market will continue to be restricted. </p>
<p>In Brazil, the strategy is very clear: all vehicles sold
by GM are sold under the Chevrolet brand name, Weinmann said.
This has been the case for dozens of years. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s largest
theme-park operator, said consumer products Chairman Andrew P. Mooney resigned to seek a leadership role at another company
after running the division for 12 years. </p>
<p>I believe this is the perfect time to take that
experience into a leadership role with another organization and
corporate boards, Mooney, 56, said today in a statement from
Burbank, California-based Disney. He wasn''t more specific. </p>
<p>The unit Mooney leaves, Disney''s second smallest ahead of
interactive media, has been a steady source of sales and profit
growth with toys and merchandise from Pixar''s Cars movies
and Marvel films. Earnings in the division jumped 32 percent in
the June quarter on a 13 percent revenue gain. </p>
<p>A native of Scotland, Mooney is credited with
reinvigorating the Disney chain of stores and leading the
division that introduced the Disney Princesses and Disney
Fairies brands. He has led the unit since 1999 and has been
chairman since 2003. </p>
<p>Disney fell 68 cents to $31.78 at 2:06 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had declined 13
percent this year before today. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Credit Suisse Group AG landed lead roles managing the
initial share sale for Carlyle Group LP, taking one of the last
major private-equity firms public in a faltering market. </p>
<p>The mandate may give the banks a boost among underwriters
as companies and their bankers struggle to complete deals.
JPMorgan currently ranks third for U.S. IPOs, while Citigroup
ranks fourth and Credit Suisse is eighth, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>U.S. listings have slowed almost to a halt because of
investors'' concerns about the economy, eroding fee income at
investment banks. U.S. IPOs have been shelved or scrapped at a
faster rate in the past three months than the comparable period
of any year since 2004, Bloomberg data show. Only five offerings
were completed last month. </p>
<p>They should be doing cartwheels and jumping in the air to
get any kind of revenue in the door right now, said Tom Jalics, a senior investment analyst at the private-banking unit
of KeyCorp in Cleveland, which oversees $22 billion. From what
we''re hearing anecdotally, this quarter is going to be
extraordinarily weak, and estimates across the board are coming
down for investment banks. </p>
<p>The three banks all have a track record for taking private-
equity firms public. Citigroup helped lead the February 2007 IPO
of Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), as well as Blackstone Group
LP (BX)''s in June 2007 along with Credit Suisse. JPMorgan, Credit
Suisse and Citigroup all helped lead Apollo Global Management
LLC''s share sale in March. Washington-based Carlyle is the
second-biggest private-equity firm after Blackstone. </p>
<p>Average Fees </p>
<p>Absent from Carlyle''s filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission was Morgan Stanley (MS), which shared the lead
role with Citigroup on Blackstone''s offering. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), which helped manage both Apollo''s share sale and the
Fortress IPO, also wasn''t mentioned in the filing. </p>
<p>Barclays Plc is the top-ranked underwriter for U.S. IPOs
this year, and Morgan Stanley is ranked second, according to
Bloomberg data. Banks have earned underwriting fees averaging
5.4 percent of the total IPO size for U.S. deals this year, the
data show. </p>

<p>The increase in pricing of corporate
credit risk is unjustified even by lower growth expectations and
higher recession risks, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Although a U.S. recession or Eurozone sovereign shocks
are risks, we think risk premiums are too elevated and unlike
normal'' cycles we have not seen a deterioration in balance
sheet quality, analysts Viktor Hjort, Kelvin Pang and Nishant
Sood wrote in a report today. We are constructive on global
credit, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>The cost to protect U.S. company debt jumped today on
concern that the European debt crisis is worsening. The Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, rose 9.6 basis points from Sept. 2 to a mid-
price of 129.6 as of 8:06 a.m. in New York, according
to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. That''s the biggest
increase since Aug. 8. </p>
<p>The credit swaps index, which typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves, has climbed
from 96.3 since the end of July. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest
software maker, is adding features to its Internet display-
advertising products to keep from losing customers to Google
Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. in the $12.3 billion U.S. market. </p>
<p>Microsoft is unveiling tools and partnerships with AppNexus
Inc. and MediaMath this month designed to help customers more
effectively tailor ads and measure their impact. Sales of
graphical display ads, including banners and videos, are poised
to climb 25 percent in the U.S. this year. </p>
<p>The company aims to reassure customers such as Publicis
Groupe SA that have questioned its commitment to display ads and
the Atlas software it acquired with the $6 billion AQuantive
Inc. deal. As Microsoft shifted its focus to search-related ads,
some marketers have devoted more display-ad dollars to Facebook
and Google. </p>
<p>We have continued to invest behind Microsoft and behind
Atlas, said Curt Hecht, chief executive officer of VivaKi
Nerve Center, the unit that oversees technology for Publicis
Groupe SA (PUB)''s digital ad agencies. We need a partner that''s as

<p>Microsoft is adding personnel and dollars to bolster
display and Atlas, which is used to place ads on websites and
help advertisers measure performance of ad campaigns. Atlas vies
with DoubleClick, acquired by Google in a $3.1 billion purchase
announced a month before the AQuantive deal. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a producer of
steelmaking coal in southern Appalachia, jumped as much as 30
percent after the London-based Times said Anglo American Plc (AAL) may
be considering a takeover bid. </p>
<p>Anglo is said to be weighing a $120-a-share offer, the
Times said in its market report without citing anyone. BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) is also interested in Walter, the Times said. </p>
<p>Walter rose $15.99, or 21 percent, to $90.98 as of 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
pared gains after Walter said in a statement it isn''t aware of
any corporate developments to account for the price
increase. The stock earlier touched $97.30, the biggest intraday
gain since March 8, 1995. </p>
<p>Walter, based in Birmingham, Alabama, hasn''t hired a
permanent chief executive officer since Keith Calder resigned
June 30. He stepped down about two months after he was appointed
to the position, following Walter''s takeover of Canada''s Western
Coal Corp., where he was the CEO. Investor Audley Capital
Advisors LLP said in July that the company should explore a
sale. </p>
<p>Met coal assets are still in high demand, Jeremy Sussman, an analyst with Brean Murray Carret  Co., wrote in a
research note today. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking
coal, is used to produce steel while utilities use thermal coal
to generate electricity. </p>
<p>Takeover Bids </p>
<p>Walter said it issued the statement in response to a
request from the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of
Canada on behalf of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company said
it doesn''t intend to comment further. </p>
<p>Surging demand from steelmakers in China and flood-related
supply disruptions in Queensland, Australia, have driven prices
for coking coal to record highs. Low-volatility metallurgical
coal rose to $291 a ton, Energy Publishing Inc. said in its
latest weekly report, published Sept. 2. It touched $330 a ton
in February. </p>
<p>There were $20.15 billion of takeover bids for coal-mining
companies valued at $100 million or more in the first nine
months of this year, compared with $7.06 billion in the year-
earlier period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU), the biggest U.S. coal producer, and
ArcelorMittal, the world''s largest steelmaker, in August agreed
to buy Macarthur Coal Ltd., a Brisbane, Australia coking-coal
producer, for A$3.64 billion ($3.88 billion). Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) became the world''s third-largest producer of
coking coal with a $7.1 billion takeover of Massey Energy Co. in
January. </p>
<p>Offer Unlikely </p>
<p>Anglo isn''t likely to make an offer for Walter, mainly
because the U.S. company''s coal reserves aren''t in a suitable
location for export by sea, London-based investment bank Liberum
Capital said today in a note. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. also saw an offer as unlikely, due to
limited potential synergies, and because the multiple of 5.5
times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is low compared with recent deals in the sector,
Brian Yu, a San Francisco-based analyst wrote in a note today. </p>
<p>Anglo, which is based in London, also declined to comment
in an e-mail. Kelly Quirke, a spokeswoman for Melbourne-based
BHP, also declined to comment. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s
compensation plan, which almost doubled top executive Lloyd Blankfein''s pay last year, unfairly rewards the investment
bank''s employees at shareholders'' expense, a lawyer for
investors said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
lost $50 billion in market value since 1999 while the company
has paid out billions in compensation to the firm''s 31,000
employees, including Blankfein, its chairman and chief executive
officer, John Harnes, an attorney for investors who have sued
over the pay plan, argued today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, is being run for the
benefit of employees rather than shareholders, Harness told
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock III. The judge heard
arguments on whether shareholders'' suits seeking to recoup
executive compensation should be thrown out and said he''d rule
later. </p>
<p>The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis. In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company''s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year, according to its website. That was 9 percent less
than in the same period in 2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent. </p>
<p>$19 Million Compensation </p>
<p>Blankfein''s $19 million compensation for 2010, which
included a $5.4 million cash bonus, was almost double the prior
year''s award even as Goldman Sach''s profits fell. Blankfein and
other firm executives agreed to forgo cash bonuses in 2009 and
take restricted stock grants as compensation to mute criticism
of the firm''s pay practices. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argue the firm''s
lucrative compensation system is wasteful and rewards employees
for taking risks that hurt the firm''s stock price. </p>
<p>Harness noted Goldman officials received billions in pay
and bonuses last year while the firm settled claims by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that executives misled
investors in collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime
mortgages. </p>
<p>The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators'' claims that marketing materials about the
investments had incomplete information. </p>
<p>CDOs in 2007 </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing a hedge fund
helped pick the underlying securities and then bet against the
investment vehicles, the SEC said in the suit Goldman settled.
The bank didn''t admit wrongdoing as part of the accord. </p>
<p>Such wrongful conduct has cost shareholders billions to
date and is likely to cost billions more, Harnes argued on
behalf of Septa. Philadelphia-based Septa is the nation''s fifth-
largest public transportation system, according to its website. </p>
<p>Investors should be permitted to move forward with their
suit, which seeks to hold Goldman Sachs directors responsible
for the firm''s flawed pay plan and for not properly overseeing
the company''s employees, he added. </p>
<p>Any recovery as a result of Septa''s so-called derivative
suit will be returned to the company''s coffers rather than given
to the transportation authority. </p>
<p>Risk-Taking </p>
<p>Gregory Varallo, Goldman Sachs''s lawyer, countered
investors haven''t provided any evidence that directors engaged
in wrongdoing by creating the pay plan or encouraged excessive
risk-taking by the firm''s traders and bankers. </p>
<p>Shareholder court filings seek to paint the investment bank
as some kind of vast criminal enterprise, Varallo told
Glasscock. Yet, investors can''t point to one illegal act
committed by a Goldman Sachs director or employee, he said. </p>
<p>The investors want the judge to decide how much risk an
investment bank should take and how much is too much
compensation for taking those risks on behalf of shareholders,
Varallo added. </p>
<p>We don''t believe that''s a judge''s job, the lawyer
added. Delaware Chancery Court judges decide cases without a
jury. </p>
<p>The case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Shareholder
Litigation, 5215, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), one of
Coca-Cola Co. (KO)''s largest franchise bottlers, said it made a
mistake in threatening to reconsider a 17 million-euro ($24
million) manufacturing investment in southern France because of
a sugar-related tax proposal. </p>
<p>I would like to set the record straight, Hubert Patricot, president of the Atlanta-based company''s European
group, said today in a statement. We are re-confirming our 17
million euro investment to our Les Pennes-Mirabeau facility. </p>
<p>The company had said in a statement hours earlier that it
was re-evaluating the planned investment and had canceled a
Sept. 19 ceremony with Chief Executive Officer John Brock. The
threat was in protest of a government plan to tax sugared
beverages as part of an austerity measure. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Enterprises declined to comment beyond the
follow-up statement. Patricot in his statement stood by the
company''s opposition to the tax proposal. </p>
<p>We remain strongly opposed to a tax that unjustly targets
the purchasing power of the French people and one category of
beverages under the pretext of addressing public health
concerns, he said. Consumer information and education around
increased exercise and balanced diets, not discriminatory taxes,
must be part of any comprehensive proposal. </p>
<p>France''s government announced last month a plan to raise 12
billion euros in 2011 and 2012 to fight mounting deficits.
Parliament is voting through tomorrow on 2011 measures that
include raising taxes on alcohol and cigarettes and creating a
new levy on sodas. </p>
<p>Euro Disney Protest </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Enterprises is the latest company to challenge
elements of the government''s plan. Euro Disney SCA (EDL)''s Disneyland
Paris and French theme parks opposed a planned increase in the
value-added tax on its business to 19.6 percent from 5.5
percent. The tax was scrapped yesterday after the parks won
support from former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. </p>
<p>When he presented the plan, Prime Minister Francois Fillon
justified the new levy on sugared drinks, saying it was aimed at
reining in the development of obesity that eventually will
represent a health cost. The levy would yield about 100
million euros a year, according to the government. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Enterprises protested earlier today saying there
are no studies in France linking sodas and higher obesity
rates. The company said then that its investment in the factory
in Pennes-Mirabeau was on hold pending the vote. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s experimental pill for
rheumatoid arthritis was as effective as Humira from Abbott
Laboratories (ABT) and showed no new side effects in study results the
company plans to submit for U.S. approval this year. </p>
<p>Nine study summaries were released today and will be
presented at the American College of Rheumatology conference in
Chicago in November. In one trial, both doses of Pfizer''s drug,
called tofacitinib, were slightly more effective than Humira
across six categories of improvement in symptoms and patient
mobility, though the study wasn''t big enough to establish the
pill''s superiority. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s biggest drugmaker, designed tofacitinib
to compete with injectable drugs that dominate the market, led
by Humira from Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott, Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ)''s Remicade and Amgen Inc. (AMGN)''s Enbrel, which New York-based
Pfizer shares. The new drug may bring in more than $2.6 billion
a year, said Catherine Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG in New York. </p>
<p>This is a game-changing drug, Arnold said. Our peak
sales of $2.6 billion are likely conservative. </p>
<p>Humira will reach peak sales of about $8.5 billion in 2013
before sales decline as doctors grow comfortable with
tofacitinib and other new drugs, said Arnold, who has an
outperform rating on Pfizer''s stock and a neutral rating
for Abbott. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 19 cents, or 1 percent, to $18.82 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Abbott declined 86
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.44. </p>
<p>Helps Application </p>
<p>Pfizer believes the risk-benefit profile supports
regulatory submission for both the 5- and 10-milligram dose,
Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in an e-mail.
We are looking forward to filing in the U.S., EU and Japan by
the end of the year. </p>
<p>Tofacitinib is the most-advanced pill in a family of
experimental drugs to target a protein, called JAK, which leads
to joint destruction in 1.3 million Americans with rheumatoid
arthritis. Three biotechnology companies are trying to catch up
to Pfizer with similar treatments: Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RIGL),
Incyte Corp. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) Pfizer''s pill is
the only one to complete the third and final stage of tests
generally needed for U.S. regulatory approval. </p>
<p>Unexpected Results </p>
<p>Humira performed unexpectedly poorly in the study, which
may not represent the true effectiveness of the drug, said
Elizabeth Hoff, a spokeswoman for Abbott. The proportion of
Humira patients showing a 20 percent improvement after six
months was 47 percent, compared with a typical proportion of 65
percent of patients with such improvement. Patients with 50
improvement only accounted for 28 percent of those studied,
compared with past studies showing 52 percent of patients. </p>
<p>Looking at the scores, this isn''t what we typically
see, Hoff said today in a telephone interview. These are
very similar patient populations. You see a pretty significant
difference. </p>
<p>The safety of tofacitinib was similar to what was seen in
previous studies, and deaths and side effects were toward the
lower end of a range of results from similar drugs, the company
reported. Much of the data from the individual studies was
reported previously. </p>
<p>Twelve deaths were reported among 3,030 patients who took
the drug, compared with 1 death among 681 taking a placebo and 1
death among 204 patients on Humira across the Phase 3 studies
completed by Pfizer. Patients spent more time on tofacitinib
than Humira or placebo and deaths per amount of time spent on
the drugs were statistically similar. </p>
<p>Serious Infections </p>
<p>Patients taking tofacitinib were more likely to have
serious infections compared with Humira or placebo. There were
0.029 infectious for every year a patient was taking the Pfizer
pill, compared with 0.015 infections for placebo and 0.017 on
Humira. In at least one trial, infection rates were greater for
those taking the higher of two possible doses of tofacitinib. </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease in which the
immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing
inflammation in and around joints. Treatments suppress the
immune system and can increase vulnerability to infection. </p>
<p>Shots known as anti-TNF therapy are standard care for the
80 percent of patients who don''t respond to methotrexate, a
generic drug that can block cell growth in people with certain
cancers and immune disorders. </p>
<p>Tofacitinib would add to Pfizer''s recently expanded
offerings in pain and inflammation. The company gained the
arthritis remedy Enbrel in the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in
2009. The medicine was Pfizer''s second-best seller last year
with $3.3 billion in revenue. The drugmaker bought King
Pharmaceuticals Inc. last year for about $3.3 billion to add
additional painkillers to its range of products. </p>
<p>Pfizer is counting on revenue from its arthritis pill to
help offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol
drug, with $10.7 billion in annual sales, faces competition
beginning in November from cheaper copies in the U.S. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. said selling
Italian and Spanish bonds along with bank stocks and debt, and
buying dollars and gold may provide the best protection against
the very unlikely risk of a euro-area collapse. </p>
<p>There are formidable barriers to break-up, which make it
less likely, but also mean it would be more disruptive if it did
occur, Seamus Mac Gorain, a strategist in London, wrote in an
investor report yesterday. The financial turmoil and economic
impact would be most pronounced in the euro area, arguing for
broad underweight euro-area equity and credit. </p>
<p>Yields on U.S. and German 10-year bonds fell to records
this week and gold reached a fresh high as investors sought the
safest assets amid concern policy makers aren''t doing enough to
prevent the spread of financial-market tension from the euro
area. That''s prompting economists to study worst-case scenarios,
with UBS AG saying two days ago that the euro doesn''t work under
its current structure. </p>
<p>Sales of Italian and Spanish bonds versus benchmark German
bunds may provide an efficient hedge, along with betting the
euro will fall against the dollar and buying gold, JPMorgan''s
Mac Gorain wrote. Owning less euro-area bank equities and credit
securities than benchmarks used to track performance would also
offer protection, he said. </p>
<p>Italian 10-year bonds rose a third day, pushing the yield
down five basis points to 5.21 percent as of 11:03 a.m. in
London. The rate fell to as low as 4.87 percent on Aug. 18 as
the European Central Bank was said to begin purchasing the debt
last month. </p>
<p>The only way to hedge against a euro break-up scenario is
to own no euro assets at all, UBS economists including
Stephane Deo wrote in their Sept. 6 report. The cost of a
potential collapse makes it close to zero probability, and
the growth consequences are awful in any break-up scenario,
they wrote. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank, the
Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan may take concerted action
to tackle weak growth and falling equity prices as soon as this
week''s Group of Seven meeting, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>The negative feedback loop between weak growth and soggy
asset markets makes a coordinated monetary-policy easing move
more likely, London-based economists Manoj Pradhan and Joachim Fels said yesterday in a note to investors. The burden of
propping up markets and the economy falls on central banks. </p>
<p>Central banks are facing calls to loosen monetary policy as
threats from Europe''s fiscal crisis and a weakening U.S.
recovery intensify and roil financial markets. The Fed, the ECB
and the Bank of England took concerted steps along with four
others in 2008 to slash interest rates as the fallout from the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. became evident. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said central banks can now reprise joint
action and roll out a mix of rate cuts and quantitative easing. </p>
<p>Strategic complementarity -- the willingness and ability
to ease if others are doing the same -- makes it easier for
banks to act jointly rather than unilaterally, the two
economists said in the e-mailed note. </p>
<p>The ECB and the Bank of England, which meet today, are
expected to keep their main policy rates on hold. At the same
time, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet faces calls for a rate
cut and the BOE may consider additional stimulus. </p>
<p>Policy makers from the Group of Seven nations will convene
for talks in the French city of Marseilles tomorrow, providing a
forum where joint action may be approved. </p>
<p>The Fed, the ECB, the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England
will all participate in any coordinated move, according to
Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>The Fed could lower its interest rate on excess reserves
to zero and announce some balance sheet measures, the
economists said. The ECB could cut its deposit rate and/or the
refi rate and announce additional term funding for banks. The
Bank of Japan and the Bank of England could both respond with
additional quantitative-easing measures. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the top global
merger adviser last year, named three new heads of its media and
communications investment-banking group to replace Stuart J. Epstein, who left to become chief financial officer of NBC
Universal. </p>
<p>Jean Abergel, Max Herrnstein and Adam Shepard will serve as
global co-heads of the group, according to a internal memo
obtained today by Bloomberg News. Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for
the New York-based firm, confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>NBC Universal, the entertainment company controlled by
Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), announced Epstein''s hire on Sept. 7. Epstein
played a key role in creating the venture that gave Comcast, the
largest U.S. cable service, a 51 percent stake in NBC Universal,
owner of the broadcast network, movie studio and cable channels
Bravo and USA, according to a statement. </p>
<p>Stuart''s contributions to the division and the firm have
been tremendous and he will be greatly missed, Paul J.
Taubman, co-president of the Institutional Securities Group, and
Franck Petitgas, global co-head of investment banking, said in
the memo. We are confident that Jean, Max and Adam will
provide the strong leadership necessary to continue to build on
the strength and positive momentum in our Global Media 
Communications business. </p>
<p>Abergel, a 12-year veteran of the firm, is currently head
of the media and communications team in Europe, while Herrnstein
is head of media in North America and Shepard runs the telecom
group in that region, according to the memo. Herrnstein has been
with the firm for 13 years, and Shepard is an 11-year veteran,
according to the memo. </p>
<p>The New York Times reported the promotions earlier. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) were among four banks chosen to manage Nikko Asset
Management Co.''s initial public offering, said three people with
knowledge of the proposed sale. </p>
<p>Nikko Asset and its largest shareholder, Sumitomo Trust 
Banking Co., may sell about 50 billion yen ($645 million) of
shares in the IPO, said the people, declining to be identified
before a public announcement. The asset manager plans to list on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange as early as this year and targets a
market value of about 200 billion yen, they said. </p>
<p>The share offer may be the biggest IPO in Japan this year,
and would be the country''s first by a major asset manager in a
decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The nation''s
equity capital market has begun to recover, with nine initial
share offers from the end of May following an 11-week hiatus in
the aftermath of a record earthquake and tsunami on March 11. </p>
<p>Overseas investors will be interested because a Japanese
asset manager''s sale is a rarity and gives them access to the
country''s 1,500 trillion yen worth of household financial
assets, said Kazumi Tanaka, an IPO analyst at TC Financial
Research Inc. in Tokyo. The IPO market will be more aggressive
next year as Japanese firms improve performance and recover from
the earthquake. </p>
<p>Megumi Yoshizawa, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Nikko
Asset, declined to comment. Goldman Sachs''s Hiroko Matsumoto,
Nomura''s Keiko Sugai, UBS''s Eiko Noda and SMBC Nikko''s Tadataka
Ishida also declined to comment. All are based in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Four-Bank Management </p>
<p>New York-based Goldman Sachs will be the global coordinator
for the IPO, while UBS AG (UBSN) and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. will
help manage the sale, the people said. </p>
<p>Nikko Asset began choosing managers for the offering in
July. The firm hasn''t decided the terms of the sale or details
for the underwriters'' roles, the people said. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), which acquired Nikko Asset from Nikko
Cordial Corp. in 2008, sold the company to Sumitomo Trust as
part of a transaction valued at 120 billion yen in October 2009. </p>
<p>Nikko Asset, founded in 1959, employs more than 500 staff
including 72 fund managers, and has 12.8 trillion yen under
management, according to its website. The investment management
firm, run by Chief Executive Officer Timothy McCarthy, has
subsidiaries in London, New York, Singapore and Sydney. </p>
<p>Sumitomo Trust and Nikko Asset agreed to buy DBS Asset
Management from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS), Southeast Asia''s
biggest bank, for S$137 million ($113 million) to tap business
from the expanding ranks of wealthy Asians, the companies said
in December. </p>

<p>Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam said the punishment sought by the government for his
insider-trading convictions is grotesquely severe and should
be rejected by the court. The U.S. said a long prison sentence
is warranted. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 54, on Sept. 9 asked U.S. District Judge
Richard Holwell in Manhattan for a sentence substantially
below what is called for by federal guidelines. The
government''s requested sentence of 19 1/2 to 24 1/2 years
would guarantee Mr. Rajaratnam''s death in prison, he said in
a court filing. </p>
<p>This court''s role is not to validate a prosecutorial
public relations effort, nor is it to single out one man to
serve as the whipping boy for Wall Street misdeeds, Rajaratnam
argued. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam was convicted in May of all 14 criminal counts
of conspiracy and securities fraud he was charged with. He''s
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 27. Rajaratnam argued that the
government''s requested sentence is more than the average
sentence imposed for kidnapping and hostage-taking, sexual
abuse, robbery, arson and child pornography. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorneys Reed Brodsky and Jonathan
Streeter, who prosecuted the case, asked Holwell in a filing
Sept. 9 to reject Rajaratnam''s pleas for leniency based on his
poor health and charitable contributions. </p>
<p>In arguing for leniency because of his health, Rajaratnam
overlooks that he committed his crimes for years after he knew
about his medical problems and thus he is in no position to seek
leniency now based on them, they said. </p>

District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>ATT Fights U.S. Suit, Calls T-Mobile Deal Good for Public </p>
<p>ATT Inc. (T) said its proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-
Mobile USA Inc. is good for mobile-phone customers and that the
U.S. lawsuit seeking to block the deal fails to come to
grips with its benefits. </p>
<p>ATT filed its response Sept. 9 to the U.S. Justice
Department''s complaint in federal court in Washington. The
company said the merger would lead to better service, fewer
dropped calls and lower prices for consumers. ATT cited fierce
competition from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S), MetroPCS Communications Inc., Leap Wireless International
Inc., U.S. Cellular Corp. and Cellular South Inc. </p>
<p>The Department does not and cannot explain how, in the
face of all these aggressive rivals, the combined ATT/T-Mobile
will have any ability or incentive to restrict output, raise
prices, or slow innovation, ATT said in the filing. </p>
<p>ATT described T-Mobile as the only major carrier to have
actually lost subscribers in a robustly growing market with a
business model that has it trapped between large providers and
lower-priced competitors. </p>
<p>The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)''s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would substantially reduce
competition. </p>
<p>Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman in Washington, said in an
e-mail that the company remains interested in a solution that
addresses the DOJ''s issues with the T-Mobile merger. </p>
<p>Hernan Daguerre, a T-Mobile spokesman, declined to comment
on the filing. </p>
<p>This transaction as currently proposed is anticompetitive
and harmful to consumers, Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the
antitrust division of the Justice Department, said in an
interview. We will respond further in our court filings. </p>
<p>Sprint, which has filed its own lawsuit opposing the
merger, said ATT''s filing doesn''t change its position on the
deal. </p>
<p>The proposed takeover would create a clear wireless
duopoly that could raise prices, stifle innovation and cost
American jobs, Sprint spokesman John Taylor said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 and told the parties to be prepared to discuss
settlement options. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>
<p>Banks May Fight Banks as Investors Pursue Class Status </p>
<p>Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) may pay more to resolve claims over their alleged roles in
the collapse of a $2.3 trillion mortgage-backed securities
market if sophisticated investors are allowed to sue as a group
along with less savvy ones, Thom Weidlich of Bloomberg News
reports. </p>
<p>Class-action status allows investors to pool financial and
legal resources, giving them greater leverage to win larger
settlements or verdicts. The banks, however, have a court ruling
on their side that may help fend off such blockbuster cases. It
says class status is barred because some investors are too
sophisticated -- in fact, because some of them are other banks,
including JPMorgan. </p>
<p>It is possible to be both an alleged perpetrator and
victim at the same time, said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer now in private
practice in Potomac, Maryland. It''s unprecedented that you
have the most sophisticated institutions as victims, to be in a
position where their losses are so great that they have sued. </p>
<p>The ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. in
Manhattan, favoring defendants Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)
and Ally Financial Inc., held that investors may not sue as a
class in part because some of them are being sued over the same
claims. Last month, that ruling was countered by two judges in
Baer''s courthouse, both of whom ruled that investors in home-
loan backed securities may sue as a class. </p>
<p>Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that, once burst, helped push the
U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. Investors have
filed class-action, or group, lawsuits against at least 16
private issuers of securities backed by mortgages. </p>

<p>KKR, Blackstone Deal-Rigging Antitrust Suit Expanded by Judge </p>
<p>Plaintiffs in a case accusing 11 firms, including KKR  Co.
and Blackstone Group LP (BX), of conspiring to rig the market for
leveraged buyout deals can expand their investigation, a federal
judge ruled. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, including a Detroit police and fire pension
fund, can seek information on 10 additional deals, U.S. District
Judge Edward F. Harrington said in a ruling Sept. 7. He didn''t
identify the transactions, which are described in a fifth
amended complaint filed under seal. The firms argued that adding
the deals would be unduly burdensome and prejudicial,
according to court papers. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, initially filed in 2007, claims the firms
conspired to drive down prices in the largest leveraged buyout
deals in violation of federal antitrust laws. The case
previously was limited to 17 transactions. Harrington gave the
plaintiffs until April 17 to seek the information. </p>
<p>Among the deals in question is Neiman Marcus Group Inc.''s
$5.1 billion buyout by Warburg Pincus LLC and TPG Capital Inc.,
SunGard Data Systems Inc.''s $11.3 billion takeover by seven
private-equity firms and Aramark Corp.''s roughly $8.3 billion
purchase in January 2007. Three plaintiffs are also shareholders
of Freescale Semiconductor Inc., which was taken private by a
group including Blackstone and Carlyle Group. TPG and Carlyle
are also defendants in the suit. </p>
<p>The firms allegedly formed bidding clubs, referred to
in the private-equity industry as consortia or teams to
rig the bidding, according to a redacted fourth amended
complaint made public Sept 9. Use of the clubs limited the
number of bidders, depressing prices at target companies, the
plaintiffs said. </p>
<p>We''re not going to have any comment on that, Owen
Blicksilver, a spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG, said
in a telephone interview Sept. 9. </p>

the company doesn''t comment on pending litigation. Blackstone
spokeswoman Christine Anderson and Chris Ullman of Carlyle Group

<p>Madoff Trustee Sets $272 Million Payout, Sept. 15 Record Date </p>
<p>The liquidator of Bernard Madoff''s firm is planning an
initial distribution of $272 million to investors holding
allowed claims as of Sept. 15, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>The trustee, Irving Picard, intends to issue payments by
the end of the third quarter, after reviewing allowed claims
against the jailed confidence man, he said in July. The average
check, arriving almost three years after the Ponzi scheme
collapsed, will be $222,551, he said. </p>
<p>Holders of claims against Madoff that were sold or
transferred will only receive distributions from Picard if the
21-day notice-and-objection period on the transfer has expired
by Sept. 15, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 lawsuits seeking
money for Madoff investors, in May allotted $2.6 billion to a
fund for victims of the Ponzi scheme. Because of court
challenges, most of the $8.6 billion he has raised isn''t
currently available to put in the customer fund or distribute to
claimholders who lost an estimated $17.3 billion in principal,
he has said. </p>
<p>Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in North Carolina,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. Picard and his law
firm, Baker  Hostetler LLP, have made about $179 million in
fees since Madoff''s 2008 arrest. </p>
<p>The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Dow Chemical, Sasol Win Dismissal of Greenpeace Lawsuit </p>
<p>Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and Sasol North America Inc. won the
dismissal of a lawsuit alleging the chemical companies illegally
spied on an affiliate of Greenpeace International, the
environmental advocacy group. </p>
<p>Greenpeace Inc. sued under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act. A federal judge in Washington
ruled Sept. 9 that the nonprofit organization failed to
establish a direct connection between corporate espionage and
civil racketeering allegations and any injury the group
suffered. </p>
<p>The direct victim of this alleged wire fraud was not
Greenpeace, but a third party, and, therefore, the link between
Greenpeace''s injuries and defendants'' alleged racketeering
activity is too attenuated to be actionable under RICO, U.S.
District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer wrote in her ruling. </p>
<p>Greenpeace claimed that Dow, closely held Sasol and two
public relations firms from 1998 to 2000 conspired to infiltrate
and steal confidential information to thwart its environmental
campaigns. </p>
<p>Greenpeace said the spying included breaking into locked
trash bins outside its Washington headquarters and infiltrating
meetings and electronic communications. </p>
<p>The injured third party the judge referred to was Calcasieu
League for Environmental Action Now, described in the ruling as
an ally of Greenpeace. </p>
<p>Molly Dorozenski, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, declined to
comment immediately, saying the group''s lawyers were reviewing
the ruling. </p>
<p>As we have said from the beginning, the case totally
lacked merit and should have never been filed by Greenpeace,
said Gregory Baldwin, a spokesman for Midland, Michigan-based
Dow, the largest U.S. chemical maker, in an e-mail. No Dow
employee did anything improper. </p>
<p>Matthew Kirtland, a Washington lawyer representing Houston-
based Sasol North America Inc., said his client is pleased with
the court''s decision. </p>
<p>The case is Greenpeace Inc. v. Dow Chemical Co., 10-cv-
02037, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>
<p>Lorillard Label Challenge Should Be Rejected, U.S. Says </p>
<p>The U.S. asked a judge to reject a bid by Lorillard Inc. (LO),
the maker of Newport cigarettes, and three other tobacco
companies to stop the government from putting new warnings on
cigarette packs. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department, in a filing Sept. 9 in federal
court in Washington, said the Food and Drug Administration has
the authority to require labels warning of the health risks of
smoking. The companies are seeking a preliminary injunction
delaying the rule, scheduled to take effect Sept. 22, 2012. </p>
<p>The FDA regulation mandates that cigarette packs, cartons
and advertising display graphic warning labels. The warnings
will be accompanied by pictures of rotting teeth or damaged
lungs to deter smokers. </p>
<p>The public interest strongly mitigates against delaying
health warnings that more effectively convey the extraordinary,
undisputed health risks created by the use of plaintiffs''
products, the Justice Department said. </p>
<p>Lorillard, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Commonwealth Brands
Inc. and Liggett Group LLC sued last month saying the regulation
violates the First Amendment. </p>
<p>Ronald Milstein, Greensboro, North Carolina-based
Lorillard''s senior vice president and general counsel, didn''t
return a telephone message after normal business hours seeking
comment on the filing. </p>
<p>Representatives in the public relations department of
Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), R.J. Reynolds''s parent, didn''t reply to
a phone message seeking comment. </p>
<p>The case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 11-cv-1482, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Ford Asks Court to Reverse $2 Billion Award to Truck Dealers </p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. (F) asked an Ohio appeals court to reverse a $2
billion judgment awarded in June to a class of commercial truck
dealers who claimed the company overcharged them for 11 years. </p>
<p>The dealers sued Ford in 2002, claiming the company broke
an agreement to sell trucks at published prices, which forced
them to pay more from 1987 through 1998 and cut into profits.
Cuyahoga County Judge Peter J. Corrigan in June upheld a $4.5
million verdict awarded to one Ohio dealer in February by a
Cleveland jury. The Cleveland judge also said Ford had to pay
similar damages and interest to a class of about 3,000 other
dealers. </p>
<p>The judge improperly found Ford liable before trial for
breach of franchise agreements and prevented the company from
defending itself on damages, the automaker said in a Sept. 2
filing with the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County in
Cleveland. Ford also said Corrigan shouldn''t have applied his
findings on one dispute across hundreds of thousands of
transactions involving other dealers. </p>
<p>The trial court''s grant of summary judgment on liability
exemplifies the court''s repeated and erroneous election to take
away from the jury key questions on liability and damages,
Ford said in court papers. The trial court deprived Ford of
its rights to due process and a trial by jury. </p>
<p>The total $2 billion award is five times higher than the
amount of the largest-ever jury award against Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford in a lawsuit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The court''s judgment was the largest of any type in Ohio
history, Ford said in its appeal. That staggering judgment was
as unwarranted as it was unprecedented, the company said. It
resulted from a series of serious errors by the trial court, any
one of which compels reversal. </p>
<p>Ford wasn''t denied any rights, James Lowe, the dealers''
lawyer, said in an interview Sept. 9. Corrigan''s treatment of
the suit by awarding damages to the class was perfectly
appropriate, he said. </p>

Co., CV 02-483526, Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio

<p>Health-Care Ruling May Delay Final Answer From U.S. High Court </p>
<p>A federal appeals court decision cast doubt on the prospect
that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality
of President Barack Obama''s health-care overhaul before the 2012
elections. </p>
<p>The three-judge panel said Sept 8 that it didn''t yet have
the power to consider a challenge to the law''s requirement that
Americans, by 2014, either acquire health insurance or pay a
penalty. The court ruled that judicial review must wait for the
assessment of a fine -- something that wouldn''t occur until the
following year. </p>
<p>The health-care law, which has divided courts around the
country, was already in line for possible Supreme Court review
early next year, with a ruling likely in June. The Sept. 8
ruling adds a new legal wrinkle, raising a procedural issue that
might delay the ultimate outcome. </p>
<p>It''s still the case that we will get some decision from
the United States Supreme Court the last week of this coming
June, said Walter Dellinger, the former U.S. solicitor general
who filed a brief backing the law on behalf of congressional
Democrats. But it is possible that ruling could be that no one
has the right to challenge this law until they''ve declined to
pay the penalty or sought a refund. </p>
<p>Three federal appeals courts have now considered the law,
each reaching a different conclusion. A Cincinnati-based appeals
court upheld the law in June, calling it a valid use of
Congress''s power to regulate interstate commerce. An appeal in
that case is now before the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>An Atlanta-based court disagreed, upholding arguments by 26
states that Congress had exceeded its power under the commerce
clause. The U.S. Justice Department is scheduled to say by the
end of the month whether it will seek Supreme Court review of
that ruling or instead ask a larger panel of appellate judges to
reconsider. </p>
<p>The latest ruling, from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, took a third approach. The panel
focused on a law, known as the Anti-Injunction Act, barring
lawsuits that seek to block the collection of federal taxes. The
measure says that no suit for the purpose of restraining the
assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any
court by any person. </p>
<p>Writing for herself and one other panel member, Judge Diana
Gribbon Motz, said the law meant the court couldn''t hear a suit
filed by Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg,
Virginia, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. </p>
<p>The cases are Liberty University v. Geithner, 10-02347, and
Commonwealth of Virginia v. Sebelius, 11-01057, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Richmond). </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>Ex-Industrial Enterprises CEO Gets Up to 21 Years for Fraud </p>
<p>Former Industrial Enterprises of America Inc. (IEAM) Chief
Executive Officer James W. Margulies was sentenced to seven to
21 years in prison for his role in a $110 million securities
fraud. </p>
<p>New York State Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro handed
down the sentence in Manhattan Sept. 9. Margulies, of Cleveland,
was convicted in July of grand larceny, scheming to defraud,
conspiracy, violation of general business law and falsifying
business records in what prosecutors called a massive pump-
and-dump scheme. </p>
<p>This is basically a case of greed, Carro said. He said
he wanted the sentence to serve as a general deterrent that
will scream out from this courtroom that people like you are
going to be treated harshly. </p>
<p>Margulies and another former Industrial Enterprises CEO,
John D. Mazzuto, were indicted in May 2010. Mazzuto pleaded
guilty and testified against Margulies, a lawyer, at trial.
Mazzuto hasn''t been sentenced. </p>
<p>My actions were well-intended at the time, Margulies
told Carro Sept. 9. By the time I recognized the potential
harm of my actions, it was too late. </p>
<p>He asked for probation, telling the judge that he needed to
be at home with his family, including a child who has special
needs. Carro rejected that request. </p>
<p>It''s not my sentence that''s going to devastate these
children, the judge said. It is your actions. </p>
<p>The case is People v. Margulies, 2503-2010, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan.) </p>
<p>Former Taiwan Semiconductor Manager Seeks 12-Month Sentence </p>
<p>A former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. manager who
pleaded guilty to being part of an insider-trading scheme
involving Primary Global Research LLC is seeking a 12-month
sentence. </p>
<p>Manosha Karunatilaka, who pleaded guilty in May to taking
about $35,000 to pass inside tips about the company''s orders
while working as a Primary Global consultant, asked the
sentencing judge Sept. 9 to give him a split term of six months
in jail and six months of home confinement. </p>
<p>I am a good person that made a terrible mistake and fell
from grace, Karunatilaka said in a letter to U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff, which was attached to the sentencing request
filed in Manhattan federal court Sept. 9. </p>
<p>Prosecutors argued in a court filing that Karunatilaka
should get from 37 to 46 months in prison. </p>
<p>An analyst at an unnamed New York-based hedge fund which
used Primary Global''s services spoke to Karunatilaka frequently
from 2008 to 2010, prosecutors said in court papers. In May
2009, acting on Karunatilaka''s recommendation to bet that Taiwan
Semiconductor shares would fall, the fund made a profit of about
$1.7 million, the U.S. said. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-CR-32, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>Alliance One, Deltafina Lose EU Appeals of Antitrust Fine </p>
<p>Universal Corp.''s Italian unit Deltafina and Alliance One
International Inc. (AOI) lost European Union court appeals against
antitrust fines totaling 54 million euros ($75 million) for
colluding on prices they paid tobacco growers. </p>
<p>The EU General Court, the 27-nation region''s second-highest
tribunal, ruled Sept. 9 that the penalties were valid. </p>
<p>The European Commission, the EU''s antitrust regulator,
fined four companies, including two Alliance One units, 56
million euros for unlawfully rigging prices for more than six
years in a cartel that ended in 2002. Deltafina was fined 30
million euros while Alliance One was held jointly liable with
its two units for a 24 million-euro penalty. </p>
<p>The ruling follows decisions by the court in a similar case
concerning the Spanish market last year in which Deltafina won a
reduction in an 11.9 million-euro antitrust fine for fixing the
prices it paid Spanish growers for tobacco. Alliance One last
October lost an appeal over its fine in the cartel. </p>
<p>Representatives of the companies in the U.S. didn''t respond
to calls outside normal office hours. </p>
<p>The cases are: T-12/06, Deltafina v. European Commission;
T-25/06, Alliance One v. European Commission. </p>

<p>On The Docket </p>
<p>Ex-Bear Stearns Fund Managers'' SEC Trial Set for February </p>
<p>Former Bear Stearns Cos. hedge-fund managers Ralph Cioffi
and Matthew Tannin, acquitted in 2009 of criminal charges they
misled investors who lost $1.6 billion, are set to face trial in
February in a related civil case brought by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Frederic Block in Brooklyn, New York,
set the trial date for Feb. 13 at a conference Sept. 9. </p>
<p>A federal jury in November 2009 found Cioffi and Tannin not
guilty of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud in the first
criminal trial stemming from a federal probe of the collapse of
the subprime-mortgage market. Cioffi, 55, was portfolio manager
for the hedge funds and Tannin was their chief operating
officer. </p>
<p>We have had no discussions of substance, John D.
Worland, a lawyer for the SEC, told Block when the judge asked
about the possibility of a settlement, which would make a trial
unnecessary. </p>
<p>Kevin Callahan, an SEC spokesman, and Marc Weinstein, a
lawyer for Cioffi at Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP in Manhattan,
declined to comment on the case. Nina Beattie, a lawyer for
Tannin at Brune  Richards LLP in Manhattan, also declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Cioffi and Tannin were indicted in June 2008, a year after
their hedge funds failed. Bear Stearns collapsed less than a
year after the funds failed, and was purchased by New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The SEC claims the two men misled investors about the
funds'' deepening financial troubles and their own holdings in
the investment pools. The regulator''s case requires a lower
standard of proof than a criminal conviction. </p>
<p>The civil case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Cioffi, 08-cv-2457, and the criminal case is U.S. v. Cioffi, 08-
CR-00415, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley said it may lower
its year-end forecast for the euro after the currency declined
to less than the bank''s $1.36 prediction, as the European
Central Bank damped the outlook for interest rate increases. </p>
<p>The Frankfurt-based central bank is likely to suffer from
reputational issues after Juergen Stark quit its executive
board last week and this will likely be unhelpful for the
single currency, analysts including Hans Redeker, head of
foreign-exchange strategy, wrote in a client note today. </p>
<p>Europe''s common currency may slump to about $1.3055 if it
weakens to less than a support level at $1.3440, the
analysts wrote. A support level is a price where bids may be
clustered.  </p>
<p>The euro lost 0.4 percent to $1.3603 as of 10:12 a.m. in

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled an
upcoming version of its Windows operating system that can run
handheld touch-screen computers, aimed at narrowing the lead of
Apple Inc. (AAPL)''s iPad in the market for tablets. </p>
<p>Software developers will be able to download a preview of
the program, called Windows 8, tonight, the company said. The
product lets users display favorite applications, people and
information in tiles on the main screen. It will allow ultra-
thin personal computers and tablets to turn on instantly and run
all day on a single charge. </p>
<p>Microsoft is under pressure to put out a new version of
Windows capable of running smaller, thinner tablet computers
with battery life to rival that of the iPad. In the meantime,
Windows sales have missed analysts'' estimates for three straight
quarters and personal-computer sales have stalled as consumers
favor tablets over notebook computers running the software. </p>
<p>It''s very important for them to get this right, said
Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen, who suggests
buying Microsoft shares. They can''t compete with what''s out
there today in tablets. </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft took the wraps off
Windows 8 today at a conference for developers in Anaheim,
California, without saying when it will go on sale. The product,
previewed in June, is an attempt to vault Microsoft into a fast-
growing market controlled by Apple and Google Inc.''s Android
software. </p>
<p>Tablet Market </p>
<p>Sixty million media tablets will ship in 2011, and 74
percent of those will be Apple''s iPads, according to an August
forecast by IHS Inc. The global market is expected to rise to
275.3 million units in 2015, with Apple forecast to claim 43.6
percent of the market at that point. </p>
<p>In the quarter that ended in June, Apple sold 9.3 million
iPads. About 20 percent of them went to customers who would have
otherwise bought a Windows PC, estimated Colin Gillis, an
analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. </p>
<p>The need to compete has led Microsoft for the first time to
offer a Windows computer operating system that runs on chip
technology from ARM Holdings Plc. (ARM) The program is the biggest
operating-system change Microsoft has made since Windows 95,
Microsoft Vice President Julie Larson-Green said in June. </p>
<p>Windows 8''s design resembles Microsoft''s software for
mobile phones in its use of digital tiles instead of icons to
help users move between programs. </p>
<p>Re-imagined Windows'' </p>
<p>From the chipset to the experience, Windows 8 re-imagines
what Windows can be, Sinofsky said in a keynote address today.
Developers at the conference will get a prototype tablet
computer with the Windows 8 preview software. The machine was
made by Samsung Electronics Co. and runs an Intel Corp. (INTC) chip. </p>
<p>Like Microsoft''s Windows 7, the new software has touch-
controlled tiles that can be automatically updated to display
information from applications on the computer''s start screen.
For example, a weather application can tell users that the
forecast is sunny without requiring them to open the app. </p>
<p>The software also will run on desktop and laptop computers
via a touch screen, mouse or keyboard. Windows 8 will run
virtually all of the existing Windows applications, the
company said in today''s statment. </p>
<p>Besides the new design, called Metro, the software also
offers the option of switching to the regular desktop look
available in Windows now. By switching to that mode, users can
employ Windows 7 apps and devices. </p>
<p>Windows Store </p>
<p>The software will have a Windows Store for selling apps,
and apps can work together and share information. </p>
<p>Microsoft first released a version of Windows for tablet
computers in 2002, though the devices used a stylus and had few
programs tailored to the new form. Many were as large as regular
notebooks and had similar battery life. </p>
<p>Tablets caught on in 2010 when Apple released the iPad,
promising 10 hours of battery life. Since then, companies
including Samsung Electronics Co. and Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc. have started selling touch-screen tablets running Google''s
Android software. </p>
<p>Microsoft also said it''s approaching 450 million copies
sold of its current operating system, Windows 7. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said trading
revenue will drop about 30 percent this quarter from the prior
three months as the economy weakened and volume declined. </p>
<p>Corporations pulled back from the market, particularly in
August, James Staley chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s
investment bank, said today at a Barclays financial-services
conference in New York. Debt and equity sales were down across
the board as were mergers and acquisitions, Staley said. </p>
<p>The company earned $5.5 billion in equity and fixed-income
trading during the second quarter. Third-quarter fees from
investment banking will fall by about half, Staley said,
projecting about $1 billion in total fees compared with $1.92
billion in the second quarter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will report a modest loss in its private-
equity unit of about $100 million, Staley said. </p>
<p>The bank''s exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and
Spain is about $14 billion, a figure that includes loans and
derivatives contracts and is mostly a mix of sovereign and bank
debt, Staley said. </p>
<p>The issue really is if there is an uncontrolled default
in Europe, to define the contagion of that is very difficult,
he said. What we learned in 2008 is that we are
interconnected. I don''t think any of us have been able to figure
out what the ultimate impact would be of a default in Greece. </p>

increase, a person familiar with the board''s thinking said. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s cash and short-term investments swelled 43
percent in the past fiscal year. With the shares losing more
than 7 percent of their value in 2011, more investors want the
company to boost its payout. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has said that Microsoft''s dividend policy is to raise
payments in line with annual gains in operating income, which
climbed 13 percent in the year that ended in June. </p>
<p>That cash is better in our hands than theirs, said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker
Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.2 billion in assets,
including Microsoft shares. I''d hope they''d raise it more. </p>
<p>In light of investor sentiment, Microsoft is considering a
larger increase, said the person familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be named because the decision is private. Still,
the board is more likely to retain its policy of raising the
payout in line with operating income, the person said. </p>
<p>Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Smaller Than Average? </p>
<p>Microsoft has paid out about 25 percent of earnings as
dividends since starting the payments in 2003, according to
Bloomberg data. Dividend-paying companies with similar market
valuations to Microsoft are paying closer to 40 percent to 50
percent, the data show. </p>
<p>Returning more cash to investors also may be hindered by
Microsoft''s overseas holdings. About $45 billion, or 85 percent,
of Microsoft''s cash and short-term investments is outside the
U.S., the company said a July 28 regulatory filing. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft would have to pay taxes if the
company brings it into the U.S. to use for dividends. </p>
<p>About half of the company''s annual cash flow from
operations is generated outside the U.S., Heather Bellini, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York, said in a Sept.
6 report. That leaves about $15 billion to $17 billion available
for dividends and share repurchases in the current fiscal year,
she said. Bellini anticipates that the dividend will rise to 18
cents to 20 cents. </p>
<p>Microsoft shares rose 15 cents to $25.89 yesterday on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has declined 7.2 percent this
year. </p>
<p>Technology Peers </p>
<p>Among technology company peers, Microsoft''s payout falls in
the middle. Intel Corp. (INTC), Sage Group Plc and SAP AG are paying a
larger portion of earnings, while Oracle Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and CA Inc. pay less, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Bloomberg dividend forecasts look at seven criteria,
including dividend history and public estimates. A payout
increase to 19 cents would boost the yield to 2.9 percent from
2.5 percent currently, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>If Microsoft were to match its peers on payout ratios, it
would equate to a dividend yield increase to 6 percent from the
current 2.6 percent, and include an approximate doubling of the
company''s dividend, said Neil Herman, an analyst at
Ticonderoga Securities, in a research report last month. </p>
<p>The shares might surge past $35 if the board decided to
majorly boost the company''s dividend, Herman said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said developers
have downloaded 500,000 copies of the preview version of Windows
8 since its debut yesterday, evidence of interest in an
operating system that will vie with Apple Inc. (AAPL) software. </p>
<p>While it''s clear we have a long way to go still with
Windows 8, we''ve been gratified by the reactions and the
interest, Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today at
a conference for developers in Anaheim, California. One area
needing more work: a Windows 8 version that runs on chips with
technology from ARM Holdings Plc, which is very, very
important to us, Ballmer said. </p>
<p>Microsoft is rushing to complete Windows 8 because the
company wants an operating system capable of running thinner,
lighter tablet machines with battery power that can rival
Apple''s iPad. That need has led the world''s largest software
maker to make its Windows personal-computer operating system
compatible with ARM-based chips for the first time. ARM
processors typically run smartphones and other mobile gadgets. </p>
<p>At the conference, Microsoft gave attendees a prototype
machine running an Intel Corp. (INTC) chip rather than an ARM model, a
sign that version is farther along. Microsoft hasn''t said when
Windows 8 devices will go on sale. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 46 cents to
$26.50 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have lost 5.1 percent of their value this year. </p>
<p>Re-Imagining'' Company </p>
<p>While Microsoft Windows President Steven Sinofsky yesterday
said that Windows 8 re-imagines what Windows can do, Ballmer
today said that the effort -- as well as Microsoft''s push into
Internet-based cloud services and new types of hardware --
represent a re-imagining of the entire company. </p>
<p>Even as it focuses on tablets, phones and cloud computing,
the company will keep Windows at the heart of its strategy,
Ballmer said. </p>
<p>Windows is at the center, he said. People question
whether that is a good idea. I think it''s an exceptionally good
idea. </p>
<p>Windows Phone, the mobile-phone software that Microsoft
released last year, hasn''t performed as well as Ballmer would
have liked, he said. Still, positive reception from those who
have bought the devices, as well as the support from handset
makers, gives him hope for the future, he said. </p>
<p>I''m not saying I love where we are, but I am very
optimistic on where we can be, Ballmer said. </p>
<p>When asked if Microsoft''s Internet-search partnership with
Yahoo was at risk, given the company''s ouster of CEO Carol Bartz, Ballmer said he''s not worried. </p>
<p>The partnership will remain strong no matter where they
want to take their business or whoever they happen to install
next as CEO, he said. </p>

annual analyst meeting in Anaheim, California. I can read a
lot of places where people question whether that is a good idea.

<p>While Microsoft has to re-imagine Windows, the company
has no reason not to build on the brand and technological

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it
lowered forecasts for the euro versus the dollar as fiscal
tensions in the region increase. </p>
<p>The shared currency will trade at $.140 at the end of the
year, down from $.145, the New York-based firm said in note to

$1.45 and $1.50, from $1.50 and $1.55 respectively. Analysts led
by Thomas Stolper, chief foreign exchange strategist in London,
continue to expect euro-dollar to rise again, albeit from a
slightly lower starting point. </p>
<p>Failure of euro area governments to calm market concern
over Greek default and contagion, relatively little additional
fiscal tightening in the U.S. and weaker-than-expected global

<p>The extent of the friction and the relative weakness of

<p>Producers of electric-car batteries
such as LG Chem Ltd. (051910) and Johnson Controls Inc. (JCI) are building new
plants at such a pace that capacity will grow to almost double
automakers'' demand, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance report shows. </p>
<p>While manufacturers will have capacity to make 35 gigawatt
hours of batteries by 2013, carmakers have committed to produce
as many as 839,000 plug-in electric vehicles needing a total of
18 gigawatt-hours of storage, the London-based researcher said. </p>
<p>The larger, mainly Asian, conglomerates can cope with
limited demand and compete by lowering prices but smaller pure-
play battery makers will be left vying for an increasingly
limited number of supply contracts, said Ali Izadi-Najafabadi,
an energy technologies analyst at New Energy Finance. </p>
<p>The glut of factories may push smaller manufacturers out of
the running for orders and into areas such as energy storage for
surplus power from electricity grids, according to today''s
report. Battery prices may also decline to $350 per kilowatt-
hour in 2020 from $800 to $1,000 now, New Energy Finance said. </p>
<p>Among Asian companies best able to cope with the surplus
are LG Chem, South Korea''s biggest chemicals maker, Seoul-based
SK Innovation Co., Toshiba Corp. (6502) in Tokyo and SB LiMotive, a
joint venture between Samsung Electronics Co. and Robert Bosch
GmbH, said Shu Sun, another analyst at the research group. </p>
<p>Nissan, GM </p>
<p>LG Chem in April said it aims to spend 2 trillion won ($1.8
billion) by 2013 to expand its battery capacity for electric
cars. Nissan Motor Co. plans to make 500,000 batteries a year by
2015 through its Automotive Energy Supply Corp. venture. </p>
<p>Nissan, based in Yokohama, Japan, and Detroit-based General
Motors Co. (GM) both began selling new electric cars in December.
Battery making has surged in the U.S., where spending under the
government''s Recovery Act has channeled about $2.4 billion into
the products, their components and charging infrastructure for
vehicles, according to U.S. Department of Energy figures. </p>
<p>The U.S. is set to hold as much as 40 percent of capacity
by 2015, up from 2 percent before the stimulus, according to the
energy department. Of companies receiving funding, Ener1 Inc. (HEV)''s
EnerDel unit is expected to struggle the most, Sun said. It
received a grant of $118.5 million for a plant in Indianapolis. </p>
<p>Brian Sinderson, a spokesman for Ener1, didn''t immediately
reply to an e-mail and voicemail seeking comment. </p>
<p>The department also provided $299.2 million for a Johnson
Controls factory in Holland, Michigan, the largest grant under
the program. Waltham, Massachusetts-based A123 Systems Inc. (AONE) got
$249.1 million for plant at Romulus and Brownstown in the state. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will shut its Global Alpha
fund after clients pulled money from the quantitative trading
pool that was once the firm''s largest hedge fund. </p>
<p>Global Alpha will stop charging fees at the end of this
month and aims to finish liquidating most assets by mid-October,
according to a letter that Goldman Sachs Asset Management sent
to clients Sept. 14. The fund, which managed $11 billion of
assets in 2007, had less than $1.7 billion at the end of June,
according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the numbers aren''t public. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, has been shrinking Global Alpha since
2007 when it lost 40 percent because of bad bets on currencies,
equities and bonds worldwide. The fund''s co-managers Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski quit in March 2009, and Katinka Domotorffy took charge of the quantitative investment strategies
unit, which uses computers to pick securities and oversees $56
billion. </p>
<p>Reuters reported yesterday that the Global Alpha fund was
down 12 percent through the end of August, and the Wall Street
Journal reported that it was being shut. Ed Canaday, a spokesman
for the New York-based bank, confirmed the letter''s contents and
said he couldn''t comment on the performance. </p>
<p>Lehman Claims </p>
<p>Domotorffy is leaving at year-end and being replaced by new
managers, including Armen Avanessians, a partner who has served
on the securities division''s executive committee since 2003,
according to a separate letter to investors Sept. 14. Ron Hua,
who oversaw $12 billion of equity assets at PanAgora Asset
Management Inc., was hired as chief investment officer and head
of the quantitative equity alpha business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs wrote in the letter that it aims to
distribute 85 percent to 90 percent of the total proceeds from
the fund''s assets to clients by the end of October. The fund''s
claims against Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which declared
bankruptcy three years ago, may take longer and the fund may
have liabilities to Lehman as well, according to the letter. </p>
<p>We have extensively reviewed the fund''s claims against,
and potential liabilities to, Lehman Brothers and intend to
vigorously pursue a resolution with Lehman Brothers that is in
the best interests of investors in the fund, Goldman Sachs
wrote. We cannot predict when the fund will be able to make
final distributions, if any, to investors in the fund. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is aiming to build the fund-management unit
and improve its performance. The overall business had $844
billion under management at the end of June and generated 13
percent of the firm''s revenue in this year''s first six months. </p>
<p>Asset Management Moves </p>
<p>Avanessians, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and became a
partner in 1994, is the latest executive to move into asset
management from other parts of the bank. Jim O''Neill, the chief
economist, was appointed chairman of asset management last year.
The investment unit''s co-heads, Timothy J. O''Neill and Edward C. Forst, came from other divisions. </p>
<p>Bill Fallon, who became chief investment officer and head
of alpha strategies when Domotorffy took over, will cede the
equity business to Hua and focus on quantitative macro funds,
according to the letter. Don Mulvihill will remain chief
investment officer and head of customized beta strategies,
Goldman Sachs said. Both will report to Avanessians, who will be
based in New York. He will report to O''Neill and Forst, who
signed the letter. </p>
<p>Domotorffy joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 as a portfolio
manager and researcher with the quantitative global macro and
fixed-income teams, according to the letter. She became head of
strategy for the quantitative investment strategies group in
2007 before taking the leadership role two years later. </p>
<p>Carhart is now running Kepos Capital Management LP, which
has $150 million under management and has made a 9 percent
return so far this year, before fees, according to a person
familiar with the matter. </p>

<p>John Mack will cede his chairman
role at Morgan Stanley to Chief Executive Officer James Gorman
on Jan. 1, capping a 35-year career at the firm that included
record losses and a government bailout. </p>
<p>Mack, 66, is completing the two years he promised to serve
in the job when he ceded the CEO title to Gorman, 53, at the end
of 2009. He will leave the board to become a senior adviser, the
New York-based company said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, more
than tripled net income last year, boosted by gains in both the
investment bank where Mack spent most of his career and the
retail brokerage that Gorman ran when he joined in 2006. </p>
<p>From the board''s point of view, Gorman has proved himself
as an executive, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. who recommends buying Morgan Stanley (MS) stock and
once served as its treasurer. He''s embraced both sides of the
firm, and the firm doesn''t have the internal dissension issues
that existed before. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was the world''s largest securities firm when
Mack returned after a four-year absence in June 2005 to replace
CEO Philip J. Purcell, who left under pressure from investors
and employees. Mack''s efforts to boost trading revenue as well
as businesses including private equity and mortgage-bond
underwriting backfired when the company posted its first
quarterly loss in 2007 and the global credit crunch toppled
smaller rival Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>Taxpayer Bailout </p>
<p>The company sold stakes to China Investment Corp. and
Japanese bank Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group to raise capital
and converted to a bank in 2008. Morgan Stanley also took $107
billion of Federal Reserve emergency loans, more than any other
company, during the financial crisis. </p>
<p>His contributions to the firm are innumerable, but none
was more critical than the leadership he provided in guiding
Morgan Stanley through a financial crisis that claimed many of
our peers, Gorman said in the statement. For more than 30
years, he has helped to define the firm''s distinctive culture
and build our franchise across the globe. </p>
<p>Mack said in 2009 that he considers his own greatest
accomplishment to be leading the firm through the 2008 crisis,
which wiped out Lehman Brothers and led Bear Stearns Cos. and
Merrill Lynch  Co. to be sold to larger companies. </p>
<p>I said to my wife, when things were really crazy, You
know, there''s a chance I will lose this firm,'' Mack said in a
2009 interview. But I would rather be doing this than sitting
on a beach reading a book. </p>
<p>Strategy Shift </p>
<p>Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz,
Florida, said that Mack changed strategy too many times at
Morgan Stanley as he reacted to circumstances. </p>
<p>It created a company which had no clear vision of where
it was going, Bove said. Overall, I would have to say his
tutelage of the company was not effective. </p>
<p>In giving Gorman the chairman job, Morgan Stanley is ending
a two-year experiment in separating the two positions. Bank of
America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., the biggest- and third-biggest
U.S. banks by assets, have separated the two jobs. JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the second- and fifth-
largest U.S. banks, have a single executive serving both roles. </p>
<p>The company gained $1.11, or 7.2 percent, to $16.59 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 4:15 p.m. and was the
second biggest gainer in the 81-company Standard  Poor''s 500
Financials Index after Lincoln National Corp. Morgan Stanley
stock is still down more than 40 percent this year. </p>
<p>I don''t know what his legacy will be, said Kenneth Crawford, a senior portfolio manager at Argent Capital
Management LLC in St. Louis, which oversees about $1.2 billion
and doesn''t own Morgan Stanley stock. Mack came back and then
allegedly resurrected Morgan Stanley and then took enough risk
that his company was on the brink. </p>

<p>Carolina Lightcap resigned
unexpectedly as president of Disney Channels Worldwide after
less than two years on the job. </p>
<p>Gary Marsh was named president and chief creative officer
of the unit, Burbank, California-based Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said
today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The move puts children''s networks including Disney Channel
and Disney XD into the hands of the creator of some of its
biggest shows, including Hannah Montana and High School
Musical. Lightcap, plucked from Disney Channels'' Latin
American operations in November 2009, said she was leaving with
some Disney cable channels'' ratings at their highest ever. </p>
<p>I readily embrace change as a good thing, and really look
forward to the next chapter of my career, Lightcap said in a
letter to her staff. </p>
<p>The departure by Lightcap, an 11-year Disney veteran who
had headed marketing in Latin America, is the second high-level
resignation at Disney this month. </p>
<p>On Sept. 6, Andrew P. Mooney resigned as chairman of the
consumer products unit to seek a larger executive role. </p>
<p>The Disney Channel''s ratings were up by 10 percent in the
company''s most recent quarter, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said in a Aug. 9 earnings conference call. Ratings at XD
channel, which is targeted at boys, increased by 24 percent. </p>
<p>For the period ended July 2, the worldwide Disney Channel
operation contributed to the company''s 11 percent increase in
operating earnings for its media networks unit, which includes
the ESPN sports channel, Disney said on Aug. 9. </p>
<p>Phineas and Ferb'' </p>
<p>Marsh, who was president of entertainment and chief
creative officer at Disney Channels, most recently developed the
Phineas and Ferb franchise. A movie based on the characters,
Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension, was cable TV''s
most-watched movie this past summer, Disney said on Aug. 6. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest theme-park company and the
owner of Pixar and Marvel movie studios, rose 65 cents to $32.94
today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s David Kostin slashed his year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor''s
500 Index by 11 percent to 1,250, citing continued uncertainty
in the global markets due to Europe''s debt crisis. </p>
<p>Kostin, the equity strategist at the firm, previously
predicted the benchmark equity index would climb to 1,400. This
was Kostin''s second SP 500 forecast reduction in the past two
months, following his shift from 1,450 on Aug. 5. </p>
<p>The unstable macro environment is likely to persist for
the foreseeable future because Europe currently lacks both the
institutional structure and policy tools to solve the festering
sovereign debt crisis, the New York-based strategist wrote in
a report dated yesterday. Investors believe a nontrivial
probability exists that the crisis will trigger a global
financial dislocation similar to 2008. </p>
<p>Investors have fled risky assets since July amid concern
European officials may fail to contain the region''s debt crisis
and the U.S. economy will slip into a recession, sending yields
on 10-year Treasuries to a record low and pushing the SP 500
down as much as 18 percent from its April high. Goldman Sachs is
the third Wall Street firm to cut its forecast for stocks this
week, following Wells Fargo  Co. and Barclays Plc. </p>
<p>Kostin kept his estimates on earnings by companies in the
SP 500 at $96 a share this year and $102 in 2012. The index
rose 1.7 percent to 1,209.11 at 4 p.m. New York time, the fourth
straight day of gains amid optimism Europe is working to tame
the credit crisis. The European Central Bank said today it will
lend dollars to euro-area banks in a series of three-month loans
to ensure they have enough of the U.S. currency through the end
of the year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s EMC Mortgage
unit was sued by Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the trustee for a mortgage
portfolio, for refusing to buy back more than 800 defective home
loans. </p>
<p>EMC rejected repeated repurchase demands for the loans
in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in a public version of the
complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. The case was initially filed under seal. </p>
<p>The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of
defaults and foreclosures, Wells Fargo said in the complaint.
Approximately three-quarters of the loans in the trust have
been modified or liquidated, or are now seriously delinquent. </p>
<p>The complaint is the second Wells Fargo has filed as
trustee against EMC. The trustee settled a suit brought in
January after EMC agreed to turn over files for more than 2,000
underlying mortgages in the trust. </p>
<p>Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>A review of 948 loan files revealed that at least 840, or
about 89 percent, failed to comply with EMC''s representations
and warranties, according to the complaint. As many as 1,503
mortgage loans are subject to repurchase, Wells Fargo said. </p>
<p>Of those 1,503 loans, 49 percent already have been
liquidated, according to a letter filed as an exhibit to the
complaint. Principal losses on those loans, including accrued
interest, total about $214.4 million, according to the letter. </p>
<p>About 51 percent of the loans are still held by the trust,
with an outstanding balance of about $344.5 million, according
to the letter. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said new managers will run
the quantitative funds unit and that Katinka Domotorffy is
retiring after 13 years at the firm. </p>
<p>Armen Avanessians, a partner who has served on the
securities division''s executive committee since 2003, will head
the global quantitative business within asset management, the
New York-based company said in a letter to clients yesterday.
Ron Hua, who oversaw $12 billion of equity assets at PanAgora
Asset Management Inc., was hired as chief investment officer and
head of the quantitative equity alpha business. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is aiming to build the firm''s fund-management
unit and improve its performance. The business had $844 billion
under management at the end of June and generated 13 percent of
the firm''s revenue in the first six months of this year. </p>
<p>Avanessians, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and became a
partner in 1994, is the latest executive to move into asset
management from other parts of the bank. Jim O''Neill, the chief
economist, was appointed chairman of asset management last year.
The investment unit''s co-heads, Timothy J. O''Neill and Edward C. Forst, came from other divisions. </p>
<p>Domotorffy took charge of the quant-funds unit, which uses
computer models to pick securities to trade, after co-heads Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski quit in March 2009. Carhart and
Iwanowski had managed Goldman Sachs''s Global Alpha fund, which
was the firm''s largest hedge fund before sustaining losses and
client redemptions in 2007 and 2008. </p>
<p>Beta Strategies </p>
<p>Bill Fallon, who became chief investment officer and head
of alpha strategies when Domotorffy took over, will cede the
equity business to Hua and focus on quantitative macro funds,
according to the letter. Don Mulvihill will remain chief
investment officer and head of customized beta strategies,
Goldman Sachs said. Both will report to Avanessians, who will be
based in New York. </p>
<p>Avanessians will report to O''Neill and Forst, who signed
the letter. Its contents were confirmed by Ed Canaday, a company
spokesman. The moves were reported yesterday by Reuters. </p>
<p>Domotorffy joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 as a portfolio
manager and researcher with the quantitative global macro and
fixed-income teams, according to the letter. She became head of
strategy for the quantitative investment strategies group in
2007 before taking the leadership role two years later. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs gained $3.25, or 3.1 percent, to $107.79 at
1:18 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock had fallen 38 percent this year through yesterday. </p>

<p>Wall Street banks seeking to unload
commercial mortgages amassed before Europe''s sovereign crisis
deepened and a slowing economy rattled markets are getting a
reprieve from rising yields after Morgan Stanley sold bonds
yesterday that demonstrated demand for the debt. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp. sold the top-
ranked 10-year portion of a $1.5 billion bond offering at 185
basis points more than the benchmark swap rate yesterday after
marketing the debt earlier at as much as 215, a person familiar
with the offering said. Similar debt that Deutsche Bank AG and
UBS AG sold last month paid a spread of 200. </p>
<p>Relative yields on securities tied to offices, hotels and
shopping centers have been hovering at about the highest levels
since June 2010 as investors shun riskier assets amid concern a
Greek default may infect European lenders and as economists
lower U.S. growth forecasts. Banks have pulled back from making
new loans to package into bonds as price swings erode profit
margins on the deals. </p>
<p>This momentum certainly would encourage banks, but it
takes a few more pricings to demonstrate a trend, said Jeffrey Berenbaum, a commercial-mortgage debt analyst at Citigroup Inc.
in New York. It''s a matter of taking a step back to see how
things settle before looking to continue lending. </p>
<p>Barren Pipeline </p>
<p>While lenders are poised to sell as much as $6 billion of
stockpiled debt through October, the rest of the year may have
no offerings, Bank of America analysts said in a Sept. 9 report.
More than $24 billion of the debt has been raised in 2011,
following $11.5 billion last year, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is marketing a $1 billion issue, according to
people familiar with the sale. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo  Co., Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc and Deutsche Bank AG are also arranging transactions, the
people said. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, a benchmark gauge of U.S.
corporate credit risk fell for a third day from a two-year high.
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 2.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 126.4 basis points as of 12:03 p.m. in New York,
according to Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>The index, which typically falls as investor confidence
improves and rises as it deteriorates, has decreased from 135.9
basis points on Sept. 12, its highest level since July 2009.
Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>Commercial Paper </p>
<p>U.S. commercial paper outstanding declined $22.6 billion
to $1.043 trillion in the week ended Sept. 14, the Federal
Reserve said today on its website. That''s the lowest level since
the market, which has fallen for nine straight weeks, reached
$1.042 trillion in the period ended Feb. 16, according to Fed
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The commercial-mortgage bond offering from Morgan Stanley
and Bank of America is composed of 63 loans on 76 properties,
the person said. Retail property debt accounts for 46.3 percent
of the offering and office debt is about 30 percent. Loans in
Texas and California account for 31.2 percent of the pool. </p>
<p>Wider Spreads </p>
<p>The securities were priced as German and French leaders
expressed support for Greece remaining in the euro monetary
union and speculation that China may help the region''s most-
indebted nations. </p>
<p>Political and economic turmoil drove relative yields on
top-ranked commercial-mortgage bonds to 303 basis points more
than Treasuries on Aug. 25, the most since June 2010, before
narrowing to 291 yesterday, according to Barclays Plc index
data. </p>
<p>Spreads climbed from this year''s low of 178 on April 26 as
Fed auctions of mortgage securities assumed in the rescue of
American International Group Inc. weighed on credit markets. The
selloff was exacerbated in July as the sovereign-debt crisis
engulfed Italy and lawmakers in Washington clashed over raising
the U.S. debt ceiling, leading SP to cut America''s top credit
grade on Aug. 5. </p>
<p>Economists are lowering their growth forecasts for the U.S.
Gross domestic product will expand 1.7 percent this year, less
than the May forecast of 2.8 percent, according to a survey by
the National Association for Business Economics issued Sept. 12
in Washington. </p>
<p>Delinquencies Fall </p>
<p>Commercial-mortgage bond sales have tumbled from a record
$234 billion in 2007. A dropoff in new lending may make it
harder for some borrowers to refinance maturing loans, according
to the Bank of America analysts led by Alan Todd. </p>
<p>Borrowers with less capital or less attractive properties
will obviously have fewer options, the New York-based analysts
wrote. It is likely that the trend of liquidating smaller
loans and modifying and extending larger loans will persist. </p>
<p>Delinquencies, which climbed to a record 9.01 percent in
July, fell 36 basis points last month, according to Fitch
Ratings. </p>
<p>Banks have increased the so-called credit enhancement,
which protects AAA bondholders from losses, to 30 percent on
deals offered since last month as investors pushed back on terms
and demanded higher yields. That compares with 16.875 percent on
a $1.48 billion transaction from Wells Fargo and Royal Bank of
Scotland in July. </p>
<p>Nice Pickup'' </p>
<p>The additional investor protection coupled with property
valuations in recent deals compares favorably with bonds sold in
2005, while offering a nice pickup in spread and yield, said
James Grady, a managing director at Deutsche Asset Management in
New York, including commercial-mortgage debt. </p>
<p>This is a trade that makes sense and you will see
investors take advantage of this opportunity while it lasts,
Grady said. </p>
<p>The slide in the safest classes of commercial-mortgage
bonds has made the debt attractive relative to other fixed-
income investments, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Timothy J. Sloan said in a Sept. 12 conference call with analysts. </p>
<p>Spreads blew out pretty significantly over the past few
months, Sloan said, referring to the most senior portions of
commercial-mortgage securities. That''s not the only class that
we think is attractive, but we definitely want to be able to
take advantage of opportunities. </p>

<p>Brent crude and copper may rally as
global economic growth led by emerging markets remains adequate
to drive an expansion in raw-materials demand, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) said, sticking with forecasts for price gains. </p>
<p>We remain constructive on commodities, Allison Nathan,
an analyst at Goldman for more than a decade, said in an
interview today. Still, risks to our bullish views have
risen, said Nathan, citing Europe''s sovereign-debt problems
and a mixed bag of economic data from the United States. </p>
<p>Goldman''s position contrasts with the outlook from Societe
Generale SA''s global asset-allocation team, which said
commodities are in a danger zone as growth slows, according
to a report distributed yesterday. The Standard  Poor''s GSCI
Spot Index of 24 commodities has shed 14 percent since April 11
on speculation that the global recovery is faltering. </p>
<p>We''ve seen emerging-markets demand for key commodities,
including oil, holding up well, Nathan said in Singapore.
There haven''t yet been signs that the economic woes in developed
markets are spreading to emerging economies, she said. </p>
<p>Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April, then turned bullish in May before prices rebounded.
Last month, the bank forecast gains for Brent crude, zinc, and
other commodities over the next 12 months, analysts led by
Jeffrey Currie said in an Aug. 8 report. </p>
<p>Copper may climb to $11,000 per metric ton, while Brent
gains to $130 a barrel, the report said. Three-month copper on
the London Metal Exchange, which reached a record $10,190 per
ton in February, traded at $8,660 per ton at 4:10 p.m. in
Singapore, while Brent was at $112.60 per barrel. </p>
<p>Greek Rescue </p>
<p>French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said yesterday that they are convinced Greece
will stay in the euro area, boosting equity and metals prices.
European governments are aiming to ratify a July 21 accord to
bolster a bailout fund and extend a second rescue to Greece. </p>
<p>Investor skittishness over the spread of Europe''s debt
crisis combined with signs that U.S. growth may be slowing have
roiled markets worldwide. Recent data have shown U.S. retail
sales were unchanged in August, while the economy generated no
jobs and earnings fell. </p>
<p>If we see weakness spreading on a global basis, that
would be a catalyst to expect a weaker demand environment and
potentially weaker prices relative to our forecast, Nathan
said in the interview. If there was a crisis in the European
banking sector, a crisis akin to 2008 could occur and that would
have a large impact on commodity prices. </p>
<p>China Forecasts </p>
<p>Still, Goldman economists forecast that China''s economic
growth may be 9.2 percent next year, compared with an estimate
of 9.3 percent for this year, according to Nathan. The nation is
the world''s largest user of metals and energy. </p>
<p>Low inventories of aluminum, copper and steel in China are
an indicator that demand in the country isn''t that bad,
Julian Zhu, a Goldman analyst, said at a media briefing in
Singapore today. Traders and investors have been concerned that
rising interest rates and a credit-tightening policy in the
nation may lead to slower consumption of raw materials. </p>
<p>The Chinese government is very flexible and if they need,
they can reverse the tightening policy very fast, said Zhu.
This could be very supportive to demand for commodities
because investment by local governments at all levels will see a
Rebound, said Zhu. </p>
<p>Societe Generale''s report said that there may be a
meaningful drop in prices of so-called cyclical commodities
such as oil and copper. Gold may rally from an increase in risk
aversion, according to the report. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) was hired to advise Huawei Technologies Co. on branding
strategy as the Chinese telecommunications gear supplier expands
into tablet computers, smartphones and cloud computing. </p>
<p>The project involves 25 consultants from the world''s
biggest computer-services provider and is expected to be
completed by the end of November, Ross Gan, a Huawei spokesman,
said in an interview today. Harriet Ip, a spokeswoman for
Armonk, New York-based IBM in Singapore, confirmed the
arrangement by phone today. Financial terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>It''s not a traditional branding project where they tell
us how the brand should be positioned, Gan said in a phone
interview from Huawei''s headquarters in Shenzhen, southern
China. It''s more from the management-of-the-process point of
view: How do I manage the brand function within the
organization? Who is responsible for what? </p>
<p>Huawei is expanding its 13-year relationship with IBM as it
seeks to more than triple sales to $100 billion in the next 10
years by expanding into consumer digital devices and enterprise
computing. The thrust requires closely held Huawei to promote to
consumers, businesses and government agencies, including those
in the U.S., where efforts to buy rivals have been rebuffed amid
allegations the company threatens national security. </p>
<p>The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.
in February told Huawei, founded in 1988 by former Chinese army
officer Ren Zhengfei, to divest its purchase of 3Leaf Systems
after lawmakers said the deal threatened national security. </p>
<p>Bids Thwarted </p>
<p>3Leaf, founded in 2004, developed technology for cloud
computing that lets businesses and government agencies move
applications and programs such as e-mail to remote networks
owned and operated by a third party. Huawei was also thwarted in
bids to buy 2Wire and Motorola Inc.''s wireless business last
year, and 3Com Corp. in 2008. </p>
<p>Huawei has said its employees own the company and China''s
government and military don''t hold any shares. Ren has had no
connection to the military since he retired from service more
than two decades ago, according to Huawei. </p>
<p>Huawei in April unveiled plans for the thrust into consumer
devices, including tablets, smartphones and enterprise
computing, setting up computer and communication networks for
businesses and government agencies. </p>
<p>Enterprise Computing </p>
<p>The company said at the time it expects enterprise
computing revenue to grow to as much as $20 billion within five
years, from $2 billion last year. Sales of mobile devices may
rise to $20 billion in the same period from $5 billion last
year. </p>
<p>Huawei''s relationship with IBM started in 1998 when Ren
began traveling to the U.S., Europe and Japan to learn
international best practices as his company expanded globally. </p>
<p>In 1999, the Chinese company added collaboration on
research and development and supply chain management to IBM''s
roles. Human resources management was added in 2005 and
financial management in 2007. The new contract is the first for
work on brand strategy from Huawei, Ip of IBM said. </p>
<p>IBM has a very strong branding strategy, Ip said.
After several rounds of doing this ourselves, we have the
expertise to help clients as well. That''s something we can share
with Huawei and our other clients. </p>
<p>Huawei won its first contract outside China in 1997. It
achieved international sales of more than $100 million by 2000,
and overseas business exceeded contracts in China for the first
time in 2005, according to data supplied by the company. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
exited a money losing bet that the dollar would weaken against a
basket of currencies after turmoil in European markets and
broader risk aversion added to the greenback''s refuge appeal.  </p>
<p>The trade was stopped out after a loss of 2.3 percent,
the New York-based securities firm said in a note today. On Aug.
10, Goldman recommended betting against the dollar with a basket
of currencies comprised of the New Zealand dollar, Russian
ruble, Swedish krona, South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit and
Chilean peso.  </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) plan to offer $1.7 billion in securities tied to
commercial mortgages, resuscitating a deal that was withdrawn
after Standard  Poor''s withdrew its ratings. </p>
<p>The debt will be marketed to investors next week, according
to people familiar with the offering who declined to be
identified because the deal hasn''t been announced. The issue was
originally $1.5 billion. </p>
<p>The transaction was pulled after it was placed with buyers
in July, rankling investors and bankers in the $600 billion
market. The banks canceled the issue on July 28 after SP said
it was halting its ratings of commercial-mortgage bonds because
of potential flaws in its models. The New York-based rating
company resumed grading the securities on Aug. 5, saying the
impact on ratings of the inconsistencies would be generally
modest. </p>
<p>The offering adds to more than $24 billion of the debt
issued in 2011, following $11.5 billion last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its
forecasts for the euro versus the dollar amid signs the European
Central Bank''s focus on inflation has faded and as leaders
disagree over approaches to the region''s debt crisis. </p>
<p>The 17-nation currency will trade at $1.38 at year-end,
compared with an earlier forecast of $1.45, strategists John Normand and Thomas Anthonj wrote today in a client note. The
euro will fetch $1.40 in June 2012, compared with the previous
estimate of $1.48, they wrote. </p>
<p>JPMorgan lowered its projections to reflect ECB''s
dovishness and internal dissent over bond purchases, the
London-based strategists wrote. </p>
<p>The euro weakened 0.6 percent to $1.3792 today in New York,
paring a weekly advance to 1 percent. </p>
<p>The New York-based financial firm joined banks including
BNP Paribas SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and
Nomura Holdings Inc. in lowering year-end targets for the euro
this month. </p>
<p>JPMorgan disagrees with the emerging consensus that the
euro will trend lower over the next year, Normand and Anthonj
wrote in their note. </p>
<p>While Europe faces an enormous funding challenge next
year, authorities also have put programs in place to manage the
debt crisis in peripheral countries, they wrote. There is
potential for the Federal Reserve to buy more Treasuries, and
the U.S. fiscal position will likely deteriorate if even parts
of President Barack Obama jobs program are approved, they wrote. </p>
<p>Inflation Risks Eased </p>
<p>The ECB said yesterday in its monthly bulletin that threats
to euro-area growth have intensified and inflation risks have
eased, signaling policy makers may take further action should
Europe''s debt crisis worsen. They raised they benchmark rate to
1.5 percent in July. </p>
<p>The central bank has purchased 143 billion euros ($197
billion) of bonds to curb the euro region''s debt crisis,
starting with Greece, Portugal and Ireland last year and
widening to Italy and Spain in August. Germany''s Juergen Stark
resigned from the ECB''s board last week in protest of the bond
program, which he said blurs the line between monetary and
fiscal policy. </p>

<p>Kweku Adoboli, the UBS AG (UBSN) trader
arrested in London yesterday, admitted to causing losses while
the bank''s risk-control officers were examining his trades, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>UBS said yesterday it suffered a loss of about $2 billion
from unauthorized trading. </p>
<p>Adoboli hired lawyers at Kingsley Napley in London to
represent him, a spokeswoman said today in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The firm previously advised Nick Leeson, who caused the
collapse of Barings Plc with $1.4 billion in losses in 1995.
Leeson, a former derivatives trader, caused the demise of
Britain''s oldest merchant bank after losses on the futures and
options markets in Singapore and Osaka, Japan, were uncovered. </p>
<p>UBS, Switzerland''s biggest bank, asked British police at 1
a.m. to arrest Adoboli before notifying the U.K. financial
regulator or prosecutors, according to two people familiar with
the matter. </p>
<p>The Financial Services Authority was notified shortly after
police. Prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office, which also
handles white-collar crime, weren''t contacted at all, according
to the people, who declined to be identified because the
investigations are private. </p>
<p>The investigation highlights the fragmented financial crime
enforcement agencies in the U.K. with jurisdictions that often
overlap. That UBS went straight to police after learning about a
$2 billion loss on trades indicates that the 31-year-old Adoboli
may have been a flight risk, or that the bank wanted to distance
itself from any crime, said Lindsay Thomas, a financial
regulation adviser at Sustainable Risks. </p>
<p>UBS wants to suggest that it was a terrible criminal act,
and that they were a victim, Thomas said in a phone interview
in London. </p>
<p>The City of London police arrested Adoboli at a business
address in London at 3:30 a.m. on suspicion of fraud and abuse
of position in connection with unauthorized trading at UBS''s
investment bank. Police declined to identify the address.
Adoboli remains in custody during the probe, Commander Ian Dyson
said yesterday. </p>
<p>UBS is still investigating the matter, the Zurich-based
bank said in a statement. No client positions were affected, and
it may be unprofitable in the third quarter because of the loss,
UBS said, declining to comment further. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>ETF Securities Sued by Former Executive in U.K. Over Bonus </p>
<p>ETF Securities Ltd., the world''s largest provider of
exchange-traded commodity funds, was sued in London by a former
employee who says he is owed a stake in the company tied to a
2006 bonus award. </p>
<p>Stefan Garcia, now an executive at another ETF firm, said
the bonus gave him options to buy 1,000 shares of the company at
49.99 pounds ($79) with no time limit, according to U.K. court
documents filed in July. </p>
<p>ETF Securities, based in Jersey, is considering selling as
much as $1 billion in shares through an initial public offering
amid growing investor demand for exchange-traded products,
according to a May report in the Wall Street Journal that cited
unidentified bankers familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Graham Tuckwell, chairman and chief executive officer of
ETF Securities, said in a phone interview the case was
absolutely without merit. He said the claim was based on a
small administrative error and the options had expired. </p>
<p>Garcia was awarded the options because at that early stage
the company had limited cash to fund its growth, according
to documents filed by his lawyers. Tuckwell sent Garcia an e-
mail in May refusing to allow him to exercise the options. </p>
<p>Mark Levine, a partner at London law firm Mishcon de Reya
who is representing Garcia, said his client had a multimillion-
pound claim and declined to comment further. </p>
<p>The case is Cherrin v. ETF Security Ltd., HQ11X02645, High
Court of Justice, Queen''s Bench Division. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Unit Must Buy Back $558 Million in Loans, Suit Says </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s EMC Mortgage unit was sued by Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), the trustee for a mortgage portfolio, for refusing
to buy back more than 800 defective home loans. </p>
<p>EMC rejected repeated repurchase demands for the loans
in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in a public version of the
complaint filed Sept. 14 in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. The case was initially filed under seal. </p>
<p>The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of
defaults and foreclosures, Wells Fargo said in the complaint.
Approximately three-quarters of the loans in the trust have
been modified or liquidated, or are now seriously delinquent. </p>
<p>The complaint is the second Wells Fargo has filed as
trustee against EMC. The trustee settled a suit brought in
January after EMC agreed to turn over files for more than 2,000
underlying mortgages in the trust. </p>
<p>A review of 948 loan files revealed that at least 840, or
about 89 percent, failed to comply with EMC''s representations
and warranties, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage LLC, CA6861,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>
<p>U.K. to Sue ECB Over Planned Restrictions on Clearing Houses </p>
<p>Britain will sue the European Central Bank over plans to
prevent some euro-denominated securities from being cleared
outside the 17 countries that share the currency, in the first
such move by a government. </p>
<p>The U.K. planned to present a legal challenge against the
ECB over its location policy for clearing houses at the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the Treasury in London said in
an e-mailed statement Sept. 14. </p>
<p>It does seem to indicate a possible change in the
approach that the U.K. is taking to Europe, Darren Fox, a
financial services lawyer at Simmons  Simmons LLP, said in a
telephone interview in London. There has been a perception in
the City that the U.K. hasn''t been doing as much in Europe as it
could have done to protect the interests of the U.K. financial-
services industry. Perhaps this is a sign that the worm is
turning. </p>
<p>It''s the first time any European government has sought to
sue the ECB, the Treasury said. The U.K. is accusing the central
bank of going against principles of the European Union single
market and contravening European law amid wider international
efforts to regulate derivatives markets. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based ECB declined to
comment. </p>

<p>Express Scripts Sues Walgreen Over Medicare Patients </p>
<p>Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) sued Walgreen Co. for what it called a
campaign to disparage the pharmacy-benefits manager in an
illegal attempt to wrest away customers. </p>
<p>Walgreen, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, is using false
advertising to encourage Medicare patients to leave Express
Scripts in violation of a contract that expires Dec. 31, St.
Louis-based Express Scripts said in a Sept. 7 complaint filed in
federal court in Chicago. Express Scripts said it will suffer
irreparable damage unless the court issues an injunction
stopping Walgreen''s action. </p>
<p>Walgreen, of Deerfield, Illinois, said in June that it will
not participate in Express Scripts'' pharmacy network next year
because negotiations collapsed on renewing the contract worth
more than $5 billion in annual drug sales. A website sponsored
by Walgreen says Medicare recipients who remain with Express
Scripts won''t be able to fill Part D prescriptions after Dec.
31. </p>
<p>This is false and highly misleading because nothing will
prohibit Walgreen from continuing to fill valid prescriptions
for such members after Dec. 31, 2011, even if Walgreen is not a
part of Express Scripts'' pharmacy network, Express Scripts
said in the complaint. </p>
<p>Walgreen has asked the court to stay the proceedings,
saying in a Sept. 12 motion that Express Scripts brought its
claims in the wrong forum because the contract requires the
parties to resolve such disputes through binding arbitration. </p>
<p>We think that it is important to inform our patients and
the public how this may impact their ability to fill
prescriptions at Walgreen next year if Express Scripts serves as
the pharmacy-benefit manager for their particular health care
plans, and we regret that Express Scripts has resorted to
litigation in an effort to stop us, Michael Polzin, a
spokesman for Walgreen, said Sept. 14 in an e-mail. We
obviously intend to vigorously defend against their suit. </p>
<p>The case is Express Scripts Inc. v. Walgreen Co. (WAG), 11-cv-
06223, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>BP Investors'' Derivative Spill Suits Dismissed by U.S. Judge </p>
<p>BP Plc (BP/) won''t have to face some lawsuits in the U.S. brought
by institutional investors on behalf of the company over last
year''s Gulf of Mexico drilling-rig explosion and oil spill, a
federal judge ruled. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Keith P. Ellison in Houston agreed with
BP''s arguments that the claims should be filed in U.K. courts
because the company is based in London. Ellison said he may
reverse this dismissal if English courts refuse to accept
jurisdiction for reasons other than the plaintiffs'' failure to
comply with procedural requirements. </p>
<p>Because this derivative lawsuit involves the internal
governance of an English corporation, the convenience of the
parties and the interests of justice favor England as a more
convenient forum, Ellison said yesterday in a 31-page
decision. </p>
<p>Investors sued BP claiming that the company''s management
and board caused the spill by knowingly putting profits ahead of
safety. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April 2010 while
drilling a BP well off the Louisiana coast, killing 11 and
spilling more than 4.1 million barrels of oil. </p>
<p>The investors'' suits, so-called derivative claims brought
on behalf of the company, are combined with other shareholder
actions before Ellison in Houston. Lawsuits seeking money for
economic and personal injuries from the spill are consolidated
before a different U.S. judge in New Orleans. </p>
<p>The primary concern of this derivative litigation is the
internal affairs of an English corporation, and the suit seeks
to recover damages for the benefit of BP only, Ellison said in
his ruling. English law governs this dispute and will
determine whether the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary duties and harmed BP in the process. </p>
<p>BP spokesmen Scott Dean and Daren Beaudo didn''t immediately
return phone or e-mail messages seeking comment on the ruling
after regular business hours. Mark Lebovitch and Lewis Kahn,
investor attorneys, didn''t immediately return calls seeking
comment. </p>
<p>The case is In re BP Shareholder Derivative Litigation,
4:10-cv-03447, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). </p>
<p>Lions Gate Suit Against Carl Icahn Voluntarily Dismissed </p>
<p>Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)''s lawsuit against
billionaire investor Carl Icahn in Manhattan federal court was
voluntarily dismissed by both sides. </p>
<p>Lions Gate, an independent producer of films including
Precious and American Psycho and the Mad Men
television series, sued Icahn in October, claiming he tried to
interfere with the studio''s plan to merge with Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer Inc. </p>
<p>In papers filed with the court yesterday, both sides said
the case is being dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can''t be
reinstituted. The papers didn''t say whether the dismissal is
part of any settlement in the case. </p>
<p>In March, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer dismissed most of
Lions Gate''s allegations, permitting it to go forward with a
claim that Icahn paid a special price for Dallas Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban''s 5.4 percent stake in Lions Gate, which the studio
said wasn''t fair to other investors. </p>
<p>William Savitt, a lawyer for Lions Gate, and Joseph
DiBenedetto, who represents Icahn, didn''t return messages
seeking comment on the court filing. </p>
<p>The case is Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. V. Icahn, 1:10-
cv-08169, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>ATT, U.S. Offer Plan for Confidential Data in T-Mobile Case </p>
<p>ATT Inc. (T) and the U.S. Justice Department agreed on a plan
for handling confidential data in the government''s antitrust
lawsuit seeking to block the company''s purchase of wireless
carrier T-Mobile USA Inc. </p>
<p>A filing by the department yesterday in federal court in
Washington sets definitions for what will be deemed confidential
and how that information will be disclosed in the case. ATT
didn''t oppose the department''s proposed order, the government
said. </p>
<p>The two sides haven''t addressed the issue of how much
access ATT''s in-house lawyers will have to confidential
materials submitted by non-parties in the case, according to
the filing. The non-parties should have a chance to be heard in
court regarding how their confidential information will be
handled, the department said. </p>
<p>Defendants wish to designate up to 10 (total) in-house
lawyers to have access to confidential information, the
department said in the filing. </p>
<p>Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman in Washington, didn''t
immediately respond to a telephone message and an e-mail message
seeking comment on the filing. </p>
<p>The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)''s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would substantially reduce
competition. </p>
<p>ATT, in a filing last week, said the T-Mobile deal is good
for mobile-phone customers because it would lead to better
service, fewer dropped calls and lower prices for consumers. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 and told the parties to be prepared to discuss
settlement options. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Fleishman Doesn''t Take Stand as U.S. Rests in Insider Trial </p>
<p>James Fleishman, the former Primary Global Research LLC
executive on trial over charges he participated in an insider-
trading scheme, didn''t take the stand in his own defense after
prosecutors finished their case. </p>
<p>Fleishman, of Santa Clara, California, is charged with two
counts of conspiracy for his role in what prosecutors said was a
scheme in which technology-company employees, working as
consultants for the company passed secret tips to hedge fund
managers. </p>
<p>The government has rested and the defense has rested,
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan told jurors
yesterday. On Monday, we will have closing arguments and you
will get the case then. </p>
<p>Rakoff said Fleishman''s lawyers may submit some written
evidence without calling witnesses to testify. After court,
Ethan Balogh, Fleishman''s lawyer, said his client wouldn''t
testify. If convicted, Fleishman faces as long as 25 years in
prison. </p>
<p>The Mountain View, California-based firm, also known as
PGR, matches employees of public companies with fund managers
for a fee. Of the 15 people charged in the probe, 12 have
pleaded guilty. Fleishman and Winifred Jiau, a former PGR
consultant convicted in June, were the only ones who have gone
to trial. </p>
<p>Also yesterday, former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. manager Manosha Karunatilaka was sentenced to 18 months in
prison for his role in the scheme involving PGR. </p>
<p>Balogh yesterday cross-examined Suk-Joo Hwang, a former
Samsung Electronics Co. manager who said he worked as a
consultant for PGR for seven years. Hwang said he sometimes
passed confidential information to PGR clients. </p>

<p>Blame for 2010 Gulf Spill Will Be Decided by Trial Judge </p>
<p>Which companies share the blame for the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill and will have to pay for it will be decided in a non-jury
trial set to begin Feb. 27, a federal judge in New Orleans said. </p>
<p>BP Plc (BP), which owned the subsea well that exploded off
Louisiana in April 2010, claims Transocean Ltd. (RIG), Halliburton
Co. (HAL), Cameron International Corp. (CAM) and other contractors involved
in the offshore drilling operation share responsibility for
mistakes that caused the disaster. </p>
<p>The trial will address all allocation of fault issues
that may properly be tried to the bench without a jury, U.S.
District Judge Carl Barbier said Sept. 14 in a written order.
This includes the negligence, gross negligence, or other bases
of liability of, and the proportion of liability allocable to
the various defendants, third parties, and non-parties, he
said. </p>
<p>The Macondo blowout and the explosion that followed killed
11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
history. The accident and spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against London-based BP and its partners and contractors. The
lawsuits over economic losses and personal injuries have been
combined before Barbier in New Orleans. </p>
<p>The lawsuits also name as defendants Transocean, the
Switzerland-based owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that exploded; Houston-based Halliburton, which
provided cementing services to the well; and Cameron
International, which provided blowout-prevention equipment. BP''s
minority partners in the well, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) and
Mitsui  Co.''s Moex Offshore LLC unit, were also sued. </p>
<p>The first test trial on damages is scheduled for July. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>Bridgestone to Pay $28 Million Fine Over Bribes, U.S. Says </p>
<p>Bridgestone Corp. (5108), the world''s biggest tire maker, agreed
to pay $28 million to settle criminal allegations it conspired
to bribe government officials in Latin America, the U.S. Justice
Department said. </p>
<p>Bridgestone will plead guilty to charges of plotting to rig
bids and make corrupt payments related to the sale of products
including marine hose, used to transfer oil between tankers and
storage facilities, Sharis A. Pozen, acting chief of the Justice
Department''s antitrust division, said yesterday in a statement.
The company said it will withdraw from the marine hose business. </p>
<p>From as early as January 1999 until late May 2007, Tokyo-
based Bridgestone conspired to fix prices and allocate market
shares of marine hose in the U.S. and elsewhere, Pozen said. The
company allegedly conspired to make payments to Latin American
government officials to obtain and retain business. </p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Bridgestone will cooperate with
the department''s investigation, according to the statement. The
agreement requires court approval. </p>
<p>Bridgestone has dismantled its international engineered
products department, closed its Houston office and terminated
many of its third-party agents, the company said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>We are committed to the efforts to further enhance and
expand our remediation measures, and to conduct business in
compliance with the competition and anticorruption laws around
the world, Bridgestone said. </p>
<p>Hermes Executive Says Takeover Win Locks in Independence </p>
<p>Hermes International (RMS) SCA''s founding family''s ability to set
up a holding company is a decisive step in the fight to
defend against a takeover, the luxury-goods maker''s deputy
managing director said. </p>
<p>A Paris court yesterday rejected an appeal by minority
investors who opposed a decision by the French market authority
waiving rules to allow the family to set up a holding company.
The family sought the structure to protect the Birkin-bag maker
after LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC), the world''s largest
luxury-goods maker, began building what is now a 21.4 percent
stake. </p>
<p>When the holding company is in place, it will become
completely obvious that the claims of unity that have taken
place for months and have been questioned will be impossible to
challenge anymore, Deputy Managing Director Patrick Albaladejo
said in a phone interview yesterday. This is a decisive
step. </p>
<p>The Autorite des Marches Financiers was right to grant the
family permission to pool a 50.2 percent Hermes stake into a
holding company without bidding for the rest of the business, as
the regulator would normally require for a group with that large
a stake joining together, the Paris appeals court said. </p>
<p>The court rejected the objections of minority investors
represented by a shareholder advocacy group Adam, which had
sought to have AMF force the family to make an offer for all
outstanding shares. </p>
<p>While LVMH has said it isn''t seeking control or a board
seat, its stake has prompted takeover talk. LVMH won''t be a
passive shareholder in Hermes and can provide its Paris-based
rival with strategic and operational help, LVMH Chairman Bernard
Arnault has said. </p>
<p>All the statements from the family have been very precise
and decisive on this, that they don''t want to engage in
discussions, Albaladejo said, adding that he isn''t aware of
any contact with Arnault. </p>
<p>Hermes wants LVMH to reduce its stake by more than half to
free shares on the open market, according to Bertrand Puech, who
heads the bag maker''s founding family. Even if LVMH doesn''t
reduce the holding, Hermes will run the company as it sees fit,
Puech has said. </p>

<p>Watson, Sandoz Pay $145 Million to Settle Drug-Price Case </p>
<p>Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI), the generic-drug maker, will
pay $79 million and Novartis AG (NOVN)''s Sandoz unit will pay $66
million to resolve claims they defrauded U.S. and state
governments by causing Medicaid to overpay for drugs. </p>
<p>Both lawsuits were filed under the U.S. False Claims Act by
Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys Inc., a specialty pharmacy. The
settlements resolved portions of the U.S. false claims cases and
similar claims by various states. The law allows whistle-blowers
to file on behalf of the government and share in any recovery. </p>
<p>Ven-A-Care has settled at least 18 lawsuits since 2000 that
have allowed state and federal governments to collect at least
$2.2 billion. Ven-A-Care has reaped more than $380 million in
whistle-blower fees during that period. James Breen, an attorney
for Ven-A-Care, declined to comment on the latest settlements. </p>
<p>The settlements by Watson and Sandoz were filed Sept. 14 in
federal court in Boston, where U.S. District Judge Patti Saris
is overseeing the so-called Average Wholesale Price litigation
against drugmakers. </p>
<p>Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson, declined to comment on the settlement. He referred to
the company''s last annual report, filed in February, that said
the company reached a settlement with Ven-A-Care for $79 million
in December. </p>
<p>The claims were unfounded, and Sandoz settled to end
the uncertainty of protracted litigation, Eric Althoff, a
spokesman for Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis, said in an e-
mail. Sandoz is committed to conducting business in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as our own
high ethical standards, he said. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale
Price Litigation, MDL No. 1456, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). </p>
<p>SABMiller''s Grolsch Wins EU Court Appeal of Antitrust Fine </p>
<p>Grolsch, a unit of SABMiller Plc (SAB), the world''s second-
largest brewer by volume, won a European Union court appeal of a
31.7 million-euro ($43.8 million) fine levied for colluding on
beer prices in the Netherlands. </p>
<p>Antitrust officials didn''t give sufficient proof to
establish the direct participation of Grolsch in the cartel
and failed to explain why the company should be held liable
for the conduct of a Dutch subsidiary, the EU General Court, the
region''s second-highest tribunal, said in a ruling yesterday. </p>
<p>The European Commission, the EU''s antitrust regulator,
fined Royal Grolsch NV, Heineken NV (HEIA) and Bavaria NV in 2007 for
fixing prices in the Netherlands from at least 1996 to 1999.
InBev NV, which has since merged with Anheuser-Busch Cos. to
become the world''s largest brewer, escaped a fine after tipping
off EU officials. Grolsch was bought by SABMiller in a takeover
completed in 2008. </p>
<p>Heineken won a cut to its fine to 198 million euros from
219.3 million euros in a ruling by the EU court in June. Bavaria
had its penalty trimmed to 20.7 million euros from 22.8 million
euros, after the court said the European Commission failed to
prove the extent of the cartel. </p>
<p>The commission will analyze the ruling carefully and
will then consider whether to appeal the judgment or readopt the
cartel decision, Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the EU
regulator, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The case is: T-234/07, Koninklijke Grolsch v. Commission. </p>
<p>New York Boiler-Room'' Salesman Anderson Gets Two Years </p>
<p>Baldwin Anderson was sentenced to two years in prison for
taking part in a boiler-room investment-fraud scheme on New
York''s Staten Island. </p>
<p>Anderson, 57, a former salesman for Gryphon Holdings Inc.,
was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in
Brooklyn, New York. He''s been in custody since June 14, when he
admitted to participating in the crime during the second day of
his trial. He was the last of 18 defendants in the Gryphon case
to plead guilty and the only one to go to trial. </p>
<p>Gryphon misled investors into paying for phony stock tips
and investment advice, defrauding them of $20 million,
prosecutors charged. Gryphon told victims its office was on Wall
Street or even in the New York Stock Exchange when it was in a
strip mall on Staten Island, according to prosecutors in the
office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch. </p>
<p>I lost sight of the truth, I lost sight of what was good
and I lost sight of the laws that govern this great country,
Anderson told Weinstein at a Sept. 13 hearing. </p>
<p>Anderson''s lawyer, Michael Padden, declined to comment
after the sentencing. </p>
<p>Kenneth Marsh, 44, who ran Gryphon, was the last defendant
before Anderson to plead guilty, on April 14. He hasn''t received
his prison sentence yet. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Marsh, 10-cr-00480, and the
SEC case is SEC v. Gryphon Holdings Inc., 10-cv-01742, U.S.

<p>General Motors Co. and the United
Auto Workers reached a tentative agreement on a four-year labor
contract that improves profit sharing and will create jobs, the
company and the union said in separate statements. </p>
<p>The accord goes to 48,500 GM hourly workers for a
ratification vote in the next seven to 10 days, GM said. The
union typically uses the first accord to set a pattern for pay
and benefits for the other two U.S. automakers. UAW negotiators
will seek a deal with Chrysler Group LLC next and then go to
Ford Motor Co. (F), three people familiar with the talks have said. </p>
<p>The UAW, while declining to provide details, said the
agreement includes improved health care and enhanced profit
sharing with far greater transparency. GM will also invest
in its plants, hire back laid-off members and return work to the
U.S. from overseas, UAW President Bob King said in a statement. </p>
<p>This is a contract negotiated in tough times, when the
economy is uncertain and a battered industry is still in
recovery, said Harley Shaiken, labor professor at the
University of California at Berkeley. The union is saying,
Look, we''ve addressed job security when that is vital to our
members and to the whole economy.'' </p>
<p>The union said it rebuffed efforts to weaken health-care
coverage and won significant improvements. </p>
<h2>New Strategies'' </h2>
<p>The UAW approached these negotiations with new strategies
and fought for and achieved some of our major goals for our
members, including significant investments and products for our
plants, King said. This contract will get our members who
have been laid off back to work and will create new jobs in our
communities. </p>
<p>The agreement positions GM for long-term success, Cathy Clegg, GM vice president for labor relations, said in a
statement. </p>
<p>We worked hard for a contract that recognizes the
realities of today''s marketplace, enabling GM to continue to
invest in U.S. manufacturing and provide good jobs to thousands
of Americans, she said. </p>
<p>The UAW will probably turn its attention next to Chrysler,
majority-owned by Fiat SpA (F), said Shaiken. The GM accord, he said
defines competitiveness for Detroit going forward. </p>
<p>The details will be critical because the union''s goals of
job security and sharing in the success of the company can be in
conflict, he said in a telephone interview, noting that he
hasn''t been briefed on those details. The results will not
make everyone happy. </p>
<h2>Non-Union Competition </h2>
<p>King, 65, has pledged to organize a foreign automaker this
year to expand the UAW''s bargaining power beyond GM, Ford and
Chrysler. He said the union has recommitted to that goal. </p>
<p>As long as unionized workers are being forced to compete
with nonunion workers who in most cases receive lower pay and
benefits -- many in temporary jobs -- there will continue to be
a downward pressure on the wages and benefits of all
autoworkers, he said in the statement. </p>
<p>Contracts covering 113,000 workers at GM (GM), Ford and Fiat
SpA-controlled Chrysler were set to expire Sept. 14 and have
been extended while negotiations continued. </p>
<p>The UAW proposed a signing bonus of $8,000 to $10,000 for
each member, five people familiar with discussions said last
week. A large bonus may help sell the deal to union members
looking to be repaid for what King has estimated as $7,000 to
$30,000 in concessions they each gave since 2005. </p>
<p>Workers at Detroit-based GM, Ford and Chrysler received
signing bonuses of $3,000 after they ratified the current
contract in 2007. Prior to that, signing bonuses had been around
$1,000, Shaiken said last week. </p>
<h2>Past Concessions </h2>
<p>Previous concessions included surrendering raises, bonuses
and cost-of-living adjustments as well as agreeing to a two-tier
wage system, where new hires are paid about half as much as
senior employees. With GM and Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford
profitable, workers have said they want to recover what they
gave up. </p>
<p>Workers at Ford have filed an equality of sacrifice
grievance against the automaker for restoring raises and bonuses
to salaried workers last year. An arbitration hearing on that
dispute started Sept. 15. </p>
<p>UAW members agreed to a no-strike pledge at GM and Auburn
Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler as part of their U.S.-backed
bankruptcies in 2009. Unsettled disputes at the automakers are
to be decided through binding arbitration. Ford didn''t receive a
U.S. bailout and UAW members there went against the wishes of
union leaders and rejected a strike ban and arbitration. </p>

<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) rolled out its mobile-
payments application on Sprint Nextel Corp.''s network, and said
it''s teaming up with Visa Inc. (V), Discover Financial Services (DFS) and
American Express Co. (AXP) to make the service more widely available. </p>
<p>Google, whose earlier partners included Citigroup Inc. and
MasterCard Inc. (MA), uses so-called near-field communication
technology to let consumers pay by tapping a smartphone on a
reader at checkout. The Google Wallet service, available now on
a handset from Sprint, enables users to charge items to Citi
MasterCard credit cards, Google said in a blog post today. </p>
<p>Our goal is to make it possible for you to add all of
your payment cards to Google Wallet, so you can say goodbye to
even the biggest traditional wallets, the company said in the
blog post. Visa, Discover and American Express have opened their
NFC specifications to Google, which may allow their cards to be
added to future versions of the application, Google said. </p>
<p>With the new service, Google can capture more information
about consumers'' shopping behavior when they''re not on the
Internet. The agreement gives Visa, the biggest payment network,
a presence in three digital wallets: Google''s; its own, unveiled
in May; and Isis, a joint venture of mobile-phone companies. </p>
<p>Customers will make decisions as to which wallet they''re
going to use, and we want to make sure customers have a
choice, said John Partridge, president of San Francisco-based
Visa, in a phone interview today. We believe there will be a
number of different alternatives that will become available and
there won''t be one that becomes a standard. </p>
<p>About 300,000 terminals worldwide are enabled with the
technology, Partridge said. </p>
<p>Google''s challenge now is spurring consumers to adopt the
service, said Richard Doherty, an analyst with Envisioneering
Group in Seaford, New York. </p>
<p>It''s a lot tougher to implement than to model and to
prototype, he said. They really have to prove themselves
with this. </p>

<p>Klaus Doerrzapf, who has solar
panels on his home, has no plans for an emission-free car in his
garage. He''s one of the reasons why automakers like Nissan Motor
Co. won''t recoup investments in electric vehicles anytime soon. </p>
<p>It''s too early, the 50-year-old manager at an electrics
company said at the International Motor Show in Frankfurt.
Range and price are a problem. Battery life and charging times
are also concerns, Doerrzapf said, while looking at an
electric-powered Focus from Ford Motor Co. (F) </p>
<p>Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW), Volkswagen AG (VOW) and Nissan
partner Renault SA (RNO) talked up their electric vehicles at the
Frankfurt motor show as they rolled out a record number of
models and began the search for a return on their development
spending. Nissan, the maker of the all-electric Leaf, is
investing 4 billion euros ($5.5 billion) together with Renault
to build electric cars. </p>
<p>Following the introduction last year of the Leaf,
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. (7211)''s i MiEV, and General Motors Co. (GM)''s
Chevrolet Volt, the new models will test consumer appetite for
electric vehicles, which cost more than double the price of
conventional models. Consumers are balking at paying up,
concerned that their own investment will be wiped out in a few
years because the batteries may not last. </p>
<p>We''re about to find out what happens when several big
manufacturers try to sell electric vehicles to real people,
said Ian Fletcher, a London-based analyst with IHS Automotive.
The signs aren''t all good. </p>
<p>Sales Targets </p>
<p>Nissan has delivered 12,000 of the Leaf model since its
introduction in December, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Ghosn
said in Frankfurt. PSA Peugeot Citroen, which beat Renault to
the market with two electric city cars last December, targeted
7,000 combined deliveries of the iOn and C-Zero models for 2011.
It has sold 3,000 since Jan. 1. </p>
<p>Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan said last November it planned
to sell as many as 25,000 units of the $32,780 Leaf in the U.S.
during the model''s first year. Through August, U.S. sales of the
model totaled just 6,168. </p>
<p>The Leaf, which has a range of about 100 miles per charge,
costs 25,990 pounds ($40,776) in the U.K., even after the
deduction of a 5,000-pound government incentive, while the
brand''s similarly sized Note starts at 11,200 pounds. In France,
the 5,000-euro government contribution lowers the starting price
of Peugeot''s iOn to 35,350 euros, compared with 9,700 euros for
the gasoline-burning Peugeot 107. </p>
<p>Battery Barrier </p>
<p>I wouldn''t buy one just yet, said Jean-Pierre Ahtuam,
38, who runs a juice bar in central Paris. I''d be worried
about where I''d plug it in and whether it will be worth anything
in a couple of years -- that''s got to be a concern with any new
technology the first time around. </p>
<p>Costly batteries and limited driving range remain the key
sticking points for the technology. Public charging stations are
also conspicuously absent in most markets. Even the technology''s
strongest advocates recognize that success hinges on years of
generous subsidies from increasingly cash-strapped governments. </p>
<p>As things stand, it''s only with this support that we can
make the cars affordable for consumers, said Thomas Orsini,
electric-vehicle business development director at Renault, which
is predicting a 10 percent global market share for battery cars
by 2020. If the subsidies disappear too soon, the market won''t
get off the ground. </p>
<p>Subsidies help to absorb the 7,000-euro cost of a battery
that will propel a compact car about 100 miles on flat terrain
between charges -- providing that heating and other energy-
draining functions are used sparingly or not at all. </p>
<p>Sudden Death'' </p>
<p>The batteries'' price and limited lifespan will combine to
make electric vehicles depreciate faster than combustion-engine
models in the used-car market, according to research by the
University of Greenwich in London. </p>
<p>Electric cars suffer from the certainty, not just risk,
of a large fixed cost a few years down the line, said Michael Wynn-Williams, a business professor and author of the study.
This is sudden death, the point where an otherwise attractive
vehicle is worth nothing. </p>
<p>To get around this problem, Daimler AG (DAI) plans to follow
Renault''s lead by initially leasing the batteries with its cars.
The electric-powered Smart city car will start at less than
16,000 euros, with the battery costing an additional 60 euros a
month. </p>
<p>Ghosn, chief executive officer of both Renault and Nissan,
remains bullish. Demand for Nissan''s Leaf has outstripped
expectations, he said Sept. 12. </p>
<p>When we first predicted a 10 percent market share, people
said we were being extremely optimistic, the CEO said. Since
then, it''s the experts who have increased their forecasts. </p>
<p>Nice to Drive'' </p>
<p>Not all industry analysts got Ghosn''s memo. Fletcher at IHS
expects battery-powered cars to claim about 1 percent of global
production in 2020, while rival research firm J.D. Power and
Associates puts their market share below 2 percent. The
forecasts exclude cars with range extenders, like GM''s Volt,
which use a small on-board gasoline generator to recharge the
battery on the move. </p>
<p>Even some of the auto executives showing pure electric
models in Frankfurt sounded skeptical about their future. 
Peugeot Citroen sees three times more global demand for hybrids,
which combine electric propulsion with a combustion engine. </p>
<p>Everything we''re seeing today confirms that vision,
said CEO Philippe Varin. </p>
<p>Consumers like Doerrzapf, who owns a VW Passat and works
for a company supplying the type of electronics equipment needed
to recharge the vehicles, may yet change their minds. </p>
<p>They are nice to drive, he said. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) options traders are more
bearish than ever, betting the company will suffer more than
MasterCard Inc. (MA) from U.S. rules meant to foster competition
among firms that process debit-card transactions. </p>
<p>Three-month puts to sell San Francisco-based Visa should
the stock fall 10 percent cost 1.29 times more than calls, near
the all-time high of 1.30 on Sept. 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price relationship known as skew is
1.21 for Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, down from an 11-
month high of 1.31 on June 20, the data show. </p>
<p>Visa has rallied about half as much as MasterCard in 2011
after the Federal Reserve set rules that let retailers choose
from at least two networks for debit transactions that involve
the use of personal identification numbers. The Fed also capped
swipe fees that merchants pay for most debit transactions,
including those that require customers'' signatures. Visa
processed $1.05 trillion of the payments last year, more than
triple the amount at MasterCard. </p>
<p>It clouds the growth trajectory for a company like
Visa, Walter Bucky Hellwig, who helps oversee $17 billion
at BBT Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said in a
Sept. 16 telephone interview. It experienced a high rate of
growth for debit-card usage, and now maybe it''s not as high. </p>
<p>Visa Revenue </p>
<p>Visa forecast that revenue will increase about 10 percent
in 2012, according to a filing on July 6, a week after the Fed''s
decision. The projection from Visa, which handled $5.6 trillion
in transactions during the year ended June 30, compared with its
estimate for 2011 sales to rise 11 percent to 15 percent.
MasterCard predicts its sales will grow 12 percent to 14 percent
a year through 2013, according to a slide show posted on the
company''s website Sept. 15. </p>
<p>Will Valentine, a spokesman for Visa, and Jim Issokson, a
spokesman for MasterCard, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index fell 20
percent last week to 30.98 for its biggest slump since the
period ended July 1. The gauge of Standard  Poor''s 500 Index
options prices has dropped 32 percent from a two-year high of 48
on Aug. 8, the first session after SP lowered its rating on
U.S. government debt. The gauge hasn''t closed below its 20.91
average for the past year since July 26. It rose 5.7 percent to
32.73 today. </p>
<p>Europe''s VStoxx Index (V2X), which measures the cost of options
to protect against declines by the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, dropped
14 percent last week, the biggest retreat since July 22, to
42.96. It jumped 6.2 percent to 45.61 today. </p>
<p>Card Purchases </p>
<p>Visa said U.S. credit-card purchases rose 9.8 percent to
$224 billion in the quarter ended June, compared with a 5.9
percent growth in the same period last year. U.S. credit-card
spending at MasterCard rose 6.1 percent, versus 1.1 percent in
the second quarter of 2010, the company said last month. </p>
<p>The price-earnings ratio for Visa is 19, or 12 percent less
than MasterCard and close to the record 14 percent discount on
Aug. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. MasterCard''s
valuation first surpassed Visa''s in January. Financial companies
in the SP 500 trade at 11.1 times profit. </p>
<p>Economic conditions in the U.S. have slowed dramatically,
and that''s likely to be true elsewhere where Visa does
business, Keith Wirtz, who oversees $16.7 billion as chief
investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management in
Cincinnati, said in a Sept. 16 telephone interview. In a
recession, you''re going to see revenues diminish. </p>
<p>Growth Forecasts </p>
<p>U.S. gross domestic product may expand by 1.6 percent this
year, according to the median of 79 economist estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. That''s down from a median forecast of 1.7
percent in August and below last year''s 3 percent rate. </p>
<p>Analysts are more optimistic about Visa than MasterCard,
assigning average ratings of 4.69 and 4.53, respectively, on a
5-point scale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. David Koning, an analyst at R.W. Baird  Co. in Milwaukee, downgraded
MasterCard to neutral from outperform in a Sept. 16
note, citing the stock''s year-to-date rally. He rates Visa
outperform. </p>
<p>Visa has climbed 28 percent this year to $90.03, falling
0.9 percent today after it said it agreed to a licensing deal
with Google Inc. that allows its cardholders to make purchases
and complete other transactions using their mobile phones.
MasterCard has risen 55 percent in 2011 to $347.98. </p>
<p>Options traders are piling into bearish bets on Visa. The
company''s December $87.50 puts had the biggest rise in open
interest among all options in the past 30 days, increasing by
3,038 contracts to 3,812, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. January $72.50 puts jumped by the second-largest
amount, rising by 2,976, reaching 3,782 contracts. </p>
<p>This is one time when I am probably grateful for not
having had the highest market share in debit in the United
States, MasterCard Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga said
last year in a conference call with analysts, referring to
provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that spurred the Fed''s debit-
card rules. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s
biggest software maker, raised its quarterly dividend 25 percent
to 20 cents, providing investors with a payout at the upper end
of forecasts. </p>
<p>The new dividend is a penny more the 19 cents a share
projected by Bloomberg data and compares with the 18 cents to 20
cents estimated by Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in New York. The change, announced in a statement
today, boosts the yield to 2.97 percent from 2.37 percent. </p>
<p>Microsoft generally has a policy of boosting the dividend
in line with operating income. While the increase exceeded the
13 percent growth in operating income in the past fiscal year,
investors were seeking more, Bellini said. The company''s cash
and short-term investments surged 43 percent last year, and
shareholders wanted a bigger piece of that hoard. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s ability to return cash to shareholders is
hampered by the fact that much of that money is held
internationally and would require the company to pay taxes to
bring it back into the country for the purpose of paying a
larger dividend. </p>
<p>About $45 billion, or 85 percent of the company''s cash and
short-term investments, is held outside the U.S., the company
said in a July 28 regulatory filing. Around half of annual cash
flow from operations is generated abroad, Bellini estimated,
which gives the company about $15 billion to $17 billion to
spend on dividends and share repurchases this year. </p>
<p>Double It </p>
<p>Even so, Neil Herman, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities
LLC, suggested in an August report that the company should
double its dividend in order to boost its share price. The
shares, which have declined 3.3 percent this year, might surge
past $35 with an increase of that magnitude, he wrote. </p>
<p>Shares of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 23
cents to $26.98 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They rose to
$27.10 in late trading after the increase was announced. </p>
<p>Before today, Microsoft has paid out about 25 percent of
earnings as dividends since starting the payments in 2003,
according to Bloomberg data. Dividend-paying companies with
similar market valuations to Microsoft are paying closer to 40
percent to 50 percent, the data show. </p>
<p>The company also said today it will continue its $40
billion stock buyback plan begun in 2008. The program, which
expires in 2013, had about $12.2 billion remaining as of June
30, Microsoft said. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world''s
biggest theme-park operator, unveiled plans for attractions
based on the top-grossing 3-D movie Avatar, starting at its
Animal Kingdom in Florida. </p>
<p>James Cameron, who directed Fox''s 2009 science-fiction
thriller, will serve as a creative consultant in development of
Avatar lands at the parks, officials of Burbank, California-
based Disney said today at a press conference. </p>
<p>The company has increased spending in its resorts division,
including a new theme park in Shanghai, a vacation project on
the Hawaiian island of Oahu and an expansion of California
Adventure in Anaheim. Investments in parks, resorts and other
properties totaled $2.56 billion through nine months of the
fiscal 2011, almost double the year earlier tally. </p>
<p>With this agreement, we have the extraordinary
opportunity to combine James''s talent and vision with the
imagination and expertise of Disney, Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger said in a statement. </p>
<p>Construction is scheduled to begin by 2013 and take five
years, said Disney, which licensed worldwide theme park rights
to Avatar from Cameron''s Lightstorm Entertainment and News
Corp.''s Twentieth Century Fox studio. </p>
<p>The project is expected to cost about $400 million,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation who wasn''t
authorized to speak publicly. Cameron''s first Avatar film
sequel is scheduled for release in 2014. </p>
<p>Disney fell 20 cents to $32.31 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 14 percent
this year. </p>
<p>Box-Office Sales </p>
<p>Avatar has collected $2.78 billion in worldwide
theatrical sales, the most of any film, according to Box Office
Mojo, an industry researcher. That eclipsed the previous record
of $1.84 billion for Titanic, also directed by Cameron. </p>
<p>The film took place on a moon called Pandora, where humans
leading a mining effort were pitted against the native Na''vi
people. </p>
<p>Theme parks accounted for 28 percent of Disney''s $38.1
billion in sales in the year ended in September 2010 and
contributed $1.32 billion in operating income, or 17 percent of
the total. </p>
<p>Locations for other Avatar themed lands will be
determined by Disney and its international theme park partners,
the company said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s largest computer-services provider, is
offering a new software product that automates marketing and
speeds up sales to entice businesses to use its servers. </p>
<p>If all of a company''s product and customer data is on IBM''s
servers, IBM''s analytics can help it sell more efficiently to
other businesses and consumers, the company said in a statement.
For example, sales campaigns could be based on where products
are geographically located and marketing campaigns could be
automatically generated based on the tone of a customer''s
Twitter post about a product. </p>
<p>The new product, which is the next step in IBM''s Smarter
Commerce initiative, is part of a push to make $7 billion by
2015 from cloud computing, which allows a company to store and
access data from IBM''s servers, the company said. IBM, based in
Armonk, New York, has made heavy investments in the area,
including $2.5 billion in acquisitions and hundreds of millions
of dollars in research, said Craig Hayman, who oversees Smarter
Commerce as general manager of IBM Industry Solutions. </p>
<p>The product clarifies what these acquisitions in the fall
were about, and gives a clear example of one of the ways IBM
plans to pursue the cloud, said Josh Olson, a Des Peres,
Missouri-based analyst for Edward Jones  Co. </p>
<p>Acquisitions, Competitors </p>
<p>Last year, IBM acquired Unica Corp. and Coremetrics, which
use analytics for online marketing, and Sterling Commerce, which
helps companies manage their relationships with partners and
suppliers. The company has said it plans to spend about $20
billion on acquisitions through 2015, after ending last year
with $10.7 billion in cash. </p>
<p>Competitors Oracle Corp. (ORCL), SAP AG (SAP) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) have
not gone as far as IBM in using cloud technology for business
services, Gene Alvarez, a Stamford, Connecticut-based analyst
for Gartner Inc., said. IBM''s technology could attract
industries like health care and telecommunications by doing for
business-to-business transactions what Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) does on
its website, providing individualized marketing, he said. </p>
<p>We now have organizations that you never would have
thought of as e-commerce organizations, wanting a system like
that, Alvarez said. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin
America''s largest Coke bottler, said it will account for half of
Mexico''s Coca-Cola sales after completing an agreement to buy
the bottling operations of Grupo Cimsa with new shares. </p>
<p>The transaction, valued at 11 billion pesos ($837 million)
in stock and assumed debt, tops the acquisition of Mexican
bottler Grupo Tampico for 6.55 billion pesos of shares and 2.75
billion pesos of debt announced by the Mexico-City based company
in June. Tampico was Coca-Cola Femsa''s largest purchase since it
bought Panamerican Beverages Inc. for $3.6 billion in 2003. </p>
<p>The acquisition announced yesterday of Cimsa, a closely
held company that sells Coca-Cola products mostly in the central
states of Morelos and Mexico, marks the second transaction this
year in which Coca-Cola Femsa offered shares instead of cash.
That''s designed to reduce resistance by family-owned companies
to sell out and exit the soft-drink business completely. </p>
<p>The consolidation of Coke bottlers in Mexico is likely to
continue as third-generation owners of smaller Coke bottling
operations swap their controlling equity stakes for minority
positions in a larger bottler, Alan Alanis, a New York-based
analyst with JPMorgan Chase  Co., said in a report today. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa rose 1.89 pesos, or 1.5 percent, to
124.87 pesos in Mexico City trading at 12:05 p.m. New York time.
The shares gained 20 percent this year before today. </p>
<p>The agreement with Cuernavaca, Mexico-based Cimsa
confirms that our company represents an attractive,
transparent and diversified investment vehicle for families that
have been in the beverage industry for a long time, Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said in a statement. </p>
<p>Mexico Consolidation </p>
<p>The Cimsa and Tampico transactions follow the merger,
completed in June, of Mexico''s second-largest and third-largest
Coke bottlers to form Arca Continental SAB. There are now eight
family-owned Coca-Cola bottlers left in Mexico that may be
targets for Coca-Cola Femsa or Arca Continental, said Alanis,
the JPMorgan analyst. He rates Coca-Cola Femsa neutral. </p>
<p>Shareholders of Cimsa, whose bottling operations are called
Corporacion de los Angeles SA, will receive 75.4 million newly
issued Coca-Cola Femsa shares valued at 118 pesos each, the
companies said yesterday. Coca-Cola Femsa will absorb net debt
of 2.1 billion pesos. </p>
<p>Cost Savings </p>
<p>Cimsa, which also has operations in the states of Guerrero
and Michoacan, is forecast to sell 159 million unit cases this
year, Coca-Cola Femsa said. A 13.2 percent stake in Promotora
Industrial Azucarera SA, a Mexican sugar company, is included in
the acquisition. Cimsa''s bottling unit is forecast to have 2011
revenue of 4.79 billion pesos and earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow
known as Ebitda -- of 1.1 billion pesos, Coca-Cola Femsa said. </p>
<p>The 2011 estimated Ebitda margin for Cimsa is 23 percent,
higher than 20 percent for Coca-Cola Femsa in this year''s first
half, Luis Miranda, an analyst at the Mexican unit of Banco
Santander SA, wrote in a report today. He recommends buying
Coca-Cola Femsa shares. </p>
<p>We view this news as positive, Miranda wrote. The
operation is accretive from the operating side. </p>
<p>The company expects to achieve annual cost savings of more
than 260 million pesos from Cimsa''s bottling unit because it
touches Coca-Cola Femsa''s territories on three sides, Hector Trevino, the company''s chief financial officer, said in a
telephone interview. The amount of synergies allowed the
company to pay 10 times annual Ebitda, compared with 9.6 times
for Tampico, he said. Cost savings with Tampico will be in a
range of 180 million pesos to 270 million pesos, Trevino said. </p>
<p>Very Achievable'' </p>
<p>We''re very sure that the 260 million pesos of annual
synergies is very achievable and perhaps a bit conservative
because of the proximity, he said. </p>
<p>After the issue of new shares for the acquisition, Cimsa
will own 3.8 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa. Coca-Cola Co. (KO)''s stake
in the company will drop to 29.4 percent from 30.6 percent and
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB will have about 50 percent, down
from 51.9 percent. Tampico will hold 3.2 percent, and the
remaining 13.6 percent of the shares trade publicly. </p>
<p>Cimsa operates three bottling plants and 18 distribution
centers and has 4,600 employees. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Femsa and Cimsa will seek shareholder approval in
special meetings. The transaction also requires approval from
Mexico''s antitrust agency and Coca-Cola Co., according to Coca-
Cola Femsa''s statement. Coca-Cola Femsa will hold a conference
call tomorrow at 11 a.m. New York time to discuss the deal. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) offered to resolve a European Union investigation into
claims the company blocked competition from rival providers of
maintenance services for mainframe computers. </p>
<p>The European Commission, the Brussels-based EU antitrust
regulator, today asked for comments on IBM''s commitments to
ensure the availability of spare parts and technical data. The
commission also closed a separate probe over IBM''s mainframe
computers after three competitors dropped complaints. </p>
<p>The commission in 2010 opened investigations into Armonk,
New York-based IBM over possible conduct that may have blocked
competitors in mainframe software and maintenance contracts by
restricting access to parts. While IBM has shifted its focus
away from hardware toward its more profitable software and
services businesses, the mainframe operations have high gross
margins and help pull in revenue for other divisions. </p>
<p>It seems that IBM has taken a pragmatic approach and
determined that these commitments do not constitute a
significant issue for them and that it''s preferable to get a
settlement and put this probe behind them instead of fighting
till the end, Christian Riis-Madsen, an antitrust partner in
Brussels at law firm O''Melveny  Myers LLP, said by telephone. </p>
<p>Non-Discriminatory Terms </p>
<p>IBM offered commitments to resolve concerns it may have
imposed unreasonable conditions for supplying competing
mainframe maintenance-service providers in breach of EU
antitrust rules. IBM will ensure that third-party providers
receive technical information under reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms, the regulator said. </p>
<p>The company said in an e-mailed statement that it
welcomes the commission''s decision to close the
investigation of IBM''s mainframe and associated intellectual
property rights. The company said it also looked forward to
providing the basis for the final resolution of the probe into
maintenance practices. </p>
<p>IBM rose 1.8 percent to $176.30 in New York Stock Exchange
trading at 4:32 p.m. London time. </p>
<p>IBM does not agree with the commission''s preliminary
assessment that the company may have abused a dominant
position on the market for certain inputs necessarily required
for the maintenance of IBM mainframe hardware and software,
the commission said in an EU document published today. </p>
<p>Comments on IBM''s practices can be submitted to the
commission within a month. After that, the agency will either
make the commitments legally binding, without saying whether
there was an infringement, or start another round of market
testing if there are substantial changes to the remedies. </p>
<p>Google Probe </p>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) is another U.S. technology company under EU
scrutiny, with a focus on whether the world''s largest Web search
company has a dominant position that allows it to influence the
behavior of Internet users. </p>
<p>EU Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week
that he is investigating whether Mountain View, California-based
Google is a gate keeper and able to influence the behavior of
Internet users. A string of antitrust probes against technology
companies by Almunia''s predecessor, Neelie Kroes, resulted in
1.68 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in fines against Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and a record 1.06 billion-euro penalty against Intel Corp. (INTC)
Intel has an appeal pending. </p>
<p>IBM began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and
1950s and is now among the few companies selling the systems. </p>
<p>I commend IBM''s readiness to address our concerns about
fair competition in the market for large computers, Almunia
said in a statement today. </p>

<p>A U.S. senator known on Wall Street

Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and tax-code critic. </p>
<p>The special congressional committee set up to cut $1.5
trillion from the federal deficit should consider taxing futures
and other derivatives at ordinary income rates, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, wrote in a letter to the panel.
The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that a similar
administration proposal could raise about $2.8 billion in

<p>Futures, non-equity options and other types of derivatives

<p>Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the
state oil company, and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) are negotiating an
arbitration settlement of about $6 billion for assets seized by
President Hugo Chavez in 2007. </p>
<p>Venezuela will pay any ruling issued by the World Bank''s
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or
ICSID, that is in Exxon''s favor, Carlos Escarra, the country''s
prosecutor general, told reporters today in Caracas. </p>
<p>They started asking for $20 billion, Escarra said,
referring to Exxon''s original demands for compensation. Talks
dropped to around $12 billion, and now they are around $6
billion. Venezuela has to pay -- we are clear on that. The
problem now is how much we will pay. </p>
<p>Chavez, since coming to power in 1999, has nationalized
parts of the oil, metals, cement and utilities industries. In
2007, he forced foreign oil producers into joint ventures as
minority partners. Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil and
ConocoPhillips (COP) rejected the revised terms and instead entered
into international arbitration. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil does not comment on media reports, said
Patrick McGinn, a Houston-based spokesman. Exxon, the world''s
largest oil company, reduced the amount it''s seeking for the
takeover of its Cerro Negro venture in the Orinoco heavy crude
belt to $7 billion from $12 billion last year, PDVSA said in a
bond prospectus at the time. </p>
<p>Venezuela is evaluating the amount that we would consider
to be a triumph, Escarra said. </p>
<p>Venezuela Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said the country
proposed paying Exxon $1 billion in compensation, Reuters
reported. Phone calls after business hours to PDVSA, as the
state oil company is known, were not returned. </p>
<p>Arbitration Results </p>
<p>As the figure for the settlement has been coming down
with the passage of time, that is good news for the sovereign
and PDVSA, Boris Segura, a Latin America strategist with
Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York, said today in
an interview from New York. But most importantly, Mr. Escarra
was unequivocal in saying that Venezuela will abide by the
results of the arbitration. </p>
<p>The Washington-based ICSID ruled on June 10 that it has
jurisdiction over any disputes after Feb. 21, 2006, for the
Cerro Negro project, according to documents posted on the
agency''s website. PDVSA previously argued that the matter should
be resolved in Venezuelan courts. </p>
<p>The Cerro Negro joint venture refined tar-like crude into
synthetic oil from wells in the Orinoco belt. </p>
<p>Regional Arbitration </p>
<p>Exxon initially won an order in the U.K. blocking PDVSA
from selling $12 billion of assets anywhere in the world. The
order was overturned by a U.K. court in March 2009. </p>
<p>Escarra, who was sworn into office as state prosecutor on
Aug. 30, said he previously advised Chavez to withdraw Venezuela
from the World Bank investment dispute unit when he was a
lawmaker in Venezuela''s National Assembly. </p>
<p>In my opinion, we should leave. Ecuador and Bolivia have
already pulled out, and Argentina is pushing for a Latin
American arbitration court, Escarra said. But as the
prosecutor, I follow instructions from Chavez. </p>
<p>Exxon fell 2.8 percent to close at $71.97 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own Venezuelan
government bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 17 basis
points, 0.17 percentage point, to 1,315 basis points today at
5:21 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan  Chase Co.''s
EMBI+. </p>
<p>Yields on the government''s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds
maturing in 2027 rose 31 basis points to 14.84 percent. The
price fell 1.4 cents on the dollar to 66.17 cents. </p>
<p>As risky assets worldwide were under pressure today,
don''t expect a positive day for Venezuelan assets, not even with
this news, Segura said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley plans to alter the
way it brings orders together in dark pools, trying to encourage
bigger trades for institutional customers after a three-year
decline in the number of shares per transaction industrywide. </p>
<p>The bank, which operates venues in the U.S., Europe, Hong
Kong, Japan and Australia that match buyers and sellers without
showing bids and offers, will give priority to larger orders at
a specified price instead of those that arrived first, Bill Neuberger, co-head of Morgan Stanley Electronic Trading, said in
a phone interview. MS POOL, which is adopting a model similar to
one used by a Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ) exchange, is among the first
dark pools to offer the protocol in the U.S. </p>
<p>We want to reward size and de-emphasize speed,
Neuberger said. MS POOL had the second-smallest average trade
size in July among venues tracked by Rosenblatt Securities Inc.
They averaged 209 shares in August, Neuberger said. Fewer 100-
share prints in dark pools may be a good thing, he said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s changes are part of an effort to portray
its venues as places where sophisticated users employing high-
frequency strategies have less influence. Larger trade sizes may
connote less interaction with proprietary trading firms, whose
ability to sniff out and exploit the intentions of investors was
one of the reasons dark pools gained popularity in the latter
half of the last decade. </p>
<p>Getting Smaller </p>
<p>Trades in most dark pools average 200 shares to 300 shares,
down from 300 shares to 400 shares in 2008 and 2009, Justin Schack, managing director for market structure analysis at
Rosenblatt Securities, a New York-based broker that analyzes
dark pool volume and trends, said in a phone interview. The
decline may have resulted from more high-frequency penetration
in venues that don''t display quotes, increased stock volatility,
or algorithms reacting to trades they receive, he said. </p>
<p>U.S. dark pools followed by Rosenblatt accounted for 12.3
percent of U.S. volume in July, compared with 10.9 percent a
year earlier. There are about 40 U.S. pools, with data from the
largest included in Rosenblatt''s tally. A category of hidden
orders on equity exchanges such as Nasdaq Stock Market and the
New York Stock Exchange totaled 3.4 percent. More than 9 percent
of volume on the main exchange run by Lenexa, Kansas-based Bats
Global Markets was in dark or hidden orders, Rosenblatt said. </p>
<p>Market Share </p>
<p>MS POOL traded 61 million shares daily on average last
month, or 0.6 percent of U.S. equity volume, according to data
compiled by Morgan Stanley and Bloomberg. The broker had 0.7
percent of volume in July, Rosenblatt data showed. Credit Suisse
Group AG''s Crossfinder, the largest dark pool, had 2.2 percent
of U.S. volume, followed by New York-based Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)''s Sigma X with 1.5 percent. Zurich-based Credit Suisse''s
venue had the smallest average trade size in July, with 188
shares, according to Rosenblatt data. </p>
<p>U.S. stock exchanges match orders submitted to them against
incoming buy and sell requests based on when they were received,
a system called price-time priority. Among markets run by larger
exchange operators, only the New York Stock Exchange and NYSE
Amex allow certain firms -- brokers working on the exchange''s
floor and so-called designated market makers -- to jump ahead
and execute alongside those next in line to trade. Nasdaq OMX
PSX, which relies on price-size priority, began last year. </p>
<p>Order Size </p>
<p>Existing orders at a given price in MS POOL will trade
based on the number of shares they initially represented. If a
firm wants to buy 1,000 shares and another subsequently bid for
5,000 shares, the second one would move ahead of the 1,000-share
order. Even if smaller orders trade against the 5,000 shares and
500 shares remained, the order retains its priority because it
initially was bigger, Neuberger said from New York. </p>
<p>Nasdaq OMX PSX has a different version of price-size
priority. Existing orders trade based on the number of shares
they represent, with incoming orders distributed proportionally.
In the last example, an incoming order for 600 shares would
trade 500 shares against the 5,000-share bid and 100 against the
smaller one. Nasdaq OMX chose this method to avoid hurting the
senders of smaller orders that are publicly displayed who might
otherwise not send bids or offers. </p>
<p>Sapna Patel, head of market structure and liquidity
strategy for the Americas for Morgan Stanley, said a customer in
a dark pool isn''t revealing his intentions because bids and
offers aren''t public. Since it''s a different model, the
trader may opt to supply larger orders, she said. </p>
<p>The new rules are expected to become effective in MS POOL
in the U.S. and Europe next week and in Asia later this year,
she said. </p>
<p>Customer Curiosity </p>
<p>Investment Technology Group Inc.''s Posit dark pool uses
price-size priority to match buy and sell orders, according to
J.T. Farley, a spokesman. Other dark pools employ versions of
the protocol. Bids Trading LP gives users a choice about how to
execute their trade requests, Tim Mahoney, chief executive
officer of the dark pool operator, wrote in an e-mail. Both
companies are in New York. </p>
<p>Whit Conary, chief executive officer of Level ATS, a
Boston-based dark pool operator, said investors have asked
venues that don''t display quotes for more information about what
kind of traders are on their system, what kind of orders are
available and how rules on the platforms work. The information
helps users make better decisions about where they want to send
orders, he said. More brokers are also reporting trading volume
to Rosenblatt to increase transparency in the market. Level
traded almost 49 million shares in July, Rosenblatt data showed. </p>
<p>Electronic Way'' </p>
<p>More broker-dealers are finding it''s efficient to have an
electronic way to match internal sources of order flow, Conary
said in a phone interview. The result is that more dark pools
are finding customers, he said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley introduced MS POOL in the U.S. in 2006 and
in Europe in 2008. It runs another network called MS Trajectory
Cross in countries where MS POOL operates. That system matches
pieces of bigger algorithmic orders according to the stock''s
average price weighted by volume over a period of time. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley hasn''t allowed some types of trading that
other dark pools encourage to attract orders. The firm doesn''t
let traders to submit orders that must be executed immediately
or canceled. It doesn''t send messages called indications of
interest to other pools or venues to solicit orders. Users must
also keep orders in MS POOL for at least a second before
withdrawing them -- a long time for many high-frequency traders.
That discourages short-term players, Neuberger said. </p>
<p>Minimum-Share Requirements </p>
<p>Some customers are asking whether dark pools aggregate
orders from users to get around minimum-share size requirements
that some investors place on orders. Such a restriction might be
sought to avoid trading against automated firms that prefer 100-
share transactions. </p>
<p>Schack said he asked dark pools several months ago to count
orders aggregated to meet a minimum-share size imposed by the
counterparty as separate trades in their reporting. Bulking
inflates the average trade size, which some investors use to
assess the type of liquidity in a venue, he said. </p>
<p>Conary said Level, which is used by about 185 broker-dealer
customers, lets members choose whether to allow minimum-share
sizes they impose to be met by multiple orders. </p>
<p>Changes at MS POOL come as regulators in Canada and Europe
are considering rules to limit trading in dark pools that don''t
give investors better prices or larger executions than what''s
publicly available. While the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has raised the prospect of a similar restriction,
called a trade-at rule, many institutional investors and retail
brokers have said they wouldn''t support that since it would hurt
their transactions. </p>
<p>Trade Transparency </p>
<p>Separately, the SEC in October 2009 proposed rules that
would increase transparency for trades in dark pools and reduce
the amount of daily volume in a company''s shares that can be
executed on the systems before prices must be made public. The
agency hasn''t acted on that proposal, in part because of dozens
of new rules it has had to write related to the Dodd-Frank Act,
the financial overhaul enacted in July 2010. </p>
<p>The SEC may be more likely to address the October 2009
proposal first, Schack said. The trade-at rule is incredibly
controversial. It has many organized, vocal opponents and very
few organized and vocal supporters. </p>

<p>     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, closed below $100 for the
first time since March 2009 as financial stocks fell amid
concerns about the European debt crisis. </p>
<p>The shares fell $4.75, or 4.6 percent, to $97.86 at 4:03
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest
closing price since March 20, 2009. The stock dropped briefly
below $100 earlier this month before climbing back above $100 by
the end of the trading session. Goldman Sachs has declined 42
percent this year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell amid an overall decline in U.S.
financial stocks, with the Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials
Index dropping 4.9 percent. Moody''s Investors Service lowered
credit ratings on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
and reduced Citigroup Inc.''s short-term rating today. </p>
<p>Most of it is still Europe and the uncertainty about what
the resolution of the sovereign debt problems will be, said
David Hilder, an analyst at New York-based Susquehanna Financial
Group. The Moody''s downgrades certainly didn''t help. Hilder
has a positive rating on Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and
Wells Fargo and a neutral on Citigroup. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
sustained the biggest decline in the SP 500 Financials Index as
the stock fell $1.30, or 8.6 percent, to $13.82. </p>

<p>Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) and
Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), two U.S. producers of coal used in
steelmaking, tumbled after they respectively cut output and
sales forecasts because of mining disruptions. </p>
<p>Shares of Alpha fell $4.62, or 17 percent, to $22.30 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Walter
declined $8.75, or 12 percent, to $66.25. </p>
<p>Alpha''s full-year production will be 102.5 million to 109.5
million tons, compared with a previous prediction of 104 million
to 112 million tons, the Abingdon, Virginia-based company said
today in a statement. Alpha cited unexpectedly curtailed
customer activity in Asia and lower-than-expected output from
some mines. </p>
<p>Walter''s second-half sales will be similar to the 5.2
million metric tons recorded for the first half, the Birmingham,
Alabama-based company said in a statement. Its previous forecast
for second-half sales was 5.9 million tons. </p>
<p>Alpha and Walter are both trying to integrate mines bought
earlier this year in separate acquisitions. Alpha bought Massey
Energy Co. for $7.1 billion in June and said today output from
some Central Appalachian Massey mines has disappointed. Walter
purchased Western Coal Corp. for C$5.3 billion ($5.31 billion)
in April, giving it production in British Columbia. Rainfall in
the Canadian province has curbed output, Walter said today. </p>
<p>Difficult'' Geology </p>
<p>Walter said third-quarter earnings will be $1 to $1.16 a
share. The average of 15 analysts'' estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for $3.24. Walter forecast fourth-quarter earnings
of $2.63 to $2.95 a share. The average from the analysts''
estimates was for $3.17. </p>
<p>The company said it''s dealing with difficult geology at
its Mine Number 7 in Alabama. </p>
<p>It is possible these challenges could tempt a large
company to look to buy Walter''s world-class assets on the
cheap,'''' Jeremy Sussman and Lucas Pipes, analysts at Brean
Murray Carret  Co. in New York, said in a note today. They
maintained their hold'''' rating for Walter and buy''''
recommendation for Alpha.'''' </p>
<p>Walter jumped 21 percent on Sept. 7 after the London-based
Times said Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. may be
considering takeover bids. Walter investor Audley Capital
Advisors LLP said in July that the company should explore a
sale. </p>
<p>The company said Sept. 12 it appointed Walter J. Scheller
III as chief executive. Keith Calder resigned as CEO on June 30,
citing differences of opinion with the board concerning
management philosophy.'''' </p>
<p>Alpha completed the Massey acquisition 14 months after an
explosion at Massey''s Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia
killed 29 people, the deadliest coal accident in 40 years. </p>

national network can process electronic payment transactions by
Ukrainians in Ukraine, according to Joshua R. Floum, the general
council of the world''s largest payments network. He spoke in a
Sept. 16 interview in Yalta, Ukraine, after meeting central bank
management. </p>
<p>The legislation concerns our business, we have a strong
disagreement over the domestic monopoly issue, said Floum, who
was attending a conference at Black Sea resort. If we were
excluded from Ukraine, it does take away a lot of incentive to
do business here. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest payment
network, are both active in Ukraine, which has a population of
46 million. Card transactions totaled 20.47 million hryvnia
($2.56 million) in the first half of this year, compared with
29.5 million hryvnia in 2010, according to central bank data. </p>
<p>If the (draft) law is changed, the outlook is very
good,  Floum said. For growth, the sky is the limit. </p>
<p>Floum said the payment network is very anxious'''' to
provide the central bank with technical support as they work
through the rulemaking process, noting that Visa has an
advantage over any domestic scheme'''' due to its global network
capabilities. </p>
<p>U.S. Regulations </p>
<p>San Francisco-based Visa is dealing with regulatory issues
in the U.S. after the Federal Reserve in July completed new
rules to cap debit-card swipe fees charged to merchants. Floum,
who testified in front of the U.S. Congress, said the company
has a very good strategy to mitigate'''' consequences of new
regulation on debit-card transaction fees that is set to take
effect in October. </p>
<p>We will modify our fee structure,'''' he said. We are
going to move from a variable fee that the merchants pay to the
banks for the visa fees. We are going to ask merchants and their
banks to pay a fixed fee rather than a variable fee based on the
transaction.'''' </p>
<p>Visa has also a strategy to win decisions from merchants
for both'''' signature and pin debit transactions, Floum said. </p>
<p>The Fed limited debit fees to 21 cents per swipe in June.
The system replaces a formula based on a percentage of the
purchase price that averaged 44 cents. </p>
<p>Big Merchants </p>
<p>We opposed the law, it was not a good idea and we
continue to have that feeling,'''' Floum said. </p>
<p>Floum blamed the bigger U.S. merchants, including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., for pushing U.S. lawmakers to include the rule in
last year''s Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul
signed into law by President Barack Obama. </p>
<p>Banks and payment networks came close to halting the new
rules this year as lawmakers pushed to delay their
implementation. In the end, the merchants won, largely due to
the lobbying of Congress, Floum said. </p>

<p>When Carol Perkins arrives at the
office, she checks e-mails, organizes files, and calls
corporations as part of a fund-raising effort. </p>
<p>Perkins, 60, works at the Urban League of Essex County in
New Jersey through a U.S. senior-citizen jobs program that used
to pay for an average of 20 hours a week of training and work.
In April, Congress sliced tens of millions of dollars in
funding, and Perkins'' schedule was cut by at least half --
forcing her to turn to welfare to pay the rent after her monthly
take home fell more than $100. </p>
<p>I''m devastated, said Perkins, of Montclair, New Jersey,
who said her previous administrative support jobs at New York-
based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bear Stearns Cos. were
eliminated. We need jobs. It''s as if they have forgotten about
us seniors and we''ll wind up out on the street. I just want to
work. </p>
<p>The funding cut illustrates the conflict between the need
to put people back to work and the mandate of a 12-member
congressional supercommittee to cut $1.5 trillion from the
deficit. Scaling back the job training for U.S. seniors will
mean fewer work opportunities as President Barack Obama pushes a
job stimulus plan, unveiled Sept. 8, aimed at easing
unemployment that has been 9 percent or higher for five straight
months. </p>
<p>It also shows how cuts to federal spending can exacerbate
the jobless situation and shift seniors into other public
assistance programs, negating some of the savings, according to
groups that help run the training. Organizations said they''ve
reduced paid training, work hours, and in some cases are turning
away seniors seeking the job-based training. </p>
<p>Homeless Seniors </p>
<p>Many in the program, which is aimed at unemployed, low-
income people who are 55 or older, need the paid training and
work: Almost 40 percent were homeless or at risk of being
homeless in 2009, according to the Labor Department. </p>
<p>The unemployment rate for people age 55 and older is at
levels not seen since at least 1948, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. It peaked at 7.3 percent in 2010 and was at
6.6 percent in August. </p>
<p>In 2000, the seniors'' rate was below 3 percent. </p>
<p>Older Americans are more likely than any other age group to
remain out of work for 99 weeks or more, according to a December
2010 report by the Congressional Research Service, which
provides policy and legal analysis to lawmakers. </p>
<p>45% Funding Cut </p>
<p>Funding for the Senior Community Service Employment Program
was cut 45 percent, to about $450 million for the year that ends
June 2012, from $825 million approved in 2010, under an April
budget deal forged by Congress and Obama. The previous year
included $225 million from federal Recovery Act money, and
excluding that appropriation the drop was 25 percent, according
to the Labor Department. </p>
<p>The Obama administration in proposing the cut found
little evidence that spending on seniors'' job training
successfully promotes unsubsidized employment or provides
cost-effective community service. </p>
<p>Cutting the program is necessary as the government seeks to
close the deficit, Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against
Government Waste, a Washington-based advocacy group, said in an
interview. </p>
<p>There are ways to help people find work without spending
a lot of money, Schatz said. The objective has to be to help
as many as possible with the least cost. </p>
<p>Program Merits </p>
<p>Shrinking the seniors jobs program shows how efforts to
curb the deficit by slashing spending can exacerbate the jobless
situation, said Lita Levine Kleger, a spokeswoman for Arlington,
Virginia-based Experience Works Inc., which helps low-income
seniors with employment. </p>
<p>I understand there''s this conversation in Congress about
making tough choices, but there has to be some discussion on the
merits of what actually works, Levine Kleger said in an
interview. This program gets people jobs. </p>
<p>Experience Works cut about 140 staff positions and closed a
customer-service center in Waco, Texas, Levine Kleger said.
They''re turning away interested applicants, she said. </p>
<p>Participants in the U.S. program generally earn minimum
wage and work an average of 20 hours a week. The goal is to help
participants get paying jobs, according to the Labor Department. </p>
<p>Unnecessary Spending'' </p>
<p>Cutting the training and work effort makes little fiscal
sense, according to lawmakers such as U.S. Representative
Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat. </p>
<p>If you take away this, what other problems are you
creating? Rangel said in an interview. What are seniors
supposed to do if they can''t find a job and are on a limited
income? When you talk about taking away money from seniors who
are fragile economically, that has an effect. I wish when people
talked about spending, they''d talk about cutting unnecessary
spending. </p>
<p>Republican Representative Michael Simpson of Idaho, a House
Appropriations committee member who sits on three panels, said
the senior training service is an employment initiative that
simply fell victim to the deficit-reduction drive. </p>
<p>I don''t think anybody is going to be pleased, Simpson
said in an interview. The reality is that as we try to reduce
spending, it''s taken a larger budget reduction. </p>
<p>To qualify, a seniors'' income must be 125 percent of
federal poverty guidelines, or $13,613 a year for a family of
one, in most states. </p>
<p>Participation is expected to fall to 70,537 people in the
year ending June 30, 2012, according to an agency report. That''s
down almost half from 130,223 the agency estimated for 2010. </p>
<p>It''s Absurd'' </p>
<p>It''s absurd, Marc Morial, chief executive officer of
the National Urban League Inc., a New York-based civil rights
group that focuses on economic issues, said in an interview.
Obama is talking about jobs, and this is a jobs program. The
best deficit reduction program is a jobs program. </p>
<p>Cutting the funds also worsens the U.S. deficit as seniors
have less disposable income to spend, pay less in taxes, and
rely more on government aid such as food stamps, he said. </p>
<p>Valerie Farrer, 77, of Verona, Wisconsin, in September 2009
qualified for the aid, working in the town library and
eventually teaching jobs skills at Experience Works. </p>
<p>Her schedule has been scaled back to 22 hours a week from
28 hours following the budget cuts, she said, and her income has
dropped $200 a month. Farrer said she doesn''t turn on the air
conditioner, has cut back on groceries and limits herself to
necessities to help save money. </p>
<p>She gets some help from Social Security. That income is
drained on such expenses as supplemental Medicare insurance and
car insurance, she said. </p>
<p>It''s Devastating'' </p>
<p>It''s devastating when the hours are cut, Farrer said in
an interview. You feel as though you''re trapped. With the
program, there''s a reason to get up every day. Then the hours
are cut and it turns back into depression. </p>
<p>Fallout is being felt at the Urban League of Essex County
in Newark, New Jersey, which lost about $1.2 million in funding
on June 30, Vann Holland, director of workforce operations, said
in an interview. That left enough money to help 132
participants, said Holland, not enough for the 500 seniors
currently being aided. To help stretch dollars, training hours
were reduced to 10 hours from 20 hours a week, he said. </p>
<p>We may run out of money end of December or January, he
said. We may have to end the program. </p>
<p>The National Caucus and Center on Black Aged Inc. in
Washington, which assists low-income seniors, fired nine full-
time staffers, and the 1,800 participants in D.C. and eight
states now train 15 hours a week, down from 20 hours, Karyne
Jones, chief executive officer, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Food Stamps </p>
<p>Some participants have lost their apartments or have gone
to agencies to get food stamps, Adrienne Wiggins, the
program''s coordinator for the group, said an interview. </p>
<p>Barbara Oliphant, 65, of Washington, earned about $660 a
month for 20 hours of training as a job counselor through the
program. With a reduction in hours, she said in an interview
that she now gets about $500 for 15 hours. </p>
<p>It''s had a big impact, said Oliphant, who lives with
her son and pays for utilities and her groceries. With the
cutbacks, it''s just enough to get by. It''s very stressful. </p>
<p>For Perkins, the reduced training hours have left her
worried about paying her rent, she said. She no longer buys
vision contacts and she scrimps on groceries. Some weeks she
skips doing her laundry, she said. </p>
<p>I don''t understand what Congress is doing, Perkins said
in an interview. You''re older now but you still have skills.
This program gives you hope. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said
investors should keep buying commodities because supply
disappointments will support prices even as the sovereign-debt
crisis and slowing economies threaten demand. </p>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index of 24
raw materials will climb 20 percent in the next 12 months, said
Jeffrey Currie, Goldman''s London-based head of commodity
research. Copper will jump 43 percent to a record $11,000 a
metric ton, while crude oil in New York surges 62 percent to
$131 a barrel, he forecast. The bank correctly advised investors
to sell oil and copper in April and turned more bullish the
following month as metals and energy rebounded. </p>
<p>Commodities erased their gains for the year today, leaving
the SP GSCI spot index down 3.9 percent in 2011, after the
Federal Reserve said there are significant downside risks to
the economic outlook. The gauge has still jumped 31 percent in
the past two years, outperforming global equities and
Treasuries, as adverse weather threatened global crops and
China''s demand for copper, cotton and soybeans surged. </p>
<p>Despite the recent macroeconomic uncertainty, commodity
prices have been remarkably resilient, Currie said in a report
today. Driving this resiliency and substantially less
volatility has been continued evidence of a relatively stronger
fundamental picture due to a combination of supply
disappointments and significant demand from emerging markets. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI spot index fell 4.9 percent to 607.49 at 3:57
p.m. in New York, bringing the gauge down more than 20 percent
from this year''s high and heading for a so-called bear market. </p>
<p>Hedge Funds </p>
<p>In the week ended Sept. 13, hedge funds and other money
managers cut their bullish bets on raw materials for the time in
five weeks, U.S. government data show. Investors placed 29
percent less cash in commodity exchange-traded products in the
first seven months of the year, Barclays Capital said on Sept.
14. Societe Generale SA''s global asset-allocation team went
underweight on commodities last week, saying that the asset
class is in the danger zone. </p>
<p>We believe that a global recession and/or financial
crisis would be required to derail our constructive commodity
views, Currie said. We continue to recommend an overweight
positioning in commodities. </p>
<p>Copper Shortage </p>
<p>In the six months ended in June, copper supplies trailed
demand by 130,000 tons, the International Copper Study Group
said yesterday. The most-expensive drought in Texas history has
parched pastures, prompting ranchers to cull the most breeding
cows ever and driving livestock prices to a record. The hottest
July since 1955 in the U.S. Midwest eroded corn yields and will
leave inventories before next year''s harvest at the lowest level
since 1996 as a percentage of consumption, government data show. </p>
<p>Energy commodities in the GSCI Enhanced Index will advance
almost 26 percent in the next 12 months, and industrial metals
will jump 23 percent, Goldman said. Agriculture will climb 4.8
percent and precious metals by 4 percent, according to the
report. The bank lowered its three-month forecast for New York
oil by 15 percent to $97.50 a barrel. </p>
<p>We believe that the recent sell-off presents a relatively
good opportunity for longer-dated purchases, Currie said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued mutual
fund firm American Century Cos. over claims it was shortchanged
in an $848 million optioned-share sale to Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce. </p>
<p>American Century failed to disclose material information
regarding the sale and the shares weren''t purchased at their
fair market value, lawyers for JPMorgan said in a public version
of the complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court. The
complaint was initially filed under seal. </p>
<p>The allegation that American Century breached an option
agreement is without merit and the edited complaint filed in
Delaware yesterday is an inaccurate and incomplete
representation of the facts, American Century said in a
statement e-mailed by Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the firm. </p>
<p>CIBC, Canada''s fifth-largest bank, announced in July that
it agreed to buy a 41 percent stake in American Century from
JPMorgan. The cash acquisition is the third-largest purchase by
the Toronto-based bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan purchased a roughly 45 percent interest in Kansas
City, Missouri-based American Century for about $900 million in
January 1998, according to the complaint. Under a 2009 option
agreement between American and JPMorgan, American could buy all
of the shares JPMorgan owned in the firm and resell them to a
third party. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, said in its complaint that it
learned of the share sale through a public announcement. The
transaction was completed on Aug. 31. </p>
<p>Withheld Information </p>
<p>American Century improperly withheld information
regarding the CIBC stock sale from JPMorgan''s director designee
on American Century''s board, lawyers for the bank said in the
redacted complaint. </p>
<p>American Century understated its financial position to
an independent adviser, causing a report that served as the
basis for the share repurchase to understate the firm''s fair
market value, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is seeking a trial to determine unspecified
damages. </p>
<p>American Century accused JPMorgan of filing the complaint
as a tactical reaction to an adverse result in another
matter recently concluded in favor of the firm. Doyle declined
to identify that matter. </p>
<p>The heavily edited complaint removes information that
reflects negatively on JPMorgan''s conduct in the other matter,
American Century said in the statement. We believe that the
information JPM removed from the complaint is not confidential
and we will soon be taking appropriate action to have the
redacted information unsealed. </p>
<p>The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. American Century
Companies Inc., CA6875, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the

Gregg Lemkau to become head of mergers and acquisitions in
Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, a newly created position. </p>
<p>Lemkau, 42, who has been co-head of technology, media, and
telecommunications since 2008, will keep responsibilities for
many of his current clients, the New York-based bank said in an
internal memorandum to employees obtained by Bloomberg News.
Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Lemkau, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1992, became a partner
in 2002. He previously worked as chief operating officer of the
investment banking division. He will join a global mergers team
overseen by co-heads Yoel Zaoui and Gene T. Sykes, with Richard Campbell-Breeden as head of mergers for Asia outside Japan and
Dusty Philip and Michael Carr as co-heads for the Americas. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has advised on 208 announced transactions for
a total value of $405 billion so far this year, second only to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s $428 billion, according to data compiled

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world''s largest consumer-payment networks, will raise debit-card
fees charged for small-ticket purchases to the full amount
allowed under new rules, according to an analyst. </p>
<p>Visa, the world''s largest network, and No. 2 MasterCard may
increase fees from 8 cents on a $2 purchase to 23 cents, Thomas McCrohan, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, wrote in a
note. They will eliminate the so-called interchange portion of
the fee, charging the highest amount allowed by rules announced
in June, McCrohan said yesterday in an interview. </p>
<p>The change will kill the economics for small-ticket debit
purchases and influence a shift back to credit cards, McCrohan
wrote. It will almost certainly lead to a merchant revolt
against the card networks. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve said June 29 that U.S. debit-card
transaction fees, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, can''t exceed
24 cents on an average transaction, replacing a formula that
averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44 cents.
The limits, championed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, an
Illinois Democrat, spurred banks to curtail debit-card rewards
programs and add fees for checking accounts. </p>
<p>The fee increase could be an attempt by San Francisco-based
Visa and MasterCard to recoup fees for banks, to affect consumer
use of mobile payment services or to influence a pending
lawsuit, McCrohan wrote. The caps may reduce revenue at U.S.
banks by $8 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg Government show. </p>
<p>MasterCard''s Interchange Structure </p>
<p>MasterCard recently informed our issuers that we will
implement a two-tiered interchange structure, James Issokson,
a spokesman at Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, said in an
e-mailed statement. As we have noted throughout this process,
setting price caps will -- and has -- created distortions in the
market. </p>
<p>Will Valentine, a Visa spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The Fed capped debit fees at 21 cents per swipe. It will
let issuers tack on 5 basis points of each transaction, or
almost 2 cents based on the average debit ticket of $38, and a
conditional 1-cent adjustment for lenders that follow certain
fraud-prevention standards. </p>

<p>     Sept. 22 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will
probably report a third-quarter loss as market tumult prevents
the bank from generating a profit for only the second time in 12
years as a public company, Barclays Capital analysts estimated. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs may lose 35 cents a share in the three months
ended Sept. 30, down from a prior estimate of $2.40 in earnings
per share, the analysts, led by Roger Freeman, said in a note to
clients today. They cut their earnings-per-share estimate for
Morgan Stanley to 12 cents from 43 cents. </p>
<p>Declines in asset prices will cause losses on some of
Goldman Sachs''s principal investments, which include stakes in
companies and real estate, the analysts wrote. Trading revenue
and investment banking fees have also been reduced amid falling
equity and credit markets and concerns that the European
sovereign debt crisis is worsening. </p>
<p>Nearly every line is being marked down from our prior
forecasts, which were not particularly optimistic to begin
with, the analysts wrote. Some revenue lines are being
reduced by more than half and, due to the equity- and debt-
market decline, we are now incorporating large principal
investment losses. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the most profitable U.S. securities firm
in Wall Street history before converting to a bank in September
2008 after the collapse of smaller rival Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. The fourth quarter of 2008 was the only time since
Goldman Sachs went public in 1999 that the firm has reported a
quarterly loss. Morgan Stanley (MS), which was the second-biggest
securities firm after Goldman Sachs, also converted to a bank in
2008 and has expanded its retail brokerage business. </p>
<p>Stocks Fall </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs fell $5.28, or 5.4 percent, to $92.58, at
12:08 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the
lowest level since March 2009. Morgan Stanley fell $1.16, or 8.4
percent, to $12.66, the lowest level since December 2008. </p>
<p>The two companies are dropping amid an overall decline in
U.S. financial stocks, with the Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials
Index declining 3.4 percent. Moody''s Investors Service yesterday
lowered long-term credit ratings on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and reduced Citigroup Inc. (C)''s short-term
rating. </p>
<p>Barclays Capital is the investment-banking unit of Barclays
Plc (BARC), Britain''s second-largest bank by assets. </p>

<p>An ex-Galleon Group LLC trader and
expert-networking consultant were sentenced yesterday to 10
years and four years in prison for their roles in a nationwide
insider-trading scandal, just three weeks before Raj Rajaratnam,
the man at the center of the investigation, is to learn his
fate. </p>
<p>Zvi Goffer, the trader, and Winifred Jiau, who worked for
Primary Global Research LLC, were convicted in June in separate
Manhattan federal court trials. Jiau was sentenced yesterday to
four years after the government asked for as long as 10 years.
Goffer received a 10-year term following a U.S. request that he
serve almost 13 years. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam, 54, co-founder of Galleon, was found guilty in
May of directing the largest hedge-fund insider-trading ring. He
should be given a prison term of as long as 24 1/2 years when
sentenced, prosecutors said. His sentence was postponed
yesterday from Sept. 27 to Oct. 13. </p>
<p>The sentences for Goffer and Jiau are more severe than in
typical insider-trading cases where a defendant gets and trades
on information only once, said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor
at Columbia Law School in New York. </p>
<p>These were professionals engaging in this as their
regular course of business, Coffee said. They went about it
systematically. </p>
<p>Dozens of people have been charged with participating in
overlapping insider-trading rings by the office of U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The Goffer and Rajaratnam trials
featured phone conversations secretly recorded by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The two, along with Jiau, were
convicted based partly on the testimony of co-conspirators
cooperating with prosecutors. </p>
<p>Jurors at Jiau''s trial saw instant electronic messages that
a hedge fund analyst sent his boss while they were on the phone
with her. The analyst also recorded the calls. </p>
<p>Goffer, who co-founded Incremental Capital LLC after he was
fired from Galleon in 2008, was convicted of all 14 criminal
counts against him. Goffer''s brother, Emanuel, and Michael
Kimelman were convicted at the same trial. Prosecutors said Zvi
Goffer headed a ring that made more than $10 million trading in
3Com Corp., Axcan Pharma Inc., Kronos Inc. and Hilton Hotels
Corp. based on information misappropriated by two lawyers. </p>
<p>Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan
to send Goffer to prison for as long as 12 years and seven
months. </p>
<p>Goffer, 34, claimed he''s a changed man who deserves a
lesser sentence. </p>
<p>Jiau, 43, of Fremont, California, was convicted of one
count each of conspiracy and securities fraud. A jury found her
guilty of passing earnings and other information about Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to Noah Freeman, a
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager, and Samir
Barai, founder of New York-based Barai Capital Management LP. </p>
<p>Prosecutors argued Jiau should get eight to 10 years in
prison in papers filed with U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff.
Jiau''s lawyers downplayed her role in the chain of inside-traders and called the government''s suggested sentence
draconian. </p>
<p>If Ms. Jiau was at the heart'' of anything in this case,
it was of the gang that couldn''t shoot straight, they said. </p>
<p>The cases are U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, and U.S. v.
Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Lawsuits/Pretrial </h2>
<h2>ATT Says It Wants Trial of U.S. Suit to Block T-Mobile Deal </h2>
<p>ATT Inc. (T) is eager for a trial of the U.S. Justice
Department''s lawsuit challenging its proposed acquisition of
wireless carrier T-Mobile USA Inc., a lawyer for the company
said. </p>
<p>There was no talk of settlement yesterday in federal court
in Washington as Mark Hansen, an attorney for ATT, told U.S.
District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle that the company wants to get
to trial as quickly as possible. Huvelle, who had earlier told
the parties to come prepared to discuss settlement prospects,
set a trial date for Feb. 13. </p>
<p>We''re seeking a prompt trial because we''re very
interested in closing this transaction, Hansen, of Kellogg,
Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans  Figel PLLC in Washington, said
during the hour-long hearing. We need to have the cloud of
uncertainty removed. We''re already a month beyond where we want
to be. </p>
<p>The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)''s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would substantially reduce
competition. Last week, seven states joined the government''s
case seeking to stop the $39 billion deal. </p>
<p>ATT is still hopeful it can address the Justice
Department''s antitrust concerns and reach a settlement, Michael
Balmoris, an ATT spokesman, said in an e-mail after the
hearing. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<h2>Servier Founder Charged in Deaths Granted 4 Million-Euro Bail </h2>
<p>Jacques Servier, chairman of France''s second-largest
drugmaker, must post bail of 4 million euros ($5.51 million) and
his freedom may be restricted as he faces charges that he helped
hide the risks of a drug suspected of causing the deaths of as
many as 2,000 people. </p>
<p>Servier and five affiliated companies of Laboratoires
Servier, which he founded, were charged yesterday by French
magistrates, the company said in a statement. Servier must
provide a financial guarantee of 6 million euros by Dec. 15,
according to the release. </p>
<p>Servier, 89, was charged with involuntary manslaughter,
aggravated deception and fraud, the newspaper Le Monde reported,
citing his lawyer. The company remains innocent until proven
guilty and will finally be able to defend itself in a judicial
setting, it said in the statement. </p>
<p>Mediator, the diabetes drug at the root of the case, was
sold in France for 33 years until it was withdrawn in November
2009 on safety concerns. It was widely used as an appetite
suppressant. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan, Citigroup Seek Dismissal of Thornburg Lawsuit </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C) and other banks asked
a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by defunct Thornburg Mortgage Inc.,
saying the complaint didn''t adequately show that fraud occurred. </p>
<p>Trustee Joel Sher sued the banks for $2 billion in April,
alleging they helped push Thornburg, now called TMST Inc., into
a free-fall bankruptcy. Making unjustified margin calls,
the banks extracted more than $700 million of margin and
interest payments from Thornburg, then sold their collateral and
left the company to file for Chapter 11 protection during the
credit crisis in May 2009, Sher claimed. </p>
<p>The banks, including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc and UBS AG (UBSN), or their affiliates, were trading
partners of Thornburg''s in repurchase and swap transactions used
to finance its mortgage business, the banks said in a Sept. 20
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore. Under the repo
agreements, they could make margin calls at any time if the
counterparty had a margin deficit, they said. </p>
<p>Sher didn''t immediately return a phone call seeking comment
on the banks'' filing. He has updated the suit since it was
initially filed. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was named in the TMST suit because it bought
assets from Bear Stearns Cos., a lender to Thornburg. Sher filed
at least eight lawsuits from April 28 to April 30, seeking money
from Barclays Plc (BARC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and other companies. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy case is Thornburg Mortgage Inc., 09-17787,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore). </p>
<h2>UBS Moved Executive in FSA Risk-Management Case to Zurich </h2>
<p>A UBS AG executive accused of risk-management failures and
facing a potential fine by the U.K. finance regulator was moved
as early as 2008 from London to Zurich by Switzerland''s biggest
bank. </p>
<p>John Pottage, the former chief executive officer of UBS''s
wealth-management division in London, will challenge the
Financial Services Authority at a court hearing in November over
its attempt to fine him for not ensuring the unit had controls
to prevent unauthorized trades that began in 2006, according to
three people familiar with the case. He now works in risk
management, two people with knowledge of his role said. </p>
<p>The FSA fined UBS 8 million pounds ($12.5 million) in 2009,
at the time the third-largest penalty imposed by the regulator,
for failing to prevent employees in the international wealth-management business from making as many as 50 unauthorized
trades a day with funds from at least 39 customer accounts. The
case is an example of UBS failing to police errant trading in
London years before the bank said this week it lost $2.3 billion
from unauthorized trades. </p>
<p>Now that the machine has got going, every single bad
thing is going to come out, said Fred Ponzo, a capital markets
adviser at Greyspark Partners in London. </p>
<p>Pottage was authorized by the FSA until Dec. 15, 2008,
according to the watchdog''s website. He had authorization for
roles including chief executive, significant management,
director, apportionment and oversight, investment adviser and
insurance mediator. </p>
<p>Pottage declined to comment when reached at a UBS number in
Zurich. Yves Kaufmann, a UBS spokesman in Zurich, also declined
to comment. </p>
<p>Chris Hamilton, an FSA spokesman, declined to comment.
Tobias Lux, a spokesman at the Swiss regulator, declined to
comment on the case. Pottage''s lawyer, John Fordham, also

<h2>Madoff Trustee Loses Bid to Quash Request for Rehearing </h2>
<p>The liquidator of Bernard Madoff''s firm lost a bid to quash
investors'' request for a new hearing on how he calculates who
gets compensated for losses in Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York said Aug. 16 that
trustee Irving Picard can ignore fictitious profits on money
Madoff never invested when calculating losses and who is
entitled to be repaid. Some investors who wouldn''t get paid
under the formula asked for a rehearing, saying the appeals
court ruled differently in a previous case. </p>
<p>Picard''s move to strike the request was denied, according
to a court filing Sept. 20. </p>
<p>A group of Madoff investors had urged the court to require
Picard to use their final account statements, which included
fictitious profits on money Madoff never invested, to determine
losses. Picard''s formula limits the number of investors who can
claim money, and cuts the size of many claims. </p>
<p>Asking the court earlier this month to refuse to rehear the
issue, Picard said in a filing the investors failed to follow
the court''s rules. Some investors filed a 24-page petition
without asking for permission to file an oversized brief, he
said. Told by the court to shorten it, the petitioners seek to
dodge the court''s order, Picard said. </p>
<p>They split the arguments into two 15-page petitions, put
some of the appellants on one petition and the rest on the
other, and ask the court to consider the petitions as one,
Picard said. The court should strike the newly filed
petitions. </p>
<p>Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in North Carolina,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. </p>
<p>The case is In re Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC, 10-2378, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan). </p>
<h2>Google Says Oracle Seeking $2 Billion in Android Dispute </h2>
<p>Google Inc. (GOOG) said Oracle Corp. (ORCL) lowered its damages request
to at least $2 billion in a patent and copyright dispute over
Android software, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>Google, which said the estimate includes $1.2 billion in
damages for unjust enrichment in 2012 alone, asked a federal
judge to exclude parts of the calculation that it says aren''t
supported by the evidence. </p>
<p>In July, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco
threw out Oracle''s earlier estimate that it''s entitled to as
much as $6.1 billion in damages in a lawsuit claiming Google
infringed its Java patents when it created the Android operating
system, now running on more than 150 million mobile devices. </p>
<p>Oracle''s new damages report ignores governing law and the
guidelines of this court''s July 22, 2011, order, Google lawyer
Robert Van Nest said in a letter to Alsup Sept. 20. </p>
<p>Alsup ruled in July that a new estimate should start as low
as $100 million, a figure that Mountain View, California-based
Google was offered in 2006 to license Java from Sun Microsystems
Inc. Google rejected that offer by Sun, which Oracle later
acquired. </p>
<p>Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Redwood City,
California-based Oracle, the largest maker of database software,
declined to comment on the Google filing. </p>
<p>The two companies have made little headway this week in
negotiations aimed at resolving the lawsuit, a person briefed on
the talks said. Google Chief Executive Larry Page and Oracle CEO
Larry Ellison participated in a settlement conference that
lasted as long as 10 hours on Sept. 19 and returned to federal
court in San Jose, California, yesterday for further meetings
with a magistrate judge. </p>
<p>The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 10-03561,

<h2>Trials </h2>
<h2>Rambus Was Dethroned'' by Intel, Micron Attorney Tells Jury </h2>
<p>Rambus Inc. (RMBS)''s computer memory failed to become an industry
standard because it was dethroned by Intel Corp. (INTC), not as a
result of collusion by rivals, a lawyer for Micron Technology
Inc. (MU) told a jury. </p>
<p>In closing arguments at a state-court trial in San
Francisco, William Price, a lawyer for Micron, said yesterday
that Rambus was aware of technical problems with its version of
dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, when it signed a 1996
contract to work with Santa Clara, California-based Intel Corp.,
the world''s largest chipmaker. The jury began deliberating
yesterday. </p>
<p>The relationship was conceived in fraud, Price told
jurors. Intel lived with Rambus in an attempt to develop
Rambus-designed memory, or RDRAM, into a product, he said. </p>
<p>What Intel concluded at the end was RDRAM was not the
product they thought it was, and that Rambus was not the company
they thought it was, Price said. Intel selected Rambus to
become king, and Intel dethroned Rambus. </p>
<p>Rambus contends that Boise, Idaho-based Micron and Ichon,
South Korea-based Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) colluded to cut the
prices of their own DDR, or double data rate, memory chips and
deserted their commitment to produce RDRAM, relegating it to a
niche role. </p>
<p>Rambus, which doesn''t make the chips it designs, said it
would have made $3.95 billion in royalties without the alleged
conspiracy. Under California law, a jury finding of damages in
that amount would be automatically tripled to $11.9 billion. </p>
<p>The case is Rambus Inc. v. Micron Technology Inc., 04-0431105, California Superior Court (San Francisco). </p>

<h2>Banks Don''t Provide Swap Costs, JPMorgan Executive Tells Court </h2>
<p>Banks don''t typically disclose what they''re charging
municipalities to arrange derivatives, a practice that isn''t
required, Antonia Creanza, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker on
trial for fraud, told a Milan court. </p>
<p>Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, How does the bank make money?'' Creanza
told the court yesterday under questioning by her lawyer. I
would explain that we would retain a margin. Never has a legal
adviser told me, Look you need to detail the gross margin,''
she said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa Bank Plc are
on trial on charges of mis-selling swaps to Milan, derivatives
that adjusted payments on a 1.7 billion-euro ($2.4 billion) bond
offering from 2005. Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo said the banks
misled Milan by telling the city it could save about 55 million
euros with the bond sale and a series of swaps. Robledo says the
banks earned 101 million euros in hidden fees. The banks deny
the charges. </p>
<p>After selling swaps to municipalities for UniCredit SpA and
a unit of Dexia SA, Creanza told the court she joined JPMorgan''s
interest-rate derivatives team in 2004, then headed by Antonio
Polverino. JPMorgan was one many banks that courted Milan, she
said. </p>
<p>From December 2004 to March 2005, before Milan''s public
tender for the financing, JPMorgan discussed various financing
scenarios with the city, Creanza told the court. </p>

<h2>Lehman to Drop Appeal of Ruling in $11 Billion Barclays Suit </h2>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which is gathering creditor
support for a $65 billion liquidation plan before a November
vote, said it will drop its attempt to collect $11 billion from
Barclays Plc in a dispute over the sale of Lehman operations in
2008. </p>
<p>Lehman also won''t appeal a Sept. 14 ruling by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in Manhattan rejecting its claim
that Barclays owed about $500 million for allegedly unpaid
bonuses. Peck previously ruled against Lehman in the larger suit
against London-based Barclays. </p>
<p>While there are aspects of the decisions with which we do
not agree, we are also cognizant of the burdens that continued
litigation of these issues would place on the court and the
assets of the estate, the defunct firm said in a statement
yesterday. </p>
<p>After appealing Peck''s ruling in the bigger suit, Lehman
said yesterday it respects the time and effort the court has
devoted to the serious issues raised by the estate. Because of
the cost of continuing the litigation, Lehman said, we have
determined that we will not pursue these issues through appeals,
believing that the resources of the court and the estate will be
better employed at this point to move the bankruptcy toward a
conclusion. </p>
<p>Lehman, once the world''s fourth-biggest investment bank,
has spent about $1.4 billion on lawyers and managers since its
2008 bankruptcy filing, the largest in U.S. history, with assets
of $639 billion. </p>
<p>The New York-based firm''s bankruptcy became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the $757
million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.''s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by Lynn LoPucki, a
bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California, Los
Angeles. </p>
<p>Lehman''s creditors range from banks and hedge funds to the
New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Lehman filed for bankruptcy
on Sept. 15, 2008. </p>
<p>The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<h2>Verdicts/Settlements </h2>
<h2>BofA''s $8.5 Billion Mortgage-Bond Deal Defended by Investors </h2>
<p>A lawyer for a group of investors that includes BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) defended their $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement with
Bank of America Corp., saying a delay in getting court approval
costs them money. </p>
<p>They believe this is a very positive settlement, Robert
Madden, who represents 22 institutional investors, told a
federal judge in Manhattan at a court hearing yesterday. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Pauley heard arguments about
whether the settlement should be considered for approval in
federal court or returned to state court in New York, where it
was originally filed. </p>
<p>Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the mortgage-bond trustee
that sought approval for the settlement, opposes moving the case
to federal court. The removal by an investor group -- Walnut
Place LLC and related entities -- threatens to significantly
delay the state-court proceeding, the bank said in a court
filing. </p>
<p>Delay hurts investors, Madden said in an interview
after the hearing. When Bank of New York filed the proceeding in
state court, a judge set a November hearing to consider
approval. </p>
<p>The proposed settlement resolves a fight with the
institutional investors, which wanted Bank of America to buy
back home loans that were packaged into bonds by Countrywide
Financial Corp. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North
Carolina, acquired Countrywide in 2008. </p>

<h2>Liberty Media Fends Off Bank of New York Challenge to Spinoff </h2>
<p>Liberty Media Corp. (LINTA) fended off Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Co.''s legal challenge to its splitoffs of the Liberty
Capital and Liberty Starz tracking stocks. </p>
<p>The Delaware Supreme Court yesterday upheld a ruling that
clears the way for Liberty, controlled by billionaire John
Malone, to transfer assets of the two tracking stocks to
shareholders. </p>
<p>The splitoffs are part of Malone''s efforts to simplify
Liberty''s financial structure and make it more attractive to
investors, Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets
Ltd. in New York, said last year. </p>
<p>Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman, declined to
comment on the court ruling in an e-mailed statement. Liberty
Media executives plan to complete the splitoff of the units
tomorrow, Courtnee Ulrich, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>As part of the deals, officials of Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty want to redeem outstanding shares of the units in
exchange for shares in a newly formed company. </p>
<p>Liberty Starz holds Liberty Media''s interest in television
company Starz Entertainment, according to the parent company''s

<h2>AIG Hires Ex-IRS Deputy Counsel Potter to Protect Tax Assets </h2>
<p>American International Group Inc. (AIG), the bailed-out insurer,
hired Clarissa Potter, former deputy chief counsel of the
Internal Revenue Service, to help protect tax assets accumulated
by the firm. </p>
<p>Potter will be deputy tax director, reporting to Tal
Kaissar, director of tax, the insurer said yesterday in a
statement. </p>
<p>Losses at New York-based AIG and its subsidiaries helped
rack up more than $25 billion of so-called deferred tax assets
as of Dec. 31 that may lower obligations to governments. Chief
Executive Officer Robert Benmosche, 67, said last month the
insurer is assembling a world-class team to manage the
assets and that they may be used for buybacks when AIG is
prepared to repurchase stock. </p>
<p>The complexity of AIG''s global structure requires a
holistic approach to compliance with domestic and international

<p>Credit-default swaps on Morgan
Stanley (MS) surged to the highest level in more than two years amid
concern the global economic recovery is fading. </p>
<p>The cost to protect the New York-based bank''s debt for five
years climbed 30.1 basis points to 435 basis points, the highest
level since March 10, 2009, according to data provider CMA. One-
year contracts jumped 55.5 basis points to 505.8, signaling that
traders are pricing in a greater probability of credit
deterioration in the short term. </p>
<p>An inverted curve for a financial services firm is never
a good thing, said Bonnie Baha, head of global developed
credit group at DoubleLine Capital LP, which has $16 billion in
assets under management. I''m still pretty concerned about the
banks. Morgan Stanley lacks the deposit bases of many of its
peers, she said. </p>
<p>Five-year credit-default swaps on New York-based Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS) increased for a sixth day, adding 9 basis
points to 297, the data show. </p>
<p>Contracts on Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) eased 2.3 basis points to
150.4, those on Citigroup Inc. (C) were little changed at 280.5, and
those on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) fell 2.8 basis points to 153.2,
the data show. Contracts on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) dropped from
the highest level since March 2009, declining 9.4 basis points
to 390.6, the data show. </p>
<p>Very Volatile'' </p>
<p>Swaps on Morgan Stanley pared an earlier jump to as high as
a mid-price of 470 basis points, according to broker Phoenix
Partners Group, on signs policy makers will act to prevent the
debt crisis from worsening. The swaps typically rise as investor
confidence deteriorates and fall as it improves. </p>
<p>Today the market in general is just very, very volatile,
and we''ve seen some as much as 50 wider and back to unchanged,
John Guarnera, a financial analyst at Societe Generale SA in New
York, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The Markit Group Ltd. CDX North America High Yield Index,
which falls as investor confidence deteriorates, climbed 0.2
percentage points to 91.8 percent of face value as of 5:20 p.m.
in New York, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.
Earlier it fell as much as 0.8 percentage points. It''s decreased
for four of six days, and it fell to 91.3 on Sept. 12, which was
the least since September 2009. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s credit rankings were
cut by Fitch Ratings for failing to pay off more of its debt
since the world''s biggest drugmaker acquired Wyeth in 2009. </p>
<p>The London-based rating service reduced Pfizer to an A+
from AA- saying its leverage level is still not commensurate
with the higher rating. Fitch expected the New York-based
company to reduce its debt to 1.3 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, said Michael Zbinovec, a Fitch analyst based in Chicago. Instead, the New
York-based company cut its debt to 1.5 times Ebitda, he said. </p>
<p>Zbinovec said Pfizer had tripled its debt load after the
$68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. A combination of the
debt and a reduction in revenue growth prevented the drugmaker
from reaching the target, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s ability to pay its debt obligation is somewhat
constrained, Zbinovec said. But the new rating should be
good for the next year and a half even with the acceleration in
patent expirations that will affect Pfizer. </p>
<p>The patent on Pfizer''s best-selling drug Lipitor expires in
November. The cholesterol medicine generated $10.7 billion in
2010. </p>
<p>Fitch also revised its outlook to stable from negative. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), gained the most
among the biggest U.S. banks in New York trading as concern
eased that Europe''s debt crisis would expose the firm to losses
from French lenders. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley climbed 66 cents, or 5 percent, to $13.72 at
4:15 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
It was the biggest increase among the 81 companies on the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index. </p>
<p>Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst, wrote in
a note to clients that the New York-based lender faces less than
$2 billion of risks linked to France. Potential losses connected
to French banks wouldn''t exceed 65 cents a share, according to
Richard Bove, an analyst at Rochdale Securities LLC. </p>
<p>Having $2 billion at risk is not good, but it''s not
threatening in any fashion, Bove, who expects Morgan Stanley
to rise to $31 over the next 12 to 18 months, said in a
telephone interview. There''s no certainty that the French
banks are going to fail, and No. 2, if they do fail, there''s no
certainty that all $2 billion will go down with the French
banks. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, said
in a filing last year that it had about $39 billion at risk with
French lenders, which are falling on concern that the sovereign-
debt crisis will spur losses. The figure exaggerates actual
risks because it includes all funds in French accounts, such as
client holdings, and excludes collateral posted to Morgan
Stanley, Bove and Hintz said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has declined about 50 percent this year. The
MSCI All-Country World Index of 45 nations fell into a bear
market this week for the first time in more than two years. </p>
<p>Management at Morgan Stanley has increased capital to
contend with Europe''s crisis, Hintz wrote. Mark Lake, a company
spokesman, declined to comment on analysts'' estimates of Morgan
Stanley''s foreign risks. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Priceline.com
Inc. (PCLN) are among 26 stocks JPMorgan Chase  Co. says may return
more than the market if U.S. equities drop like they did after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>The list includes companies with high price-to-book and
price-to-earnings ratios that are also liked by analysts and are
considered growth stocks, Thomas Lee, the New York-based firm''s
chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note today. Stocks that
meet the criteria may perform better than benchmark gauges in
two scenarios: if the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index plunges like
it did in 2008 after Lehman''s bankruptcy, or if it rallies,
which is what happened following the Asian crisis, he said. </p>
<p>The benchmark gauge for American equities is down 17
percent from its high in April after the U.S. lost its AAA
credit rating from SP and concern about the European debt
crisis grew. Since the beginning of August, the index has traded
between about 1,100 and 1,300. While U.S. equities reacted in
opposite directions after the two previous crises, Lee said the
valuation levels and fundamentals of the 26 stocks may mean
they''re poised to outperform no matter which direction the SP
500 moves. </p>
<p>What worked both post-Asia ''98 and post-Lehman failure
''08? Lee wrote in the note. It is not entirely a surprise
that growth'' outperformed, but the fact these other style
attributes outperformed is less obvious. </p>
<p>Lee considered companies in the SP 500 Pure Growth Index
and corporations with an enterprise value at least 8.8 times 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
He looked for price-to-book values higher than 2.89 and price-
to-earnings ratios above 13.9. </p>
<p>The following is the list of 26 stocks that met the
criteria, according to Lee. </p>

<p>AppNexus Inc., the online
advertising company backed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), has turned
profitable and may go public late next year, founder and Chief
Executive Officer Brian O''Kelley said. </p>
<p>The New York-based company has raised $65.5 million since
it was founded in 2007, with the last round of $50 million led
by Microsoft in October. AppNexus had its first profitable month
in August, O''Kelley said in an interview. </p>
<p>The financials, the revenue, the profit and the growth
are all strong enough that we could be going public as soon as
late next year, said O''Kelley, 34. That''s really the path. </p>
<p>AppNexus provides technology, data and analytics that
companies such as Microsoft and EBay Inc. use to buy and sell
online display-advertising. The market for graphical display ads
is set to climb 25 percent in the U.S. in 2011, and will almost
double to $22 billion in 2015 from this year''s level, according
New York-based EMarketer Inc., which tracks digital marketing. </p>
<p>The idea of real-time bidding is going to become
increasingly important, said David Hallerman, an analyst with
EMarketer in New York. There is sheer growth of display-ad
inventory as people spend more time online. </p>
<p>AppNexus said its revenue has grown fourfold this year
compared with 2010. The company hasn''t hired investment banks
and the IPO timing depends on market conditions, O''Kelley said.
Newly issued stocks during their first publicly traded year are
performing the worst since July 2009, according to the Bloomberg
IPO Index. </p>
<p>Right Media, DoubleClick </p>
<p>O''Kelley said he prefers an IPO to a sale as the management
team wants to be in charge of building AppNexus into a global
company. </p>
<p>It would be hard to see a sale as the right outcome,
O''Kelley said. I feel immense loyalty to the team we''ve built.
As a public company we can control our destiny. </p>
<p>Many of O''Kelley''s top employees came from companies that
were bought. He and co-founder Mike Nolet worked at online
advertising company Right Media Inc., and left when Yahoo! Inc.
purchased it in 2007. Michael Rubenstein, now AppNexus
president, was at DoubleClick Inc. when Google Inc. (GOOG) purchased it
in 2008 for about $3.1 billion. AppNexus began with 20 employees
and projects to be at 200 at end of this year. </p>
<p>For the next few months, O''Kelley will build the business
through acquisitions in Europe. His management team has talked
to more than 80 European companies on a trip this week,
including customers and potential takeover targets, he said. </p>
<p>The company, which opened an office in London this summer,
was drawn to Europe through partnerships with Hi-Media SA (HIM), a
Paris-based electronic payments company, and Microsoft, the
world''s largest software maker, O''Kelley said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the fourth-biggest seller of display ads in the
U.S., unveiled partnerships this month with AppNexus and
MediaMath. Microsoft''s share is less than one-third of
Facebook''s and about half of Google''s, according to EMarketer. </p>
<p>AppNexus''s investors also include Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway, First Round Capital, Venrock Associates, Kodiak Venture
Partners and Khosla Ventures. Bloomberg LP, the parent company
of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen''s venture-
capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), whose shares
dropped yesterday on concern French losses will mount, faces
less than $2 billion of risks linked to the country, according
to Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst. </p>
<p>There is solid evidence that shows Morgan Stanley has
been taking action to limit risk in preparation for potentially
difficult market conditions ahead, Hintz, who is based in New
York, wrote in a note to clients today. We estimate that total
risk to France and its banks is less than $2 billion net of
collateral and hedges. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said in a filing last year that its exposure
was about $39 billion to French lenders, which are falling on
concern Europe''s sovereign-debt crisis will spur losses. That
figure exaggerates the value of the New York-based bank''s actual
risks because it includes all funds in French accounts, such as
client holdings, and excludes collateral posted to Morgan
Stanley, Hintz wrote. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley management has increased capital and boosted
its liquidity pool to contend with Europe''s crisis, Hintz wrote. </p>
<p>Shares of the company dropped 52 percent this year through
yesterday as global equities fell into a bear market this week
for the first time in more than two years. Morgan Stanley
climbed 33 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $13.39 in composite trading
on the New York Stock Exchange at 9:39 a.m. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a company spokesman, declined to comment on
Hintz''s report. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O''Neill said the global financial system risks
repeating the crisis of 2008 if Europe''s debt crisis escalates
and spreads to the U.S. banking industry. </p>
<p>This is where the parallels with 2008 are relevant, even
though I think they are being over exaggerated, O''Neill said
in an interview on CNBC today. It was when the financial
system really imploded that financial firms stopped extending
credit to anybody that the corporate world had to destock and we
know what happened after that. We are not far off the same sort
of thing. </p>
<p>More than $3.4 trillion has been erased from equity values
this week, driving global stocks into a bear market, as the
Federal Reserve''s new stimulus and a pledge by Group of 20
nations fails to ease concern the global economy is on the brink
of another recession. O''Neill said the Fed''s plan to shift $400
billion of short-term debt into longer term Treasuries hasn''t
convinced investors it will strengthen growth. </p>
<p>The fear that it''s all dependent on the Fed, together
with this mess in Europe, is really getting people more and more
worried as this week comes to an end, O''Neill said. The
markets have taken the latest FOMC move rather badly, which adds
a whole new angle to it. It''s the first time since the global
rally started in early 2009 that the markets have rejected a Fed
easing. </p>
<p>Stocks Decline </p>
<p>The decline in U.S. stocks after the announcement on Sept.
21 of the Fed''s announcement contrasts with the reaction to the
second round of quantitative easing. The SP 500 Index rose 24
percent from the day Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first signaled the
policy in August 2010 to its conclusion in June. </p>
<p>European stocks fell for a third day today, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slipping 1.5 percent as of 1:52 p.m. in London.
The FTSE 100 Index declined 1.2 percent. U.S. stock futures also
fell. </p>
<p>The solution for the U.S. is not more tinkering by the
Fed, but doing things like micro-policies to get U.S. companies
to spend more money on investment and jobs, O''Neill said. </p>
<p>Group of 20 finance chiefs late yesterday promised to
address rising risks to the global economy and pushed Europe to
contain its debt crisis. The European Central Bank may act to
tackle risks to growth as soon as next month should economic
data disappoint, Governing Council member Luc Coene said. </p>
<p>As the problem in Europe spreads from Greece to more and
more other countries and in particular Italy, the exposure that
so many people bank-wise have to Italian debt means the systems
can''t cope easily with that and it would spread way beyond
Europe''s borders, O''Neill said. This is why the policy
makers need to stop being so sleepy and get on and lead. </p>

<p>Bank of America Corp. (BAC) is among a
group of lenders that may face a wave of new lawsuits claiming
cash-strapped counties were cheated out of millions of dollars
by a system used for more than a decade to register mortgages. </p>
<p>Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said state
attorneys general and county officials across the U.S. have
expressed interest in his lawsuit against Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems Inc. and Bank of America, filed in Texas
state court on Sept. 21. Dallas County could be owed as much as
$100 million in filing fees, he said. </p>
<p>This is a big new front, said Christopher L. Peterson,
associate dean and professor at the University of Utah S.J.
Quinney College of Law. This case is scary because if Dallas
wins then there are a lot of other counties around the country
that are going to follow. </p>
<p>MERS, a unit of Reston, Virginia-based Merscorp Inc., says
on its website that its aim is to place every mortgage in the
country on an electronic, rather than a paper, system that
allows members to buy and sell mortgages. </p>
<p>MERS acts as the lender''s nominee and remains the mortgagee
of record as long as the note promising repayment is owned by a
MERS member. Dallas County claims this allows banks to buy and
sell loans without properly recording transfers with counties
and paying the fee. </p>
<p>The MERS business model and practices are legal and
comply with the recording statutes and regulations of Texas,
Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Merscorp, said in an e-mail. The
claims in the lawsuit are without legal or factual merit. </p>
<p>Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender by
assets, declined to comment on the suit. </p>
<p>Liability in the Dallas case could exceed $1 billion, based
on the number of mortgages in the county, Peterson said. Local
laws impose substantial penalties, as well as back payments of
fees and taxes, if false documents were filed in land
transactions, said Peterson, who has advised private plaintiffs
making similar claims. </p>
<p>Faulty mortgages and foreclosures have already cost the
five biggest home lenders $66 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America''s credit rating was cut
on Sept. 21 by Moody''s Investors Service in part because the
bill for mortgage disputes may climb past the $39 billion
committed since 2007. County clerks in Kentucky have also sued
MERS, while officials in Massachusetts and Michigan say they are
exploring the possibility. </p>
<p>The Texas case is Dallas County v. Merscorp Inc., CC-11-
06571-E, County Court at Law, Dallas County, Texas. The Kentucky
case is Christian County Clerk v. Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems Inc., 5:11-cv-00072, U.S. District Court,

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>JPMorgan Sues American Century Over $848 Million Share Sale </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued mutual fund firm American Century
Cos. over claims it was shortchanged in a $848 million optioned
share sale to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. </p>
<p>American Century failed to disclose material information
regarding the sale and the shares were not purchased at their
fair market value, lawyers for JPMorgan said in a public version
of the complaint filed Sept. 21 in Delaware Chancery Court. The
complaint was initially filed under seal. </p>
<p>The allegation that American Century breached an option
agreement is without merit and the edited complaint filed in
Delaware yesterday is an inaccurate and incomplete
representation of the facts, American Century said in a
statement e-mailed by Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the firm. </p>
<p>CIBC, Canada''s fifth-largest bank, announced in July that
it agreed to buy a 41 percent stake in American Century from
JPMorgan. The cash acquisition is the third-largest purchase by
the Toronto-based bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan purchased a roughly 45 percent interest in Kansas
City, Missouri-based American Century for about $900 million in
January 1998, according to the complaint. Under a 2009 option
agreement between American and JPMorgan, American could purchase
all of the shares JPMorgan owned in the firm and resell them to
a third party. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, said in its complaint that it
learned of the share sale through a public announcement. The
transaction was completed on Aug. 31. </p>
<p>American Century improperly withheld information
regarding the CIBC stock sale from JPMorgan''s director designee
on American Century''s board, lawyers for the bank said in the
redacted complaint. </p>
<p>The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. American Century
Companies Inc., CA6875, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington.) </p>

<p>Madoff Trustee Sues Atlantic Security Bank for $120 Million </p>
<p>The trustee overseeing the liquidation of Bernard L.
Madoff''s firm sued Atlantic Security Bank for $120 million. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is one of several filed by Irving Picard to
recoup what he said is customer property from companies that
invested with Fairfield Sentry Ltd., a so-called feeder fund
that placed money in the con man''s Ponzi scheme. Atlantic
Security Bank is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and has
offices in Panama, according to Picard''s suit filed yesterday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. A phone number for the bank
couldn''t be immediately located. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. Atlantic Security Bank, 11-02730,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>Madoff Family Wins Partial Dismissal of $198 Million Suit </p>
<p>Bernard L. Madoff''s family won dismissal of part of a $198
million lawsuit by the liquidator of the con man''s firm, while
the judge left Irving Picard free to pursue most of his claims. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland struck Picard''s
claims for some transfers of money out of the jailed Ponzi
scheme operator''s firm. Picard, who sued Madoff''s brother, two
sons and niece, is free to amend his suit, the judge said in a
court filing yesterday. </p>
<p>Picard''s 2009 lawsuit against the brother, Peter Madoff,
sons Andrew and Mark Madoff and niece Shana Madoff Swanson, all
of whom held senior positions at the defunct money-management
firm, claimed they spent more than $198 million of investors''
money and treated the con man''s investment firm as their
family piggy bank. </p>
<p>Peter Madoff was chief compliance officer at Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Madoff''s sons, Andrew and
Mark, were co-directors of trading at the investment firm, and
Shana Madoff was compliance director, according to Picard. </p>
<p>Mark Madoff committed suicide in December. </p>
<p>Mark and Andrew Madoff had no prior knowledge of Bernard
Madoff''s crimes and contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and
the SEC immediately after their father told them he had
defrauded his investment advisory clients, Martin Flumenbaum,
a lawyer for Andrew Madoff and Mark Madoff''s estate, said in an
e-mail yesterday. Whether or not the trustee amends his
complaint to reassert some or all of the claims that were
dismissed today, we fully expect to prevail on the merits. </p>
<p>Charles Spada, who has been representing Peter Madoff, had
no comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>Mark Smith, a lawyer for Shana Madoff, didn''t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment yesterday. </p>
<p>Refusing to dismiss the entire suit, Lifland said the
family''s failure to stop Madoff''s fraud was unsurprising given
their close familial relationship with Madoff and proximity to
his firm. However, Picard''s suit contains some correctable
pleading deficiencies that need to be amended, he said. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. Peter Madoff, 09-1503, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>UBS Trader Adoboli Faces Added Fraud Charge, Prosecutor Says </p>
<p>Kweku Adoboli, the UBS AG (UBSN) trader charged with fraud and
false accounting that may have resulted in a $2.3 billion loss,
said through his lawyer that he was sorry beyond words after
facing an additional fraud charge at a court hearing yesterday. </p>
<p>The 31-year-old, who holds a Ghanaian passport, didn''t
apply for bail when he appeared at a magistrate''s court in
London. Prosecutor David Levy said the alleged loss may exceed
$2.3 billion. Adoboli wasn''t required to enter a plea yesterday
and another hearing was scheduled for Oct. 20. </p>
<p>The trader is sorry beyond words for what happened
here, said Patrick Gibbs, Adoboli''s lawyer. He apologized for
his disastrous miscalculations, Gibbs said. </p>
<p>Adoboli, who appeared yesterday wearing a dark grey suit,
white shirt and navy tie, has been in police custody since he
was arrested Sept. 15 on suspicion of making the unauthorized
trades. </p>
<p>Prosecutors charged him Sept. 17 with fraud and false
accounting dating back to 2008. The prosecution yesterday added
a charge to extend the fraud allegations to 2008 as well. </p>
<p>If convicted, he faces as many as 10 years in prison,
according to sentencing guidelines. Time spent in custody
beforehand would be deducted from any sentence. </p>
<p>Louise Hodges, another of Adoboli''s lawyers, declined to
comment after the hearing. Yves Kaufmann, a spokesman for UBS in
Zurich said the loss arising from the unauthorized trades is
$2.3 billion, as we have stated previously. </p>

<p>Smith Barney Lead Plaintiff Thrown Out, Never Owned Shares </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C)''s Smith Barney unit can''t be sued by the
lead plaintiff in a six-year-old shareholder fraud class action
because the fund never owned any shares that are the basis of
the lawsuit, a judge said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III, citing epic
failures by the lawyers on both sides of the case, yesterday
dismissed the lead plaintiff, Operating Local 649 Annuity Trust
Fund. The fund''s attorneys told the judge that their client
owned more than 75,000 shares of a similarly named security and
not those involved in the case. </p>
<p>Pauley called the effect of the error seismic, and said
it has caused considerable waste of time and resources. </p>
<p>After six years of litigation, including extensive motion
practice, an appeal to the Second Circuit, remand, more motion
practice, and discovery, lead counsel learned that the lead
plaintiff never purchased any of the securities at issue in this
action, Pauley, in Manhattan, wrote in yesterday''s decision. </p>
<p>Bernstein Liebhard partner Stanley Bernstein said the
lawyers relied on the union''s certification that it had bought
the mutual fund shares and brokerage statements that mistakenly
reflected the mutual fund shares along with their ticker symbol. </p>
<p>We did not just rely on somebody''s word, Bernstein said
in a phone interview yesterday. We had the underlying core
documentation from the broker. And it was wrong. </p>
<p>Charles Platt, a partner in the New York office of Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, which represents Citigroup,
declined to comment on Pauley''s opinion yesterday. </p>
<p>The mistake will require several motions to be rebriefed, </p>

(Manhattan). </p>

<p>Deutsche Bank Swap Ruling May Apply to Other Cases, Judge Says </p>
<p>A German top court ruling on swaps that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
lost in March may also apply in cases involving other
derivatives, a judge said. </p>
<p>The Frankfurt Regional Court will review to what extent the
top court ruling governs currency options as well, Presiding
Judge Bruno Menhofer said yesterday at a hearing in a lawsuit
against the lender seeking 30 million euros ($40 million) in
damages. The court''s assessment is preliminary, he said. The
case was brought by travel company Schauinsland-Reisen GmbH. </p>
<p>The Federal Court of Justice, Germany''s highest civil
court, ruled in March that Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank must
cover losses caused by a derivative it branded a CMS Spread
Ladder Swap, because the bank didn''t disclose the product had
a initial negative market value. Deutsche Bank is arguing that
ruling only applies to the same kind of product. Former
customers are hoping to capitalize on the ruling to collect
damages for other bets that went sour. </p>
<p>The top court has used very, very strong language as
regards disclosure duties the bank has, said Menhofer. The
ruling is a leading precedent setting clear standards and we
have to see how they apply to the product at issue here. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s case is LG Frankfurt, 3-04 O 50/10. </p>

<p>Saad Group''s Al-Sanea Wins End to $9.2 Billion Asset Freeze </p>
<p>Maan al-Sanea, founder of Saudi Arabia''s Saad Group, won
dismissal of a $9.2 billion asset freeze in the Cayman Islands
after Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi  Brothers Co. admitted failing to
disclose evidence. </p>
<p>Algosaibi agreed it breached its duty of full and frank
disclosure when it won the asset freeze against al-Sanea in
2009, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands ruled Sept. 21.
Algosaibi applied last month to voluntarily dismiss the freeze
after it found new evidence that should have been revealed
earlier. Al-Sanea still faces a fraud lawsuit filed by Algosaibi
in New York and probes in Bahrain and Switzerland. </p>
<p>Since AHAB started its litigation scheme over two years
ago, I have been resolute in my complete rejection of its
desperate claims that I somehow defrauded the Algosaibis, al-
Sanea said yesterday in a statement, using Algosaibi''s initials. </p>
<p>The asset freeze was part of a global legal dispute between
the companies after they defaulted in 2009 on a total of about
$15.7 billion in loans from more than 100 banks. Al-Sanea, one
of Saudi Arabia''s richest men who married into the Algosaibi
family before founding Saad Group, faces claims he forged
signatures to take out as much as $10 billion in fake loans
through Algosaibi''s Money Exchange unit, which he ran. </p>
<p>The dismissal of the asset freeze doesn''t prove al-Sanea''s
innocence or reduce his legal troubles, said Eric Lewis, a legal
coordinator for the Algosaibi family. Al-Sanea has refused to
appear in court in the Cayman Islands, Lewis said. </p>
<p>Algosaibi voluntarily withdrew the freezing order and did
not seek a new one, despite all the essential allegations of
fraud and forgery having been proven correct, Lewis said.
Maan al-Sanea has spent two years in procedural maneuvers to
avoid a court from considering his vast fraud. </p>

<p>Boeing, General Dynamics Seek End to $3 Billion Claims Case </p>
<p>Boeing Co. (BA) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) urged a federal
claims court judge to end the companies'' 20-year-old dispute
with the U.S. in which the government sought $3 billion over a
canceled Navy aircraft contract. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the companies asked U.S. Federal Claims Judge
Robert Hodges during a hearing yesterday to find that the case
over the A-12 bomber can no longer be litigated because of
classified data, noting that the parties, with their cross
claims, have fought to a draw after two decades. </p>
<p>We have come the conclusion that it''s time for the Boeing
Company to lay down its sword, said Boeing''s lawyer, Charles
Cooper of Cooper  Kirk in Washington. </p>
<p>The fight has moved back and forth among courts since it
began in 1991, reaching the U.S. Supreme Court in September
2010. In May, the high court set aside a ruling that put the
U.S. in line to recover $3 billion from the companies. The case
was sent back to a lower court to determine whether the
government had a responsibility to disclose classified
information vital to the performance of the contract. </p>
<p>The Justice Department said yesterday that it will continue
to pursue the claim, arguing that the justices had an
opportunity to dismiss the case and didn''t. </p>
<p>If the Supreme Court had wanted that outcome, it could

Snee said. </p>

against the government, sent a letter to the department urging
it to drop the case. </p>
<p>The time has come for all parties to step back, to
reflect on where we are after two decades of contesting this
matter, and to finally do what we should have done years ago:
agree to bring this litigation to an end, the Boeing lawyers
wrote, submitting the letter to U.S. Court of Federal Claims in
a Sept. 20 filing. </p>

<p>Galleon Sentencing Scorecard: Average Prison Term Is 3 Years </p>
<p>Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam will be
sentenced on Oct. 13 for insider trading after being convicted
by a jury in Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>Prosecutors say Rajaratnam, who was convicted in May,
should serve as long as 24 1/2 years in prison, calling him the
modern face of insider trading. On Sept. 21, judges in
Manhattan sentenced two other convicted insider traders -- Zvi
Goffer and Winifred Jiau -- to prison terms of 10 years and four
years, respectively. </p>
<p>Since Rajaratnam''s arrest in October 2009, judges in
Manhattan federal court have sentenced 12 defendants in cases
linked to Galleon. All but two pleaded guilty. The average
prison term has been 35.75 months, or almost three years behind
bars. </p>
<p>Typically, those convicted at a trial get longer prison
terms than those pleading guilty. In addition to the two Galleon
defendants who took their cases to a jury, Manhattan judges
since 2003 have imposed sentences in three other cases where the
main charge was insider trading and a jury returned a guilty
verdict. The average sentence has been six years and two months. </p>
<p>About two dozen others are waiting to be sentenced in the
Galleon cases. They include Emanuel Goffer, a former trader and
brother of Zvi Goffer, who was convicted at a trial, and Anil
Kumar, a former McKinsey  Co. executive who pleaded guilty and
testified against Rajaratnam in a bid for leniency. </p>
<p>The Rajaratnam case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184,

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Judge Approves Madoff Trustee Settlement With Tremont Funds </p>
<p>A judge approved a $1 billion settlement of a lawsuit by
liquidator of Bernard Madoff''s firm and hedge-fund firm Tremont
Group Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>In the deal approved yesterday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland, trustee Irving Picard will accept a cash payment
of more than $1 billion from funds associated with Tremont. In
exchange, the Tremont funds will be allowed to make claims on
the Madoff estate of about $3 billion, according to court
filings. </p>
<p>The settlement is fair and reasonable, Lifland said. </p>
<p>Among the parties settling were Oppenheimer Acquisition
Corp., an affiliate of the Oppenheimer mutual funds that bought
Tremont, and Oppenheimer''s parents, MassMutual Holding LLC and
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, New York Life Insurance Co. and six
other insurance companies assailed the settlement. As limited
partners of the hedge-fund firm''s Opportunity III fund, they
said they would lose if a court rules that the Ponzi scheme''s
so-called net winners should be compensated, because they
wouldn''t be allowed to recalculate their claims. A U.S. appeals
court yesterday denied Picard''s move to strike a request by
Madoff investors for a second hearing on the issue. </p>
<p>Picard sued Tremont and related entities for $2.1 billion,
saying they ignored warnings that Madoff could be running a
Ponzi scheme and profited from it, according to a complaint
unsealed in March. The payment from Tremont, the second-biggest
so-called feeder into Madoff''s multibillion-dollar fraud, will
add to the $2.6 billion in the fund for Madoff customers, Picard
has said. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. Tremont Group Holdings Inc., 10-5310,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan.) </p>

<p>PharmAthene Wins Rights to Profit From Siga Smallpox Drug </p>
<p>Siga Technologies Inc. (SIGA) must share with PharmAthene Inc. (PIP)
profit from sales of a smallpox drug that may total more than
$400 million, a judge ruled. Trading in shares of both companies
was halted. </p>
<p>Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr. in
Wilmington said yesterday New York-based Siga breached its
obligation to negotiate in good faith on ST-246, an antiviral
drug for use in case of a biological attack. Parsons rejected
PharmAthene''s claim that Siga breached a binding license
agreement. He also denied claims for a lump sum award and
instead ordered the companies to share the profits. </p>
<p>The plaintiff is entitled to share in any profits
realized from the sale of the drug in question, Parsons said
yesterday in a 118-page opinion. </p>
<p>Lewis Goldberg, a Siga spokesman, said the company couldn''t
immediately comment on the ruling. Siga was preparing a
statement, he said. </p>
<p>Stacey Jurchison, a spokeswoman for Annapolis, Maryland-
based PharmAthene, said the ruling appears to have granted the
company a 50 percent profit split. </p>
<p>We think it is a very good outcome, Jurchison said in a
phone interview. </p>

<p>Ford Wins Reversal of $43 Million Award in Fatal Crash Case </p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. (F) won reversal of an Illinois jury''s $43
million damage award in a lawsuit filed after a 2003 crash
killed a 73-year-old man and severely burned his wife. </p>
<p>The Illinois Supreme Court yesterday threw out the verdict
rendered after a 2005 trial concluding that Dora Jablonski and
the estate of her husband, John, failed to prove the gas tank of
their 1993 Lincoln Town Car had been defectively designed. </p>
<p>Their car burst into flames after being hit in the rear by
another vehicle traveling at an estimated 55 to 65 miles per
hour while they were stopped at a highway construction zone in
southwest Illinois, causing an item in the trunk to pierce the
tank. </p>
<p>Plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence from which a
jury could conclude that Ford breached its duty of reasonable
care on three negligent design theories, the court said. It
rejected a fourth argument as not viable under state law. </p>
<p>Bradley M. Lakin, the Wood River, Illinois, attorney who
took the case to trial, didn''t immediately reply to telephone
messages seeking comment on yesterday''s ruling. </p>
<p>Ford is gratified by the court''s decision, Marcey
Evans, a spokeswoman for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker,
said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The 1993 Town Car exceeded all federal crash safety
standards, she said. While the Jablonskis were victims of a
tragic accident caused by a distracted driver who rear-ended
them at 60 miles per hour, it was unfair to blame Ford for their
injuries. </p>

<p>Richard Zabel Said to Get Deputy U.S. Attorney Post in N.Y. </p>
<p>Richard Zabel, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, was
promoted to deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Zabel served as co-head of litigation at Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer  Feld LLP from 1999 until 2009, when he rejoined the

 Dorr LLP, according to the firm. </p>
<p>A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School,
Zabel worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan from
1991 to 1999, holding positions including chief of the office''s
narcotics unit. He co-wrote two reports published in 2008 and
2009 by the group Human Rights First, In Pursuit of Justice,
Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in the Federal Courts. </p>
<p>He twice won the Attorney General''s Award for Distinguished
Service for his role in the prosecutions of a violent criminal
organization known as the Latin Kings and members of the Gambino
organized crime family. </p>
<p>Johnson, a graduate of Hamilton College and Cornell Law
School, has been a prosecutor in the office since 1999, holding
positions including chief of the public corruption unit and head
of the international narcotics trafficking unit. </p>
<p>He is scheduled to start work with Washington-based Wilmer
Hale''s litigation and white-collar practices on Oct. 1. </p>
<p>Under the supervision of both men, prosecutors in the
office have won several insider-trading cases including the May
conviction of Raj Rajaratnam, co-founder of Galleon Group LLC. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it

<p>The trade was stopped at a theoretical loss of 4.2
percent including interest, the New York-based company said in a
note today. </p>
<p>The recent sharp increase in risk aversion, much of this
originating in Europe, and upward pressure on the dollar across
a wide range of currencies lately, has pushed the cross below
our 1.35 closing stop, Goldman said in the note written by
analysts including chief strategist Thomas Stolper. </p>
<p>The euro rose 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.3551 at

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world''s biggest payments networks, may face a merchant backlash
by raising debit-card swipe fees on the smallest purchases to
the maximum allowed under U.S. caps that take effect next week. </p>
<p>MasterCard will impose the highest fees permitted on all
debit transactions, including so-called small-ticket purchases,
for cards issued by the biggest U.S. banks, said a person with
direct knowledge of the matter. Visa will do the same, Thomas McCrohan, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, wrote in a
Sept. 21 note, without saying how he got the information. </p>
<p>The networks, which pass the fees to lenders such as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc., now charge retailers
1.55 percent of the purchase price plus 4 cents for small-ticket
transactions of less than $15. That comes to about 7 cents for a
$2 cup of coffee. The cost to merchants for that item would more
than triple under rules created by the Federal Reserve, which
capped the fees at 21 cents, plus 5 basis points of the total
and a conditional 1 cent for fraud-prevention. </p>
<p>The mom-and-pop coffee shop that processes lots of $3
transactions is really going to get hurt by this, said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association,
a trade group that represents the biggest U.S. merchants,
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. </p>
<p>The new fee structure won''t apply to cards issued by banks
and credit unions with less than $10 billion in assets, which
are exempt from the law, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. </p>
<p>Price Controls </p>
<p>During the debate in Congress last year and the rule-making
process that ensued, banks and payment networks said that
capping swipe fees, or interchange, would be tantamount to
government price controls and result in unintended consequences. </p>
<p>MasterCard recently informed our issuers that we will
implement a two-tiered interchange structure, James Issokson,
a spokesman for Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, said
yesterday in a statement. As we have noted throughout this
process, setting price caps will -- and has -- created
distortions in the market. </p>
<p>Will Valentine, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Visa,
John Hall of the American Bankers Association and the Federal
Reserve''s Susan Stawick declined to comment. </p>
<p>Visa, the world''s biggest network, and No. 2 MasterCard
processed 36.9 billion debit-card purchase transactions in the
U.S. last year, company data show. About 20 percent of all
debit-card purchases are small-ticket, according to Brian Riley,
senior research director at TowerGroup, a Boston-based research
and advisory firm. </p>
<p>Lobbying Fight </p>
<p>Retailers and financial firms spent about $30 million and
deployed more than 500 lobbyists in the battle to influence the
legislation and rule-making, people briefed with the
expenditures said in June. </p>
<p>The fee caps, set to take effect Oct. 1, replace a formula
that averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44
cents for the typical $38 debit transaction. The change may cut
annual revenue at the biggest banks by $8 billion, data compiled
by Bloomberg Government show, and the increase for small-ticket
purchases may help them recoup some of it. </p>
<p>That also may help Visa and MasterCard assuage their
biggest bank customers and stave off competition from other
debit networks, including Pulse, a unit of Discover Financial
Services (DFS), and First Data Corp.''s Star. </p>
<p>Fee-Fixing'' </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard have customers on the bank side so
they have to make sure their issuers are happy, and on the other
side they have to make sure the retailers aren''t getting charged
too much, said Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic
Payments Coalition, which represents banks and networks. There
are unintended consequences that result when the government
steps in and pretends to know better than the free market. </p>
<p>The limits, championed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, an
Illinois Democrat, have led banks to end debit-card rewards
programs and add fees for checking accounts. </p>
<p>The looming increase in small-ticket swipe fees
underscores the anti-competitive nature of the fee-fixing
relationship that big banks have with Visa and MasterCard and
reaffirms the need for reasonable regulation of the swipe-fee
system, Max Gleischman, a spokesman for Durbin, said in an e-
mailed statement. </p>

<p>We have a social contract that''s been broken between

<p>Kasman said the uncoordinated and sporadic response from

that they don''t have the wherewithal to deal with the region''s

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said poor risk-management, not sophisticated products,
is to blame for financial-company losses and failures. </p>
<p>If you don''t invest in risk-management, it doesn''t matter
what business you''re in, it''s a risky business, Cohn said
today at a panel discussion in Washington sponsored by the
Institute of International Finance. </p>
<p>The cause of financial-company collapses dating back to
Barings Plc or Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has never been
sophisticated products, it''s been a risk-management issue or a
separation of duties problem in which a trader was able to
manipulate operational controls in the back office, Cohn said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has a robust separation of duties in our
organization between traders and back-office administrators so
that traders can''t manipulate operational controls, he said.
We have just continuously reiterated a farther divide in how
those people interact to make sure we''re protecting the assets
of the firm. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs allows employees to change jobs and
move into the trading business from the back office, Cohn said
the New York-based company ensures that those traders lose
access to administrative processes they had in the back office. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
dismissal of suits over employee bonuses filed in New York by
shareholders who called the awards a waste of assets. </p>
<p>Security Police  Fire Professionals of America Retirement
Fund and Judith A. Miller sued the investment bank in December
2009, accusing directors and executives of breaching their
fiduciary duties by reserving half of the company''s net revenue
for employee compensation. Shareholders Ken Brown and Central
Laborers Pension Fund filed similar suits the following month. </p>
<p>New York State Supreme Judge Bernard J. Fried ordered the
lawsuits dismissed on Sept. 21, according to court documents
filed today. The plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal in January
2010, after New York-based Goldman Sachs said its ratio of
compensation and benefits to net revenue for 2009 was its
lowest as a public company, Fried said in his ruling. </p>
<p>Fried denied the plaintiffs'' request for attorney fees and
expenses, and rejected a request from Brown -- who died in
December 2010 -- for an incentive fee award of $25,000. Brown''s
attorney, Lynda J. Grant, didn''t immediately return a voice-mail
message seeking comment on Fried''s ruling. </p>
<p>Pay Record </p>
<p>The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis. </p>
<p>Goldman had a 2007 compensation and benefits expense of
$20.2 billion, or 43.9 percent of revenue, that came to an
average of $661,490 per employee, according to company reports.
The pay expense dropped to $10.9 billion, or 48 percent of
revenue, in 2008 and was $16.2 billion, or 36 percent of
revenue, in 2009. </p>
<p>In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company''s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year. That was 9 percent less than in the same period in
2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein''s
$19 million compensation for 2010, which included a $5.4 million
cash bonus, was almost double the prior year''s award even as
Goldman Sach''s profits fell. </p>
<p>Blankfein and other firm executives agreed to forgo cash
bonuses in 2009 and take restricted stock grants as compensation
to mute criticism of the firm''s pay practices. Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year while the firm settled claims by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators'' claims that marketing materials about the
investments had incomplete information. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. </p>
<p>The cases are Brown v. Blankfein, 650003/2010, and Central
Laborers'' Pension Fund v. Goldman Sachs, 600036/2010, both in
New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) expects to make a
final decision in 2013 about how much more to invest in an
effort to add as many as 6 billion barrels of crude reserves to
an oil field shared by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. </p>
<p>The second-largest U.S. energy company is moving ahead with
a pilot project by injecting steam into the Wafra field in a
border area between the neighboring countries after early work
showed very promising results, Kenneth Sniffen, a spokesman
for Saudi Arabian Chevron, said today in an interview in Manama,
Bahrain. Saudi Arabian Chevron is a fully owned subsidiary of
California-based Chevron Corp. </p>
<p>The Wafra field is mature, and it''s producing at a
declining rate, Sniffen said. We want to add 500,000 barrels
a day to whatever amount the field will be producing once
injecting steam is applied on a large scale. </p>
<p>Wafra will be the world''s largest project for recovering
oil through steam injection once Chevron applies the technique
to the entire field. The company hopes to be injecting steam
into most, if not all, of the deposit by 2017, Sniffen said. </p>
<p>Chevron has injected steam to help produce crude at a field
in Bakersfield, California, for almost 50 years and at a deposit
in Indonesia for almost 30 years. Wafra yields about 240,000
barrels a day of light and heavy crudes, he said. </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, has 264.5
billion barrels of total proved crude reserves, according to the
BP Statistical Review of World Energy, published in June. Kuwait
has 101.5 billion barrels in reserves, according to the same
review. </p>

<p>Hedge fund Oasis Management LLC
sued Morgan Stanley for C$9.5 million ($9.3 million) over
options in Sino-Forest Corp. (TRE) bought before the Toronto-listed
timber company''s stock plunged 71 percent in two days in June. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley failed to settle the options contracts in an
effort to limit its liability, Oasis said in a lawsuit filed
in London in July. Hong Kong-based Oasis bought options to sell
Sino-Forest at C$19 on May 12, three weeks before shares fell to
C$5.22 on allegations it had overstated forestry holdings. </p>
<p>Shares in Sino-Forest have fallen 74 percent since June 1,
the day before short-seller Carson Block''s Muddy Waters LLC
research firm said the company had overstated its holdings.
While investors including hedge fund manager John Paulson and
billionaire Richard Chandler took losses when Sino-Forest shares
sank, holders of put contracts could reap returns from selling
stock at prices far above the present value. </p>
<p>The Oasis deal will cost Morgan Stanley (MS) C$7.5 million to
settle, the hedge fund said in its court filing. The put options
are valued at C$9.5 million, compared with C$2 million for the
equivalent shares, it said in the lawsuit. Oasis paid Morgan
Stanley a premium of C$770,000 for the options in May. </p>
<p>New York-based Morgan Stanley claimed the options were
terminated because trading in Sino-Forest''s shares was
suspended, Oasis lawyers said in the filing. The bank offered
Oasis C$3.8 million to cancel the deal, the hedge fund said in
the lawsuit. </p>

<p>Ex-NBA Player Tate George Charged in $2 Million Ponzi Scheme </p>
<p>Tate George, a former player with the National Basketball
Association''s New Jersey Nets and Milwaukee Bucks, was charged
with running a $2 million Ponzi scheme that targeted former
professional athletes. </p>
<p>George, 43, raised more than $2 million for his company,
The George Group, after telling investors his real-estate
development portfolio was worth $500 million, according to a
Federal Bureau of Investigation complaint charging him with wire
fraud. </p>
<p>In reality, The George Group had virtually no income
generating operations, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a
statement. </p>
<p>George used the money he raised to pay early investors in
his company and to fund living expenses such as mortgage and
child-support payments, restaurant meals, clothing and gas,
according to the FBI complaint. </p>
<p>George faces as many as 20 years in prison for the scheme,
which prosecutors said ran from 2005 to March. His attorney,
Thomas Ashley, didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>

<p>Silvercorp Sues Chinastockwatch.com Over Stock Manipulation </p>
<p>Silvercorp Metals Inc. (SVM), a Canadian miner of silver in
China, sued two websites and their operators for allegedly
spreading false information in an effort to drive down the
company''s stock price. </p>
<p>Chinastockwatch.com, a New York-based website that posts
reports on public companies, and operator Jerry Katz published
false, defamatory and fraudulent statements, Silvercorp said
in the complaint filed Sept. 22 in New York State Supreme Court
in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Alfredlittle.com, website operator Alfred Little and an
editor, Simon Moore, also were named as defendants in the
lawsuit. Silvercorp seeks punitive damages of at least $10
million and compensatory damages of more than $1 million. </p>
<p>The defendants sought to artificially drive down the price
of Silvercorp common stock in order to obtain illicit profits on
short sales, the Vancouver-based company said in the
complaint. Short investors sell borrowed shares with plans to
buy them back later at a lower price. </p>
<p>No contact information was listed on Chinastockwatch.com
and Katz couldn''t be immediately reached to comment on the
lawsuit. The complaint is frivolous and Alfredlittle.com has
nothing to do with Chinastockwatch.com, Moore said. </p>
<p>Every statement that was made in every single report that
was published on Silvercorp from Alfredlittle.com is completely
factual, Moore said in a telephone interview. Absolutely
nothing in any of our previous reports on other companies that
we''ve published on including Silvercorp has ever been
exaggerated. </p>

<p>ATT Judge Sets Expert Reports Deadlines in Antitrust Case </p>
<p>The judge overseeing the U.S. Justice Department''s
antitrust lawsuit seeking to block ATT Inc. (T)''s $39 billion
takeover of T-Mobile USA Inc. gave both sides until Dec. 28 to
file reports by expert witnesses. </p>
<p>Responses to those reports must be filed by Jan. 9,
according to the order issued Sept. 23 by U.S. District Judge
Ellen Segal Huvelle. Rebuttal reports must be delivered by Jan.
16, according to the order. </p>
<p>The judge''s order resolved a dispute between the government
and ATT over deadlines for the expert reports. On Sept. 23 the
U.S. Justice Department asked Huvelle to give it until Jan. 5 to
prepare its reports, while ATT had pressed for a Nov. 15
deadline. The trial is set to begin Feb. 13. </p>
<p>The expert reports will likely be central to the case, said
Howard University law professor Andrew Gavil. </p>
<p>The government will have to lay out how the merger will
be anticompetitive and the only way to present those models is
with economists, Gavil said in a phone interview. To the
extent there is a difference of opinion between the government
and ATT, this is the area that is likely to heat up and be
critical ground for discussion. </p>
<p>The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)''s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would substantially reduce
competition. Last week, seven states joined the government''s
effort to block the deal. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). </p>
<p>Madoff Trustee Renews $91 Million Sterling Partner Suit </p>
<p>The liquidator of Bernard Madoff''s firm filed a revised
lawsuit against money management firm American Securities LP
that demanded $91.9 million dollars of funds taken out of the
con man''s firm since January 2000. </p>
<p>American Securities, after meeting Fred Wilpon and Saul
Katz, owners of the New York Mets Major League Baseball team,
joined with their Sterling Equities Inc. in 1991 to create a
$4.5 billion-asset real estate investment company, Sterling
American Property Inc., according to Madoff trustee Irving
Picard. Madoff was among the investors, Picard said in a court
filing Sept. 23. </p>
<p>Closely held American Securities and its executives had
access to the con man and should have responded to so-called red
flags warning of fraud, Picard said in an amended complaint
filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Of the money Picard is demanding, about $10 million was
fake profit, he said. </p>
<p>A call seeking comment on the complaint from Charles Klein,
a founder and managing director of American Securities, wasn''t
immediately returned. </p>
<p>Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year sentence in a federal
prison in North Carolina. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. American Securities, 1:10-ap-05415,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York

<p>News Corp. (NWSA) to Be Sued in U.S. by Victims of Phone Hacking </p>
<p>News Corp. (NWS) directors will be sued in the U.S. by victims of
phone hacking by reporters at the News of the World tabloid, a
lawyer said. </p>
<p>Legal action will be started in the U.S. within 10 days,
Mark Lewis, a lawyer representing phone-hacking victims in
London, said in an interview broadcast on Sky News Sept.23. </p>
<p>Lewis represents phone-hacking victims including the family
of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Revelations that Dowler''s
mobile-phone messages were deleted while she was missing in 2002
led to the closure of the News of the World and forced News
Corp. to drop a takeover bid for British Sky Broadcasting Group
Plc. (BSY) </p>
<p>U.S. lawyers will make the final decisions on the
defendants to include in the lawsuit, Lewis said in a separate
interview on BBC News. He said that lawyers are looking at areas
that should have been part of the knowledge of directors of a
large corporation. Lawyers would seek to speak with News Corp.
Chairman Rupert Murdoch and Deputy Chief Operating Officer James
Murdoch, Lewis said. </p>
<p>Miranda Higham, a spokeswoman for News Corp. in London,
declined to comment on the U.S. lawsuits. Lewis didn''t return a

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Obama Health-Care Law Leaves Appeals Court With Questions </p>
<p>President Barack Obama''s health-care law got a mixed
reception in its fourth review by a federal appeals court as
three judges grappled with questions about the law''s
constitutionality and their own authority to rule on it. </p>
<p>In a two-hour argument Sept. 23 in Washington, two judges
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit said a ruling upholding the law, which requires that
most Americans buy insurance or face a tax penalty, could leave
the government with unprecedented power over its citizens. </p>
<p>In 220 years there has been a whole lot of laws and a lot
of crises, yet Congress has never once mandated a purchase,
said Judge Brett Kavanaugh, adding that the lurking next
step might be a law requiring investment in private retirement
accounts. </p>
<p>Kavanaugh also questioned whether federal courts could rule
on the law before any taxpayer had been assessed a penalty. </p>
<p>The Washington appellate panel may be the last to rule on
the law before it reaches U.S. Supreme Court. The Obama
administration must signal next week whether it will seek high
court review of another court''s opinion declaring the insurance
mandate unconstitutional. </p>
<p>Two federal appeals courts have ruled on the insurance
mandate. A Cincinnati panel in June decided Congress''s authority
to regulate interstate commerce extended to enacting the
insurance mandate. The U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta threw
out the mandate on Aug. 12, concluding Congress can''t compel
people to buy a product for their entire lives. </p>
<p>An appeals panel in Richmond, Virginia, decided on Sept. 8
that it was blocked by a statute that generally bars challenging
taxes before they''re collected or assessed. </p>
<p>The case argued Sept. 23 was brought in June 2010 by five
individuals who claimed they and their families could face
collective penalties of more than $27,000 for failing to obtain
insurance. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler in February dismissed
their suit, finding the mandate constitutional. </p>
<p>The U.S. calls the insurance mandate the linchpin of the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, claiming that
without expanding the pool of younger, healthier customers the
insurance industry can''t meet its obligations for coverage under
the law. </p>

Appeals for the District of Columbia (Washington). </p>

<p>Marcellus Gas Drillers Face Chaos'' in Land Law Ruling </p>
<p>A Pennsylvania appeals court ruling has raised questions
about who can claim ownership of natural gas embedded in the
Marcellus shale formation, potentially putting in doubt the
legitimacy of thousands of drilling leases, Bloomberg News'' Jim
Polson and Mike Lee report. </p>
<p>The state''s Superior Court said Pennsylvania law governing
ownership of oil and gas rights isn''t clear and a lower-court
judge should solicit expert opinions in a case pitting current
landowners against the heirs to an 1881 deed. </p>
<p>Dozens of energy companies have invested billions of
dollars in leasing shale gas production rights in
Pennsylvania, Larry Nettles, an attorney with the Houston-
based law firm Vinson  Elkins LLP, said in a telephone
interview. This opinion calls into question whether they have
those rights. </p>
<p>For more than a century, Pennsylvania has required
landowners to consider oil and gas rights separate from more
general mineral rights when transferring ownership of
resources beneath the surface of their property. The defendants
in the title dispute argued shale gas is different and should be
considered part of the mineral rights because it is contained
inside rock. </p>
<p>The Superior Court, the second-highest court in the state,
ruled Sept. 7 that current law doesn''t sufficiently address
whether Marcellus shale constitutes a mineral, the question
that''s now to be hashed out by the lower court. </p>
<p>Until the case is decided, oil and gas companies will face
uncertainty about whether they''ve signed drilling leases with
the right people, legal experts say. Owners of oil and gas
rights who signed leases with gas producers could find that they
don''t own the gas after all. </p>
<p>If, somehow, shale gas is different, that would be a sea
change in Pennsylvania law, David Fine, a Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania-based attorney for KL Gates LLP, said Sept. 22 in
a telephone interview. The issue is whether they''ve entered
into a lease with someone and somebody else is going to find a
problem with the title. </p>
<p>The case may take as long as two years to wind through the
courts, Fine said. </p>
<p>The case is John E. and Mary Josephine Butler v. Charles
Powers Estate et al, 1795-mda-2010, Superior Court of
Pennsylvania. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Potash Producer Civil Antitrust Suit Rejected by U.S. Court </p>
<p>Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. and six other producers
of the fertilizer chemical won a U.S. appeals court ruling
rejecting purchaser claims they were conspiring to fix prices in
violation of federal antitrust laws. </p>
<p>The buyers sued in 2008, claiming violations of the U.S.
Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act, which can extend the
reach of American antitrust law to foreign anticompetitive
conduct that affects U.S. imports. </p>
<p>The Chicago-based court ruled that Minn-Chem Inc. and its
co-plaintiffs failed to state a plausible direct, substantial
and reasonably foreseeable, link between the allegedly anti-
competitive activity of the producers -- all of whose mining
operations are based in Canada, Russia or Belarus -- and the
U.S. market for their product. </p>
<p>All of the anticompetitive conduct identified in the
complaint is alleged to have occurred outside the United
States, U.S. Circuit Judge Diane Sykes wrote in the court''s
unanimous 27-page decision. </p>
<p>Also named as defendants in the case were Calgary-based
Agrium Inc. (AGU), Plymouth, Minnesota-based The Mosaic Co. (MOS), as well
as Russian and Belarussian companies. As of 2008, they accounted
for about 71 percent of the world''s supply of potash, according
to the Sept. 23 court ruling. </p>
<p>We are evaluating the opinion and making decisions
about what we will be doing, San Francisco attorney Bruce
Simon, who argued the case for the purchasers on June 3, said
Sept. 23 in a phone interview. He declined to comment further. </p>
<p>We believe the court made the right ruling, Rob Litt, a
spokesman for The Mosaic Co., said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>We''re certainly very pleased with the decision of the
court, said Bill Johnson, a spokesman for Saskatoon-based
Potash Corp. </p>

U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (Chicago). </p>
<p>Emanuel Goffer Seeks Prison Term of Less Than 46 Months </p>
<p>Emanuel Goffer, convicted of insider trading with his
brother Zvi Goffer, is seeking a prison term of less than 46
months, saying he plays a critical role in raising a 3-year-old
son with developmental problems. </p>
<p>Emanuel Goffer is set to be sentenced Oct. 7 before U.S.
District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan, who imposed a 10-
year prison term on his brother this week. </p>
<p>In court papers filed Sept. 23, Emanuel Goffer asked for a
tempered sentence shorter than the 46- to 57-month federal
sentencing guidelines range calculated by U.S. probation
officials. Goffer said in the filings that his son isn''t meeting
age appropriate gross motor milestones. </p>
<p>Goffer also disputes a U.S. finding that he earned more
than $2 million by insider trading. </p>
<p>Jerika Richardson, a spokeswoman for the office of U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) and Intel Corp. (INTC) will invest $4.4 billion over five years
to create a hub for next-generation computer chip technology in
New York, the state''s Governor Andrew Cuomo, said. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider, will
spend $3.6 billion to develop computer chips using 22-nanometer
and 14-nanometer process technology, said Michael Loughran, a
company spokesman. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter and
measures the size of transistors in a chip. Lower numbers
indicate more advanced technology. </p>
<p>Intel Corp., IBM, Globalfoundries Inc., Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. will
focus on transforming 300-millimeter wafer technology into 450-
millimeter technology, which will produce twice the number of
chips, according to a statement from Cuomo''s office. </p>
<p>This is really all about the computing systems IBM and
others will construct using advanced technologies, John Kelly,
senior vice president and director of research at Armonk, New
York-based IBM, said at a press conference in Albany. This
will create computers that will help doctors diagnose advanced
diseases. </p>
<p>The investment will retain and create 6,900 jobs in the
state, including 2,500 new technology roles, according to the
statement. </p>
<p>To support the project, the state will make a $400 million
investment in the State University of New York College of
Nanoscale Science and Engineering in Albany, the statement said. </p>
<p>Unprecedented Investment'' </p>
<p>Research and development facilities located in Canandaigua,
Utica, East Fishkill and Yorktown Heights also will receive
cash, according to the statement. </p>
<p>This unprecedented investment in New York''s economy will
create thousands of jobs and make the state the epicenter for
the next generation of computer chip technology, Cuomo said in
the statement. </p>
<p>IBM rose $3.20, or 1.8 percent, to $177.71 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are up 21
percent this year. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California,

<p>The Italian city of Cassino was
ordered by a court to disclose the terms of a settlement it
reached with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to terminate a derivative that
cost taxpayers as much as 2 million euros ($2.7 million). </p>
<p>An administrative court published a ruling yesterday saying
Bloomberg News should be granted access to the swaps contracts
and settlement after a lawsuit under the country''s freedom-of-
information laws. The central Italian city and the bank agreed
to end the swaps contract in 2009 without disclosing the terms. </p>
<p>Faced with shrinking income and growing expenses, cities
throughout Italy bought swaps to cut their short-term interest
expenses, while putting them at the risk of rising interest
costs. About 300 were losing a total of 912 million euros on
derivatives as of March, Bank of Italy data show. </p>
<p>This ruling will create a precedent, said Elio Lannutti, a senator and member of the opposition Italian Values
party, who also heads the Adusbef consumer group. This ruling
re-establishes the law, which was violated by the obscure
dealings that prohibit taxpayers from choosing and judging their
local administrations and their relations with banks. </p>
<p>The city of 33,000, and site of heavy fighting during World
War II, sought to keep the settlement secret, citing a
confidentiality clause in its agreement with JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. lender by assets. </p>
<p>The city will comply with the court order once received,
said Enzo Salera, Cassino''s finance chief. The city can still
appeal to the country''s highest administrative court, the
Council of State. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. </p>
<p>Greater Transparency'' </p>
<p>The taxpayers of Cassino deserve to understand how the
government managed to lose millions of dollars in their
interest-rate swap with JPMorgan, said Matthew Winkler,
editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News. We continue to seek greater
transparency, accountability and disclosure of the financial
terms in this case to shed light on how taxpayer money is being
used. </p>
<p>In 2003, Cassino entered a seven-year swap with Bear
Stearns Cos., which JPMorgan bought in 2008, to adjust payments
on about 22 million euros of debt. The swap switched the city''s
4.7 percent fixed interest rate payment for a variable rate,
according to a June 2009 report by Italy''s financial police. </p>
<p>The city paid a floating rate based on the U.S.-dollar
London interbank offered rate, an extremely risky bet given
that Libor was at a record low, police said in testimony to the
Italian Senate. </p>
<p>Dollar Libor </p>
<p>Three-month U.S. dollar Libor was at a 1 percent in June
2003 and by January 2006 had surpassed 4.7 percent, according to
data compiled by the British Bankers'' Association. The measure
climbed as high as 5.7 percent in September 2007 as credit
markets began to seize up, before declining to a record low of
0.25 percent by December 2009 after policy makers cut rates. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was named an interested party in the lawsuit
because of the potential impact on the firm. The bank is
separately on trial in Italy in the first European criminal case
involving swaps. Together with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Depfa Bank Plc
and UBS AG, JPMorgan faces charges in Milan for fraud for
tricking the municipal government into buying the contracts. The
lenders deny the allegations. </p>
<p>In a judgment published earlier this month, Italy''s highest
administrative court ruled that Pisa''s provincial government has
the right to annul swaps contracts with Dexia Crediop SpA and
Depfa Bank Plc. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News also sued the European Central Bank in
December to make it release documents showing how Greece used
derivatives to hide its fiscal deficit and helped trigger the
region''s sovereign debt crisis. The case is pending. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) says it will be
able to book oil and gas reserves it finds in an Arctic and
Black Sea venture with OAO Rosneft even though its Russian
state-run partner owns the licenses. </p>
<p>We see this as one of the most prospective areas for
exploration in the whole world, Glenn Waller, Exxon''s head of
Russia, told reporters today at the Sakhalin Oil and Gas 2011
conference in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. That is what is driving us.
Access to new resources. </p>
<p>Exxon agreed to form a venture with Rosneft on Aug. 30,
pledging to spend $3.2 billion exploring for oil and gas in
Russia''s Arctic Kara Sea and deep-water Black Sea. Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin is encouraging partnerships with
international explorers to maintain output at a world-leading 10
million barrels a day for the next decade. Putin said the Exxon-
Rosneft alliance may lead to $500 billion in investment. </p>
<p>The west Siberian basin that''s the source of more than half
Russia''s oil output extends north under the Kara Sea, according
to Waller. Rosneft selected Exxon for the Arctic blocks after a
planned venture and share swap with BP Plc collapsed in May. </p>
<p>Exxon Confident </p>
<p>We are confident that we will be able to book those
reserves that belong to us under stock exchange rules,
following the exploration period, Waller said. Rosneft holds the
license, and almost 67 percent of the exploration venture, while
Exxon has 33 percent. </p>
<p>Exxon and Rosneft aim to drill the first exploration well
in 2015, according to a Rosneft presentation. </p>
<p>The partners will hold step-by-step talks with the
state as they seek tax incentives to make the challenging
project profitable, Waller said. The Kara Sea is icebound for
much of the year, and projects in its Arctic waters will need to
contend with nuclear waste from former test sites and dumps,
according to Waller''s presentation at the conference. </p>
<p>The government understands it needs to change some taxes to
make the projects effective, Waller said. </p>
<p>Rosneft, Russia''s largest oil producer, will decide in the
first half on an offer from Exxon to join projects in areas
including Texas, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, he said. Rosneft
and Exxon don''t plan to bring in other partners for now, he
said. </p>

analysts led by New York-based Hussein Allidina said in a report
today. Non-OPEC output will rise 225,000 barrels. </p>
<p>Slowing global economic growth will result in reducing
demand growth, the analysts said. Consumption will advance
600,000 barrels a day in 2012, down from a 950,000 gain this
year and 2.7 million barrel advance in 2010. </p>
<p>Brent oil for November settlement fell $3.33, or 3.1

<p>Microsoft Corp. plans to offer
online pay television service from Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) through Xbox Live, in an bid to channel more
entertainment to its video-game console, people with knowledge
of the situation said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is in talks with
almost two dozen providers of music, sports, movies and TV shows
in the U.S. and Europe, and may announce an expanded Xbox Live
streaming service as soon as next week, said one of the people,
who weren''t authorized to speak publicly. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is promoting the Xbox
360 console as a way to switch easily between games, DVDs and
pay TV. He said on Sept. 14 that by Christmas, Microsoft will
add the Bing search engine to the Xbox and use its Kinect
controller''s voice recognition to sift through shows on the Web. </p>
<p>We all know the frustrations of using guides and menus
and controllers, and we think a better way to do all of this is
simply to bring Bing and voice to Xbox, Ballmer said at a
developers conference. You say it, Xbox finds it. </p>
<p>Microsoft also expects to sign deals with Time Warner
Inc. (TWX)''s HBO cable channel, Sony Pictures Entertainment''s Crackle
streaming service, NBC Universal''s Bravo and Syfy channels and
Lovefilm UK, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the person said. </p>
<p>Wayne Hickey, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment, as did Bobbi Henson, a spokeswoman for Verizon, and
Jennifer Khoury of Comcast, which controls NBC. Greg Belloni, a
Sony spokesman, had no immediate comment. Dorothy Jean, a
spokeswoman for Lovefilm, declined to comment. An HBO
spokesperson declined to comment. </p>
<p>Pay-TV Tether </p>
<p>The new applications from Philadelphia-based Comcast''s
Xfinity TV service and New York-based Verizon''s FiOs would
require users to prove they already are pay-TV customers in
regions where the services operate, two of the people said. </p>
<p>The Xbox 360 plays DVDs and video games, and owners can pay
$60 a year for the Xbox Live premium service, which allows for
multi-user play over Web. Console owners can also add
subscriptions to Netflix Inc. (NFLX)''s and Hulu LLC''s online film and
television services, and pay-TV through ATT Inc. (T)''s U-verse in
its markets. </p>
<p>The surge in online entertainment has thrust the Xbox 360
and its console rival, Sony Corp. (6758)''s PlayStation 3, into
competition with other Web-connected devices in the home, from
DVRs to television sets. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Moves </p>
<p>Since last year, Microsoft has integrated social networking
features into Xbox Live, letting viewers chat with each other
while watching movies and shows. The company announced in June
that 35 million people used its paid Xbox Live service around
the world, spending an average of 60 hours a month playing games
and watching entertainment. </p>
<p>Comcast had 22.5 million pay-TV customers as of June 30.
Verizon Fios had 3.8 million. </p>
<p>Cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast are
looking to stem defections by putting their services on more
devices and making it easier for them watch. </p>
<p>In June, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts demonstrated a TV
interface called Xcalibur that uses Web-connected servers to
forgo the need for a set-top box at all. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 9 cents to $25.58 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. Comcast lost 33 cents to $22. Verizon slid 5
cents to $36.84 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) passed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become the world''s second-most
valuable technology company, a reflection of industry changes
including the shift away from the personal computer. </p>
<p>IBM''s market value rose to $214 billion yesterday, while
Microsoft''s fell to $213.2 billion. It''s the first time IBM has
exceeded its software rival based on closing prices since 1996,
according to Bloomberg data. IBM became the fourth-largest
company by market value, based on yesterday''s closing price,
and, in technology, trails only Apple Inc. (AAPL) </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano sold IBM''s PC
business six years ago to focus on corporate software and
services. Though Microsoft has expanded into online advertising
and games, it gets most of its revenue and earnings from the
Windows and Office software used primarily on PCs. </p>
<p>IBM went beyond technology, said Ted Schadler, an
analyst with Forrester Research Inc. They were early to
recognize that computing was moving way beyond these boxes on
our desks. </p>
<p>IBM remained ahead of Microsoft for a second day today,
sliding $4.30 to $174.87 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, as Microsoft dropped 56 cents to $24.89 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has
gained 19 percent this year, while Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Washington, has fallen 11 percent. </p>
<p>Apple, which long competed against IBM and Microsoft in the
PC business, passed Microsoft in market value last year, on
rising sales of iPhones, iPods and iPads. Apple''s market
capitalization is $353.5 billion based on today''s close. </p>
<p>Palmisano''s Strategy </p>
<p>Palmisano, who is also chairman, has spent his nine years
at the helm sharpening the company''s focus on software and
services for corporations and government. Once known as the
world''s largest computer company, IBM in 2005 sold its PC unit
to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), calling it commoditized. The company
has spent more than $25 billion investing in its software,
computer-services and consulting businesses. </p>
<p>The maneuvers have helped increase per-share profit for
more than 30 straight quarters. Palmisano has boosted sales by
20 percent from 2001 through last year, while keeping the costs
of the 426,000-employee company little changed. IBM pulled in
more than half of its $99.9 billion in revenue last year from
services and is now the world''s largest computer-services
provider. </p>
<p>The company is betting it can add another $20 billion to
revenue through 2015. Palmisano is investing in emerging markets
and analytics, as well as cloud-computing and an initiative
called Smarter Planet to connect roads, electrical systems and
other infrastructure to the Internet. </p>
<p>Railways, Waterways </p>
<p>Computing is now found in things that no one thinks of as
computers'', said Palmisano at a trade show keynote in
February. Today, there are nearly a billion transistors per
human, and each one costs one ten-millionth of a cent. Yes, some
of these transistors are going into servers, PCs, smart phones,
MP3 players and tablets. But an increasing number of them are
going into appliances and automobiles, power grids, roadways,
railways and waterways. </p>
<p>IBM plans to almost double operating earnings to at least
$20 a share in 2015. Investors have taken notice: Shares have
climbed 35 percent since the company first announced the goal in
May 2010. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Slump </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software company, was worth
three times as much as IBM in January 2000 and hit a market
capitalization of more than $430 billion in July 2000, according
to Bloomberg data. Microsoft fell to about $135 billion in March
2009 during the economic downturn, before recovering with the
market. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which had $69.9 billion in revenue for the
fiscal year ending in June, got about 60 percent of its sales
from the Windows and Office units in the most recent quarter. </p>
<p>They were trapped in the classic innovator''s dilemma
because their software business was so good, said Schadler.
The bet that Microsoft made in the PC business was to double
down and double down and double down. </p>
<p>CEO Steve Ballmer said investors may not appreciate the
company''s progress in other businesses, including server
software and online versions of Office, given the higher profile
of its consumer businesses. </p>
<p>People are saying, Where do you go next?'', said
Ballmer at the company''s annual meeting in November. There
probably isn''t as much appreciation for the incredible growth
and success we''ve had with enterprises since people relate
better to the consumer market. But it''s great products with
great earnings and particularly in some high-visibility
categories. </p>
<p>Xbox, Bing </p>
<p>The company''s server software and Office divisions boosted
sales last quarter, as did the entertainment division, which
includes its Xbox games business. Revenue at the online services
division, including the Bing search engine, climbed to $662
million, while its operating loss widened to $728 million. </p>
<p>Microsoft also cut a deal with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) this year to make
its Windows Phone the primary operating system for the company''s
smartphones. The deal is designed to help both companies compete
against Apple and Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android operating system, which
is available for free to handset makers such as Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. </p>
<p>Mobile and Cloud </p>
<p>IBM briefly passed Microsoft in market value rank on an
intraday basis in May, and the companies may continue to switch
positions, said Joel Achramowicz, an analyst for Blaylock Robert
Van LLC in Oakland, California. While IBM has largely convinced
investors it can execute its stable growth strategy, Microsoft
has to prove it can move beyond PCs to tackle the mobile and
cloud computing markets, he said. </p>
<p>Right now, we''re on the cusp of a major offensive move on
the part of Microsoft to position itself with some significant
leadership, this time in the mobile sector, he said.
Investors are skeptical, so the opportunity here is actually
bigger for Microsoft than it is for IBM. </p>
<p>Still, mobile computing is unlikely to ever be as
profitable for Microsoft as the PC business, said Forrester''s
Schadler. </p>
<p>They''re never going to win in that business the way they
did in the PC business, he said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), which owns the
world''s largest retail brokerage, is being priced in the credit-
default swaps market as less creditworthy than most U.S., U.K.
and French banks and as risky as Italy''s biggest lenders. </p>
<p>The cost of buying the swaps, or CDS, which offer
protection against a default of New York-based Morgan Stanley''s
debt for five years, surged to 488 basis points as of 4:20 p.m.
in New York, or $488,000, for every $10 million of debt insured,
from 305 basis points on Sept. 15, according to prices provided
by London-based CMA. Italy''s Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) had CDS trading
at 422 basis points, and UniCredit SpA (UCG) at 426, the data show. A
basis point is one-hundredth of a percent. </p>
<p>The CDS spreads are making investors and creditors
nervous about Morgan Stanley, said Brad Hintz, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York who rates the company''s
stock outperform, in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The price of Morgan Stanley credit-default swaps continued
to climb earlier this week even when the firm''s shares rose. The
stock, which yesterday jumped 6.6 percent, today dropped $1.58,
or 10 percent, to $13.51 in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, the biggest drop in the 81-company SP 500 Financials
Index. Shares are down 50 percent since the start of the year. </p>
<p>Implied Risk </p>
<p>Moody''s Analytics, an arm of Moody''s Investors Service
that''s separate from the company''s credit-rating business, said
in a report yesterday that Morgan Stanley''s CDS prices imply
that investors see the bank''s credit rating as having declined
to Ba2 from Ba1 in the last month. The company is actually rated
six grades higher at A2 by Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>By comparison, Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and France''s Societe
Generale (GLE) SA, which have CDS trading at 421 basis points and 340
basis points respectively, have prices that imply a rating of
Ba1, higher than the implied rating on Morgan Stanley, said
Allerton Smith, a banking-risk analyst at Moody''s Analytics in
New York. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley in New York,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley was the biggest recipient of emergency loans
from the Federal Reserve during the financial crisis and also
benefited from capital provided by Tokyo-based Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group Inc., now the biggest shareholder, and the U.S.
Treasury, which it repaid with interest. </p>
<p>2008 Peak </p>
<p>While the price of Morgan Stanley''s credit-default swaps is
at the highest level since March 2009, it''s nowhere near the
peak reached in 2008. On Oct. 10 of that year, the annual price
for five-year protection rose to the equivalent of 1,300 basis
points, according to data provided by CMA, a unit of CME Group
Inc. that compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market. </p>
<p>The credit-default swaps market can be thinly traded, and
the recent jump in prices may reflect no more than a single big
counterparty seeking to hedge contracts, said Hintz, a former
Morgan Stanley treasurer. Morgan Stanley, one of the biggest
traders of CDS among U.S. banks, doesn''t make a market in its
own swaps, according to Smith of Moody''s Analytics. </p>
<p>The CDS market has features that may not exist in other
markets like the bond market or the equities market, Smith
said in a telephone interview. Having fewer participants trading
in the Morgan Stanley name could result in a disproportionate
spread movement, he said. </p>
<p>Trading Volume </p>
<p>The daily average trading volume in Morgan Stanley shares
over the last three months is 27 million shares, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. By contrast, a three-month study
released this week by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found
that most single-name CDS trade less than once a day, while the
most active trade more than 20 times per day. </p>
<p>Trading in Morgan Stanley credit-default swaps has risen to
257 contracts last week, compared with 187 for Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), according to the Depository Trust  Clearing Corp.
That compares with a weekly average of 73 trades in Morgan
Stanley and 91 in Goldman Sachs in the six months that ended on
Aug. 26, DTCC data show. </p>
<p>There was a net $4.6 billion of protection bought and sold
on Morgan Stanley debt as of Sept. 23, according to DTCC. Even
with the higher trading volume, investor skittishness in the
face of Europe''s sovereign debt crisis may be leaving few market
participants willing to sell CDS protection to meet the demand
for hedges, said Hintz. </p>
<p>With the EU teetering, few other firms are going to jump
in and write CDS on a global capital markets player like MS,
Hintz said in his e-mail, referring to the European Union and to
Morgan Stanley''s stock-market ticker symbol. </p>
<p>Trading Decline </p>
<p>The rise in Morgan Stanley''s CDS prices may also relate to
an expected decline in third-quarter trading revenue or to the
company''s exposure to French banks, Smith said. </p>
<p>Ruth Porat, the bank''s chief financial officer, said at an
investor conference on Sept. 13 that the fixed-income trading
environment in the third-quarter was worse than 2010''s fourth
quarter, when Morgan Stanley posted its lowest debt-trading
revenue since the 2008 crisis. The company, led by Chief
Executive Officer James Gorman, 53, reported second-quarter
revenue from both investment banking and fixed-income trading
that beat rival Goldman Sachs for the first time on record. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had $39 billion of cross-border exposure to
French banks at the end of December before accounting for
offsetting hedges and collateral, according to an annual filing
with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission. Cross-border
outstandings include cash deposits, receivables, loans and
securities, as well as short-term collateralized loans of
securities or cash known as repurchase agreements or reverse
repurchase agreements. </p>
<p>Galloping Wider'' </p>
<p>While Morgan Stanley hasn''t updated those figures, Hintz
estimated in a Sept. 23 note to investors that the bank''s total
risk to France and that country''s lenders is less than $2
billion when collateral and hedges are included. Morgan Stanley
currently has zero exposure to France, including French banks,
after hedges and collateral are factored in, according to a
person close to the firm. </p>
<p>As of June 30, Morgan Stanley had about $5 billion of
funded exposure to Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain,
which was reduced to about $2 billion when offsetting hedges
were accounted for, according to a regulatory filing. The
company also had about $2 billion in overnight deposits in banks
in those countries and about $1.5 billion of unfunded loans to
companies in those countries, the filing shows. </p>
<p>Their spreads just are galloping wider, Smith said.
Is it rational that Morgan Stanley CDS spreads would be wider
than French bank CDS spreads if the concern is exposure to
French banks? I don''t think that makes perfect sense. </p>
<p>Bond Yield Climbs </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which like Morgan Stanley converted from a
securities firm to a bank in 2008, had $38.5 billion of gross
cross-border exposure to French banks as of June 30, according
to a regulatory filing. The firm''s five-year credit-default
swaps traded at 330 basis points as of 4:20 p.m., according to
CMA. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s 10-year debt has also shown signs that
investors are growing concerned. The yield on the company''s $1.5
billion of 5.5 percent senior unsecured notes that comes due in
July 2021 has climbed to 6.57 percent from 5.46 percent on Sept.
15, according to prices reported by Trace, the bond price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>That''s still lower than the 6.76 percent yield on 4.125
percent bonds issued by Intesa Sanpaolo that come due more than
a year earlier, in April 2020, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Very Sensitive'' </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s reliance on the debt markets, instead of
depositors, to provide funding for its assets may be one cause
of concern, some analysts said. Morgan Stanley and Goldman
Sachs, which were the second-biggest and biggest U.S. securities
firms before converting to banks, both got less than 10 percent
of their funding from depositors as of June 30, according to
company filings with the SEC. </p>
<p>By contrast, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the
two largest U.S. banks by assets, funded more than half of their
balance sheets with retail deposits at the end of June, filings
show. </p>
<p>The market is just very sensitive to anybody considered
to be wholesale funded, John Guarnera, a financial analyst at
Societe Generale in New York, said in a Sept. 23 telephone
interview. If you''re a bank, you can fall back on the fact
that you have a strong retail deposit base. Morgan Stanley has
deposits, but not like you''d see out of a BofA or a JPMorgan. </p>

<p>The Group of 20 nations may agree
to take coordinated measures to ease monetary policy at their
November meeting as global growth slows, according to Goldman
Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O''Neill. </p>
<p>Central banks have to be forward looking, said O''Neill
in an interview in London today. I wouldn''t be completely
surprised if we had some kind of coordinated move at the
November meeting and, if there were, Brazil would definitely
play a role in that. </p>
<p>Brazil''s central bank unexpectedly cut the Selic benchmark
interest rate by half a percentage point to 12 percent on Aug.
31 as the risk of recession in Europe and the U.S. shifted
policy makers'' focus away from the fastest inflation in six
years. Turkey and Israel have also lowered rates to protect
their economies from the impact of Europe''s debt problems. </p>
<p>Brazil''s decision to cut the benchmark rate was quite
smart, O''Neill said. The probability of the country meeting
its inflation target of 4.5 percent next year has risen
significantly because of the global economic crisis, he said. </p>
<p>Europe''s debt crisis led investors to dump emerging market
assets in the past two months, pushing the real down 18 percent
against the dollar since the end of July. The Brazilian currency
had gained 13 percent in the previous 12 months. </p>
<p>The real needs to weaken a further 10 percent to 15 percent
to make Brazilian stocks more interesting, according to
O''Neill, who ranks Brazil in rising third place for equity
investment among the so-called BRIC nations, behind China and
Russia and ahead of India. China is the most compelling and
very cheap, said O''Neill, who coined the term BRIC in 2001. </p>
<p>If we had a further decline in the real, I think the
Brazilian stock market would look more interesting than it has
for a year, he said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) won dismissal of a
retirement fund''s lawsuit over a collateralized debt obligation
called the Libertas CDO. </p>
<p>The Employees'' Retirement System of the Government of the
Virgin Islands claimed in the 2009 suit that New York-based
Morgan Stanley defrauded investors by collaborating with ratings
companies to give the CDO an undeserved AAA rating at the same
time it was short-selling almost all of the assets underlying
the notes. The CDO was backed by $1.2 billion in assets,
according to the complaint. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan today
dismissed the investor complaint, which asserted claims for
fraud and unjust enrichment under New York state law. </p>
<p>AAA is the highest rating for fixed-income instruments. The
portfolio was 92 percent residential mortgage-backed securities
and included exposure to more than $130 million in loans from
Option One Mortgage Corp. and $100 million from New Century
Mortgage Corp., both lenders to homebuyers with poor credit
scores, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The Libertas CDO entered into credit-default swaps that
referenced specific residential mortgage-backed securities.
According to the complaint, the notes collapsed in value after

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s Nigerian unit
said gunmen attacked a vessel supplying one of its offshore oil
platforms, wounding one worker and seizing another. </p>
<p>The incident has been reported to security and relevant
government agencies after the attack in southern Akwa Ibom
state, Nigel Cookey-Gam, a spokesman in Lagos, said in an e-
mailed statement. Exxon doesn''t know where the seized worker has
been taken and the injured individual is stable, he said. </p>
<p>Violence has risen in the southern Niger River delta, home
to Nigeria''s oil and gas industry, after a period of relative
quiet that followed a government amnesty in 2009 and the
disarming of thousands of fighters. Nigeria is Africa''s largest
oil producer and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. </p>
<p>Armed attacks in the delta cut Nigeria''s oil output more
than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) said this month it shut 25,000
barrels a day of crude output from its Imo River field in the
country''s southern Abia state because of the level of theft. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp.''s Angolan unit
will increase oil production to about 500,000 barrels a day by
August or September next year, from 450,000 now, Expansao said,
citing country Managing Director Stephane de Mahieu. </p>
<p>The company, which operates the Block 15 project about 350
kilometers (218 miles) off the coast, is developing the Kizomba
satellite fields to extend the life of the area, Luanda-based
Expansao cited De Mahieu as saying. Output will decline in the
meantime as some fields near the end of their life, it said. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Angolan projects are pumping oil more than 95
percent of the time, De Mahieu told the newspaper. </p>
