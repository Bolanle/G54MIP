&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA) returned workers to some oil and natural gas platforms
as Tropical Storm Lee accelerated to the east-northeast, out of
the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crews are resuming production in the western Gulf after
inspecting equipment for damage, David Eglinton, a spokesman for
Exxon Mobil, based in Irving, Texas-based said today in an e-
mail. Exxon moved about 140 employees to shore from
approximately 20 structures ahead of Lee. Shell, based in The
Hague, confirmed it began returning staff after evacuating as
many as 858 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 60 percent of oil production from the Gulf,
equivalent to 843,223 barrels per day, remained shut as of 11:30
a.m. New York time, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy
Management, Regulation and Enforcement. Gas curtailments totaled
2.35 billion cubic feet, or 44 percent, down from 2.9 billion
cubic feet, or 55 percent, yesterday. The bureau said 239 of the
617 platforms in the Gulf were evacuated and 25 of the 70 rigs
currently drilling in the ocean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interruptions will be brief, said James Williams, an
economist at WTRG Economics in London, Arkansas. &#8220;We&#8217;re not
talking about Hurricane Gustav here, moving pipelines up and
down Louisiana like it was spaghetti,&#8221; Williams said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;This one isn&#8217;t a big story. It&#8217;s a wet
story.&#8221; Gustav struck in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production Resumes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Production resumed at Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC)&#8217;s Nansen,
Boomvang and Gunnison platforms, the operator said today on its
website. Its Constitution, Marco Polo, Independence Hub, Neptune
and Red Hawk installations will be staffed and started as soon
as possible, The Woodlands, Texas-based Anadarko said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platforms become accessible as weather clears west to east,
Mike Hurst, chief pilot of PHI Inc. in Lafayette, Louisiana.
It&#8217;s the largest provider of helicopters to Gulf of Mexico oil
producers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal flights may resume tomorrow over western and central
platforms with service to eastern platforms Tuesday, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX)&#8217;s refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, is
operating normally, Katherine W. Swetman, a spokeswman, said
today in an e-mail. The unit can process as much as 360,000
barrels per day. More than 10 inches of rain fell in the area
the past four days, the National Weather Service said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Exxon Mobil refineries were operating normally today,
spokeswoman Claire Hassett said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sigmund Freud and his fiancee Martha
Bernays exchanged more than 1,500 letters during their secret,
four-year engagement. They fought, reconciled, described dreams,
shared hopes and even compared cocaine experiences by post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For many years, no-one outside the family knew the letters
had survived. Bernays, who lived until 1951, almost destroyed
them after her husband died because they were so private and
intimate. Her daughters persuaded her not to. Germany&#8217;s S.
Fischer Verlag is publishing them in full for the first time, in
five volumes over five years. The first, covering the period
from June 1882 to July 1883, was published this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intensive correspondence reveals a stormy relationship
and a jealous, insecure and domineering Freud. Ilse Grubrich-
Simitis, a psychoanalyst and Freud expert, is one of its three
editors and wrote the introduction. We speak in her sparsely
furnished practice in Frankfurt&#8217;s chic Westend district, seated
on two chairs next to an empty couch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picturing Freud on the couch, I ask whether we can analyze
the founder of psychoanalysis from the letters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the most intimate and the most revealing of
Freud&#8217;s correspondences, so it is very tempting,&#8221; says
Grubrich-Simitis, trim and elegant with glasses and gray hair.
&#8220;But you have to remember that he was very young -- he was 26
when it started and 30 when it ended. His stormy, precarious
psychic state at the time had a lot to do with his uncertain
social status.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pound fell to a seven-week low
against the dollar after U.K. reports showed confidence in the
outlook for employment weakened and a services index declined,
boosting the case for more economic stimulus measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterling extended two weeks of losses against the yen and
slumped below its 200-day moving average against the greenback
for the first time since July. Government bonds climbed, driving
yields on two-year gilts to a record low. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said it expects the Bank of England to resume so-called
quantitative easing &#8220;in the coming months&#8221; and pushed back its
forecast for higher interest rates until 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the past couple of weeks the topic of QE has got
more momentum behind it,&#8221; said Jane Foley, a senior foreign-
exchange strategist at Rabobank International in London. &#8220;The
fact that it appears to be on the table is likely to keep
sterling undermined.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound depreciated 0.7 percent to $1.6097 at 4:47 p.m.
in London, after dropping to $1.6062, the lowest level since
July 19. Sterling slipped below its 200-day moving average,
currently at $1.6123, for the first time since July 19,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound weakened for a fifth day against the Swiss franc,
sliding 1.2 percent to 1.2631 francs. It was little changed at
87.61 pence per euro. The U.K. currency declined 0.7 percent to
123.73 yen, after depreciating 0.8 percent last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An index of consumer sentiment toward hiring prospects slid
13 points to minus 66 for August, the lowest since February,
Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets said today. A gauge of services
activity based on a survey of purchasing managers fell to 51.1
from 55.4 in July, according to Markit Economics and the
Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November is the most likely month for the resumption of
bond purchases by the central bank, and there is likely to be
100 billion pounds of quantitative easing over two quarters,
Goldman Sachs economists Kevin Daly and Adrian Paul in London
wrote in a note to clients dated Sept. 2. The bank may resume
quantitative easing as soon as this week, Citigroup Inc.
economist Michael Saunders said in an e-mailed note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Engineering Employers&#8217; Federation last week cut its
U.K. manufacturing and economic growth forecasts and said the
central bank will keep rates on hold until at least next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterling has fallen 6.7 percent in the past 12 months
against a basket of nine major peers, according to Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. Only the dollar has
weakened more, sliding 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilts Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year gilts rose for a third day, with yields falling 14
basis points to 2.31 percent. The two-year yield was little
changed at 0.55 percent, after dropping to 0.494, the lowest
level since Bloomberg started collecting data on the securities
in 1992. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should favor 10-year gilts over German bunds
after the spread between their yields widened, betting the
interest-rate outlook will remain &#8220;benign,&#8221; Citigroup said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. &#8220;may have problems in meeting the fiscal targets
as the economy slows, but at least the coalition&#8217;s commitment to
deficit reduction is credible,&#8221; Citigroup fixed-income
strategists Nishay Patel and Aman Bansal wrote in a research
note. The recent underperformance of gilts &#8220;looks a good near-
term buying opportunity. Further quantitative easing would make
the trade even more attractive,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year gilts yielded 43 basis points more than their
German counterparts, compared with 26 basis points a week ago,
the most since March 2, based on closing Bloomberg generic
prices. The spread has widened from a 2011 low of eight basis
points on May 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gilts have returned 8.7 percent this year, compared with
6.5 percent for bunds and 8.3 percent for U.S. Treasuries,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dunkin&#8217; Brands Group Inc. was
initiated with a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
one of the banks that managed the coffee and doughnut chain&#8217;s
initial public offering in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With 6,800 U.S. stores mostly in New England, New York and
other eastern areas, Dunkin&#8217; has sought to draw customers in the
afternoons with snack foods such as stuffed breadsticks. Last
month, the chain also began selling K-Cups for Green Mountain
Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR)&#8217;s Keurig brewing machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weak consumer sentiment may curb Dunkin&#8217;s sales, &#8220;despite
a boost&#8221; from the introduction of single-serve K-Cups, Michael Kelter, a Goldman Sachs analyst in New York, wrote in a note
today after initiating coverage of the company. Dunkin&#8217;s U.S.
business is &#8220;highly macro-sensitive against an uncertain
economic backdrop,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canton, Massachusetts-based company, also the owner of
Baskin-Robbins, raised $423 million in an IPO before an over-
allotment. Goldman Sachs was among the banks that led the
Dunkin&#8217; offering and exercised the over-allotment option to buy
3.3 million additional shares for $19 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dunkin&#8217; rose 2 cents to $27.02 at 4 p.m. New York time in
trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Since the IPO the shares
have gained 42 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s growth plan includes doubling the number of
U.S. stores to 15,000 during the next 20 years. Kelter estimates
that the chain may be able to open about 3,200 more Dunkin&#8217;
Donuts in the U.S. for a total of 10,000 shops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDonald&#8217;s Corp. (MCD) has about 14,000 U.S. locations, while
Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) has 10,900. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California-blend gasoline weakened
the most in five days on speculation that the switch to winter-
blend fuel will boost supply in the market and after Exxon Mobil
Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Torrance refinery recovered from an equipment failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob in Los Angeles dropped 9.5 cents to a premium of 26
cents a gallon above gasoline futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange at 2:03 p.m. East Coast time, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell 11.64 cents to
$3.0782 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;California refineries will start their switching over
from summer to winter blend gasoline,&#8221; said Bob van der Valk,
an independent fuel pricing analyst in Terry, Montana.
&#8220;Additional gasoline production will show up on the market as
early as Sept. 15.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s 150,000-barrel-a-day Torrance refinery, south of
Los Angeles, was operating normally after an equipment failure
earlier today. No units were shut as a result of the incident,
Barbara Burgett, a spokeswoman at the refinery, said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London-based BP Plc was said to be planning maintenance at
its 266,000-barrel-a-day Carson refinery in southern California
that may result in flaring from tomorrow to Sept. 19. The work
isn&#8217;t related to an equipment breakdown and isn&#8217;t expected to
significantly affect operations, according to a person familiar
with the plant&#8217;s operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for Carbob in San Francisco narrowed 9 cents,
also to a premium of 26 cents over futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuel in Portland &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Portland, Oregon, was
unchanged at 32 cents a gallon over futures, its largest premium
since July 23, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corp. (TSO) said it shut an API unit, which separates
water and other contaminants from crude oil, at its 125,000-
barrel-a-day Anacortes refinery in Washington last week for
planned work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery expects to finish work on the unit, unrelated
to the refining process, early this week, Mike Marcy, a Tesoro
spokesman based in Martinez, California, said in an e-mailed
statement Sept. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work &#8220;will have no impact whatsoever on Tesoro&#8217;s
ability to fulfill its regional product supply commitments,&#8221;
Marcy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro also shut a residual oil supercritical extraction
unit, which produces feedstock for the refinery&#8217;s fluid
catalytic cracking and hydrocracking units, for maintenance that
may take several weeks to finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s largest
theme-park operator, said consumer products Chairman Andrew P. Mooney resigned to seek a leadership role at another company
after running the division for 12 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I believe this is the perfect time to take that
experience into a leadership role with another organization and
corporate boards,&#8221; Mooney, 56, said today in a statement from
Burbank, California-based Disney. He wasn&#8217;t more specific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit Mooney leaves, Disney&#8217;s second smallest ahead of
interactive media, has been a steady source of sales and profit
growth with toys and merchandise from Pixar&#8217;s &#8220;Cars&#8221; movies
and Marvel films. Earnings in the division jumped 32 percent in
the June quarter on a 13 percent revenue gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A native of Scotland, Mooney is credited with
reinvigorating the Disney chain of stores and leading the
division that introduced the Disney Princesses and Disney
Fairies brands. He has led the unit since 1999 and has been
chairman since 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 68 cents to $31.78 at 2:06 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares had declined 13
percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C)
and Credit Suisse Group AG landed lead roles managing the
initial share sale for Carlyle Group LP, taking one of the last
major private-equity firms public in a faltering market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mandate may give the banks a boost among underwriters
as companies and their bankers struggle to complete deals.
JPMorgan currently ranks third for U.S. IPOs, while Citigroup
ranks fourth and Credit Suisse is eighth, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. listings have slowed almost to a halt because of
investors&#8217; concerns about the economy, eroding fee income at
investment banks. U.S. IPOs have been shelved or scrapped at a
faster rate in the past three months than the comparable period
of any year since 2004, Bloomberg data show. Only five offerings
were completed last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They should be doing cartwheels and jumping in the air to
get any kind of revenue in the door right now,&#8221; said Tom Jalics, a senior investment analyst at the private-banking unit
of KeyCorp in Cleveland, which oversees $22 billion. &#8220;From what
we&#8217;re hearing anecdotally, this quarter is going to be
extraordinarily weak, and estimates across the board are coming
down for investment banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three banks all have a track record for taking private-
equity firms public. Citigroup helped lead the February 2007 IPO
of Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG), as well as Blackstone Group
LP (BX)&#8217;s in June 2007 along with Credit Suisse. JPMorgan, Credit
Suisse and Citigroup all helped lead Apollo Global Management
LLC&#8217;s share sale in March. Washington-based Carlyle is the
second-biggest private-equity firm after Blackstone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Average Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absent from Carlyle&#8217;s filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission was Morgan Stanley (MS), which shared the lead
role with Citigroup on Blackstone&#8217;s offering. Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS), which helped manage both Apollo&#8217;s share sale and the
Fortress IPO, also wasn&#8217;t mentioned in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Plc is the top-ranked underwriter for U.S. IPOs
this year, and Morgan Stanley is ranked second, according to
Bloomberg data. Banks have earned underwriting fees averaging
5.4 percent of the total IPO size for U.S. deals this year, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the largest
software maker, is adding features to its Internet display-
advertising products to keep from losing customers to Google
Inc. (GOOG) and Facebook Inc. in the $12.3 billion U.S. market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is unveiling tools and partnerships with AppNexus
Inc. and MediaMath this month designed to help customers more
effectively tailor ads and measure their impact. Sales of
graphical display ads, including banners and videos, are poised
to climb 25 percent in the U.S. this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company aims to reassure customers such as Publicis
Groupe SA that have questioned its commitment to display ads and
the Atlas software it acquired with the $6 billion AQuantive
Inc. deal. As Microsoft shifted its focus to search-related ads,
some marketers have devoted more display-ad dollars to Facebook
and Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have continued to invest behind Microsoft and behind
Atlas,&#8221; said Curt Hecht, chief executive officer of VivaKi
Nerve Center, the unit that oversees technology for Publicis
Groupe SA (PUB)&#8217;s digital ad agencies. &#8220;We need a partner that&#8217;s as
committed as we are. Microsoft is at a point where they need to
show it&#8217;s important to them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is adding personnel and dollars to bolster
display and Atlas, which is used to place ads on websites and
help advertisers measure performance of ad campaigns. Atlas vies
with DoubleClick, acquired by Google in a $3.1 billion purchase
announced a month before the AQuantive deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a producer of
steelmaking coal in southern Appalachia, jumped as much as 30
percent after the London-based Times said Anglo American Plc (AAL) may
be considering a takeover bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo is said to be weighing a $120-a-share offer, the
Times said in its market report without citing anyone. BHP
Billiton Ltd. (BHP) is also interested in Walter, the Times said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter rose $15.99, or 21 percent, to $90.98 as of 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
pared gains after Walter said in a statement it isn&#8217;t aware of
any &#8220;corporate developments&#8221; to account for the price
increase. The stock earlier touched $97.30, the biggest intraday
gain since March 8, 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter, based in Birmingham, Alabama, hasn&#8217;t hired a
permanent chief executive officer since Keith Calder resigned
June 30. He stepped down about two months after he was appointed
to the position, following Walter&#8217;s takeover of Canada&#8217;s Western
Coal Corp., where he was the CEO. Investor Audley Capital
Advisors LLP said in July that the company should explore a
sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Met coal assets are still in high demand,&#8221; Jeremy Sussman, an analyst with Brean Murray Carret  Co., wrote in a
research note today. Metallurgical coal, also known as coking
coal, is used to produce steel while utilities use thermal coal
to generate electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeover Bids &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter said it issued the statement in response to a
request from the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of
Canada on behalf of the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company said
it doesn&#8217;t intend to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surging demand from steelmakers in China and flood-related
supply disruptions in Queensland, Australia, have driven prices
for coking coal to record highs. Low-volatility metallurgical
coal rose to $291 a ton, Energy Publishing Inc. said in its
latest weekly report, published Sept. 2. It touched $330 a ton
in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were $20.15 billion of takeover bids for coal-mining
companies valued at $100 million or more in the first nine
months of this year, compared with $7.06 billion in the year-
earlier period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU), the biggest U.S. coal producer, and
ArcelorMittal, the world&#8217;s largest steelmaker, in August agreed
to buy Macarthur Coal Ltd., a Brisbane, Australia coking-coal
producer, for A$3.64 billion ($3.88 billion). Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR) became the world&#8217;s third-largest producer of
coking coal with a $7.1 billion takeover of Massey Energy Co. in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offer Unlikely &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo isn&#8217;t likely to make an offer for Walter, mainly
because the U.S. company&#8217;s coal reserves aren&#8217;t in a suitable
location for export by sea, London-based investment bank Liberum
Capital said today in a note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. also saw an offer as unlikely, &#8220;due to
limited potential synergies,&#8221; and because the multiple of 5.5
times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization is low compared with recent deals in the sector,
Brian Yu, a San Francisco-based analyst wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo, which is based in London, also declined to comment
in an e-mail. Kelly Quirke, a spokeswoman for Melbourne-based
BHP, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
compensation plan, which almost doubled top executive Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s pay last year, unfairly rewards the investment
bank&#8217;s employees at shareholders&#8217; expense, a lawyer for
investors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, has
lost $50 billion in market value since 1999 while the company
has paid out billions in compensation to the firm&#8217;s 31,000
employees, including Blankfein, its chairman and chief executive
officer, John Harnes, an attorney for investors who have sued
over the pay plan, argued today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, &#8220;is being run for the
benefit of employees rather than shareholders,&#8221; Harness told
Delaware Chancery Court Judge Sam Glasscock III. The judge heard
arguments on whether shareholders&#8217; suits seeking to recoup
executive compensation should be thrown out and said he&#8217;d rule
later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis. In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year, according to its website. That was 9 percent less
than in the same period in 2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$19 Million Compensation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s $19 million compensation for 2010, which
included a $5.4 million cash bonus, was almost double the prior
year&#8217;s award even as Goldman Sach&#8217;s profits fell. Blankfein and
other firm executives agreed to forgo cash bonuses in 2009 and
take restricted stock grants as compensation to mute criticism
of the firm&#8217;s pay practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation
Authority, a Goldman Sachs shareholder, argue the firm&#8217;s
lucrative compensation system is wasteful and rewards employees
for taking risks that hurt the firm&#8217;s stock price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harness noted Goldman officials received billions in pay
and bonuses last year while the firm settled claims by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission that executives misled
investors in collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime
mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators&#8217; claims that marketing materials about the
investments had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs in 2007 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDOs in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing a hedge fund
helped pick the underlying securities and then bet against the
investment vehicles, the SEC said in the suit Goldman settled.
The bank didn&#8217;t admit wrongdoing as part of the accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such &#8220;wrongful conduct has cost shareholders billions to
date and is likely to cost billions more,&#8221; Harnes argued on
behalf of Septa. Philadelphia-based Septa is the nation&#8217;s fifth-
largest public transportation system, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should be permitted to move forward with their
suit, which seeks to hold Goldman Sachs directors responsible
for the firm&#8217;s flawed pay plan and for not properly overseeing
the company&#8217;s employees, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any recovery as a result of Septa&#8217;s so-called derivative
suit will be returned to the company&#8217;s coffers rather than given
to the transportation authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk-Taking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory Varallo, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s lawyer, countered
investors haven&#8217;t provided any evidence that directors engaged
in wrongdoing by creating the pay plan or encouraged excessive
risk-taking by the firm&#8217;s traders and bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder court filings seek to paint the investment bank
as some kind of &#8220;vast criminal enterprise,&#8221; Varallo told
Glasscock. Yet, investors can&#8217;t point to one illegal act
committed by a Goldman Sachs director or employee, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors want the judge to decide &#8220;how much risk&#8221; an
investment bank should take and &#8220;how much is too much&#8221;
compensation for taking those risks on behalf of shareholders,
Varallo added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s a judge&#8217;s job,&#8221; the lawyer
added. Delaware Chancery Court judges decide cases without a
jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) Shareholder
Litigation, 5215, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chief Executive
Officer John Watson urged President Barack Obama to cut
regulations and expand offshore oil drilling rather than use
subsidies to create jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration should abandon efforts to repeal about
$4 billion a year in oil and gas tax breaks and reconsider an
Environmental Protection Agency rule on greenhouse-gas emissions
to control climate change, Watson said today at a conference in
Washington. The EPA regulation will raise energy costs and
hinder growth, he said at the meeting sponsored by The Hill
newspaper and American Petroleum Institute industry group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would be delighted to invest more in the oil and gas
industry,&#8221; Watson said. The industry responds to the &#8220;fiscal
and regulatory environment we are given,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama is set to outline his proposals to help lower
unemployment from 9.1 percent in an address to Congress tomorrow
night. Payroll growth stalled last month, the Labor Department
reported Sept. 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anglo American Plc (AAL), a miner of coal
in Australia, South Africa and Colombia, is unlikely to make an
offer for U.S.-based Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) mainly because of the
location of its reserves, Liberum Capital Ltd. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anglo has negligible presence in U.S. coal markets, plus
landlocked U.S. coal is less exposed to export seaborne
markets,&#8221; London-based Liberum said today in a note. The
London-based Times newspaper reported earlier that Anglo may be
weighing an offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy has slumped 41 percent in New York trading
this year amid management turmoil and disappointing earnings.
Investor Audley Capital Advisors LLP said in July the southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal should explore a sale
following Chief Executive Officer Keith Calder&#8217;s resignation
after three months on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo may be considering a bid at $120 a share, the Times
said in its daily market report, without saying where it got the
information. The London-based miner could increase an offer to
$150 if needed, the newspaper said, adding that BHP Billiton
Ltd. (BHP) may also be interested in Walter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anglo declined to comment in an e-mail today. Kelly Quirke,

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE), one of
Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s largest franchise bottlers, said it made a
mistake in threatening to reconsider a 17 million-euro ($24
million) manufacturing investment in southern France because of
a sugar-related tax proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would like to set the record straight,&#8221; Hubert Patricot, president of the Atlanta-based company&#8217;s European
group, said today in a statement. &#8220;We are re-confirming our 17
million euro investment to our Les Pennes-Mirabeau facility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had said in a statement hours earlier that it
was re-evaluating the planned investment and had canceled a
Sept. 19 ceremony with Chief Executive Officer John Brock. The
threat was in protest of a government plan to tax sugared
beverages as part of an austerity measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises declined to comment beyond the
follow-up statement. Patricot in his statement stood by the
company&#8217;s opposition to the tax proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain strongly opposed to a tax that unjustly targets
the purchasing power of the French people and one category of
beverages under the pretext of addressing public health
concerns,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Consumer information and education around
increased exercise and balanced diets, not discriminatory taxes,
must be part of any comprehensive proposal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s government announced last month a plan to raise 12
billion euros in 2011 and 2012 to fight mounting deficits.
Parliament is voting through tomorrow on 2011 measures that
include raising taxes on alcohol and cigarettes and creating a
new levy on sodas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro Disney Protest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises is the latest company to challenge
elements of the government&#8217;s plan. Euro Disney SCA (EDL)&#8217;s Disneyland
Paris and French theme parks opposed a planned increase in the
value-added tax on its business to 19.6 percent from 5.5
percent. The tax was scrapped yesterday after the parks won
support from former Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he presented the plan, Prime Minister Francois Fillon
justified the new levy on sugared drinks, saying it was aimed at
reining in &#8220;the development of obesity that eventually will
represent a health cost.&#8221; The levy would yield about 100
million euros a year, according to the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises protested earlier today saying there
are &#8220;no studies in France&#8221; linking sodas and higher obesity
rates. The company said then that its investment in the factory
in Pennes-Mirabeau was on hold pending the vote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s experimental pill for
rheumatoid arthritis was as effective as Humira from Abbott
Laboratories (ABT) and showed no new side effects in study results the
company plans to submit for U.S. approval this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine study summaries were released today and will be
presented at the American College of Rheumatology conference in
Chicago in November. In one trial, both doses of Pfizer&#8217;s drug,
called tofacitinib, were slightly more effective than Humira
across six categories of improvement in symptoms and patient
mobility, though the study wasn&#8217;t big enough to establish the
pill&#8217;s superiority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, designed tofacitinib
to compete with injectable drugs that dominate the market, led
by Humira from Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott, Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Remicade and Amgen Inc. (AMGN)&#8217;s Enbrel, which New York-based
Pfizer shares. The new drug may bring in more than $2.6 billion
a year, said Catherine Arnold, an analyst at Credit Suisse Group
AG in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a game-changing drug,&#8221; Arnold said. &#8220;Our peak
sales of $2.6 billion are likely conservative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humira will reach peak sales of about $8.5 billion in 2013
before sales decline as doctors grow comfortable with
tofacitinib and other new drugs, said Arnold, who has an
&#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Pfizer&#8217;s stock and a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating
for Abbott. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 19 cents, or 1 percent, to $18.82 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Abbott declined 86
cents, or 1.6 percent, to $51.44. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helps Application &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer believes the risk-benefit profile supports
regulatory submission for both the 5- and 10-milligram dose,&#8221;
Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;We are looking forward to filing in the U.S., EU and Japan by
the end of the year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib is the most-advanced pill in a family of
experimental drugs to target a protein, called JAK, which leads
to joint destruction in 1.3 million Americans with rheumatoid
arthritis. Three biotechnology companies are trying to catch up
to Pfizer with similar treatments: Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc. (RIGL),
Incyte Corp. and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. (VRTX) Pfizer&#8217;s pill is
the only one to complete the third and final stage of tests
generally needed for U.S. regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humira performed unexpectedly poorly in the study, which
may not represent the true effectiveness of the drug, said
Elizabeth Hoff, a spokeswoman for Abbott. The proportion of
Humira patients showing a 20 percent improvement after six
months was 47 percent, compared with a typical proportion of 65
percent of patients with such improvement. Patients with 50
improvement only accounted for 28 percent of those studied,
compared with past studies showing 52 percent of patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Looking at the scores, this isn&#8217;t what we typically
see,&#8221; Hoff said today in a telephone interview. &#8220;These are
very similar patient populations. You see a pretty significant
difference.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The safety of tofacitinib was similar to what was seen in
previous studies, and deaths and side effects were toward the
lower end of a range of results from similar drugs, the company
reported. Much of the data from the individual studies was
reported previously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve deaths were reported among 3,030 patients who took
the drug, compared with 1 death among 681 taking a placebo and 1
death among 204 patients on Humira across the Phase 3 studies
completed by Pfizer. Patients spent more time on tofacitinib
than Humira or placebo and deaths per amount of time spent on
the drugs were statistically similar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious Infections &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients taking tofacitinib were more likely to have
serious infections compared with Humira or placebo. There were
0.029 infectious for every year a patient was taking the Pfizer
pill, compared with 0.015 infections for placebo and 0.017 on
Humira. In at least one trial, infection rates were greater for
those taking the higher of two possible doses of tofacitinib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease in which the
immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing
inflammation in and around joints. Treatments suppress the
immune system and can increase vulnerability to infection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shots known as anti-TNF therapy are standard care for the
80 percent of patients who don&#8217;t respond to methotrexate, a
generic drug that can block cell growth in people with certain
cancers and immune disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib would add to Pfizer&#8217;s recently expanded
offerings in pain and inflammation. The company gained the
arthritis remedy Enbrel in the $68 billion purchase of Wyeth in
2009. The medicine was Pfizer&#8217;s second-best seller last year
with $3.3 billion in revenue. The drugmaker bought King
Pharmaceuticals Inc. last year for about $3.3 billion to add
additional painkillers to its range of products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is counting on revenue from its arthritis pill to
help offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol
drug, with $10.7 billion in annual sales, faces competition
beginning in November from cheaper copies in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said selling
Italian and Spanish bonds along with bank stocks and debt, and
buying dollars and gold may provide the best protection against
the &#8220;very unlikely&#8221; risk of a euro-area collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are formidable barriers to break-up, which make it
less likely, but also mean it would be more disruptive if it did
occur,&#8221; Seamus Mac Gorain, a strategist in London, wrote in an
investor report yesterday. &#8220;The financial turmoil and economic
impact would be most pronounced in the euro area, arguing for
broad underweight euro-area equity and credit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on U.S. and German 10-year bonds fell to records
this week and gold reached a fresh high as investors sought the
safest assets amid concern policy makers aren&#8217;t doing enough to
prevent the spread of financial-market tension from the euro
area. That&#8217;s prompting economists to study worst-case scenarios,
with UBS AG saying two days ago that the euro doesn&#8217;t work under
its current structure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales of Italian and Spanish bonds versus benchmark German
bunds may provide an &#8220;efficient hedge,&#8221; along with betting the
euro will fall against the dollar and buying gold, JPMorgan&#8217;s
Mac Gorain wrote. Owning less euro-area bank equities and credit
securities than benchmarks used to track performance would also
offer protection, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian 10-year bonds rose a third day, pushing the yield
down five basis points to 5.21 percent as of 11:03 a.m. in
London. The rate fell to as low as 4.87 percent on Aug. 18 as
the European Central Bank was said to begin purchasing the debt
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The only way to hedge against a euro break-up scenario is
to own no euro assets at all,&#8221; UBS economists including
Stephane Deo wrote in their Sept. 6 report. The cost of a
potential collapse makes it &#8220;close to zero probability,&#8221; and
&#8220;the growth consequences are awful in any break-up scenario,&#8221;
they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carol Bartz&#8217;s ouster is giving

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, the most-visited U.S. Web portal, fired Bartz on
Sept. 6, after less than three years as chief executive officer.
Once an $80 billion company, Yahoo has fallen 89 percent as it
lost Internet users and advertising revenue to Google Inc. (GOOG) and

&lt;p&gt;While Yahoo&#8217;s revenue has declined in the past two years,
its cash and investments in Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan Corp. (4689)
account for about 80 percent of the company&#8217;s capitalization,
according to Gabelli  Co. Putting Yahoo up for sale could
entice Alibaba Group Chairman Jack Ma, who may want to regain
the stake he sold six years ago, as well as Microsoft and AOL
Inc. (AOL), according to Jefferies Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve got to sell the company, break it up, do
something,&#8221; Brett Harriss, an analyst with Rye, New York-based
Gabelli, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Many would argue that
Alibaba Group is the majority of the value of Yahoo. Ma
certainly knows Alibaba Group better than Yahoo and so he&#8217;s in a
position to make a pretty good bid. There&#8217;s enough value there
that something&#8217;s got to happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Rubey, a spokeswoman for Sunnyvale, California-based
Yahoo, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail or telephone call seeking
comment on whether it would consider selling itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;No Fast Fixes&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo may sell its stakes in Alibaba Group and Yahoo Japan
instead of putting the company up for sale, according to a
person familiar with the thinking of Yahoo&#8217;s board, who wasn&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are no fast fixes,&#8221; Colin Gillis, an analyst for
BGC Partners Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;There are plenty of assets on the book, but freeing those
assets is a lengthy process and it has risks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo climbed 5.4 percent yesterday after Bartz,
63, who took over as CEO in January 2009, said in a memo to
staff that she was terminated by Chairman Roy Bostock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo said in a statement that Chief Financial Officer Tim Morse would become interim CEO, replacing Bartz, and decided to
review options for its businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Founded in 1994 by Jerry Yang and David Filo at Stanford
University, Yahoo aggregates news, offers free e-mail and
provides services that help users do everything from finding a
new house to landing a date. It also competes with Google for
users searching the Internet for information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Internet Search &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the dominant search engine, Yahoo&#8217;s share of the U.S.
online ad market is now projected to drop to 9.7 percent next
year from 16 percent in 2009, according to New York-based firm
EMarketer Inc. Mountain View, California-based Google&#8217;s will
climb to 45 percent, while Facebook will more than triple its
portion of the online ad market to 7.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo&#8217;s sales last quarter fell short of estimates as an
overhaul of the U.S. sales force made it harder to close deals
and slowed growth in advertising for banner ads and video clips.
Bartz said at the time that sales were held back as more
employees left during the overhaul than Yahoo anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Bartz, shareholders of Yahoo also lost out to Google.
The owner of the world&#8217;s largest Internet-search engine advanced
66 percent, almost doubling the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index&#8217;s 34
percent gain. Yahoo rose just 6.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youssef Squali, a New York-based analyst at Jefferies, said
in a report to clients yesterday that Bartz&#8217;s departure means
that Yahoo will sell itself before a permanent CEO is announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Daunting Task&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company faces a &#8220;daunting task&#8221; in attracting a
capable successor, while investors may be unwilling to wait for
a turnaround under new leadership, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve had a number of years to try to play out their
business model, and it doesn&#8217;t appear to be gaining much
traction,&#8221; Jack Ablin, who helps oversee $60 billion as chief
investment officer for Chicago-based Harris Private Bank, said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;The time for Yahoo to be picky is
over. Yahoo may be forced to take what they can get.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabelli estimates that Yahoo&#8217;s Asian assets and its cash
are worth almost as much as the company itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo holds about 40 percent of Alibaba Group, China&#8217;s
biggest e-commerce company. Through that investment, Yahoo owns
stakes in Taobao.com, China&#8217;s largest Internet shopping site,
and Alibaba.com, which offers e-commerce services for businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Sum of Parts &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using earnings estimates for 2012, Gabelli&#8217;s Harriss said
the Alibaba businesses are worth $3 a share, while Yahoo&#8217;s 35
percent ownership of Yahoo Japan, the Tokyo-based operator of
Japan&#8217;s most-visited web portal, is valued at $5.22 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add Yahoo&#8217;s cash and the pieces may be worth about $11 a
share -- without accounting for its U.S. operations, based on
Harriss&#8217;s sum-of-the-parts analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Di Zhou, a Santa Fe, New Mexico-based analyst at Thornburg
Investment Management, which oversees about $80 billion, is even
more bullish and estimates Yahoo&#8217;s Asian investments may sell
for more than $15 a share. The stock ended yesterday at $13.61. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The valuation gap may persuade Alibaba Group&#8217;s Ma to
acquire Yahoo to regain the stake that he sold in 2005 as
Internet use in China surges and Taobao.com mulls a public
listing, according to Herman Leung, a San Francisco-based
analyst for Susquehanna International Group LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taobao.com accounts for 90 percent of China&#8217;s consumer e-commerce market, which may generate almost $100 billion in
transactions this year, according to Michael Clendenin, managing
director at research company RedTech Advisors in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Alibaba Bids &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bartz had turned down Alibaba&#8217;s bids to buy back stock held
by Yahoo, saying she wanted &#8220;the most value&#8221; from a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susquehanna&#8217;s Leung says that Alibaba Group&#8217;s Ma could team
up with private equity firms to buy Yahoo, with the buyout firms
retaining its U.S. operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jack Ma has made it no secret that he wants that stake
back,&#8221; Leung said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It makes a lot of
sense. There&#8217;s an option to buy the whole company with private-equity support.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Spelich, a spokesman for Alibaba in Hong Kong, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft, which can buy Yahoo at
less than half what it offered in 2008, may also be interested,
Leung said. AOL, the New York-based Internet company that&#8217;s
suffered almost $800 million in net losses in less than two
years, could partner with Yahoo as well, according to Laura Martin, an analyst at New York-based Needham  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shareholder Interest &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer McCarthy, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said it
doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors or speculation. AOL&#8217;s Graham James
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a telephone call or e-mail seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board is definitely under some pressure to show that
they&#8217;re actually acting in shareholder interest,&#8221; Ken Sena, an
analyst at New York-based Evercore Partners Inc., said in an
interview yesterday with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s
&#8220;Surveillance Midday.&#8221; &#8220;The fact that they made this
announcement without a CEO in mind signals they are open to
possibilities. I&#8217;m sure that a breakup or sale is among those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York City commuters would rather
sleep, spend time with their families or exercise than fight
traffic, according to an annual survey by International Business
Machines Corp. (IBM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York ranked No. 15 for having the most painful commute
in the survey, which ranks the emotional and economic toil of
commuting. Mexico City ranked the worst, a spot it tied for last
year with Beijing. The survey was released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the survey asked commuters what they&#8217;d rather be doing
than being stuck in traffic, 23 percent of New Yorkers said
working, up from 10 percent last year. Forty-nine percent said
exercise, 39 percent said sleep more and 54 percent said spend
more time with family, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In terms of their frustrations and stress, it&#8217;s generally
higher than it was last year,&#8221; Naveen Lamba, leader of IBM&#8217;s
Intelligent Transportation practice, said in a telephone
interview of the survey&#8217;s findings. &#8220;Despite reducing volumes,
you&#8217;re seeing the pain of the commute, so to speak,
increasing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average typical one-way commute in Mexico City was 40
minutes. Of drivers surveyed, 57 percent said they&#8217;d been stuck
in roadway traffic for two hours or more during the past three
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For surveyed New Yorkers, the average typical commute was
30 minutes. The index&#8217;s average of 20 cities was 33 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city with the least painful commute was Montreal,
according to the survey. The daily one-way commute on average in
the Canadian city last year was 29 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing&#8217;s ranking improved over last year&#8217;s survey to third
worst, behind Shenzhen to the south, near Hong Kong. IBM said
the Chinese government spent 80 billion yuan ($12.5 billion)
last year to improve transportation infrastructure in the
Chinese capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peruvian President Ollanta Humala
will stem rising production of coca leaf that has made the
country the world&#8217;s largest exporter of cocaine, using crop
eradication he&#8217;s previously criticized, the Andean nation&#8217;s new
drug czar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru will increase spending 20 percent next year, step up
drug seizures and tighten controls on chemicals used to process
cocaine, said Ricardo Soberon, who was named last month to head
the nation&#8217;s counter narcotics agency, known as Devida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government suspended an eradication program last month,
sparking concern Humala planned to enact pledges during his
election campaign to end forced eradication at the expense of
reduced foreign aid. Soberon said the pause, which lasted about
a week, was necessary as the government weighs a new drug
strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humala will implement a &#8220;sustainable&#8221; eradication program
that replaces coca, a native plant whose leaves are used to make
cocaine, with alternative crops such as coffee and cocoa,
Soberon told reporters in Lima today. Soberon, himself a critic
of eradication in the past, said the government will contribute
more to the fight against drug-trafficking as foreign aid
declines, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative Crops &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Crop reduction must be definitive, which means replacing
coca with an economically viable alternative,&#8221; said Soberon, a
lawyer and expert on drug policy. &#8220;This problem is well beyond
our ability to confront alone so we&#8217;re worried about the trend
of declining international aid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peru rivals Colombia as the world&#8217;s largest producer of
coca leaf after land dedicated to production of the crop rose
2.2 percent to 61,200 hectares in 2010, according to the United
Nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Colombia produces twice as much cocaine as Peru, the
country&#8217;s 50 percent seizure rate limits the amount available
for export, Julio Castro, Soberon&#8217;s chief adviser, said in an
interview in Lima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money laundering has increased to about $4.3 billion a year
in Peru compared with $3.5 billion 18 months ago, the banking
regulator said Sept. 7. Drug trafficking accounts for about 80
percent of the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opposition lawmakers this week called for Soberon&#8217;s
resignation saying his previous opposition to eradication as a
means of fighting drug-trafficking makes him unfit for the job. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Nathan Gill" date="Sep 09, 2011 12:14 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-09/ecuador-s-biess-in-talks-with-citigroup-jpmorgan-for-bond-sale.html"><headline>Ecuador State Fund Balks at 12% Rate Sought by Banks in Bond Market Return</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The banking arm of Ecuador&#8217;s state-
run pension fund is in talks with banks including Citigroup Inc. (C)
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to help manage a $200-million foreign
bond sale next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco del Instituto Ecuatoriano de Seguridad Social, which
will use the notes to boost spending on local infrastructure
projects and lending to members, said the banks are recommending
an &#8220;impossible&#8221; interest rate of 12 percent, while BIESS is
seeking no more than 9 percent, Chief Executive Officer Efrain Vieira said yesterday in an interview at his offices in Quito. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds would be the first notes sold in international
markets by a government agency since Ecuador defaulted on $3.2
billion of debt three years ago. Vieira, who manages about $7.57
billion for the country&#8217;s biggest institutional investor, said
the banks want higher yields because of the perceived risk of
investing in Ecuador, where the United Nations estimates about
40 percent of the population can&#8217;t meet basic needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sale would allow Ecuador to reintegrate with
international markets,&#8221; said Vieira, a 47-year-old electrical
engineer, who was named CEO last year after winning a public
merit contest. &#8220;The banks want 12 percent, which is too
expensive for me. It&#8217;s impossible to sell at that rate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup&#8217;s press office in Miami and JPMorgan spokeswoman
Lauren Francis in New York didn&#8217;t immediately respond today to
telephone messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar-Bond Yields &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Ecuador&#8217;s dollar bonds maturing in 2015 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.64 percent at
12:02 p.m. New York time, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield has declined 233 basis points this year,
while the price has gained 8.6 cents to 99.08 cents on the
dollar. The country&#8217;s bonds on average yield 881 basis points
more than U.S. Treasuries, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s EMBI+ index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIESS also is reducing its Ecuadorean government bond
holdings to help spur trading for the notes in the country&#8217;s
local market, Vieira said. The bank has sold $352 million so far
this year and plans an additional $328 million sale immediately,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a change of policy,&#8221; Vieira said. &#8220;Before, the
fund waited for the paper to mature. Now the plan is to help
generate a secondary market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a shortage of government debt on the local market
after the central bank in July passed rules forcing financial
companies to hold part of their reserves in public debt, Cesar Robalino, executive president of the nation&#8217;s private bank
association, said in an Aug. 24 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International Financing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecuador&#8217;s government has relied on financing from China and
multilateral lenders like the Inter-American Development Bank as
well as loans from the state pension fund to help cover budget
deficits since the default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Rafael Correa stopped payments on $3.2 billion in
bonds starting in December 2008, saying the securities were
&#8220;illegitimate&#8221; and &#8220;illegal.&#8221; The government&#8217;s 2015 dollar
bonds were the only global notes Correa kept servicing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BIESS also is limiting purchases of debt from Ecuadorean
companies with high import levels in a bid to support a
government plan to boost the country&#8217;s trade surplus, Vieira
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank plans to increase its holdings of securities sold
by Holcim Ecuador SA, the local unit of Holcim Ltd., the world&#8217;s
second-biggest cement producer, and supermarket chain Corp. La
Favorita CA, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnering with international banks would give the foreign
bond sale &#8220;more weight,&#8221; Vieira said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The goal is to do something different,&#8221; he said. Help
from foreign banks should give the bonds &#8220;much more weight and
protection and they will be much more enticing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthony Scaramucci fist bumps
investors as he makes his way through a poolside party at the
Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas on a May evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the Mooch!&#8221; someone shouts. Scaramucci, a Harvard
Law School graduate who flunked the New York bar exam twice and
was fired from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) in 1991, is exactly
where he wants to be: playing host to the hedge-fund industry as
it surges past $2 trillion in global assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci is the creator and ringmaster of the SkyBridge
Alternatives Conference, known as SALT, the largest annual
symposium and schmoozefest for hedge-fund managers and investors
in the U.S. For three days in May, more than 1,750 investment
professionals soaked up market insights from industry stars
Steven A. Cohen, Leon Cooperman and Kenneth Griffin;
geopolitical observations from Colin Powell and Gordon Brown;
and sports talk from New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan,
Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its October issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the poolside gala capping the opening day, young women
in cocktail dresses play air hockey. Across the patio, men smoke
freshly rolled Dominican cigars. Jugglers, mimes and an Italian
clown riding a unicycle weave their way between revelers sipping
drinks and feasting on roasted pork. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Can you believe this?&#8221; Scaramucci, 47, says, savoring
the festivities he&#8217;s organized. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to use the skill
set God has given you, and I have the ability to connect with
people. I was made to do this stuff.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Influential Friends &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Anthony Scaramucci show. Two years ago, he
was a little-known money manager facing the failure of his New
York-based funds of hedge funds, SkyBridge Capital LLC,
following the worst financial crisis in decades. Scaramucci
swiftly recovered and catapulted himself into the center of the
hedge-fund world through unabashed self-promotion and his gift
for forging relationships with influential figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His friends range from Michael Milken, who helped debut the
first SALT conference in 2009, to movie director Oliver Stone,
who gave Scaramucci a cameo as a short seller in his 2010 sequel
Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps. Former President George W. Bush, the keynote speaker at this year&#8217;s conference, even
nicknamed his dapper host &#8220;Gucci Scaramucci.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anthony is a likable, self-promotional, street-smart kid
who understands the tremendous opportunity for growth in the
hedge-fund industry as the world grows more volatile,&#8221; says
Cooperman, 68, the billionaire founder of Omega Advisors Inc. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass Affluent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all of the attention Scaramucci is attracting, he&#8217;s
pushing an investment model -- funds of hedge funds -- that has
lost assets and credibility since the credit crisis. SkyBridge,
which manages $2.8 billion in assets, is aiming its funds of
funds at so-called mass affluent investors. They are households
with a net worth of $100,000 to $1 million not counting their
primary residence, according to the Spectrem Group, a Lake
Forest, Illinois-based research firm that analyzes wealth
trends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only 3 percent of the 36 million mass affluent investors in
the U.S. commit money to hedge funds, Spectrem says. With
volatility in equities and fixed-income markets exploding in the
wake of Standard  Poor&#8217;s downgrade of the U.S. credit rating on
Aug. 5, Scaramucci is betting more mass affluent will plunge
into short selling securities, fixed-income arbitrage and other
sophisticated trades to grow their nest eggs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraught With Challenges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to be the Peter Lynch of the hedge-fund
industry,&#8221; Scaramucci says, referring to the Fidelity
Investments money manager and TV spokesman who helped popularize
mutual-fund investing in the 1980s and 1990s. &#8220;I want to make
hedge-fund investing approachable to the average American
investor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funds-of-funds approach is fraught with challenges,
says Deirdre Nectow, managing director for business development
at Cambridge Associates LLC, a Boston-based investment
consulting firm. Bernard Madoff&#8217;s $20 billion Ponzi scheme
revealed that some funds of funds failed to detect how he had
faked his performance for more than 20 years as they had
channeled millions of dollars of their clients&#8217; money into his
firm. While Madoff is a unique case, the difficulty of
researching the practices of dozens of managers that typically
comprise a fund of funds has left investors wary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have 30 to 35 managers in one fund, but if one is a
Madoff you have a problem,&#8221; says Nectow, who advises many
clients to invest directly into hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layer on Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds of funds disgorged $2 billion in capital in the
second quarter as investors withdrew from the category,
according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. In contrast,
investors poured $29 billion directly into hedge funds, which
are on course to record their highest net asset inflows since
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there are the costs. Investors have to pay funds of
funds a management fee on top of the typical 2 percent on assets
and 20 percent of profits hedge funds charge. SkyBridge asks 1.5
percent annually and no performance fees, and its clients may
have to pay brokers a one-time placement fee of up to 3 percent.
Funds of funds mostly haven&#8217;t delivered on those higher costs:
The SP 500 Index (SPX)&#8217;s 2.4 percent average annual gain in the five
years ended on July 31 beat the HFRI Funds of Funds index&#8217;s 1.7
percent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you layer on the fees, you&#8217;re just guaranteeing a
lower return,&#8221; says Janet Tavakoli, founder of Tavakoli
Structured Finance Inc., a Chicago investment advisory firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci has had some success attracting well-off
investors who aren&#8217;t super-rich. About two-thirds of the 13,000
investors in SkyBridge&#8217;s funds of funds are mass affluent
households and high-net-worth individuals, says Ray Nolte, a
SkyBridge managing partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Aggressive &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in the firm&#8217;s $1.7 billion flagship, the
SkyBridge Multi-Adviser Hedge Fund Portfolios LLC, have to
qualify as accredited investors with a net worth of $1 million
under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. The fund of
funds has a minimum threshold investment of only $25,000, and
SkyBridge sells it through Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, Bank of
America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit and other retail brokerages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see mass affluent households starting to loosen up and
become more aggressive with their risk tolerance,&#8221; says Thomas
Wynn, a director at Spectrem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SkyBridge offers investors entr&#233;e to top-shelf managers
they may not have the influence or wealth to reach on their own.
Led by Portfolio Manager Troy Gayeski, the firm&#8217;s flagship fund
commits 8.5 percent of its investments to Don Brownstein&#8217;s
Structured Servicing Holdings LP. It bets on the spreads between
mortgage-backed securities and was the top-performing hedge fund
in Bloomberg Markets&#8217; annual ranking this year, with a 49.5
percent return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex and Risky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SkyBridge puts 8.1 percent of its flagship fund&#8217;s assets in
Daniel Loeb&#8217;s Third Point Ultra, which exploits price swings in
securities linked to mergers and acquisitions, and another 5.9
percent in John Paulson&#8217;s Recovery portfolio, which hedges
dollar-linked risk by being denominated in gold. SkyBridge also
invests in Passport Capital LLC&#8217;s Global Strategy fund, which
focuses on commodities producers. SkyBridge&#8217;s flagship fund is
up 6.3 percent this year through June 30 compared with a 6
percent rise for the SP 500 in that period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SkyBridge&#8217;s Multi-Adviser fund is far more complex and
risky than the typical actively managed mutual fund, Tavakoli
says. SkyBridge concentrates about a third of its assets in five
funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities, including
tranches of subprime home loans originated during the housing
boom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well Protected &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SkyBridge doesn&#8217;t use leverage itself, some of its
fund managers do to bolster returns. And SkyBridge says in its
quarterly reports that its flagship fund is &#8220;highly illiquid&#8221;
because, like many hedge funds, the firm reserves the right not
to redeem its clients&#8217; money upon request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tavakoli says such a fund is too perilous for investors who
can&#8217;t afford to lose $25,000. &#8220;They should run far away from
this kind of strategy,&#8221; she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci and Nolte counter that by spreading bets among
41 managers, some of whom pursue strategies designed to go up
when U.S. equities markets drop, they&#8217;re delivering a hedge many
investors want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if one or two managers lose their way, we are still
well protected,&#8221; Scaramucci says. Nolte says the firm&#8217;s clients
want SkyBridge to make big bets on their favorite trades, such
as mortgages, and not simply match market performance. &#8220;When we
have a strong conviction on an idea, we will put more risk on,&#8221;
Nolte says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Dinner &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci uses his SALT conference -- and its A-list
lineup of speakers -- to burnish the SkyBridge brand. At the
2011 event, Scaramucci threw a private dinner for Bush, who
pocketed $175,000 for his off-the-record talk earlier in the
evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milken, Cohen and other friends of Scaramucci&#8217;s joined the
former president for a four-course meal featuring filet mignon
and Yorkshire pudding slathered in black truffle gravy. Asked if
he took the seat at Bush&#8217;s right hand, Scaramucci guffawed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What, are you kidding me? I&#8217;m a sales guy: I put my best
client next to the president, and he was in heaven,&#8221; he says in
the staccato rhythm of his native Long Island, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci promotes SkyBridge in the media too. He makes
regular appearances as a stock picker on CNBC, and spent more
than $100,000 to place the SkyBridge logo in a scene in Stone&#8217;s
second Wall Street drama featuring Gordon Gekko, the insider-
trading felon played by Michael Douglas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Like a Pinata&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a nationally televised town hall meeting in Manhattan on
Sept. 20, 2010, Scaramucci challenged President Barack Obama to
lay off of Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have felt like a pinata,&#8221; he complained to the
president. The following evening, Jon Stewart, the host of the
news satire program The Daily Show, lampooned Scaramucci as a
&#8220;Jersey Shore breakout star&#8221; who&#8217;s oblivious to the country&#8217;s
outrage at bailing out big banks. Scaramucci was so giddy to be
the target of Stewart&#8217;s wit that he sent the clip of the
comedian to his friends and clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hedge funds have long kept their heads down and let their
performance and reputations do the talking for them, but this
guy seems to be operating outside of the model entirely,&#8221; says
Charles Geisst, a financial historian and author of Wall Street:
A History (Oxford University Press, 1997). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A youthful man with wavy brown hair and matinee idol looks,
Scaramucci does have a salesman&#8217;s smooth touch. He peppers his
conversation with offers to perform favors -- &#8220;What do you
need?&#8221; -- and is fond of slipping his arm around your shoulder
and giving it a squeeze to make a point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Raise Some Money&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the first day of the SALT conference, Scaramucci is
decked out in a gray, custom-made Loro Piana suit, a pink shirt
and pink striped necktie. He&#8217;s walking down a crowded hall in
the Bellagio&#8217;s convention center greeting attendees when a money
manager approaches and offers his hand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is off the charts, Anthony, off the charts,&#8221; he
says. Scaramucci grins and wraps his arm around his new friend
without breaking stride. &#8220;Look, why don&#8217;t you try and raise
some money for yourself while you&#8217;re here?&#8221; Scaramucci says.
&#8220;I know a guy last year who raised a lot of assets from new
clients at SALT.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci possesses the trader&#8217;s love of profanity and
off-color jokes. He regaled a group of money managers at SALT
with a story of how he spoke with a roomful of wealthy Jewish
investors in Palm Beach, Florida, in early 2009 after many of
them had lost their fortunes to Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invest with an Italian &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So I told them: Always invest with an Italian. They like
cash businesses, and an Italian will only steal as much as he
can fit in the trunk of his car in cash,&#8221; he said. The money
managers crack up as their host flashes a wide smile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci is equally at home talking about complex trading
strategies. At a dinner he hosted at the Four Seasons during
SALT, Scaramucci led a discussion with economist Nouriel Roubini
on how Federal Reserve policy and Europe&#8217;s debt woes were
impacting capital markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He comes across as Vinnie Barbarino, but it masks how
smart and thoughtful he really is,&#8221; says Brett Messing, a
Harvard Law friend, referring to a wisecracking TV character
played by John Travolta in the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci grew up in Port Washington, a middle-class town
on the north shore of Long Island. His parents are second-
generation Italians, and his father Alexander labored in the
construction industry for 42 years. As a teenager, Scaramucci
spent afternoons helping out at his uncle Sal&#8217;s Harley-Davidson
shop. He wasn&#8217;t allowed to ride motorcycles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Action and Riches &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My father said, &#8216;We&#8217;re going to put $100,000 of education
into your brain, so I don&#8217;t want it on the pavement,&#8217;&#8221; says
Scaramucci, who drove a 1979 Chevrolet Camaro Berlinetta
instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University
in Medford, Massachusetts, in 1986, with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in
economics. Three years later, he earned his Harvard Law degree.
He found legal work to be mind numbing and failed to put in the
study needed to pass the New York bar exam until his third try.
He never did practice law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawn to the action and riches of Wall Street, he was
ecstatic when he landed a perch in Goldman&#8217;s real-estate
investment-banking unit in August 1989. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Your goal here is to not get fired,&#8221; Robert Rubin, a
Goldman partner who would serve as U.S. Treasury secretary from
1995 to 1999, told Scaramucci&#8217;s training class, Scaramucci
recalls. By the end of his first year, Scaramucci knew he didn&#8217;t
have the analytical skills or patience to unpack complex
property deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humbling Moment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I sucked at it,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the property market contracted in 1991, real-estate
head Michael Fascitelli fired Scaramucci as part of a cost-
cutting move. It was a humbling moment for the would-be Wall
Street player. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fascitelli liked Scaramucci and helped him get a job in
Goldman&#8217;s equities group. In 1994, he transferred to the private
wealth management unit, where he was responsible for building a
book of rich investing clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was very hungry, and I thought he could shine in an
area where he could use his people skills,&#8221; says Fascitelli,
who&#8217;s now chief executive officer of Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By 1995, Scaramucci, then 31, had more than 300 clients and
was producing $4.5 million in gross commissions and pocketing
more than $1 million a year in compensation. The next year, he
quit to co-found a hedge fund called Oscar Capital Management
LLC with fellow Goldman alum Andrew Boszhardt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future in Doubt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They built Oscar up to $800 million in assets and brought
in billionaire PC maker Michael Dell as a minority stakeholder
in the firm. After the dot-com crash hurt Oscar&#8217;s performance in
2000 and 2001, they sold the firm to Neuberger Berman Group
Inc., a New York asset management firm and brokerage, which was
in turn acquired by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later, Scaramucci struck out on his own again. He
set up SkyBridge as a &#8220;seeding&#8221; firm that invested in startup
hedge funds similar to the way venture capitalists back tech
entrepreneurs. He raised $300 million and invested in nine
fledgling hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the recession struck in 2008, SkyBridge rapidly lost a
fifth of its value and Scaramucci criss-crossed the country
trying to persuade clients not to withdraw from his fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By May 2009, Scaramucci says, SkyBridge&#8217;s future was in
doubt. At the time, financial firms were canceling conferences
in Las Vegas out of concern it would look bad to party in Sin
City as taxpayers bailed out Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing Anxious &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci had no such qualms. He decided to host his first
hedge-fund extravaganza at Encore at Wynn, one of the priciest
hotels on the Strip. &#8220;I wanted to let people know we were still
alive,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci needed more than a three-day party in Vegas to
save his ailing firm. He recognized that the U.S. Treasury,
which injected $45 billion into Citigroup Inc. (C) after it almost
collapsed, was pressing CEO Vikram Pandit to unload peripheral
businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci arranged in late 2009 to meet Nolte, then CEO of
the hedge-fund management group in Citi&#8217;s alternative-investing
unit, which included funds of funds. Nolte, a buttoned-down
money manager with the demeanor of a college professor, told
Scaramucci that he was growing anxious as Citi pondered whether
to shed his division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were going to wither and die until Citi decided what
to do with us,&#8221; Nolte says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against the Odds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2010, Citi agreed to sell the business to
SkyBridge and Nolte, and his 23-member investment team joined
forces with Scaramucci. SkyBridge made a nominal upfront payment
and agreed to share a portion of its asset management fees with
Citi for three years, according to a person familiar with the
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return, Scaramucci got $1.6 billion in assets, four
institutional investors and more than 7,000 mass affluent and
high-net-worth clients. &#8220;Anthony pulled off something that was
totally against the odds,&#8221; Fascitelli says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second day of this year&#8217;s SALT gathering, Scaramucci
is chatting with one of his old bosses, Jon Corzine, Goldman&#8217;s
co-chairman from 1994 to 1999. Scaramucci says he&#8217;s still
mortified by the time in 1996 when he ran into Corzine and his
first wife, Joanne, at Henry Cipriani, a Midtown Manhattan
restaurant, and accidentally knocked a bottle of water off their
table and onto their laps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top Fundraiser &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corzine, who lost his bid for re-election as New Jersey&#8217;s
governor in 2009, laughs and tells him to forget about it.
&#8220;Anthony, you&#8217;re one of the only guys to leave Goldman Sachs
and do well,&#8221; says Corzine, now CEO of New York futures broker
MF Global Holdings Ltd. (MF) &#8220;I lose elections!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scaramucci has become the Wall Street player he aspired to
be when he first landed at Goldman some 22 years ago. He
entertains clients in his luxury suite at Citi Field, home of
his beloved New York Mets. And he&#8217;s a top fundraiser for Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts who&#8217;s seeking the
Republican nomination for president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s hit his stride not through his record as a money
manager, which even he admits is lackluster. Rather, it&#8217;s his
networking chops and friendships with Wall Street&#8217;s elite that
have won him the spotlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would make him the trustee for my estate not because
he&#8217;s a brilliant investor but because he would do the right
thing for my family, says Robert Matza, a former president of
Neuberger Berman and now president of GoldenTree Asset
Management LP, a New York hedge fund. &#8220;I trust him.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales Job &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SkyBridge has attracted $1 billion in new inflows since it
absorbed Citi&#8217;s funds-of-funds unit on July 1, 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Performance isn&#8217;t what beats a path to your door,&#8221; says
Robert Nichols, founder of Windward Capital Management Co., a
Los Angeles-based firm with $250 million in assets. &#8220;It&#8217;s sales
and marketing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peddling high-risk funds of funds to the upper-middle class
will be a major struggle -- and just the kind of sales job that
Scaramucci relishes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) said it got
assurances from Samsung Electronics Co. that Japan&#8217;s largest
phone operator will be able to continue selling the Galaxy
tablet in the country amid a patent dispute with Apple Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Samsung told us there won&#8217;t be any problem for the sale&#8221;
of the Galaxy devices, NTT President Ryuji Yamada told reporters
in Tokyo yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple filed a suit against Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy tablet computer
in Tokyo on Aug. 23, seeking compensation for alleged patent
violations, Nam Ki-Yung, a Samsung spokesman in Seoul, said by
telephone. The two companies&#8217; patent dispute is now being waged
across three continents as Apple claims the Galaxy devices
copied its iPhone and iPad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first hearing over the latest dispute took place Sept.
7 in Tokyo District Court, according to Samsung&#8217;s Nam. Kyodo
News reported that Apple wants 100 million yen ($1.3 million) in
damages from Suwon, South Korea-based Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nam and Takashi Takebayashi, an Apple spokesman in Japan&#8217;s
capital, both declined to comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The patent situation is different here from Europe,&#8221;
Yamada said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung had about a 16 percent share in the tablet market
in the first quarter, trailing the iPad&#8217;s 69 percent, according
to Strategy Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan Patents Valid, Infringed by Teva, Judge Decides &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan Inc.&#8217;s patents for the glaucoma treatment Lumigan
are valid and are infringed by Israel&#8217;s Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries Ltd. (TEVA), a federal judge ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan, the maker of wrinkle-smoothing Botox, sued Teva&#8217;s
Barr Laboratories unit in 2009 over the two patents and a non-
jury trial was held in January and February, according to court
papers. In dispute were patents 5,688,819 and 6,403,649. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration in December 2009 to sell a prescription drug
using the same ingredients as Lumigen to make eyelashes thicker
and darker. Allergan, based in Irvine, California, sells that
product under the Latisse label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Allergan has met its burden&#8221; to prove Teva&#8217;s proposed
generic Lumigan infringes, and the defendants &#8220;have not proven
by clear and convincing evidence&#8221; that the patents are
invalid,&#8221; wrote U.S. District Judge Sue L. Robinson in
yesterday&#8217;s opinion released in Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, with $16.1 billion in
sales last year, is the world&#8217;s largest generic drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise Bradley, a U.S. spokeswoman for Teva, said the
company has no comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest of the patents expires in 2014, according to FDA
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Allergan Inc. v. Barr Laboratories Inc.,
09CV333, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Acer Sign Patent License Pact for Tablets, Phones &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. signed a patent-license deal with Acer Inc. (2353)
covering the Taiwanese computer maker&#8217;s tablets and phones,
which use Google Inc.&#8217;s Android platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based software maker disclosed the
agreement in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has entered into more than 700 licensing
agreements since the company began its intellectual-property
licensing program in December 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall Phelps joined Microsoft in 2003 after a 28-year
career with International Business Machines Corp., where he was
vice president for intellectual property and licensing. There he
was credited with pioneering the patent monetization business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phelps helped Microsoft move toward viewing patents as an
asset that could make money or be used as a bargaining chip with
other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myhrvold Seeks U.S. Patents on Hurricane-Prevention Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Myhrvold, the former chief technology officer at
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), applied for six patents on a technology aimed
at preventing hurricanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six applications, published in the database of the U.S.
patent and Trademark Office, cover what he calls a &#8220;water
alteration structure and system having heat transfer conduit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology covered by the patent would lower the
temperature of the ocean through the use of myriad floating
devices with a downward conduit. As waves wash over the edges of
the device, warmer surface water is pushed downward, lowering
the water&#8217;s surface temperature, according to the patent
applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurricanes originate over tropical or subtropical waters
and lose much of their energy over colder waters, according to
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The applications were filed between January 2008 and May
2009. In addition to Myhrvold, Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill
Gates is also listed as an inventor, as are a number of
scientists who consult with or are part of Myhrvold&#8217;s
Intellectual Ventures invention company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Demands Chinese Noodle Company Change Its Logo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) objected to a logo used by a Chinese company
that produces noodles and flour, the GoChengDoo.com English-
language news website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sichuan Fangguo Food Go Ltd. was accused of using
conceptual elements in its logo that were taken from Cupertino,
California-based Apple, according to GoChengDoo.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhao Yi, chief executive officer of the noodle company,
said his company&#8217;s apple logo contains two Chinese characters
and is a totally different shape from the California company&#8217;s,
according to the website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons Apple objected, GoChengDoo.com reported,
is that the noodle company&#8217;s trademark application covered 16
different product categories, including &#8220;notebook computers&#8221;
and &#8220;electronic-game software,&#8221; which overlap some of the
California company&#8217;s product categories. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Book-Scanning Lawsuit Is Dropped by French Publishers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three French publishers dropped a 9.8 million-euro ($13.8
million) lawsuit against Google Inc. (GOOG) over books scanned by the
search-engine company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Editions Albin Michel SA, Editions Gallimard SA and
Flammarion made the decision in order to resume negotiations to
reach a deal on scanning copyright-protected works for Google&#8217;s
digital library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Google suspended negotiations&#8221; when the suit was filed,
Brice Amor, Gallimard&#8217;s legal director, said yesterday. The
publishers dropped their claims &#8220;with the goal that the
negotiations might resume.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, has reached
agreements with Lagardere SCA (MMB)&#8217;s Hachette Livre and La Martiniere
Groupe publishers to allow the scanning of out-of-print French
books since losing a copyright dispute with the latter in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a great news,&#8221; Philippe Colombet, Google Books&#8217;
French director, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We are keen to discuss
constructively and work with publishers around the world to
preserve and disseminate our important cultural treasures, and
to find new business opportunities for authors and publishers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was earlier reported on the website of trade
publication Livres Hebdo. Calls to Albin Michel and Flammarion
for comment weren&#8217;t immediately returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP&#8217;s Former Unit Criminally Charged for Oracle Downloads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP AG (SAP)&#8217;s former TomorrowNow software-maintenance unit was
criminally charged by the U.S. for downloading Oracle Inc.
programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP, which shut the Bryan, Texas-based unit in 2008,
reached an agreement with the Justice Department resolving the
charges, Jim Dever, a SAP spokesman, said yesterday in a
telephone interview. A confidential plea agreement was filed in
court and isn&#8217;t yet public, he said, without disclosing any
penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any fine would be paid by SAP,&#8221; Dever said. &#8220;We look
forward to what we believe is fair and final resolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TomorrowNow was accused in 11 counts of using login
credentials from Oracle customers to gain access to the
company&#8217;s software and one count of criminal copyright
infringement, according to a charging document filed yesterday
in federal court in San Francisco by U.S. Attorney Melinda Haag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Gillund, a spokesman for Haag, declined to comment on
whether there was a plea agreement with Walldorf, Germany-based
SAP, the largest maker of business-management software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very pleased that the Department of Justice
brought criminal charges against SAP for their widespread and
systematic theft of Oracle&#8217;s intellectual property, to which SAP
has repeatedly confessed,&#8221; Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for
Redwood City, California-based Oracle, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Oakland, California, last week threw out
a $1.3 billion jury verdict in Oracle&#8217;s civil lawsuit against
SAP and said that the damages for the improper downloading
should be no more than $272 million. If Oracle disagrees with
the amount, SAP should get a new trial, U.S. District Judge
Phyllis Hamilton ruled Sept. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. TomorrowNow, 11-642, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denver Post&#8217;s Publisher Quits Contract with Righthaven &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media News Group Inc. said it&#8217;s dropping a contract with
Las Vegas-based Righthaven LLC, a copyright-enforcement entity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Denver-based company, publisher of the Denver Post,
said in a statement in that newspaper that it will let its 12-
month contract with Righthaven lapse when it expires at the end
of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven has brought numerous copyright-infringement
cases on behalf of the Post and Stephens Media Inc.&#8217;s Las Vegas-
Review Journal. Many of those suits have been stymied over court
interpretations of whether Righthaven has standing to sue for
infringement of the newspapers&#8217; content. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Nomura
Holdings Inc. (8604) were among four banks chosen to manage Nikko Asset
Management Co.&#8217;s initial public offering, said three people with
knowledge of the proposed sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikko Asset and its largest shareholder, Sumitomo Trust 
Banking Co., may sell about 50 billion yen ($645 million) of
shares in the IPO, said the people, declining to be identified
before a public announcement. The asset manager plans to list on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange as early as this year and targets a
market value of about 200 billion yen, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share offer may be the biggest IPO in Japan this year,
and would be the country&#8217;s first by a major asset manager in a
decade, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The nation&#8217;s
equity capital market has begun to recover, with nine initial
share offers from the end of May following an 11-week hiatus in
the aftermath of a record earthquake and tsunami on March 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Overseas investors will be interested because a Japanese
asset manager&#8217;s sale is a rarity and gives them access to the
country&#8217;s 1,500 trillion yen worth of household financial
assets,&#8221; said Kazumi Tanaka, an IPO analyst at TC Financial
Research Inc. in Tokyo. &#8220;The IPO market will be more aggressive
next year as Japanese firms improve performance and recover from
the earthquake.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megumi Yoshizawa, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman for Nikko
Asset, declined to comment. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Hiroko Matsumoto,
Nomura&#8217;s Keiko Sugai, UBS&#8217;s Eiko Noda and SMBC Nikko&#8217;s Tadataka
Ishida also declined to comment. All are based in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four-Bank Management &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs will be the global coordinator
for the IPO, while UBS AG (UBSN) and SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. will
help manage the sale, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikko Asset began choosing managers for the offering in
July. The firm hasn&#8217;t decided the terms of the sale or details
for the underwriters&#8217; roles, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C), which acquired Nikko Asset from Nikko
Cordial Corp. in 2008, sold the company to Sumitomo Trust as
part of a transaction valued at 120 billion yen in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nikko Asset, founded in 1959, employs more than 500 staff
including 72 fund managers, and has 12.8 trillion yen under
management, according to its website. The investment management
firm, run by Chief Executive Officer Timothy McCarthy, has
subsidiaries in London, New York, Singapore and Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Trust and Nikko Asset agreed to buy DBS Asset
Management from DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS), Southeast Asia&#8217;s
biggest bank, for S$137 million ($113 million) to tap business
from the expanding ranks of wealthy Asians, the companies said
in December. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s share of online
searches in the U.S. slipped during August from July, while
rivals Yahoo! Inc. and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) gained, according to
research firm ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had 64.8 percent of U.S. searches last month, down
from 65.1 percent in July, according to ComScore. It was the
second-straight month of decline, following no change in June.
Yahoo climbed to 16.3 percent, up from 16.1 percent, rising for
a second month in a row. Microsoft, meanwhile, increased to 14.7
percent from 14.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yahoo and Microsoft teamed up last year in the search
market, providing a bigger threat to Google&#8217;s dominance. Under
the companies&#8217; 10-year agreement, Microsoft handles Internet
queries for Yahoo pages. Microsoft, which released a revamped
search engine named Bing in 2009, also has rolled out a
multimedia advertising campaign to attract users and is
bolstering results by displaying data from Facebook Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, continues to
enhance its own features. In June, the company unveiled a
feature called Instant Pages that gives users of its Chrome
browser quicker connections from links on query results. The
change is designed to cut 2 to 5 seconds from the process.
Google got most of its $29.3 billion in revenue last year from
search advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s shares rose $5.27 to $530.12 at 4 p.m. New York
time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Yahoo fell 22 cents $14.26,
while Microsoft climbed 15 cents to $25.89. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM), the largest maker of
mobile-phone chips, said Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s new operating system
will provide a launchpad for the company to break Intel Corp. (INTC)&#8217;s
dominance in personal-computer processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s decision to enable the new version of its
Windows operating system to work on mobile-phone chips, as well
as those based on Intel&#8217;s technology, will help Qualcomm and
other chipmakers win orders, Executive Vice President Steve Mollenkopf said today in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think that&#8217;s going to be a very disruptive force in
the industry,&#8221; Mollenkopf said. &#8220;We think that we will be able
to provide a better product than the incumbent solution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm aims to build on its leadership in mobile-phone
chips by getting its Snapdragon processors into more
smartphones, tablets and eventually computers. The San Diego-
based company is boosting the abilities of Snapdragon to make it
work in notebook-like devices, where Intel controls more than 80
percent of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm rose 99 cents to $51.39 today on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. Shares of Santa Clara, California-based Intel climbed 58
cents to $20.28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How Big a Threat? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its part, Intel doesn&#8217;t see a major shift away from its
technology, said Bill Calder, a company spokesman. The ARM
Holdings Plc technology that Qualcomm and other phone-chip
makers use doesn&#8217;t scale in performance to a level that will
make it competitive in anything beyond basic laptops, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t take threats to our core business lightly,&#8221;
Calder said. &#8220;The best-performing platform will win.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. is the only other
maker of laptop chips with more than 1 percent of the market,
and its chips also use Intel&#8217;s so-called X86 technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One challenge in moving from phones to computers is power.
Laptops have chips that draw hundreds of times as much energy as
their counterparts in mobile phones, while processing
information much faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Qualcomm aims to break into computers, Intel is
working on a counterattack into the phone market. That means
making its chips more efficient, so they can work in devices
that run on batteries. Intel has struggled for a decade to
convert its PC supremacy into mobile-phone market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Conference &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel will kick off its Intel Developer Forum tomorrow in
San Francisco, providing a showcase for its latest technology
and predictions for future trends. Microsoft, meanwhile, is
holding its Build conference in Anaheim, California, where it
will discuss the new version of Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qualcomm, whose digital signal processors convert radio
signals into voice and data in phones, is working on delivering
processors capable of handling larger pieces of software, like
Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success in the market will be determined by the ability to
deliver semiconductors that combine the functions of multiple
chips and make them cheaply, said Qualcomm&#8217;s Mollenkopf.
Qualcomm has a head start over competitors because it has all
the communications, graphics and processor capabilities it needs
in house, along with experience bringing them together, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You need the ability and the expertise across a number of
dissimilar technologies,&#8221; Mollenkopf said. &#8220;We have to
assemble less assets than other people to drive that market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) promoted Walter J. Scheller III to chief executive officer two months after
Keith Calder resigned from the post at the U.S. producer of
metallurgical coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheller, 50, was president of the company&#8217;s U.S.
operations, Birmingham, Alabama-based Walter Energy said today
in a statement. He joined the company in June 2010 from Peabody
Energy Corp., where he worked for four years. He has also worked
as an executive at CNX Gas Corp. and Consol Energy Inc. Scheller
replaces interim CEO Joseph B. Leonard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calder, who resigned as CEO on June 30, assumed the
position in April. He told the board of directors in a letter
that he was leaving due to differing opinions concerning
&#8220;management philosophy.&#8221; Calder was the CEO of Western Coal
Corp., which Walter Energy acquired in April for C$5.32 billion
($5.36 billion). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Gundlach testified that he
met with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) before TCW Group Inc. fired
him in 2009 and that he sought advice on how to improve his
situation at the Los Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale (GLE) SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach was the final witness in the trial over whether he
stole TCW&#8217;s trade secrets before starting his own company or TCW
fired him to avoid to paying management and performance fees
owed to him as the firm&#8217;s chief investment officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He told jurors in state court in Los Angeles today that he
was advised by Goldman Sachs either to arrange for better
corporate governance terms so that he could stay at TCW, attempt
a management buyout of TCW or negotiate his own departure.
Gundlach said he hadn&#8217;t decided to leave TCW at the time of his
last conversation with Goldman Sachs on Dec. 1, 2009, which was
three days before he was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten days after he was terminated, Gundlach, 51, who worked
at TCW for 25 years and was named Morningstar&#8217;s Fixed Income
Manager of the Year in 2006, started his own money management
firm, DoubleLine Capital LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW sued in January 2010 alleging that Gundlach and three
other former employees stole TCW&#8217;s trade secrets to start
DoubleLine. TCW&#8217;s damages expert testified that the company
suffered $344 million in damages from Gundlach&#8217;s alleged
interference with contracts and $222 million from a claimed
breach of fiduciary duty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Through the Roof&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a countersuit, Gundlach claimed that TCW fired him to
avoid having to pay management and performance fees for the
distressed-asset funds his group managed and that went &#8220;through
the roof.&#8221; Gundlach seeks about $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine&#8217;s lawyers called Gundlach, who had already
testified both in TCW&#8217;s and DoubleLine&#8217;s case, to refute
testimony by a Goldman Sachs banker that Gundlach had said at a
November 2009 meeting that he didn&#8217;t have an employment
agreement with TCW. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW claims that Gundlach can&#8217;t seek as much as $500 million
for breach of contract because he didn&#8217;t have a signed contract
when he was fired. Gundlach maintains he had been working and
was getting paid under a valid agreement made in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing arguments in the trial, which started July 28, are
scheduled for tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Jeffrey Gundlach,
BC429385, California Superior Court, Los Angeles County. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
was fined by the Central Bank of Ireland for breaching rules on
counterparty risk assessment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Bank (Europe) Plc was fined 160,000 euros
($218,000), the Dublin-based central bank said in an e-mailed
statement today. The company incorrectly calculated its
regulatory capital requirements between July 16, 2008 and Dec.
17, 2010, the central bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The reliance on automated systems should be tempered by
adequate oversight to ensure that systems and controls are, and
continue to be, comprehensive and proportionate,&#8221; Peter Oakes,
director of enforcement at the central bank, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error in working out the counterparty risk capital
requirement didn&#8217;t result in any breach of the capital adequacy
ratios, the central bank said. No counterparties were impacted.
Goldman Sachs has taken remedial action to fix the breaches and
the matter is closed, the central bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm disclosed the errors in calculations to the
central bank on Dec. 13, according to today&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased this matter has been resolved,&#8221; Joanna Carss, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, in London, said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam said the punishment sought by the government for his
insider-trading convictions is &#8220;grotesquely severe&#8221; and should
be rejected by the court. The U.S. said a long prison sentence
is warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, on Sept. 9 asked U.S. District Judge
Richard Holwell in Manhattan for a sentence &#8220;substantially
below&#8221; what is called for by federal guidelines. The
government&#8217;s requested sentence of 19 1/2 to 24 1/2 years
&#8220;would guarantee Mr. Rajaratnam&#8217;s death in prison,&#8221; he said in
a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This court&#8217;s role is not to validate a prosecutorial
public relations effort, nor is it to single out one man to
serve as the whipping boy for Wall Street misdeeds,&#8221; Rajaratnam
argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam was convicted in May of all 14 criminal counts
of conspiracy and securities fraud he was charged with. He&#8217;s
scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 27. Rajaratnam argued that the
government&#8217;s requested sentence is more than the average
sentence imposed for kidnapping and hostage-taking, sexual
abuse, robbery, arson and child pornography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorneys Reed Brodsky and Jonathan
Streeter, who prosecuted the case, asked Holwell in a filing
Sept. 9 to reject Rajaratnam&#8217;s pleas for leniency based on his
poor health and charitable contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In arguing for leniency because of his health, Rajaratnam
overlooks that he committed his crimes for years after he knew
about his medical problems and thus he is in no position to seek
leniency now based on them,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Fights U.S. Suit, Calls T-Mobile Deal Good for Public &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T) said its proposed $39 billion acquisition of T-
Mobile USA Inc. is good for mobile-phone customers and that the
U.S. lawsuit seeking to block the deal &#8220;fails to come to
grips&#8221; with its benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT filed its response Sept. 9 to the U.S. Justice
Department&#8217;s complaint in federal court in Washington. The
company said the merger would lead to better service, fewer
dropped calls and lower prices for consumers. ATT cited fierce
competition from Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Sprint Nextel
Corp. (S), MetroPCS Communications Inc., Leap Wireless International
Inc., U.S. Cellular Corp. and Cellular South Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Department does not and cannot explain how, in the
face of all these aggressive rivals, the combined ATT/T-Mobile
will have any ability or incentive to restrict output, raise
prices, or slow innovation,&#8221; ATT said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT described T-Mobile as &#8220;the only major carrier to have
actually lost subscribers in a robustly growing market&#8221; with a
business model that has it trapped between large providers and
lower-priced competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman in Washington, said in an
e-mail that the company remains &#8220;interested in a solution that
addresses the DOJ&#8217;s issues with the T-Mobile merger.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hernan Daguerre, a T-Mobile spokesman, declined to comment
on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This transaction as currently proposed is anticompetitive
and harmful to consumers,&#8221; Gina Talamona, a spokeswoman for the
antitrust division of the Justice Department, said in an
interview. &#8220;We will respond further in our court filings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint, which has filed its own lawsuit opposing the
merger, said ATT&#8217;s filing doesn&#8217;t change its position on the
deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed takeover would create a clear wireless
duopoly that could raise prices, stifle innovation and cost
American jobs,&#8221; Sprint spokesman John Taylor said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 and told the parties to be prepared to discuss
settlement options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks May Fight Banks as Investors Pursue Class Status &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) may pay more to resolve claims over their alleged roles in
the collapse of a $2.3 trillion mortgage-backed securities
market if sophisticated investors are allowed to sue as a group
along with less savvy ones, Thom Weidlich of Bloomberg News
reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class-action status allows investors to pool financial and
legal resources, giving them greater leverage to win larger
settlements or verdicts. The banks, however, have a court ruling
on their side that may help fend off such blockbuster cases. It
says class status is barred because some investors are too
sophisticated -- in fact, because some of them are other banks,
including JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is possible to be both an alleged perpetrator and
victim at the same time,&#8221; said Jacob S. Frenkel, a former U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawyer now in private
practice in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;It&#8217;s unprecedented that you
have the most sophisticated institutions as victims, to be in a
position where their losses are so great that they have sued.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold Baer Jr. in
Manhattan, favoring defendants Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)
and Ally Financial Inc., held that investors may not sue as a
class in part because some of them are being sued over the same
claims. Last month, that ruling was countered by two judges in
Baer&#8217;s courthouse, both of whom ruled that investors in home-
loan backed securities may sue as a class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that, once burst, helped push the
U.S. into the biggest recession since the 1930s. Investors have
filed class-action, or group, lawsuits against at least 16
private issuers of securities backed by mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are New Jersey Carpenters Health Fund v.

&lt;p&gt;KKR, Blackstone Deal-Rigging Antitrust Suit Expanded by Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plaintiffs in a case accusing 11 firms, including KKR  Co.
and Blackstone Group LP (BX), of conspiring to rig the market for
leveraged buyout deals can expand their investigation, a federal
judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, including a Detroit police and fire pension
fund, can seek information on 10 additional deals, U.S. District
Judge Edward F. Harrington said in a ruling Sept. 7. He didn&#8217;t
identify the transactions, which are described in a fifth
amended complaint filed under seal. The firms argued that adding
the deals would be &#8220;unduly burdensome and prejudicial,&#8221;
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, initially filed in 2007, claims the firms
conspired to drive down prices in the largest leveraged buyout
deals in violation of federal antitrust laws. The case
previously was limited to 17 transactions. Harrington gave the
plaintiffs until April 17 to seek the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the deals in question is Neiman Marcus Group Inc.&#8217;s
$5.1 billion buyout by Warburg Pincus LLC and TPG Capital Inc.,
SunGard Data Systems Inc.&#8217;s $11.3 billion takeover by seven
private-equity firms and Aramark Corp.&#8217;s roughly $8.3 billion
purchase in January 2007. Three plaintiffs are also shareholders
of Freescale Semiconductor Inc., which was taken private by a
group including Blackstone and Carlyle Group. TPG and Carlyle
are also defendants in the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firms allegedly formed &#8220;bidding clubs,&#8221; referred to
in the private-equity industry as &#8220;consortia&#8221; or &#8220;teams&#8221; to
rig the bidding, according to a redacted fourth amended
complaint made public Sept 9. Use of the clubs limited the
number of bidders, depressing prices at target companies, the
plaintiffs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to have any comment on that,&#8221; Owen
Blicksilver, a spokesman for Fort Worth, Texas-based TPG, said
in a telephone interview Sept. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for New York-based KKR, said
the company doesn&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. Blackstone
spokeswoman Christine Anderson and Chris Ullman of Carlyle Group
didn&#8217;t return phone messages seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dahl v. Bain Capital Partners LLC, 07-12388,
U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Trustee Sets $272 Million Payout, Sept. 15 Record Date &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm is planning an
initial distribution of $272 million to investors holding
allowed claims as of Sept. 15, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee, Irving Picard, intends to issue payments by
the end of the third quarter, after reviewing allowed claims
against the jailed confidence man, he said in July. The average
check, arriving almost three years after the Ponzi scheme
collapsed, will be $222,551, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holders of claims against Madoff that were sold or
transferred will only receive distributions from Picard if the
21-day notice-and-objection period on the transfer has expired
by Sept. 15, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard, who has filed more than 1,000 lawsuits seeking
money for Madoff investors, in May allotted $2.6 billion to a
fund for victims of the Ponzi scheme. Because of court
challenges, most of the $8.6 billion he has raised isn&#8217;t
currently available to put in the customer fund or distribute to
claimholders who lost an estimated $17.3 billion in principal,
he has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in North Carolina,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. Picard and his law
firm, Baker  Hostetler LLP, have made about $179 million in
fees since Madoff&#8217;s 2008 arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-ap-1789, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical, Sasol Win Dismissal of Greenpeace Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Chemical Co. (DOW) and Sasol North America Inc. won the
dismissal of a lawsuit alleging the chemical companies illegally
spied on an affiliate of Greenpeace International, the
environmental advocacy group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace Inc. sued under the federal Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act. A federal judge in Washington
ruled Sept. 9 that the nonprofit organization failed to
establish a direct connection between corporate espionage and
civil racketeering allegations and any injury the group
suffered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The direct victim of this alleged wire fraud was not
Greenpeace, but a third party, and, therefore, the link between
Greenpeace&#8217;s injuries and defendants&#8217; alleged racketeering
activity is too attenuated to be actionable under RICO,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Rosemary M. Collyer wrote in her ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace claimed that Dow, closely held Sasol and two
public relations firms from 1998 to 2000 conspired to infiltrate
and steal confidential information to thwart its environmental
campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenpeace said the spying included breaking into locked
trash bins outside its Washington headquarters and infiltrating
meetings and electronic communications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The injured third party the judge referred to was Calcasieu
League for Environmental Action Now, described in the ruling as
an ally of Greenpeace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly Dorozenski, a Greenpeace spokeswoman, declined to
comment immediately, saying the group&#8217;s lawyers were reviewing
the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we have said from the beginning, the case totally
lacked merit and should have never been filed by Greenpeace,&#8221;
said Gregory Baldwin, a spokesman for Midland, Michigan-based
Dow, the largest U.S. chemical maker, in an e-mail. &#8220;No Dow
employee did anything improper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Kirtland, a Washington lawyer representing Houston-
based Sasol North America Inc., said his client is pleased with
the court&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Greenpeace Inc. v. Dow Chemical Co., 10-cv-
02037, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorillard Label Challenge Should Be Rejected, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. asked a judge to reject a bid by Lorillard Inc. (LO),
the maker of Newport cigarettes, and three other tobacco
companies to stop the government from putting new warnings on
cigarette packs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department, in a filing Sept. 9 in federal
court in Washington, said the Food and Drug Administration has
the authority to require labels warning of the health risks of
smoking. The companies are seeking a preliminary injunction
delaying the rule, scheduled to take effect Sept. 22, 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDA regulation mandates that cigarette packs, cartons
and advertising display graphic warning labels. The warnings
will be accompanied by pictures of rotting teeth or damaged
lungs to deter smokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The public interest strongly mitigates against delaying
health warnings that more effectively convey the extraordinary,
undisputed health risks created by the use of plaintiffs&#8217;
products,&#8221; the Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorillard, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. Commonwealth Brands
Inc. and Liggett Group LLC sued last month saying the regulation
violates the First Amendment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ronald Milstein, Greensboro, North Carolina-based
Lorillard&#8217;s senior vice president and general counsel, didn&#8217;t
return a telephone message after normal business hours seeking
comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives in the public relations department of
Reynolds American Inc. (RAI), R.J. Reynolds&#8217;s parent, didn&#8217;t reply to
a phone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. v. U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, 11-cv-1482, U.S. District Court, District of
Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Asks Court to Reverse $2 Billion Award to Truck Dealers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. (F) asked an Ohio appeals court to reverse a $2
billion judgment awarded in June to a class of commercial truck
dealers who claimed the company overcharged them for 11 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dealers sued Ford in 2002, claiming the company broke
an agreement to sell trucks at published prices, which forced
them to pay more from 1987 through 1998 and cut into profits.
Cuyahoga County Judge Peter J. Corrigan in June upheld a $4.5
million verdict awarded to one Ohio dealer in February by a
Cleveland jury. The Cleveland judge also said Ford had to pay
similar damages and interest to a class of about 3,000 other
dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge improperly found Ford liable before trial for
breach of franchise agreements and prevented the company from
defending itself on damages, the automaker said in a Sept. 2
filing with the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County in
Cleveland. Ford also said Corrigan shouldn&#8217;t have applied his
findings on one dispute across hundreds of thousands of
transactions involving other dealers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trial court&#8217;s grant of summary judgment on liability
exemplifies the court&#8217;s repeated and erroneous election to take
away from the jury key questions on liability and damages,&#8221;
Ford said in court papers. &#8220;The trial court deprived Ford of
its rights to due process and a trial by jury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total $2 billion award is five times higher than the
amount of the largest-ever jury award against Dearborn,
Michigan-based Ford in a lawsuit, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s judgment was the largest of any type in Ohio
history, Ford said in its appeal. &#8220;That staggering judgment was
as unwarranted as it was unprecedented,&#8221; the company said. &#8220;It
resulted from a series of serious errors by the trial court, any
one of which compels reversal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford wasn&#8217;t denied any rights, James Lowe, the dealers&#8217;
lawyer, said in an interview Sept. 9. Corrigan&#8217;s treatment of
the suit by awarding damages to the class was &#8220;perfectly
appropriate,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Westgate Ford Truck Sales Inc. v. Ford Motor
Co., CV 02-483526, Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County, Ohio
(Cleveland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health-Care Ruling May Delay Final Answer From U.S. High Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court decision cast doubt on the prospect
that the U.S. Supreme Court will rule on the constitutionality
of President Barack Obama&#8217;s health-care overhaul before the 2012
elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-judge panel said Sept 8 that it didn&#8217;t yet have
the power to consider a challenge to the law&#8217;s requirement that
Americans, by 2014, either acquire health insurance or pay a
penalty. The court ruled that judicial review must wait for the
assessment of a fine -- something that wouldn&#8217;t occur until the
following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health-care law, which has divided courts around the
country, was already in line for possible Supreme Court review
early next year, with a ruling likely in June. The Sept. 8
ruling adds a new legal wrinkle, raising a procedural issue that
might delay the ultimate outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s still the case that we will get some decision from
the United States Supreme Court the last week of this coming
June,&#8221; said Walter Dellinger, the former U.S. solicitor general
who filed a brief backing the law on behalf of congressional
Democrats. &#8220;But it is possible that ruling could be that no one
has the right to challenge this law until they&#8217;ve declined to
pay the penalty or sought a refund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three federal appeals courts have now considered the law,
each reaching a different conclusion. A Cincinnati-based appeals
court upheld the law in June, calling it a valid use of
Congress&#8217;s power to regulate interstate commerce. An appeal in
that case is now before the Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Atlanta-based court disagreed, upholding arguments by 26
states that Congress had exceeded its power under the commerce
clause. The U.S. Justice Department is scheduled to say by the
end of the month whether it will seek Supreme Court review of
that ruling or instead ask a larger panel of appellate judges to
reconsider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest ruling, from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, took a third approach. The panel
focused on a law, known as the Anti-Injunction Act, barring
lawsuits that seek to block the collection of federal taxes. The
measure says that &#8220;no suit for the purpose of restraining the
assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any
court by any person.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for herself and one other panel member, Judge Diana
Gribbon Motz, said the law meant the court couldn&#8217;t hear a suit
filed by Liberty University, a Christian school in Lynchburg,
Virginia, founded by the late Rev. Jerry Falwell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Liberty University v. Geithner, 10-02347, and
Commonwealth of Virginia v. Sebelius, 11-01057, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (Richmond). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Industrial Enterprises CEO Gets Up to 21 Years for Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Industrial Enterprises of America Inc. (IEAM) Chief
Executive Officer James W. Margulies was sentenced to seven to
21 years in prison for his role in a $110 million securities
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro handed
down the sentence in Manhattan Sept. 9. Margulies, of Cleveland,
was convicted in July of grand larceny, scheming to defraud,
conspiracy, violation of general business law and falsifying
business records in what prosecutors called a &#8220;massive&#8221; pump-
and-dump scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is basically a case of greed,&#8221; Carro said. He said
he wanted the sentence to serve as &#8220;a general deterrent that
will scream out from this courtroom that people like you are
going to be treated harshly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margulies and another former Industrial Enterprises CEO,
John D. Mazzuto, were indicted in May 2010. Mazzuto pleaded
guilty and testified against Margulies, a lawyer, at trial.
Mazzuto hasn&#8217;t been sentenced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My actions were well-intended at the time,&#8221; Margulies
told Carro Sept. 9. &#8220;By the time I recognized the potential
harm of my actions, it was too late.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked for probation, telling the judge that he needed to
be at home with his family, including a child who has special
needs. Carro rejected that request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not my sentence that&#8217;s going to devastate these
children,&#8221; the judge said. &#8220;It is your actions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People v. Margulies, 2503-2010, New York state
Supreme Court (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Taiwan Semiconductor Manager Seeks 12-Month Sentence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. manager who
pleaded guilty to being part of an insider-trading scheme
involving Primary Global Research LLC is seeking a 12-month
sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manosha Karunatilaka, who pleaded guilty in May to taking
about $35,000 to pass inside tips about the company&#8217;s orders
while working as a Primary Global consultant, asked the
sentencing judge Sept. 9 to give him a split term of six months
in jail and six months of home confinement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am a good person that made a terrible mistake and fell
from grace,&#8221; Karunatilaka said in a letter to U.S. District
Judge Jed Rakoff, which was attached to the sentencing request
filed in Manhattan federal court Sept. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argued in a court filing that Karunatilaka
should get from 37 to 46 months in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An analyst at an unnamed New York-based hedge fund which
used Primary Global&#8217;s services spoke to Karunatilaka frequently
from 2008 to 2010, prosecutors said in court papers. In May
2009, acting on Karunatilaka&#8217;s recommendation to bet that Taiwan
Semiconductor shares would fall, the fund made a profit of about
$1.7 million, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Nguyen, 11-CR-32, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alliance One, Deltafina Lose EU Appeals of Antitrust Fine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universal Corp.&#8217;s Italian unit Deltafina and Alliance One
International Inc. (AOI) lost European Union court appeals against
antitrust fines totaling 54 million euros ($75 million) for
colluding on prices they paid tobacco growers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU General Court, the 27-nation region&#8217;s second-highest
tribunal, ruled Sept. 9 that the penalties were valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
fined four companies, including two Alliance One units, 56
million euros for unlawfully rigging prices for more than six
years in a cartel that ended in 2002. Deltafina was fined 30
million euros while Alliance One was held jointly liable with
its two units for a 24 million-euro penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling follows decisions by the court in a similar case
concerning the Spanish market last year in which Deltafina won a
reduction in an 11.9 million-euro antitrust fine for fixing the
prices it paid Spanish growers for tobacco. Alliance One last
October lost an appeal over its fine in the cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the companies in the U.S. didn&#8217;t respond
to calls outside normal office hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are: T-12/06, Deltafina v. European Commission;
T-25/06, Alliance One v. European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On The Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Bear Stearns Fund Managers&#8217; SEC Trial Set for February &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Bear Stearns Cos. hedge-fund managers Ralph Cioffi
and Matthew Tannin, acquitted in 2009 of criminal charges they
misled investors who lost $1.6 billion, are set to face trial in
February in a related civil case brought by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Frederic Block in Brooklyn, New York,
set the trial date for Feb. 13 at a conference Sept. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in November 2009 found Cioffi and Tannin not
guilty of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud in the first
criminal trial stemming from a federal probe of the collapse of
the subprime-mortgage market. Cioffi, 55, was portfolio manager
for the hedge funds and Tannin was their chief operating
officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have had no discussions of substance,&#8221; John D.
Worland, a lawyer for the SEC, told Block when the judge asked
about the possibility of a settlement, which would make a trial
unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Callahan, an SEC spokesman, and Marc Weinstein, a
lawyer for Cioffi at Hughes Hubbard  Reed LLP in Manhattan,
declined to comment on the case. Nina Beattie, a lawyer for
Tannin at Brune  Richards LLP in Manhattan, also declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cioffi and Tannin were indicted in June 2008, a year after
their hedge funds failed. Bear Stearns collapsed less than a
year after the funds failed, and was purchased by New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claims the two men misled investors about the
funds&#8217; deepening financial troubles and their own holdings in
the investment pools. The regulator&#8217;s case requires a lower
standard of proof than a criminal conviction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Cioffi, 08-cv-2457, and the criminal case is U.S. v. Cioffi, 08-
CR-00415, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York
(Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) unveiled an
upcoming version of its Windows operating system that can run
handheld touch-screen computers, aimed at narrowing the lead of
Apple Inc. (AAPL)&#8217;s iPad in the market for tablets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software developers will be able to download a preview of
the program, called Windows 8, tonight, the company said. The
product lets users display favorite applications, people and
information in tiles on the main screen. It will allow ultra-
thin personal computers and tablets to turn on instantly and run
all day on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is under pressure to put out a new version of
Windows capable of running smaller, thinner tablet computers
with battery life to rival that of the iPad. In the meantime,
Windows sales have missed analysts&#8217; estimates for three straight
quarters and personal-computer sales have stalled as consumers
favor tablets over notebook computers running the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very important for them to get this right,&#8221; said
Sid Parakh, an analyst at McAdams Wright Ragen, who suggests
buying Microsoft shares. &#8220;They can&#8217;t compete with what&#8217;s out
there today in tablets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft took the wraps off
Windows 8 today at a conference for developers in Anaheim,
California, without saying when it will go on sale. The product,
previewed in June, is an attempt to vault Microsoft into a fast-
growing market controlled by Apple and Google Inc.&#8217;s Android
software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablet Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty million media tablets will ship in 2011, and 74
percent of those will be Apple&#8217;s iPads, according to an August
forecast by IHS Inc. The global market is expected to rise to
275.3 million units in 2015, with Apple forecast to claim 43.6
percent of the market at that point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the quarter that ended in June, Apple sold 9.3 million
iPads. About 20 percent of them went to customers who would have
otherwise bought a Windows PC, estimated Colin Gillis, an
analyst at BGC Partners LP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to compete has led Microsoft for the first time to
offer a Windows computer operating system that runs on chip
technology from ARM Holdings Plc. (ARM) The program is the biggest
operating-system change Microsoft has made since Windows 95,
Microsoft Vice President Julie Larson-Green said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 8&#8217;s design resembles Microsoft&#8217;s software for
mobile phones in its use of digital tiles instead of icons to
help users move between programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Re-imagined Windows&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From the chipset to the experience, Windows 8 re-imagines
what Windows can be,&#8221; Sinofsky said in a keynote address today.
Developers at the conference will get a prototype tablet
computer with the Windows 8 preview software. The machine was
made by Samsung Electronics Co. and runs an Intel Corp. (INTC) chip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Microsoft&#8217;s Windows 7, the new software has touch-
controlled tiles that can be automatically updated to display
information from applications on the computer&#8217;s start screen.
For example, a weather application can tell users that the
forecast is sunny without requiring them to open the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software also will run on desktop and laptop computers
via a touch screen, mouse or keyboard. Windows 8 will run
&#8220;virtually all&#8221; of the existing Windows applications, the
company said in today&#8217;s statment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides the new design, called Metro, the software also
offers the option of switching to the regular desktop look
available in Windows now. By switching to that mode, users can
employ Windows 7 apps and devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Store &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software will have a Windows Store for selling apps,
and apps can work together and share information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft first released a version of Windows for tablet
computers in 2002, though the devices used a stylus and had few
programs tailored to the new form. Many were as large as regular
notebooks and had similar battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablets caught on in 2010 when Apple released the iPad,
promising 10 hours of battery life. Since then, companies
including Samsung Electronics Co. and Motorola Mobility Holdings
Inc. have started selling touch-screen tablets running Google&#8217;s
Android software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said it&#8217;s approaching 450 million copies
sold of its current operating system, Windows 7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four Seasons Hotels Inc., the
luxury chain founded in 1961, will develop a property at Walt
Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida, in a $360 million deal
with Silverstein Properties Inc. and Dune Real Estate Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 444-room hotel is scheduled to open in 2014, Toronto-
based Four Seasons said in a statement today. The hotelier,
which purchased the land from Disney in August 2008, will have a
30 percent stake in the resort and will operate it. Grupo
Financiero Inbursa, based in Mexico City, will provide $190
million in construction financing for the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an irreplaceable asset,&#8221; Daniel Neidich, chief
executive officer of New York-based Dune Real Estate Partners,
said in the statement, &#8220;a rare opportunity in a remarkable
location, with a prestigious brand that we believe will provide
attractive returns to our investors for many years to come.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the hotel, the property will include as many
as 40 Four Seasons Residence Club units and as many as 90
private homes. The resort will feature several restaurants,
including a rooftop venue with views of Disney&#8217;s Magic Kingdom,
a spa with 18 treatment rooms, a fitness center, three pools and
sports facilities including tennis courts, a basketball court
and climbing wall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dune is the project&#8217;s majority investor, according to the
statement. Silverstein Properties, based in New York and led by
CEO Larry A. Silverstein, will oversee development and
construction at the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project will encompass the Tom Fazio-designed Osprey
Ridge golf course, which will be renovated and managed by Four
Seasons. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said trading
revenue will drop about 30 percent this quarter from the prior
three months as the economy weakened and volume declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations pulled back from the market, particularly in
August, James Staley chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
investment bank, said today at a Barclays financial-services
conference in New York. Debt and equity sales were down across
the board as were mergers and acquisitions, Staley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company earned $5.5 billion in equity and fixed-income
trading during the second quarter. Third-quarter fees from
investment banking will fall by about half, Staley said,
projecting about $1 billion in total fees compared with $1.92
billion in the second quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will report a &#8220;modest loss&#8221; in its private-
equity unit of about $100 million, Staley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and
Spain is about $14 billion, a figure that includes loans and
derivatives contracts and is mostly a mix of sovereign and bank
debt, Staley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The issue really is if there is an uncontrolled default
in Europe, to define the contagion of that is very difficult,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;What we learned in 2008 is that we are
interconnected. I don&#8217;t think any of us have been able to figure
out what the ultimate impact would be of a default in Greece.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, is likely to raise its dividend 19
percent as early as this week, frustrating investors who are
clamoring for a bigger payout from its $52.8 billion cash hoard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projected increase -- to 19 cents a share per quarter,
from 16 cents, based on data compiled by Bloomberg -- would be
similar to last year&#8217;s rise. While Microsoft&#8217;s board is aware of
the shareholder demands, it will probably stick with the usual
increase, a person familiar with the board&#8217;s thinking said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s cash and short-term investments swelled 43
percent in the past fiscal year. With the shares losing more
than 7 percent of their value in 2011, more investors want the
company to boost its payout. Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer has said that Microsoft&#8217;s dividend policy is to raise
payments in line with annual gains in operating income, which
climbed 13 percent in the year that ended in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That cash is better in our hands than theirs,&#8221; said Pat Becker Jr., a fund manager at Portland, Oregon-based Becker
Capital Management Inc., which oversees $2.2 billion in assets,
including Microsoft shares. &#8220;I&#8217;d hope they&#8217;d raise it more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of investor sentiment, Microsoft is considering a
larger increase, said the person familiar with the matter, who
asked not to be named because the decision is private. Still,
the board is more likely to retain its policy of raising the
payout in line with operating income, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller Than Average? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has paid out about 25 percent of earnings as
dividends since starting the payments in 2003, according to
Bloomberg data. Dividend-paying companies with similar market
valuations to Microsoft are paying closer to 40 percent to 50
percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returning more cash to investors also may be hindered by
Microsoft&#8217;s overseas holdings. About $45 billion, or 85 percent,
of Microsoft&#8217;s cash and short-term investments is outside the
U.S., the company said a July 28 regulatory filing. Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft would have to pay taxes if the
company brings it into the U.S. to use for dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About half of the company&#8217;s annual cash flow from
operations is generated outside the U.S., Heather Bellini, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York, said in a Sept.
6 report. That leaves about $15 billion to $17 billion available
for dividends and share repurchases in the current fiscal year,
she said. Bellini anticipates that the dividend will rise to 18
cents to 20 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 15 cents to $25.89 yesterday on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock has declined 7.2 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology Peers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among technology company peers, Microsoft&#8217;s payout falls in
the middle. Intel Corp. (INTC), Sage Group Plc and SAP AG are paying a
larger portion of earnings, while Oracle Corp., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and CA Inc. pay less, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg dividend forecasts look at seven criteria,
including dividend history and public estimates. A payout
increase to 19 cents would boost the yield to 2.9 percent from
2.5 percent currently, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Microsoft were to match its peers on payout ratios, it
would equate to a dividend yield increase to 6 percent from the
current 2.6 percent, and include an approximate doubling of the
company&#8217;s dividend,&#8221; said Neil Herman, an analyst at
Ticonderoga Securities, in a research report last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares might surge past $35 if the board decided to
&#8220;majorly boost the company&#8217;s dividend,&#8221; Herman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bard Holding GmbH, the German
offshore wind developer that put itself up for sale, hired
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s investment banking arm to find a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. investment bank JPMorgan has been mandated with
the search for a strategic investor,&#8221; Bard said today in an e-
mailed statement. The new ownership structure will be decided by
the end of the first quarter, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bard, based in Emden, was founded in 2003 by Arngolt Bekker, who at the age of 76 has decided to sell, spokesman
Andreas Koelling said by telephone on Aug. 31. The owners plan
to divest an 87.5 percent stake, Koelling said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bard heads a group of companies covering all stages of
offshore wind development, including Bard Emden Energy GmbH,
which makes rotor blades and components for turbines and
assembles the machines. The group also comprises a project
development and investment company for offshore wind farms as
well as units for installation and turbine maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is developing the Bard Offshore 1 project, a
400-megawatt park about 90 kilometers (56 miles) northwest of
Borkum island in Germany. Its partner UniCredit SpA has arranged
financing for the venture, Bard said in today&#8217;s statement,
without elaborating. The company couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached
for further comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bard said Aug. 29 that it sold its shares in one of its
planned wind farms, the 600-megawatt Bard-Nederland project in
the Dutch North Sea, to Typhoon Offshore BV, a unit of clean-
energy investor Typhoon Capital BV, and Dutch energy provider
HVC Groep. Bard will still supply turbines to the project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks are expensive and
will only rally when the European sovereign-debt crisis
diminishes, JPMorganCazenove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks trade at around 8.5 times their estimated
12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio and investors could
find &#8220;a lot of places that are cheaper than Turkey in absolute
terms as well as cheaper relative to their own histories,&#8221;
wrote JPMorgan analyst David Aserkoff in a report, giving Russia
and Poland as cheaper examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Turkey should move into banks, which may
&#8220;surprise on the upside&#8221; with earnings upgrades, JPMorgan
said. Top picks are Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN), Turkey&#8217;s largest
bank by market value, UniCredit SpA Turkish unit Yapi  Kredi
Bankasi AS and state-run Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi AS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For investors looking to benefit from a rebound in emerging
markets, the nature of the bounce is key, JPMorgan said. A
bounce-back driven by better global growth prospects would favor
Russia, while a recovery stimulated by a pickup in Europe&#8217;s
financial crisis is more likely to favor Turkey, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey is one of the most-exposed emerging markets to
European exports and &#8220;risks to growth are high,&#8221; Aserkoff
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The premium for Heavy Louisiana
Sweet oil rose two days after Chevron Corp. (CVX) shut about 15,000
barrels a day of oil production in the Gulf of Mexico following
a leak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partial output was expected to resume by today, Russell
Johnson, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail yesterday. He
didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail today asking if any output had
resumed. About 2.3 gallons of oil was released and the company
is evaluating repair options, according to an e-mailed statement
from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron shut its Main Pass and Cypress pipeline systems
Sept. 12 to investigate the incident, Johnson said yesterday.
The Main Pass system helps supply oil to Chevron&#8217;s Empire
terminal, a delivery point for Heavy Louisiana Sweet crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy Louisiana Sweet&#8217;s premium to West Texas Intermediate
increased $2 to $27.50 a barrel at 4:29 p.m. in New York,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet&#8217;s
premium gained $1.20 to $24.70. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend added 75 cents to $22 while Poseidon increased 50 cents to
$22 a barrel over WTI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southern Green Canyon&#8217;s premium added 75 cents to $20.50 a
barrel. West Texas Sour&#8217;s discount narrowed 5 cents to 70 cents.
Thunder Horse&#8217;s premium decreased 75 cents to $24.50 above the
benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Canada Select&#8217;s discount widened $2.25 to $13.25 a
barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for Syncrude lost 25 cents to $11.25 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
tar sands in Alberta. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said developers
have downloaded 500,000 copies of the preview version of Windows
8 since its debut yesterday, evidence of interest in an
operating system that will vie with Apple Inc. (AAPL) software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While it&#8217;s clear we have a long way to go still with
Windows 8, we&#8217;ve been gratified by the reactions and the
interest,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer said today at
a conference for developers in Anaheim, California. One area
needing more work: a Windows 8 version that runs on chips with
technology from ARM Holdings Plc, which is &#8220;very, very
important to us,&#8221; Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is rushing to complete Windows 8 because the
company wants an operating system capable of running thinner,
lighter tablet machines with battery power that can rival
Apple&#8217;s iPad. That need has led the world&#8217;s largest software
maker to make its Windows personal-computer operating system
compatible with ARM-based chips for the first time. ARM
processors typically run smartphones and other mobile gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conference, Microsoft gave attendees a prototype
machine running an Intel Corp. (INTC) chip rather than an ARM model, a
sign that version is farther along. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t said when
Windows 8 devices will go on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, rose 46 cents to
$26.50 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
shares have lost 5.1 percent of their value this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Re-Imagining&#8217; Company &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft Windows President Steven Sinofsky yesterday
said that Windows 8 &#8220;re-imagines&#8221; what Windows can do, Ballmer
today said that the effort -- as well as Microsoft&#8217;s push into
Internet-based cloud services and new types of hardware --
represent a &#8220;re-imagining&#8221; of the entire company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as it focuses on tablets, phones and cloud computing,
the company will keep Windows at the heart of its strategy,
Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Windows is at the center,&#8221; he said. &#8220;People question
whether that is a good idea. I think it&#8217;s an exceptionally good
idea.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone, the mobile-phone software that Microsoft
released last year, hasn&#8217;t performed as well as Ballmer would
have liked, he said. Still, positive reception from those who
have bought the devices, as well as the support from handset
makers, gives him hope for the future, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying I love where we are, but I am very
optimistic on where we can be,&#8221; Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked if Microsoft&#8217;s Internet-search partnership with
Yahoo was at risk, given the company&#8217;s ouster of CEO Carol Bartz, Ballmer said he&#8217;s not worried. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The partnership will remain strong no matter where they
want to take their business or whoever they happen to install
next as CEO,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said it
lowered forecasts for the euro versus the dollar as fiscal
tensions in the region increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shared currency will trade at $.140 at the end of the
year, down from $.145, the New York-based firm said in note to
clients today. It also reduced its six- and 12-month outlooks to
$1.45 and $1.50, from $1.50 and $1.55 respectively. Analysts led
by Thomas Stolper, chief foreign exchange strategist in London,
&#8220;continue to expect euro-dollar to rise again, albeit from a
slightly lower starting point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure of euro area governments to calm market concern
over Greek default and contagion, relatively little additional
fiscal tightening in the U.S. and weaker-than-expected global
economic data contributed to the revisions, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The extent of the friction and the relative weakness of
the policy response was not our core scenario,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro rose 0.6 percent to $1.3754 at 4:55 p.m. in New
York from $1.3678 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) bought 1,023 patents
from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) as the Internet
search and advertising company bolsters its strategy of
defending against smartphone lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transfers recorded by the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office&#8217;s website yesterday show Google acquired the patents Aug.
17. Jim Prosser, a spokesman for the Mountain View, California-
based company, confirmed the transaction today without providing
details or financial terms. Chris Andrews, a spokesman for
Armonk, New York-based IBM, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is building an arsenal of patents that the company
has said is largely designed to counter a &#8220;hostile, organized
campaign&#8221; by companies including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
against the Android operating system for mobile devices. Google
had already acquired 1,030 patents from IBM in a transaction
recorded in July, and will obtain more than 17,000 with its
$12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android is a free, open-source program that relies on some
nonproprietary features Google didn&#8217;t create and allows outside
developers to modify the code. That has left the company and
handset makers that use the system vulnerable to lawsuits
claiming Android was built on the backs of research done by
other technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android handset makers HTC Corp. (2498), Samsung Electronics Co.
and Motorola Mobility have each been targeted in lawsuits by
Cupertino, California-based Apple, and Microsoft and Motorola
Mobility have exchanged patent-infringement allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help in the fight, Google last month transfered to HTC
nine patents it bought in the past year from companies including
the former Motorola Inc. and Openwave Systems Inc. Taoyuan,
Taiwan-based HTC used those patents last week in a new lawsuit
that escalates its patent battle with Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IBM sale was previously reported by the SEO by the Sea
blog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar may be
approaching a short-term retracement of losses against its U.S.
counterpart, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aussie may be due for a bounce as it weakens to support
levels near parity with the U.S. dollar. A jump above $1.0485
would signal stabilization in risk sentiment and may mean the
Australian currency will strengthen to as high $1.07, Niall O&#8217;Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan said in
an interview. The currency has fallen 4.4 percent against the
greenback over the past week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The burden of proof is on the bulls,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor said.
&#8220;The $1.0485 area was where we saw it break down last week, and
as long as it is under that level, the Aussie is vulnerable down
to a cluster of support around 1.000. While there is still
downside risk, we are close to some sort of bounce.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar fell 0.9 percent today to $1.0222,
from $1.0312 yesterday. The currency dropped to 99.28 U.S. cents
on August 9, trading below parity for the first time since
March. It reached $1.0765 on Sept. 1, the highest in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven-day relative strength index for the Aussie versus
the dollar fell to 26.3, trading below the 30 level for the
first time since Aug. 10. A reading below 30 indicates an asset
may have fallen too fast and may be due for a correction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A support level is an area on a chart where analysts
anticipate buy orders will be clustered. A break below 98.90
cents per U.S. dollar would imply the Australian dollar could
weaken to 96 cents, O&#8217;Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aussie is about as oversold as it was at its August lows,
which suggests it might try to stabilize,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, will shut its Global Alpha
fund after clients pulled money from the quantitative trading
pool that was once the firm&#8217;s largest hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Alpha will stop charging fees at the end of this
month and aims to finish liquidating most assets by mid-October,
according to a letter that Goldman Sachs Asset Management sent
to clients Sept. 14. The fund, which managed $11 billion of
assets in 2007, had less than $1.7 billion at the end of June,
according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the numbers aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, has been shrinking Global Alpha since
2007 when it lost 40 percent because of bad bets on currencies,
equities and bonds worldwide. The fund&#8217;s co-managers Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski quit in March 2009, and Katinka Domotorffy took charge of the quantitative investment strategies
unit, which uses computers to pick securities and oversees $56
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported yesterday that the Global Alpha fund was
down 12 percent through the end of August, and the Wall Street
Journal reported that it was being shut. Ed Canaday, a spokesman
for the New York-based bank, confirmed the letter&#8217;s contents and
said he couldn&#8217;t comment on the performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domotorffy is leaving at year-end and being replaced by new
managers, including Armen Avanessians, a partner who has served
on the securities division&#8217;s executive committee since 2003,
according to a separate letter to investors Sept. 14. Ron Hua,
who oversaw $12 billion of equity assets at PanAgora Asset
Management Inc., was hired as chief investment officer and head
of the quantitative equity alpha business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs wrote in the letter that it aims to
distribute 85 percent to 90 percent of the total proceeds from
the fund&#8217;s assets to clients by the end of October. The fund&#8217;s
claims against Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (LEHMQ), which declared
bankruptcy three years ago, may take longer and the fund may
have liabilities to Lehman as well, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have extensively reviewed the fund&#8217;s claims against,
and potential liabilities to, Lehman Brothers and intend to
vigorously pursue a resolution with Lehman Brothers that is in
the best interests of investors in the fund,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
wrote. &#8220;We cannot predict when the fund will be able to make
final distributions, if any, to investors in the fund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is aiming to build the fund-management unit
and improve its performance. The overall business had $844
billion under management at the end of June and generated 13
percent of the firm&#8217;s revenue in this year&#8217;s first six months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Management Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avanessians, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1985 and became a
partner in 1994, is the latest executive to move into asset
management from other parts of the bank. Jim O&#8217;Neill, the chief
economist, was appointed chairman of asset management last year.
The investment unit&#8217;s co-heads, Timothy J. O&#8217;Neill and Edward C. Forst, came from other divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Fallon, who became chief investment officer and head
of alpha strategies when Domotorffy took over, will cede the
equity business to Hua and focus on quantitative macro funds,
according to the letter. Don Mulvihill will remain chief
investment officer and head of customized beta strategies,
Goldman Sachs said. Both will report to Avanessians, who will be
based in New York. He will report to O&#8217;Neill and Forst, who
signed the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domotorffy joined Goldman Sachs in 1998 as a portfolio
manager and researcher with the quantitative global macro and
fixed-income teams, according to the letter. She became head of
strategy for the quantitative investment strategies group in
2007 before taking the leadership role two years later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carhart is now running Kepos Capital Management LP, which
has $150 million under management and has made a 9 percent
return so far this year, before fees, according to a person
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carolina Lightcap resigned
unexpectedly as president of Disney Channels Worldwide after
less than two years on the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Marsh was named president and chief creative officer
of the unit, Burbank, California-based Walt Disney Co. (DIS) said
today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move puts children&#8217;s networks including Disney Channel
and Disney XD into the hands of the creator of some of its
biggest shows, including &#8220;Hannah Montana&#8221; and &#8220;High School
Musical.&#8221; Lightcap, plucked from Disney Channels&#8217; Latin
American operations in November 2009, said she was leaving with
some Disney cable channels&#8217; ratings at their highest ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I readily embrace change as a good thing, and really look
forward to the next chapter of my career,&#8221; Lightcap said in a
letter to her staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departure by Lightcap, an 11-year Disney veteran who
had headed marketing in Latin America, is the second high-level
resignation at Disney this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 6, Andrew P. Mooney resigned as chairman of the
consumer products unit to seek a larger executive role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Disney Channel&#8217;s ratings were up by 10 percent in the
company&#8217;s most recent quarter, Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger said in a Aug. 9 earnings conference call. Ratings at XD
channel, which is targeted at boys, increased by 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the period ended July 2, the worldwide Disney Channel
operation contributed to the company&#8217;s 11 percent increase in
operating earnings for its media networks unit, which includes
the ESPN sports channel, Disney said on Aug. 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Phineas and Ferb&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsh, who was president of entertainment and chief
creative officer at Disney Channels, most recently developed the
&#8220;Phineas and Ferb&#8221; franchise. A movie based on the characters,
&#8220;Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension,&#8221; was cable TV&#8217;s
most-watched movie this past summer, Disney said on Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest theme-park company and the
owner of Pixar and Marvel movie studios, rose 65 cents to $32.94
today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have declined 12 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)&#8217;s David Kostin slashed his year-end forecast for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index by 11 percent to 1,250, citing continued uncertainty
in the global markets due to Europe&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin, the equity strategist at the firm, previously
predicted the benchmark equity index would climb to 1,400. This
was Kostin&#8217;s second SP 500 forecast reduction in the past two
months, following his shift from 1,450 on Aug. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The unstable macro environment is likely to persist for
the foreseeable future because Europe currently lacks both the
institutional structure and policy tools to solve the festering
sovereign debt crisis,&#8221; the New York-based strategist wrote in
a report dated yesterday. &#8220;Investors believe a nontrivial
probability exists that the crisis will trigger a global
financial dislocation similar to 2008.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors have fled risky assets since July amid concern
European officials may fail to contain the region&#8217;s debt crisis
and the U.S. economy will slip into a recession, sending yields
on 10-year Treasuries to a record low and pushing the SP 500
down as much as 18 percent from its April high. Goldman Sachs is
the third Wall Street firm to cut its forecast for stocks this
week, following Wells Fargo  Co. and Barclays Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kostin kept his estimates on earnings by companies in the
SP 500 at $96 a share this year and $102 in 2012. The index
rose 1.7 percent to 1,209.11 at 4 p.m. New York time, the fourth
straight day of gains amid optimism Europe is working to tame
the credit crisis. The European Central Bank said today it will
lend dollars to euro-area banks in a series of three-month loans
to ensure they have enough of the U.S. currency through the end
of the year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMC Mortgage
unit was sued by Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the trustee for a mortgage
portfolio, for refusing to buy back more than 800 defective home
loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC rejected &#8220;repeated repurchase demands&#8221; for the loans
in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in a public version of the
complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. The case was initially filed under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of
defaults and foreclosures,&#8221; Wells Fargo said in the complaint.
&#8220;Approximately three-quarters of the loans in the trust have
been modified or liquidated, or are now seriously delinquent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint is the second Wells Fargo has filed as
trustee against EMC. The trustee settled a suit brought in
January after EMC agreed to turn over files for more than 2,000
underlying mortgages in the trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of 948 loan files revealed that at least 840, or
about 89 percent, failed to comply with EMC&#8217;s representations
and warranties, according to the complaint. As many as 1,503
mortgage loans are subject to repurchase, Wells Fargo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of those 1,503 loans, 49 percent already have been
liquidated, according to a letter filed as an exhibit to the
complaint. Principal losses on those loans, including accrued
interest, total about $214.4 million, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 51 percent of the loans are still held by the trust,
with an outstanding balance of about $344.5 million, according
to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage LLC, CA6861,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the largest
U.S. mortgage servicer, failed to make a list of companies doing
a satisfactory job of assisting homeowners struggling to pay
their mortgage, according to Fannie Mae. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 11 biggest servicers of Fannie Mae mortgages, Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), Citigroup Inc. (C), Ally Financial Inc. and EverBank
Financial Corp. are on track to receive satisfactory or better
grades under a newly created customer service and foreclosure-
prevention ratings system, the mortgage-finance company said in
a statement. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI), PHH
Corp. (PHH), PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (PNC), OneWest Bank FSB and
MetLife Inc. (MET) were the other companies that didn&#8217;t make the list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Servicers who achieve the highest ratings are leading the
way in providing assistance to homeowners who are having
difficulty making their mortgage payments,&#8221; Leslie Peeler, vice
president of servicer portfolio management for Washington-based
Fannie Mae, said in the statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan servicers interact with borrowers, collect mortgage
payments and oversee foreclosures. More than 228,000 U.S.
homeowners received foreclosure filings in August, the highest
total since March, RealtyTrac Inc. reported today. Default
notices rose 33 percent from July as lenders began to speed up
processing of paperwork delayed by probes into documentation
practices, the Irvine, California-based data service said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan Modifications &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has sought to prevent foreclosures
through its Home Affordable Modification Program, which pays
banks and servicers to modify monthly payments for delinquent
borrowers. About 675,000 homeowners have had permanent loan
modifications under the plan through July, compared with the
initial goal of as many as 4 million by 2012, according to the
Treasury Department. Another 2.42 million homeowners were
offered modification plans through proprietary programs from
servicers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Fannie Mae&#8217;s Servicer Total Achievement and Rewards,
or STAR, program, mortgage companies were scored based on the
number of distressed homeowners who receive help and the
customer&#8217;s experience, such as the response time for complaints,
in the second quarter. Satisfactory scores range from three
stars for &#8220;at least median performance&#8221; to five stars for
&#8220;superior performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is Fannie Mae&#8217;s first report on the STAR program,
announced in February. Servicers below the median or with
unsatisfactory results don&#8217;t receive a rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Wilson, a spokesman for Fannie Mae, said the company
wouldn&#8217;t discuss the servicers who failed to make the list of
those on pace for at least three-star ratings. Fannie Mae, which
has been in U.S. conservatorship since 2008, is the country&#8217;s
largest mortgage financier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working Toward Improvement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, which has given modifications to more than
910,000 borrowers since 2009, has &#8220;previously acknowledged that
there is room for improvement in key areas, particularly those
affecting the customer experience, and we are continually
improving our processes to assist distressed homeowners,&#8221; Rick Simon, a spokesman for the Charlotte, North-Carolina-based
lender, wrote in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our team will continue working to prevent foreclosure for
our customers who are experiencing hardships as a result of
unemployment, underemployment and other continued economic
conditions in our country,&#8221; said Simon, whose company announced
plans on Sept. 12 to slash 30,000 jobs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon declined to comment specifically on the Fannie Mae
report. Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for JPMorgan in New York, also
declined to comment, as did David Isaacs, a spokesman for
Pasadena, California-based OneWest Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks Over Status &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHH declined to comment because it is in talks with Fannie
Mae about its status on the list, Jonathan McGrain, a spokesman
for the Mount Laurel, New Jersey-based company, wrote in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife is &#8220;committed to the highest level of customer
service,&#8221; David Hammarstrom, a spokesman for the New York-based
insurer, said in an e-mail. &#8220;In the past 12 months the company
has completed over 8,000 workouts, including modifications,
repayment plans and forbearance plans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MetLife Home Loans received the second-highest ranking for
customer satisfaction among mortgage originators from J.D. Power
 Associates, a marketing-services company, Hammarstrom said.
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service this month downgraded its servicer-
quality rating of MetLife, citing deterioration in call center
customer services, which had &#8220;performance levels that are
significantly worse than its peers,&#8221; according to a Sept. 9
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fred Solomon, a spokesman for Pittsburgh-based PNC, didn&#8217;t
immediately return an e-mail seeking comment. Mike McCoy, a
spokesman for SunTrust in Atlanta, said the company wasn&#8217;t
immediately able to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hank Asher -- high school dropout,
cyber pioneer, friend to law enforcers, enemy to child
predators, nemesis of privacy advocates, ex-cocaine smuggler --
is back in the business of finding almost everything that&#8217;s
known about anyone in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement applauds Asher for his help in catching
child-predators. Defenders of privacy may regard the latest
version of his system to search databases and collate the
results as a menace, as they did his anti-terror Matrix system
developed during the Bush administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rival companies including Reed Elsevier Plc (REL)&#8217;s LexisNexis
Risk Solutions unit also may be paying attention, since on his
way to making almost half a billion dollars Asher invented
products they sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is &#8220;kind of a legend,&#8221; said Greg Lambert, who co-
founded a legal-tech blog and runs the library for the Houston

named it TLO Inc., The Last One. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asher&#8217;s field is data fusion, the collecting of bits of
information about people and businesses from thousands of data
bases and linking them to create a previously unseen mosaic:
typing in three Zip codes and getting a list of people who&#8217;ve
lived in all three, where they work and what they drive, for
instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brent crude and copper may rally as
global economic growth led by emerging markets remains adequate
to drive an expansion in raw-materials demand, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (GS) said, sticking with forecasts for price gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain constructive on commodities,&#8221; Allison Nathan,
an analyst at Goldman for more than a decade, said in an
interview today. Still, &#8220;risks to our bullish views have
risen,&#8221; said Nathan, citing Europe&#8217;s sovereign-debt problems
and a &#8220;mixed bag&#8221; of economic data from the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s position contrasts with the outlook from Societe
Generale SA&#8217;s global asset-allocation team, which said
commodities are in a &#8220;danger zone&#8221; as growth slows, according
to a report distributed yesterday. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI
Spot Index of 24 commodities has shed 14 percent since April 11
on speculation that the global recovery is faltering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen emerging-markets demand for key commodities,
including oil, holding up well,&#8221; Nathan said in Singapore.
There haven&#8217;t yet been signs that the economic woes in developed
markets are spreading to emerging economies, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman correctly advised investors to sell oil and copper
in April, then turned bullish in May before prices rebounded.
Last month, the bank forecast gains for Brent crude, zinc, and
other commodities over the next 12 months, analysts led by
Jeffrey Currie said in an Aug. 8 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper may climb to $11,000 per metric ton, while Brent
gains to $130 a barrel, the report said. Three-month copper on
the London Metal Exchange, which reached a record $10,190 per
ton in February, traded at $8,660 per ton at 4:10 p.m. in
Singapore, while Brent was at $112.60 per barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek Rescue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said yesterday that they are &#8220;convinced&#8221; Greece
will stay in the euro area, boosting equity and metals prices.
European governments are aiming to ratify a July 21 accord to
bolster a bailout fund and extend a second rescue to Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor skittishness over the spread of Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis combined with signs that U.S. growth may be slowing have
roiled markets worldwide. Recent data have shown U.S. retail
sales were unchanged in August, while the economy generated no
jobs and earnings fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we see weakness spreading on a global basis, that
would be a catalyst to expect a weaker demand environment and
potentially weaker prices relative to our forecast,&#8221; Nathan
said in the interview. &#8216;If there was a crisis in the European
banking sector, a crisis akin to 2008 could occur and that would
have a large impact on commodity prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Goldman economists forecast that China&#8217;s economic
growth may be 9.2 percent next year, compared with an estimate
of 9.3 percent for this year, according to Nathan. The nation is
the world&#8217;s largest user of metals and energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low inventories of aluminum, copper and steel in China are
an indicator that demand in the country &#8220;isn&#8217;t that bad,&#8221;
Julian Zhu, a Goldman analyst, said at a media briefing in
Singapore today. Traders and investors have been concerned that
rising interest rates and a credit-tightening policy in the
nation may lead to slower consumption of raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Chinese government is very flexible and if they need,
they can reverse the tightening policy very fast,&#8221; said Zhu.
&#8220;This could be very supportive to demand for commodities
because investment by local governments at all levels will see a
Rebound,&#8221; said Zhu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale&#8217;s report said that there may be a
&#8220;meaningful drop&#8221; in prices of so-called cyclical commodities
such as oil and copper. Gold may rally from an increase in risk
aversion, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) was hired to advise Huawei Technologies Co. on branding
strategy as the Chinese telecommunications gear supplier expands
into tablet computers, smartphones and cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project involves 25 consultants from the world&#8217;s
biggest computer-services provider and is expected to be
completed by the end of November, Ross Gan, a Huawei spokesman,
said in an interview today. Harriet Ip, a spokeswoman for
Armonk, New York-based IBM in Singapore, confirmed the
arrangement by phone today. Financial terms weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not a traditional branding project where they tell
us how the brand should be positioned,&#8221; Gan said in a phone
interview from Huawei&#8217;s headquarters in Shenzhen, southern
China. &#8220;It&#8217;s more from the management-of-the-process point of
view: How do I manage the brand function within the
organization? Who is responsible for what?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei is expanding its 13-year relationship with IBM as it
seeks to more than triple sales to $100 billion in the next 10
years by expanding into consumer digital devices and enterprise
computing. The thrust requires closely held Huawei to promote to
consumers, businesses and government agencies, including those
in the U.S., where efforts to buy rivals have been rebuffed amid
allegations the company threatens national security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.
in February told Huawei, founded in 1988 by former Chinese army
officer Ren Zhengfei, to divest its purchase of 3Leaf Systems
after lawmakers said the deal threatened national security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bids Thwarted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3Leaf, founded in 2004, developed technology for cloud
computing that lets businesses and government agencies move
applications and programs such as e-mail to remote networks
owned and operated by a third party. Huawei was also thwarted in
bids to buy 2Wire and Motorola Inc.&#8217;s wireless business last
year, and 3Com Corp. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei has said its employees own the company and China&#8217;s
government and military don&#8217;t hold any shares. Ren has had no
connection to the military since he retired from service more
than two decades ago, according to Huawei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei in April unveiled plans for the thrust into consumer
devices, including tablets, smartphones and &#8220;enterprise
computing,&#8221; setting up computer and communication networks for
businesses and government agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enterprise Computing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said at the time it expects enterprise
computing revenue to grow to as much as $20 billion within five
years, from $2 billion last year. Sales of mobile devices may
rise to $20 billion in the same period from $5 billion last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei&#8217;s relationship with IBM started in 1998 when Ren
began traveling to the U.S., Europe and Japan to learn
international best practices as his company expanded globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1999, the Chinese company added collaboration on
research and development and supply chain management to IBM&#8217;s
roles. Human resources management was added in 2005 and
financial management in 2007. The new contract is the first for
work on brand strategy from Huawei, Ip of IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM has a very strong branding strategy,&#8221; Ip said.
&#8220;After several rounds of doing this ourselves, we have the
expertise to help clients as well. That&#8217;s something we can share
with Huawei and our other clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huawei won its first contract outside China in 1997. It
achieved international sales of more than $100 million by 2000,
and overseas business exceeded contracts in China for the first
time in 2005, according to data supplied by the company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
exited a money losing bet that the dollar would weaken against a
basket of currencies after turmoil in European markets and
broader risk aversion added to the greenback&#8217;s refuge appeal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade was &#8220;stopped out&#8221; after a loss of 2.3 percent,
the New York-based securities firm said in a note today. On Aug.
10, Goldman recommended betting against the dollar with a basket
of currencies comprised of the New Zealand dollar, Russian
ruble, Swedish krona, South Korean won, Malaysian ringgit and
Chilean peso.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and
Citigroup Inc. (C) plan to offer $1.7 billion in securities tied to
commercial mortgages, resuscitating a deal that was withdrawn
after Standard  Poor&#8217;s withdrew its ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt will be marketed to investors next week, according
to people familiar with the offering who declined to be
identified because the deal hasn&#8217;t been announced. The issue was
originally $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction was pulled after it was placed with buyers
in July, rankling investors and bankers in the $600 billion
market. The banks canceled the issue on July 28 after SP said
it was halting its ratings of commercial-mortgage bonds because
of potential flaws in its models. The New York-based rating
company resumed grading the securities on Aug. 5, saying the
impact on ratings of the inconsistencies would be &#8220;generally
modest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering adds to more than $24 billion of the debt
issued in 2011, following $11.5 billion last year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its
forecasts for the euro versus the dollar amid signs the European
Central Bank&#8217;s focus on inflation has faded and as leaders
disagree over approaches to the region&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 17-nation currency will trade at $1.38 at year-end,
compared with an earlier forecast of $1.45, strategists John Normand and Thomas Anthonj wrote today in a client note. The
euro will fetch $1.40 in June 2012, compared with the previous
estimate of $1.48, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lowered its projections &#8220;to reflect ECB&#8217;s
dovishness and internal dissent over bond purchases,&#8221; the
London-based strategists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro weakened 0.6 percent to $1.3792 today in New York,
paring a weekly advance to 1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based financial firm joined banks including
BNP Paribas SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and
Nomura Holdings Inc. in lowering year-end targets for the euro
this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disagrees &#8220;with the emerging consensus that the
euro will trend lower over the next year,&#8221; Normand and Anthonj
wrote in their note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Europe faces an &#8220;enormous&#8221; funding challenge next
year, authorities also have put programs in place to manage the
debt crisis in peripheral countries, they wrote. There is
potential for the Federal Reserve to buy more Treasuries, and
the U.S. fiscal position will likely deteriorate if even parts
of President Barack Obama jobs program are approved, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation Risks Eased &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB said yesterday in its monthly bulletin that threats
to euro-area growth have intensified and inflation risks have
eased, signaling policy makers may take further action should
Europe&#8217;s debt crisis worsen. They raised they benchmark rate to
1.5 percent in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank has purchased 143 billion euros ($197
billion) of bonds to curb the euro region&#8217;s debt crisis,
starting with Greece, Portugal and Ireland last year and
widening to Italy and Spain in August. Germany&#8217;s Juergen Stark
resigned from the ECB&#8217;s board last week in protest of the bond
program, which he said blurs the line between monetary and
fiscal policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kweku Adoboli, the UBS AG (UBSN) trader
arrested in London yesterday, admitted to causing losses while
the bank&#8217;s risk-control officers were examining his trades, a
person with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS said yesterday it suffered a loss of about $2 billion
from &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli hired lawyers at Kingsley Napley in London to
represent him, a spokeswoman said today in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm previously advised Nick Leeson, who caused the
collapse of Barings Plc with $1.4 billion in losses in 1995.
Leeson, a former derivatives trader, caused the demise of
Britain&#8217;s oldest merchant bank after losses on the futures and
options markets in Singapore and Osaka, Japan, were uncovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, asked British police at 1
a.m. to arrest Adoboli before notifying the U.K. financial
regulator or prosecutors, according to two people familiar with
the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority was notified shortly after
police. Prosecutors at the Serious Fraud Office, which also
handles white-collar crime, weren&#8217;t contacted at all, according
to the people, who declined to be identified because the
investigations are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation highlights the fragmented financial crime
enforcement agencies in the U.K. with jurisdictions that often
overlap. That UBS went straight to police after learning about a
$2 billion loss on trades indicates that the 31-year-old Adoboli
may have been a flight risk, or that the bank wanted to distance
itself from any crime, said Lindsay Thomas, a financial
regulation adviser at Sustainable Risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS wants &#8220;to suggest that it was a terrible criminal act,
and that they were a victim,&#8221; Thomas said in a phone interview
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of London police arrested Adoboli at a business
address in London at 3:30 a.m. on suspicion of fraud and abuse
of position in connection with unauthorized trading at UBS&#8217;s
investment bank. Police declined to identify the address.
Adoboli remains in custody during the probe, Commander Ian Dyson
said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS is still investigating the matter, the Zurich-based
bank said in a statement. No client positions were affected, and
it may be unprofitable in the third quarter because of the loss,
UBS said, declining to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF Securities Sued by Former Executive in U.K. Over Bonus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF Securities Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest provider of
exchange-traded commodity funds, was sued in London by a former
employee who says he is owed a stake in the company tied to a
2006 bonus award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan Garcia, now an executive at another ETF firm, said
the bonus gave him options to buy 1,000 shares of the company at
49.99 pounds ($79) with no time limit, according to U.K. court
documents filed in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ETF Securities, based in Jersey, is considering selling as
much as $1 billion in shares through an initial public offering
amid growing investor demand for exchange-traded products,
according to a May report in the Wall Street Journal that cited
unidentified bankers familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graham Tuckwell, chairman and chief executive officer of
ETF Securities, said in a phone interview the case was
&#8220;absolutely without merit.&#8221; He said the claim was based on a
&#8220;small administrative error&#8221; and the options had expired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garcia was awarded the options because at that early stage
the company had &#8220;limited cash to fund its growth,&#8221; according
to documents filed by his lawyers. Tuckwell sent Garcia an e-
mail in May refusing to allow him to exercise the options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Levine, a partner at London law firm Mishcon de Reya
who is representing Garcia, said his client had a multimillion-
pound claim and declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cherrin v. ETF Security Ltd., HQ11X02645, High
Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Unit Must Buy Back $558 Million in Loans, Suit Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s EMC Mortgage unit was sued by Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), the trustee for a mortgage portfolio, for refusing
to buy back more than 800 defective home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC rejected &#8220;repeated repurchase demands&#8221; for the loans
in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo said in a public version of the
complaint filed Sept. 14 in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. The case was initially filed under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The loans have been plagued by an alarming rate of
defaults and foreclosures,&#8221; Wells Fargo said in the complaint.
&#8220;Approximately three-quarters of the loans in the trust have
been modified or liquidated, or are now seriously delinquent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint is the second Wells Fargo has filed as
trustee against EMC. The trustee settled a suit brought in
January after EMC agreed to turn over files for more than 2,000
underlying mortgages in the trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of 948 loan files revealed that at least 840, or
about 89 percent, failed to comply with EMC&#8217;s representations
and warranties, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Linehan, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage LLC, CA6861,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. to Sue ECB Over Planned Restrictions on Clearing Houses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain will sue the European Central Bank over plans to
prevent some euro-denominated securities from being cleared
outside the 17 countries that share the currency, in the first
such move by a government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. planned to present a legal challenge against the
ECB over its location policy for clearing houses at the European
Court of Justice in Luxembourg, the Treasury in London said in
an e-mailed statement Sept. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It does seem to indicate a possible change in the
approach that the U.K. is taking to Europe,&#8221; Darren Fox, a
financial services lawyer at Simmons  Simmons LLP, said in a
telephone interview in London. &#8220;There has been a perception in
the City that the U.K. hasn&#8217;t been doing as much in Europe as it
could have done to protect the interests of the U.K. financial-
services industry. Perhaps this is a sign that the worm is
turning.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the first time any European government has sought to
sue the ECB, the Treasury said. The U.K. is accusing the central
bank of going against principles of the European Union single
market and contravening European law amid wider international
efforts to regulate derivatives markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for the Frankfurt-based ECB declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Express Scripts Sues Walgreen Over Medicare Patients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) sued Walgreen Co. for what it called a
&#8220;campaign to disparage&#8221; the pharmacy-benefits manager in an
illegal attempt to wrest away customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreen, the biggest U.S. drugstore chain, is using false
advertising to encourage Medicare patients to leave Express
Scripts in violation of a contract that expires Dec. 31, St.
Louis-based Express Scripts said in a Sept. 7 complaint filed in
federal court in Chicago. Express Scripts said it will suffer
&#8220;irreparable damage&#8221; unless the court issues an injunction
stopping Walgreen&#8217;s action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreen, of Deerfield, Illinois, said in June that it will
not participate in Express Scripts&#8217; pharmacy network next year
because negotiations collapsed on renewing the contract worth
more than $5 billion in annual drug sales. A website sponsored
by Walgreen says Medicare recipients who remain with Express
Scripts won&#8217;t be able to fill Part D prescriptions after Dec.
31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is false and highly misleading because nothing will
prohibit Walgreen from continuing to fill valid prescriptions
for such members after Dec. 31, 2011, even if Walgreen is not a
part of Express Scripts&#8217; pharmacy network,&#8221; Express Scripts
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreen has asked the court to stay the proceedings,
saying in a Sept. 12 motion that Express Scripts brought its
claims in the wrong forum because the contract requires the
parties to resolve such disputes through binding arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think that it is important to inform our patients and
the public how this may impact their ability to fill
prescriptions at Walgreen next year if Express Scripts serves as
the pharmacy-benefit manager for their particular health care
plans, and we regret that Express Scripts has resorted to
litigation in an effort to stop us,&#8221; Michael Polzin, a
spokesman for Walgreen, said Sept. 14 in an e-mail. &#8220;We
obviously intend to vigorously defend against their suit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Express Scripts Inc. v. Walgreen Co. (WAG), 11-cv-
06223, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Investors&#8217; Derivative Spill Suits Dismissed by U.S. Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/) won&#8217;t have to face some lawsuits in the U.S. brought
by institutional investors on behalf of the company over last
year&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico drilling-rig explosion and oil spill, a
federal judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Keith P. Ellison in Houston agreed with
BP&#8217;s arguments that the claims should be filed in U.K. courts
because the company is based in London. Ellison said he may
reverse this dismissal if English courts &#8220;refuse to accept
jurisdiction&#8221; for reasons other than the plaintiffs&#8217; failure to
comply with procedural requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because this derivative lawsuit involves the internal
governance of an English corporation, the convenience of the
parties and the interests of justice favor England as a more
convenient forum,&#8221; Ellison said yesterday in a 31-page
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors sued BP claiming that the company&#8217;s management
and board caused the spill by knowingly putting profits ahead of
safety. The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in April 2010 while
drilling a BP well off the Louisiana coast, killing 11 and
spilling more than 4.1 million barrels of oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors&#8217; suits, so-called derivative claims brought
on behalf of the company, are combined with other shareholder
actions before Ellison in Houston. Lawsuits seeking money for
economic and personal injuries from the spill are consolidated
before a different U.S. judge in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The primary concern of this derivative litigation is the
internal affairs of an English corporation, and the suit seeks
to recover damages for the benefit of BP only,&#8221; Ellison said in
his ruling. &#8220;English law governs this dispute and will
determine whether the individual defendants breached their
fiduciary duties and harmed BP in the process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP spokesmen Scott Dean and Daren Beaudo didn&#8217;t immediately
return phone or e-mail messages seeking comment on the ruling
after regular business hours. Mark Lebovitch and Lewis Kahn,
investor attorneys, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re BP Shareholder Derivative Litigation,
4:10-cv-03447, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas
(Houston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lions Gate Suit Against Carl Icahn Voluntarily Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)&#8217;s lawsuit against
billionaire investor Carl Icahn in Manhattan federal court was
voluntarily dismissed by both sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lions Gate, an independent producer of films including
&#8220;Precious&#8221; and &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; and the &#8220;Mad Men&#8221;
television series, sued Icahn in October, claiming he tried to
interfere with the studio&#8217;s plan to merge with Metro-Goldwyn-
Mayer Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In papers filed with the court yesterday, both sides said
the case is being dismissed with prejudice, meaning it can&#8217;t be
reinstituted. The papers didn&#8217;t say whether the dismissal is
part of any settlement in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, U.S. District Judge Harold Baer dismissed most of
Lions Gate&#8217;s allegations, permitting it to go forward with a
claim that Icahn paid a special price for Dallas Mavericks owner
Mark Cuban&#8217;s 5.4 percent stake in Lions Gate, which the studio
said wasn&#8217;t fair to other investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Savitt, a lawyer for Lions Gate, and Joseph
DiBenedetto, who represents Icahn, didn&#8217;t return messages
seeking comment on the court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. V. Icahn, 1:10-
cv-08169, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT, U.S. Offer Plan for Confidential Data in T-Mobile Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T) and the U.S. Justice Department agreed on a plan
for handling confidential data in the government&#8217;s antitrust
lawsuit seeking to block the company&#8217;s purchase of wireless
carrier T-Mobile USA Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A filing by the department yesterday in federal court in
Washington sets definitions for what will be deemed confidential
and how that information will be disclosed in the case. ATT
didn&#8217;t oppose the department&#8217;s proposed order, the government
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides haven&#8217;t addressed the issue of how much
access ATT&#8217;s in-house lawyers will have to confidential
materials submitted by &#8220;non-parties&#8221; in the case, according to
the filing. The non-parties should have a chance to be heard in
court regarding how their confidential information will be
handled, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants wish to designate up to 10 (total) in-house
lawyers to have access to confidential information,&#8221; the
department said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Balmoris, an ATT spokesman in Washington, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a telephone message and an e-mail message
seeking comment on the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-
based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT, in a filing last week, said the T-Mobile deal is good
for mobile-phone customers because it would lead to better
service, fewer dropped calls and lower prices for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 and told the parties to be prepared to discuss
settlement options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman Doesn&#8217;t Take Stand as U.S. Rests in Insider Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Fleishman, the former Primary Global Research LLC
executive on trial over charges he participated in an insider-
trading scheme, didn&#8217;t take the stand in his own defense after
prosecutors finished their case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fleishman, of Santa Clara, California, is charged with two
counts of conspiracy for his role in what prosecutors said was a
scheme in which technology-company employees, working as
consultants for the company passed secret tips to hedge fund
managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government has rested and the defense has rested,&#8221;
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan told jurors
yesterday. &#8220;On Monday, we will have closing arguments and you
will get the case then.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said Fleishman&#8217;s lawyers may submit some written
evidence without calling witnesses to testify. After court,
Ethan Balogh, Fleishman&#8217;s lawyer, said his client wouldn&#8217;t
testify. If convicted, Fleishman faces as long as 25 years in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mountain View, California-based firm, also known as
PGR, matches employees of public companies with fund managers
for a fee. Of the 15 people charged in the probe, 12 have
pleaded guilty. Fleishman and Winifred Jiau, a former PGR
consultant convicted in June, were the only ones who have gone
to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also yesterday, former Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing
Co. manager Manosha Karunatilaka was sentenced to 18 months in
prison for his role in the scheme involving PGR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Balogh yesterday cross-examined Suk-Joo Hwang, a former
Samsung Electronics Co. manager who said he worked as a
consultant for PGR for seven years. Hwang said he sometimes
passed confidential information to PGR clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Fleishman, 11-cr-00032, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blame for 2010 Gulf Spill Will Be Decided by Trial Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which companies share the blame for the Gulf of Mexico oil
spill and will have to pay for it will be decided in a non-jury
trial set to begin Feb. 27, a federal judge in New Orleans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP), which owned the subsea well that exploded off
Louisiana in April 2010, claims Transocean Ltd. (RIG), Halliburton
Co. (HAL), Cameron International Corp. (CAM) and other contractors involved
in the offshore drilling operation share responsibility for
mistakes that caused the disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trial will address all allocation of fault issues
that may properly be tried to the bench without a jury,&#8221; U.S.
District Judge Carl Barbier said Sept. 14 in a written order.
This includes &#8220;the negligence, gross negligence, or other bases
of liability of, and the proportion of liability allocable to
the various defendants, third parties, and non-parties,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Macondo blowout and the explosion that followed killed
11 workers and set off the worst offshore oil spill in U.S.
history. The accident and spill led to hundreds of lawsuits
against London-based BP and its partners and contractors. The
lawsuits over economic losses and personal injuries have been
combined before Barbier in New Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits also name as defendants Transocean, the
Switzerland-based owner and operator of the Deepwater Horizon
drilling rig that exploded; Houston-based Halliburton, which
provided cementing services to the well; and Cameron
International, which provided blowout-prevention equipment. BP&#8217;s
minority partners in the well, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC) and
Mitsui  Co.&#8217;s Moex Offshore LLC unit, were also sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first test trial on damages is scheduled for July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Oil Spill by the Oil Rig Deepwater
Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico on April 20, 2010, MDL-2179, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgestone to Pay $28 Million Fine Over Bribes, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgestone Corp. (5108), the world&#8217;s biggest tire maker, agreed
to pay $28 million to settle criminal allegations it conspired
to bribe government officials in Latin America, the U.S. Justice
Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgestone will plead guilty to charges of plotting to rig
bids and make corrupt payments related to the sale of products
including marine hose, used to transfer oil between tankers and
storage facilities, Sharis A. Pozen, acting chief of the Justice
Department&#8217;s antitrust division, said yesterday in a statement.
The company said it will withdraw from the marine hose business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From as early as January 1999 until late May 2007, Tokyo-
based Bridgestone conspired to fix prices and allocate market
shares of marine hose in the U.S. and elsewhere, Pozen said. The
company allegedly conspired to make payments to Latin American
government officials to obtain and retain business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Bridgestone will cooperate with
the department&#8217;s investigation, according to the statement. The
agreement requires court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridgestone has dismantled its international engineered
products department, closed its Houston office and terminated
many of its third-party agents, the company said yesterday in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are committed to the efforts to further enhance and
expand our remediation measures, and to conduct business in
compliance with the competition and anticorruption laws around
the world,&#8221; Bridgestone said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermes Executive Says Takeover Win Locks in Independence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermes International (RMS) SCA&#8217;s founding family&#8217;s ability to set
up a holding company is &#8220;a decisive step&#8221; in the fight to
defend against a takeover, the luxury-goods maker&#8217;s deputy
managing director said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Paris court yesterday rejected an appeal by minority
investors who opposed a decision by the French market authority
waiving rules to allow the family to set up a holding company.
The family sought the structure to protect the Birkin-bag maker
after LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC), the world&#8217;s largest
luxury-goods maker, began building what is now a 21.4 percent
stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the holding company is in place, it will become
completely obvious that the claims of unity that have taken
place for months and have been questioned will be impossible to
challenge anymore,&#8221; Deputy Managing Director Patrick Albaladejo
said in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;This is a decisive
step.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Autorite des Marches Financiers was right to grant the
family permission to pool a 50.2 percent Hermes stake into a
holding company without bidding for the rest of the business, as
the regulator would normally require for a group with that large
a stake joining together, the Paris appeals court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court rejected the objections of minority investors
represented by a shareholder advocacy group Adam, which had
sought to have AMF force the family to make an offer for all
outstanding shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While LVMH has said it isn&#8217;t seeking control or a board
seat, its stake has prompted takeover talk. LVMH won&#8217;t be a
passive shareholder in Hermes and can provide its Paris-based
rival with strategic and operational help, LVMH Chairman Bernard
Arnault has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All the statements from the family have been very precise
and decisive on this, that they don&#8217;t want to engage in
discussions,&#8221; Albaladejo said, adding that he isn&#8217;t aware of
any contact with Arnault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermes wants LVMH to reduce its stake by more than half to
free shares on the open market, according to Bertrand Puech, who
heads the bag maker&#8217;s founding family. Even if LVMH doesn&#8217;t
reduce the holding, Hermes will run the company as it sees fit,
Puech has said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watson, Sandoz Pay $145 Million to Settle Drug-Price Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI), the generic-drug maker, will
pay $79 million and Novartis AG (NOVN)&#8217;s Sandoz unit will pay $66
million to resolve claims they defrauded U.S. and state
governments by causing Medicaid to overpay for drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both lawsuits were filed under the U.S. False Claims Act by
Ven-A-Care of the Florida Keys Inc., a specialty pharmacy. The
settlements resolved portions of the U.S. false claims cases and
similar claims by various states. The law allows whistle-blowers
to file on behalf of the government and share in any recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ven-A-Care has settled at least 18 lawsuits since 2000 that
have allowed state and federal governments to collect at least
$2.2 billion. Ven-A-Care has reaped more than $380 million in
whistle-blower fees during that period. James Breen, an attorney
for Ven-A-Care, declined to comment on the latest settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlements by Watson and Sandoz were filed Sept. 14 in
federal court in Boston, where U.S. District Judge Patti Saris
is overseeing the so-called Average Wholesale Price litigation
against drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charlie Mayr, a spokesman for Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson, declined to comment on the settlement. He referred to
the company&#8217;s last annual report, filed in February, that said
the company reached a settlement with Ven-A-Care for $79 million
in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims were &#8220;unfounded,&#8221; and Sandoz settled &#8220;to end
the uncertainty of protracted litigation,&#8221; Eric Althoff, a
spokesman for Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis, said in an e-
mail. &#8220;Sandoz is committed to conducting business in compliance
with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as our own
high ethical standards,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Pharmaceutical Industry Average Wholesale
Price Litigation, MDL No. 1456, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SABMiller&#8217;s Grolsch Wins EU Court Appeal of Antitrust Fine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grolsch, a unit of SABMiller Plc (SAB), the world&#8217;s second-
largest brewer by volume, won a European Union court appeal of a
31.7 million-euro ($43.8 million) fine levied for colluding on
beer prices in the Netherlands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antitrust officials didn&#8217;t give sufficient proof to
&#8220;establish the direct participation of Grolsch&#8221; in the cartel
and &#8220;failed to explain&#8221; why the company should be held liable
for the conduct of a Dutch subsidiary, the EU General Court, the
region&#8217;s second-highest tribunal, said in a ruling yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
fined Royal Grolsch NV, Heineken NV (HEIA) and Bavaria NV in 2007 for
fixing prices in the Netherlands from at least 1996 to 1999.
InBev NV, which has since merged with Anheuser-Busch Cos. to
become the world&#8217;s largest brewer, escaped a fine after tipping
off EU officials. Grolsch was bought by SABMiller in a takeover
completed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heineken won a cut to its fine to 198 million euros from
219.3 million euros in a ruling by the EU court in June. Bavaria
had its penalty trimmed to 20.7 million euros from 22.8 million
euros, after the court said the European Commission failed to
prove the extent of the cartel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission will &#8220;analyze the ruling carefully&#8221; and
will then consider whether to appeal the judgment or readopt the
cartel decision, Amelia Torres, a spokeswoman for the EU
regulator, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is: T-234/07, Koninklijke Grolsch v. Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York &#8216;Boiler-Room&#8217; Salesman Anderson Gets Two Years &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldwin Anderson was sentenced to two years in prison for
taking part in a &#8220;boiler-room&#8221; investment-fraud scheme on New
York&#8217;s Staten Island. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson, 57, a former salesman for Gryphon Holdings Inc.,
was sentenced yesterday by U.S. District Judge Jack Weinstein in
Brooklyn, New York. He&#8217;s been in custody since June 14, when he
admitted to participating in the crime during the second day of
his trial. He was the last of 18 defendants in the Gryphon case
to plead guilty and the only one to go to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gryphon misled investors into paying for phony stock tips
and investment advice, defrauding them of $20 million,
prosecutors charged. Gryphon told victims its office was on Wall
Street or even in the New York Stock Exchange when it was in a
strip mall on Staten Island, according to prosecutors in the
office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I lost sight of the truth, I lost sight of what was good
and I lost sight of the laws that govern this great country,&#8221;
Anderson told Weinstein at a Sept. 13 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anderson&#8217;s lawyer, Michael Padden, declined to comment
after the sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Marsh, 44, who ran Gryphon, was the last defendant
before Anderson to plead guilty, on April 14. He hasn&#8217;t received
his prison sentence yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Marsh, 10-cr-00480, and the
SEC case is SEC v. Gryphon Holdings Inc., 10-cv-01742, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the new service, Google can capture more information
about consumers&#8217; shopping behavior when they&#8217;re not on the
Internet. The agreement gives Visa, the biggest payment network,
a presence in three digital wallets: Google&#8217;s; its own, unveiled
in May; and Isis, a joint venture of mobile-phone companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Customers will make decisions as to which wallet they&#8217;re
going to use, and we want to make sure customers have a
choice,&#8221; said John Partridge, president of San Francisco-based
Visa, in a phone interview today. &#8220;We believe there will be a
number of different alternatives that will become available and
there won&#8217;t be one that becomes a standard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 300,000 terminals worldwide are enabled with the
technology, Partridge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s challenge now is spurring consumers to adopt the
service, said Richard Doherty, an analyst with Envisioneering
Group in Seaford, New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot tougher to implement than to model and to
prototype,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They really have to prove themselves
with this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) options traders are more
bearish than ever, betting the company will suffer more than
MasterCard Inc. (MA) from U.S. rules meant to foster competition
among firms that process debit-card transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month puts to sell San Francisco-based Visa should
the stock fall 10 percent cost 1.29 times more than calls, near
the all-time high of 1.30 on Sept. 14, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price relationship known as skew is
1.21 for Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, down from an 11-
month high of 1.31 on June 20, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa has rallied about half as much as MasterCard in 2011
after the Federal Reserve set rules that let retailers choose
from at least two networks for debit transactions that involve
the use of personal identification numbers. The Fed also capped
swipe fees that merchants pay for most debit transactions,
including those that require customers&#8217; signatures. Visa
processed $1.05 trillion of the payments last year, more than
triple the amount at MasterCard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It clouds the growth trajectory for a company like
Visa,&#8221; Walter &#8220;Bucky&#8221; Hellwig, who helps oversee $17 billion
at BBT Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama, said in a
Sept. 16 telephone interview. &#8220;It experienced a high rate of
growth for debit-card usage, and now maybe it&#8217;s not as high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa forecast that revenue will increase about 10 percent
in 2012, according to a filing on July 6, a week after the Fed&#8217;s
decision. The projection from Visa, which handled $5.6 trillion
in transactions during the year ended June 30, compared with its
estimate for 2011 sales to rise 11 percent to 15 percent.
MasterCard predicts its sales will grow 12 percent to 14 percent
a year through 2013, according to a slide show posted on the
company&#8217;s website Sept. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Valentine, a spokesman for Visa, and Jim Issokson, a
spokesman for MasterCard, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index fell 20
percent last week to 30.98 for its biggest slump since the
period ended July 1. The gauge of Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index
options prices has dropped 32 percent from a two-year high of 48
on Aug. 8, the first session after SP lowered its rating on
U.S. government debt. The gauge hasn&#8217;t closed below its 20.91
average for the past year since July 26. It rose 5.7 percent to
32.73 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s VStoxx Index (V2X), which measures the cost of options
to protect against declines by the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, dropped
14 percent last week, the biggest retreat since July 22, to
42.96. It jumped 6.2 percent to 45.61 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Card Purchases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa said U.S. credit-card purchases rose 9.8 percent to
$224 billion in the quarter ended June, compared with a 5.9
percent growth in the same period last year. U.S. credit-card
spending at MasterCard rose 6.1 percent, versus 1.1 percent in
the second quarter of 2010, the company said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price-earnings ratio for Visa is 19, or 12 percent less
than MasterCard and close to the record 14 percent discount on
Aug. 5, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. MasterCard&#8217;s
valuation first surpassed Visa&#8217;s in January. Financial companies
in the SP 500 trade at 11.1 times profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Economic conditions in the U.S. have slowed dramatically,
and that&#8217;s likely to be true elsewhere where Visa does
business,&#8221; Keith Wirtz, who oversees $16.7 billion as chief
investment officer at Fifth Third Asset Management in
Cincinnati, said in a Sept. 16 telephone interview. In a
recession, &#8220;you&#8217;re going to see revenues diminish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gross domestic product may expand by 1.6 percent this
year, according to the median of 79 economist estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. That&#8217;s down from a median forecast of 1.7
percent in August and below last year&#8217;s 3 percent rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts are more optimistic about Visa than MasterCard,
assigning average ratings of 4.69 and 4.53, respectively, on a
5-point scale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. David Koning, an analyst at R.W. Baird  Co. in Milwaukee, downgraded
MasterCard to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;outperform&#8221; in a Sept. 16
note, citing the stock&#8217;s year-to-date rally. He rates Visa
&#8220;outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa has climbed 28 percent this year to $90.03, falling
0.9 percent today after it said it agreed to a licensing deal
with Google Inc. that allows its cardholders to make purchases
and complete other transactions using their mobile phones.
MasterCard has risen 55 percent in 2011 to $347.98. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options traders are piling into bearish bets on Visa. The
company&#8217;s December $87.50 puts had the biggest rise in open
interest among all options in the past 30 days, increasing by
3,038 contracts to 3,812, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. January $72.50 puts jumped by the second-largest
amount, rising by 2,976, reaching 3,782 contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one time when I am probably grateful for not
having had the highest market share in debit in the United
States,&#8221; MasterCard Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga said
last year in a conference call with analysts, referring to
provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that spurred the Fed&#8217;s debit-
card rules. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm is &#8220;clearly wrong&#8221; in demanding $19 billion in
damages from JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) on behalf of creditors of the
Ponzi scheme operator, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been &#8220;settled law&#8221; since the 1970s that a
bankruptcy trustee cannot assert claims belonging to creditors,
JPMorgan said in a Sept. 16 filing in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan. Trustee Irving H. Picard defended his lawsuit against
the second-biggest U.S. bank earlier this month, saying he was
empowered by law to sue JPMorgan on behalf of the con man&#8217;s
innocent creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s &#8220;argument is so clearly wrong that the trustee
did not even make it to Judge Rakoff,&#8221; the bank said, citing
Judge Jed S. Rakoff&#8217;s July ruling in an HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) case
that Picard can&#8217;t sue on behalf of Madoff customers using
common-law claims against parties who failed to detect the
fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee and his counsel remain confident in our
position,&#8221; Amanda Remus, a Picard spokeswoman, said today in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is trying to persuade U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon to dismiss Picard&#8217;s damage claims, along with about
$1 billion of bankruptcy and other claims. Picard is fighting
for the right to demand most of the $100 billion he is seeking
from banks and Madoff investors, after Rakoff tossed almost
$9 billion in damages sought from HSBC and feeder funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Massive Gap&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an amended suit, Picard alleged that New York-based
JPMorgan, Madoff&#8217;s primary banker, &#8220;did know&#8221; about the fraud
and could have stopped it by notifying regulators. In the June
suit, he more than tripled his demand for damages, making it
equal to his estimate of all principal lost by all Madoff
investors by the time the Ponzi scheme collapsed in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Aggressive&#8221; plaintiffs often blame banks for a
depositor&#8217;s bad deeds, according to JPMorgan. Picard, though,
can&#8217;t identify any JPMorgan employee who conspired with Madoff
or discovered his scheme, even after &#8220;extensive&#8221; interviews
with bank employees, according to its filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a massive gap between the trustee&#8217;s blustering
accusations and the facts that he has actually alleged to
support them,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &#8220;The trustee&#8217;s damages claims
demand the absurd inference that JPMorgan deliberately joined
with Bernard Madoff in a doomed-to-fail Ponzi scheme so that it
could earn conventional banking fees,&#8221; which were small for the
bank, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 1:11-cv-00913,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aflac Inc. (AFL), the largest
supplemental health insurer, hired Eric Kirsch to oversee its
$93 billion portfolio after posting losses tied to investments
in banks from Greece Ireland and Portugal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirsch was previously global head of insurance asset
management at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) where he oversaw about
$75 billion for clients. Kirsch will be Aflac&#8217;s chief investment
officer and work out of New York, replacing Jeremy Jeffery who
will serve as senior vice president of fixed income, according
to a statement today from Columbus, Georgia-based Aflac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirsch will review hiring outside firms to help manage as
much as 10 percent of the company&#8217;s portfolio. The insurer,
which gets most of its revenue in Japan, was burned by
investments in European banks that issue debt in yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Income-oriented investors face challenges in the current
interest rate environment,&#8221; Kirsch said in the statement. &#8220;I
believe that we can maintain a favorable risk profile to the
portfolio, while improving returns by exploring new, yet
appropriate asset classes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirsch joined New York-based Goldman Sachs in 2007 after
overseeing more than $100 billion at Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s
insurance asset-management business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquefied natural gas prices are
surging to a three-year high as demand from Japan, China and
India outpaces supply increases, boosting sales for producers
from BG Group Plc (BG/) to Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Japanese imports to replace nuclear power after the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi disaster, plus a 27 percent jump in China&#8217;s
first-half purchases, may send prices to about $20 per million
British thermal units this winter, up 71 percent from 2010 and
the highest since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The world&#8217;s spare production capacity shrank about 50 percent
this year as consumption grew, and will continue to decline
through 2014, Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising LNG prices are encouraging Exxon and BG, which got
27 percent of its operating profit from the fuel in the first
half, to develop and transport more. That may spur North
American exports by 2016 and help the world&#8217;s fastest-growing
economies contain inflation from rising oil and coal costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;LNG demand will go up, there&#8217;s no other alternative,&#8221;
said P.K. Jain, the New Delhi-based director of finance at GAIL
India Ltd. (GAIL), the nation&#8217;s biggest gas distributor and a co-owner
of Petronet LNG Ltd., the largest buyer. &#8220;Demand will rise in
Asia as Japan increases LNG use after Fukushima and even in
Europe, with countries moving away from nuclear, long-term
demand for LNG may rise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Optimistic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for gas cooled to liquid and transported by ships
may be making U.S. forecasters more optimistic about natural
gas. Bulls outnumber bears by about six to one, a reversal from
the one-to-two ratio a month ago, according to Bloomberg data.
While gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange have
slumped 13 percent this year to $3.829 per million British
thermal units, LNG, which is not exchange-traded, has gained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquefied gas costs surged about 33 percent after Japan&#8217;s
March 11 earthquake and tsunami caused reactor meltdowns at
Tokyo Electric Power Co.&#8217;s Fukushima plant, and have since
climbed toward $16 per million Btu, according to Mark Greenwood,
an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in Sydney. They may rise to $20
this winter, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of eight analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country bought spot shipments at $15 per million Btu in
July, according to Ministry of Finance data. Spot deliveries,
typically from utilities facing emergency and weather-related
needs, reached a 33-month high in June and July. The 10 regional
power suppliers bought and consumed record amounts for a second
month in August amid all-time low utilization rates at nuclear
plants, the Federation of Electric Power Companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price Forecasts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see prices going to $20,&#8221; said Peter Buchanan, an
economist at CIBC World Markets Inc. in Toronto. His forecasts
for natural gas at Henry Hub in Erath, Louisiana, the benchmark
for futures traded on the Nymex, were the second-most accurate
after Bank of America Corp. for the eight quarters ended June
30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty percent of the 19 analyst forecasts compiled by
Bloomberg on Sept. 9 were bullish on U.S. gas, while 13 percent
were negative. That compares with 29 percent that were
optimistic and 57 percent bearish a month earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global LNG demand grew 9 percent in the first half and 13
percent over the past 12 months, Bernstein Research said in an
Aug. 29 report. Spare production capacity is likely to shrink to
26 million metric tons a year in 2011 and to 2 million by 2014,
stoking prices and benefiting BG, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA), Total
SA (FP) and PetroChina Co., according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Insufficient Supply&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the underlying strength in demand from emerging
markets and Japan, there is insufficient supply coming onto the
market over the next three years which will lead to tighter
spare capacity and higher prices,&#8221; Neil Beveridge, the Hong
Kong-based senior analyst at Bernstein, said in an e-mail.
&#8220;Asian customers will increasingly be competing with European
customers, which will lead to higher gas prices outside of North
America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atomic power provided about 30 percent of the electricity
in Japan, the world&#8217;s third-biggest economy, before March 11.
About 76 percent of Japan&#8217;s 54 reactors are offline, with more
scheduled to shut for maintenance. Demand is unlikely to ease
anytime soon as Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, who replaced
Naoto Kan as premier on Sept. 2, struggles to win public support
for restarting reactors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear reactors are
forecast to be brought into a state of &#8220;cold shutdown&#8221; by the
end of this year, Goshi Hosono, minister in charge of the
response to the nuclear crisis, said today at the International
Atomic Energy Agency&#8217;s general conference in Vienna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Decision &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Japanese tsunami certainly did increase the demand
quite dramatically for LNG imports into the region, which
effectively tightened the global LNG market more quickly than
most people had anticipated,&#8221; said Allison Nathan, a senior
commodities economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in New York.
&#8220;We now see the global market as tight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplies have become scarcer partly because Germany decided
on March 15 to close eight of its 17 atomic stations following
Fukushima. Qatar, the world&#8217;s biggest LNG producer, said Sept. 5
it will shut three of seven production lines for maintenance
through October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s senior vice minister of trade and industry, Seishu
Makino, asked U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu at a meeting in
San Francisco last week to increase exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheniere Energy, the Houston-based Blackstone Group LP-
backed owner of the Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana, got
approval to ship fuel to Japan in May. The Freeport terminal in
Freeport, Texas, and the Lake Charles facility in Lake Charles,
Louisiana, are also seeking clearance for exports, according to
Akinobu Yoshikawa, deputy manager for Japan&#8217;s Petroleum and
Natural Gas Division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impact for our imports will be big,&#8221; Yoshikawa told
reporters in Tokyo Sept. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North American Exports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the tsunami, Japan used about 70 million tons of LNG
a year. The demand will rise as much as 15 million tons, or 21
percent, in the 2011 fiscal year and as much as 20 million tons
in 2012, the Institute of Energy Economics said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North America may export about 5 billion cubic feet a day
of LNG, or roughly the combined LNG export capacity of Nigeria
and Algeria, globally by 2017 from projects that turn surplus
gas from shale-rock formations to LNG for shipment to customers
in Asia and Europe, according to the Eurasia Group, a New York-
based consultant. That&#8217;s about half of the six proposed
developments by companies including Cheniere in the U.S. Gulf
Coast and British Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. may produce more than 12 trillion cubic feet of
shale gas a year by 2020 in a &#8220;high-case scenario,&#8221; about a
three-fold jump from last year&#8217;s level, as it boosts output by
hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, of gas trapped in shale
deposits, Gaffney, Cline  Associates, a unit of Baker Hughes
Inc., the world&#8217;s third-largest oilfield-services provider, said
in a presentation in Singapore on Sept. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2020 Surplus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the high-case scenario, U.S. shale gas could provide
an exportable surplus by 2020,&#8221; Stuart Traver, a consultant for
the company in Singapore, said in the presentation. Shale gas
accounted for approximately 20 percent of total U.S. production
in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fracking, producers force chemically treated water into
underground shale wells to break up rock and let gas flow. About
84 trillion cubic feet of undiscovered, technically recoverable
gas lie in the Marcellus Shale under New York and seven other
states, the U.S. Geological Survey said Aug. 23. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is studying the effects of
fracking because opponents say it&#8217;s a threat to drinking water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar and producers such as Australia, Malaysia and
Indonesia are competing to satisfy demand for LNG from China and
India, the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economies. China&#8217;s
imports rose 27 percent to 5.2 million tons in the first half of
2011 from a year earlier and reached a record in July, according
to customs data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina Terminal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina started trial operations at its 3.5 million ton-
a-year Jiangsu LNG terminal in May and is buying two spot
cargoes a month. It may boost purchases in coming months, Liu
Wenfei, a director at the terminal, said Sept. 16. China
National Offshore Oil Corp., operator of three terminals, may
increase imports by 16 percent via its Guangdong facility this
year, a company official said the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s LNG imports increased 26 percent in the first half,
according to Bernstein estimates. The country&#8217;s gas use may
double to as much as 400 million cubic meters a day by 2016,
while domestic supply may be about 200 million cubic meters,
A.K. Balyan, managing director of New Delhi-based Petronet LNG,
said last month. The company is planning a 50 percent expansion
of capacity to convert LNG back into gas and has held talks with
Cheniere on supply contracts, Balyan said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While their LNG needs increase, the economies of Asia are
struggling to damp rising prices, including the costs of coal
and oil. China has raised interest rates five times since
October to contain inflation, which has been above the
government&#8217;s 2011 target of 4 percent every month this year.
Indian inflation has held above 9 percent throughout 2011 even
after six rate increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newcastle coal from Australia, an Asian pricing benchmark,
surged 29 percent since Sept. 24, 2010, to $122.90 a ton. Brent
crude oil futures rose 41 percent in the past year to $111.54 a
barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. may export enough LNG within five years to push
down global gas prices if the cost disparity between domestic
supplies and those in Europe and Asia remains about the same,
Gerard Mestrallet, the chairman and chief executive officer of
Courbevoie, Paris-based GDF Suez, Europe&#8217;s largest LNG importer,
said in a Sept. 9 interview in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia&#8217;s purchases of term LNG, or contractual supplies, are
typically priced off a basket of imported Japanese crude oil,
known as the Japan Crude Cocktail. Spot LNG is usually linked to
the U.K.&#8217;s National Balancing Point, with Asia paying a premium
to divert cargoes away from Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas in the U.S. trades at about $4 per million Btu,
while Asia pays at least $14, Traver said in the presentation.
North American LNG could be delivered at about $9 per million
Btu, encouraging utilities in Asia to seek a new pricing regime
linked to the U.S. benchmark, he said. Term supplies of LNG to
Asia have been linked to oil prices since Japan first started
buying the fuel more than four decades ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia may produce an additional 60 million tons of LNG
from projects in western Australia and coal seam gas ventures in
Queensland by 2016, according to Bernstein Research. That
includes the Gorgon project, developed by Chevron Corp. (CVX), Exxon
and Shell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short-term demand will be affected by temperatures in the
coming Northern Hemisphere winter, when heating requirements
increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Japan gets terribly cold weather, they&#8217;ll be out
buying in the spot market, driving up prices,&#8221; said Zach Allen,
president of Pan Eurasian Enterprises Inc., a Raleigh, North
Carolina-based tracker of LNG shipments who predicts prices may
rise 26 percent this winter. &#8220;Prices can always spike much
higher than that over very short periods.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suzano Papel  Celulose SA hired
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to manage a potential sale of its paper

obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzano is considering selling the assets in three blocks,

&lt;p&gt;Poland must overhaul its public
finances to reassure investors and increase its chances of
receiving a credit-rating upgrade like the neighboring Czech
Republic, a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-term measures may include speeding up state asset
sales, reversing recent tax cuts and canceling reductions in
social contributions, Magdalena Polan said in an interview. In
the longer-term, the government must eliminate privileges
enjoyed by some professions and reduce early retirement among
public workers, she added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a wrong time to talk about
structural reforms,&#8221; Polan said Sept. 15 in Warsaw. &#8220;Ratings
agencies really appreciated the stance of the Czech government,
which engaged in a number of long-term structural reforms with
the ambitious goal of balancing the budget.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland&#8217;s budget deficit soared to 7.9 percent of gross
domestic product in 2010, remaining above the European Union&#8217;s 3
percent limit for a third year. While ratings companies have
rewarded eastern European nations such as the Czech Republic for
lowering debt levels and overhauling pensions, Poland&#8217;s credit
grade may come under pressure as slower economic growth
threatens plans to trim the budget shortfall, Piotr Kowalski,
head of Fitch Ratings&#8217;s local unit, said Sept. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch rates Poland A- with a stable outlook, two grades
below the Czech Republic, which is at A+ with a positive
outlook. Standard  Poor&#8217;s upgraded the Czech Republic by two
notches Aug. 24, citing a &#8220; prudently managed and balanced
economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Reassurance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors would be most reassured&#8221; by a combination of
short-term measures to &#8220;make the country less exposed to market
fluctuations, together with a discussion of longer-term
measures,&#8221; according to Polan. The Czech upgrade &#8220;wasn&#8217;t just
because their fiscal metrics improved, but because of the
country&#8217;s resolve and political commitment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poland is relying on economic growth of 4 percent this year
and in 2012 to help it meet deficit goals and keep public debt
below a legal threshold of 55 percent of GDP. While Finance
Minister Jacek Rostowski said Sept. 15 that there was no reason
to change the 2012 forecast, Bank of America Corp. lowered its
2012 growth estimate to 2.9 percent the following day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The largest of the EU&#8217;s eastern members escaped recession
at the height of the global credit crisis in 2009. Still, the
government has struggled to improve public finances and Polan
doubts its ability to achieve a budget deficit of 2.9 percent of
GDP next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t think they will manage it,&#8221; Polan said,
predicting a deficit of 3.7 percent instead. &#8220;Whether Poland
could bring the deficit down to 3 percent of GDP in 2013 depends
to a great extent on growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC), the lender
burdened by its Countrywide Financial Corp. takeover, would
consider putting the unit into bankruptcy if litigation losses
threaten to cripple the parent, said four people with knowledge
of the firm&#8217;s strategy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option of seeking court protection exists because the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank maintained a separate legal
identity for the subprime lender after the 2008 acquisition,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the plans
are private. A filing isn&#8217;t imminent and executives recognize
the danger that it could backfire by casting doubt on the
financial strength of the largest U.S. bank, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat of a Countrywide bankruptcy is a &#8220;nuclear&#8221;
option that Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan could use
as leverage against plaintiffs seeking refunds on bad mortgages,
said analyst Mike Mayo of Credit Agricole Securities USA.
Moynihan has booked at least $30 billion of costs for faulty
home loans, most sold by Countrywide during the housing boom,
and analysts estimate the total could double in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the losses become so great, how can Bank of America at
least not discuss internally the relative tradeoff of a
Countrywide bankruptcy?&#8221; Mayo, who has an &#8220;underperform&#8221;
rating on the bank, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Countrywide bankruptcy could halt legal proceedings and
consolidate litigation into one court that would split up the
subsidiary&#8217;s remaining assets for creditors, said Jay Westbrook,
a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin. In effect,
this would trade one type of litigation for another, one of the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision would turn on whether the potential savings of
a filing outweigh the risks involved in disavowing some of the
firm&#8217;s obligations, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry DiRita, a Bank of America spokesman, said he couldn&#8217;t
comment on whether the company planned to file a Countrywide
bankruptcy. The bank &#8220;took great pains to preserve the separate
identity of Countrywide,&#8221; DiRita said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Federal ATT Suit Joined by New York, Six Other States &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. lawsuit seeking to block ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s acquisition
of T-Mobile USA Inc. was joined by seven states as their
attorneys general said the proposed $39 billion deal would hurt
competition and raise wireless telephone prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The states joining the amended complaint filed Sept. 16 by
the U.S. Justice Department in federal court in Washington were
New York, California, Massachusetts, Washington, Ohio,
Pennsylvania and Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation by the states bolsters the Justice
Department&#8217;s position and means any negotiated settlement of the
case would have to win the states&#8217; approval, said Herbert
Hovenkamp, a professor and antitrust expert at the University of
Iowa College of Law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the federal government wants to go for a settlement
and the states don&#8217;t like it, they can hold out,&#8221; Hovenkamp
said in an interview. &#8220;The judge would have to listen to their
complaints.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s antitrust suit claims that the merger of
the two companies, which would make Dallas-based ATT the
biggest wireless carrier in the U.S. and cut the number of
national competitors to three from four, is anticompetitive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Balmoris, a spokesman for ATT, said 11 state
attorneys general support the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to seek an expedited hearing on the
Justice Department&#8217;s complaint,&#8221; he said in an e-mail. &#8220;On a
parallel path, we have been, and remain, interested in a
solution that addresses the department&#8217;s issues with the T-
Mobile merger.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle has set a hearing
for Sept. 21 on the scheduling and told the parties to be
prepared to discuss settlement options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rakoff Will Decide If Madoff Trustee Can Sue for False Profits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said that he rather than a
bankruptcy judge will initially decide whether the trustee for
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities Inc. has the right to
sue customers for recovery of so-called fictitious profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Madoff&#8217;s customers, James Greiff, argued on July 29
Rakoff should take a lawsuit away from the bankruptcy court in
which Irving Picard, the Madoff trustee, sued Greiff for taking
more cash out of the Madoff firm that he put in. Picard has sued
hundreds of other Madoff customers on the same grounds. Rakoff
said in a ruling yesterday that he would make initial decisions
on two issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff told Greiff and the Madoff trustee to explain
whether the profits shown on Greiff&#8217;s account statements
represent valid debt to counter a fraudulent transfer claim.
Rakoff also wants the parties to explain whether a provision in
bankruptcy law known as the safe harbor bars suits because they
stem from trades in securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff said he will later file a written opinion giving
reasons for his ruling in detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff is revisiting the same issues that were decided in a
26-page opinion on Aug. 31 by U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood,
another federal district judge in Manhattan. Wood ruled that the
Madoff trustee is using valid theories to recover money
customers took out of the Ponzi scheme before the fraud was
discovered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood said that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton L. Lifland was
correct last year when he ruled Picard was justified in bringing
$34 million in claims against the Ariel and Gabriel funds
controlled by Ezra Merkin. Wood said Picard&#8217;s claims withstand
attack at the early stages of the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greiff case in district court is Picard v. Greiff, 11-
03775, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The Madoff liquidation case is Securities Investor
Protection Corp. v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
Inc., 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). The criminal case is U.S. v. Madoff, 09-cr-

&lt;p&gt;Mortgage Debacle Costs Banks $66 Billion as Suits Sap Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faulty mortgages and foreclosure abuses have cost the
nation&#8217;s five biggest home lenders at least $65.7 billion,
according to a tally by Bloomberg News, and new claims may push
the industrywide total to twice that amount, Bloomberg News&#8217;
James Sterngold reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. lender, had the
biggest costs, totaling $39.1 billion since the start of 2007,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM),
ranked second by assets, followed with $16.3 billion, and Wells
Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender, had $5.09 billion,
the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The costs have eclipsed predictions from bankers and
analysts that lenders would suffer only modest damage from what
Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan has
called &#8220;the mortgage mess.&#8221; Paul Miller, the FBR Capital
Markets  Co. analyst, said costs for all banks could surpass
$121 billion as the bill comes due for lax lending practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re not talking about improperly stapling together two
documents, you&#8217;re talking about systematic fraud in the
system,&#8221; Neil Barofsky, the former special inspector general
for the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief Program, said in
an interview. &#8220;What this shows is that before the financial
crisis, the banks were essentially lying to the purchasers of
the mortgages about the quality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg&#8217;s tally was compiled from regulatory filings,
company statements and financial presentations by the nation&#8217;s
five biggest mortgage lenders. The data cover provisions and
expenses attributable to repurchases, foreclosure errors and
abuses, payments to reimburse investors for lost value on faulty
mortgages, legal settlements and litigation expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compilation also includes writedowns of assets, such as
mortgage-servicing rights, when the company attributed the loss
in value to problems in mortgage underwriting or foreclosures
and the costs of remedies. The figures may increase as more
detailed breakdowns become available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Costco Workers&#8217; Group Case Blocked After Wal-Mart Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costco Wholesale Corp. (COST) won a ruling voiding a judge&#8217;s
decision to expand a sex-bias lawsuit filed by three women to
include hundreds of female workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court in San Francisco said Sept. 16 that
the lower-court judge applied the wrong legal standard and sent
the case back with instructions to apply the standards set by
the U.S. Supreme Court in its June ruling throwing out a group
gender-bias lawsuit against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costco, the biggest U.S. warehouse-club chain, was sued in
2004 for allegedly limiting promotions of female employees to
assistant general manager and general manager by failing to post
job openings. The original plaintiffs won class, or group,
status for the case in 2007. Costco&#8217;s appeal of that order was
put on hold while the Supreme Court considered Bentonville,
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart&#8217;s appeal of a similar ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jocelyn Larkin, an attorney for the workers, said she was
delighted with the ruling because employees had argued that the
case should go back to the lower court for further consideration
while Costco claimed that no national class of company employees
could be certified on the evidence in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The panel rejected Costco&#8217;s position and remanded as we
proposed,&#8221; Larkin said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeff Elliott, a spokesman for Issaquah, Washington-based
Costco, declined to comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ellis v. Costco, 07-15838, U.S. Court of
Appeals, San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News Corp. (NWSA) Ex-Employee Said to Be Contacted for U.S. Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors investigating hacking and bribery allegations
at Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s News Corp. are seeking to interview a former
employee of a U.S. unit who claims knowledge of illegal activity
at the company, according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors in Manhattan this month contacted a lawyer
for Robert Emmel, a former account director at News America
Marketing In-Store LLC, about allegations of hacking and
possible violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, said
the person, who wasn&#8217;t authorized to discuss the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emmel said in court papers that he had evidence of
&#8220;widespread illegal activity&#8221; at News Corp.&#8217;s retail marketing
unit and gave it to federal lawmakers and regulators in 2006,
the year the company fired him. Emmel made the allegations in a
lawsuit News America Marketing brought against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carly Sullivan, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in New York, declined to comment on whether prosecutors
had made the contact. Emmel declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Hilder , a lawyer for Emmel, said in an interview
that &#8220;authorities have reached out&#8221; to him. Hilder declined to
identify the investigators or what they are seeking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Halpin, a spokeswoman for News Corp., declined to
comment on the development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The breach of contract case is News America Marketing In-
Store LLC v. Emmel, 07-cv-00791, U.S. District Court, Northern
District of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach Wins TCW Pay Claim, Is Found Liable on Trade Secret &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Gundlach, who was fired from TCW Group Inc. and
started his own firm, won a $66.7 million jury award against his
former employer for unpaid wages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who has to share the money with three of his
colleagues, was also found Sept. 16 to have breached his
fiduciary duty to TCW and misappropriated its trade secrets. The
Los Angeles jury awarded the company no damages on the breach
claim. A judge will determine damages on the trade-secret claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Estrich, a lawyer for TCW, said the company will ask
the judge to award it $89 million on the trade-secret claim. The
company also won a claim for intentional interference with
contractual relations. The jury awarded no damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very pleased and gratified with the verdict,&#8221;
Estrich said outside the courtroom. &#8220;This was about liability,
about standing up for what is right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, the Los Angeles-based unit of Societe Generale (GLE) SA,
sued Gundlach, 51, in January 2010, after more than half of its
fixed-income professionals joined DoubleLine Capital LP, the
asset-management firm Gundlach started within weeks after TCW
fired him. TCW sought as much as $566 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brad Brian, a lawyer for DoubleLine, said it could be
months before the judge rules on the &#8220;reasonable royalty&#8221; for
TCW&#8217;s trade-secret claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury found that Gundlach and DoubleLine didn&#8217;t act
willfully and maliciously in misappropriating trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very pleased the jury agreed Jeffrey Gundlach and
our other clients didn&#8217;t do anything to hurt TCW,&#8221; Brian said.
&#8220;This was not an easy trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Cahill, TCW&#8217;s general counsel, said in an e-mailed
statement that the verdict &#8220;speaks directly to the principles
at the heart of this case -- integrity, honesty and trust. The
jury found that each of the defendants violated these
principles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gundlach, who had worked at TCW for 25 years and was named
Morningstar&#8217;s Fixed Income Manager of the Year in 2006,
countersued, saying TCW fired him to avoid having to pay
management and performance fees for the distressed-asset funds
his group managed and that went &#8220;through the roof.&#8221; Gundlach
sought about $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury heard more than six weeks of testimony as the two
sides provided conflicting views of Gundlach&#8217;s falling out with
TCW Chief Executive Officer Marc Stern in 2009, which ended with
Stern&#8217;s buying Metropolitan West Asset Management LLC to run
TCW&#8217;s fixed-income group and firing Gundlach in December 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Co. of the West v. Gundlach, BC429385,

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual Group Settles Suit Accusing Lawyer of Extortion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. settled a lawsuit the insurer
filed against one of its former outside lawyers claiming he
tried to extort new legal work with a threat to expose
misconduct by an unidentified company executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Richard J. Sullivan in Manhattan
ordered the case dismissed after receiving a letter on Sept. 8
from Boston-based Liberty Mutual informing the court that it had
reached an agreement with Michael J. Devereaux and his law firm
Devereaux  Associates, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual sued Devereaux in January, saying the New
York lawyer threatened to file a suit claiming the executive
engaged in &#8220;personal misconduct&#8221; and demanded a 5 percent
kickback of all fees the company paid the law firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased that the litigation has been resolved and
that we have concluded our relationship with the Devereaux
firm,&#8221; Liberty Mutual said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Devereaux didn&#8217;t return a message seeking comment on the
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liberty Mutual Insurance Co. v. Michael J.
Devereaux  Associates PC, 11-cv-359, U.S. District Court,

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli Charged With Fraud, False Accounting Dating to 2008 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kweku Adoboli, the trader arrested Sept. 15 after UBS AG (UBSN)
said it discovered unauthorized trades that caused a $2 billion
loss, was charged with fraud and two counts of false accounting
dating back to 2008 by London police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 31-year-old was remanded in custody at a magistrates
court in London Sept. 16 until Sept. 22, when he can make an
application for bail. Adoboli&#8217;s false accounting offenses
started in October 2008, according to the court charge sheet. He
is also charged with fraud dating back to January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli &#8220;dishonestly abused&#8221; his position as a senior
trader, which required him &#8220;to safeguard, or not to act
against, the financial interests of UBS,&#8221; according to court
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli worked for UBS&#8217;s investment bank on its Delta One
desk, which handles trades for clients, typically helping them
to speculate on or hedge the performance of a basket of
securities. The group also takes risks with the bank&#8217;s own money
in arranging trades. UBS has said that no client positions were
affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hired criminal law firm Kingsley Napley LLP in London to
represent him. Lawyers from the same firm advised Nick Leeson,
the former derivatives trader who caused the collapse of Barings
Plc with $1.4 billion in losses in 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli wore a sky-blue sweater over a white shirt for his
appearance in court Sept. 16 and didn&#8217;t speak apart from
confirming his name and date of birth. He didn&#8217;t enter a plea.
Kingsley Napley said in an e-mailed statement it wouldn&#8217;t
comment on behalf of its client. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Services Authority and the Swiss
Financial Market Supervisory Authority said they would also
investigate the UBS trading losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation, to be carried out by a third party, will
focus on &#8220;the control failures which permitted the activity to
remain undetected&#8221; and &#8220;will include an assessment of the
overall strength of UBS&#8217;s controls to prevent unauthorized or
fraudulent trading activity in its investment bank,&#8221; the FSA
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NewPage Bankruptcy Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy docket of NewPage Corp., the largest maker of
coated papers in North America, was the most-read litigation
docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NewPage, based in Miamisburg, Ohio, filed the biggest
bankruptcy of 2011 by assets listing $3.4 billion in assets and
$4.2 billion in debt as of June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 8, NewPage won temporary court permission to
borrow as much as $600 million to keep operating while it tries
to restructure at least $2.6 billion in bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re NewPage Corp. 11-12804, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) paid over 1 million
pounds ($1.57 million) to buy the silence of a female executive
unfairly passed over for the job of managing director for the
software company&#8217;s U.K. operations, the Daily Telegraph
reported, citing unidentified people at Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natalie Ayres worked at Microsoft for 15 years and was
widely tipped to become U.K. managing director in 2006; her
interview process was still under way when Microsft named Gordon
Frazer, general manager of Microsoft South Africa, to the post,
the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayres received a seven-figure payoff when she left at the
end of 2006; Microsoft said it didn&#8217;t comment on individual
employees and placed great importance on the core values of
diversity, the Telegraph reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kulczyk bought a stake in a company called Centar, taking
the post of chief executive officer, while JPMorgan&#8217;s Ian Hannam

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, raised its quarterly dividend 25 percent
to 20 cents, providing investors with a payout at the upper end
of forecasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new dividend is a penny more the 19 cents a share
projected by Bloomberg data and compares with the 18 cents to 20
cents estimated by Heather Bellini, an analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. in New York. The change, announced in a statement
today, boosts the yield to 2.97 percent from 2.37 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft generally has a policy of boosting the dividend
in line with operating income. While the increase exceeded the
13 percent growth in operating income in the past fiscal year,
investors were seeking more, Bellini said. The company&#8217;s cash
and short-term investments surged 43 percent last year, and
shareholders wanted a bigger piece of that hoard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s ability to return cash to shareholders is
hampered by the fact that much of that money is held
internationally and would require the company to pay taxes to
bring it back into the country for the purpose of paying a
larger dividend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $45 billion, or 85 percent of the company&#8217;s cash and
short-term investments, is held outside the U.S., the company
said in a July 28 regulatory filing. Around half of annual cash
flow from operations is generated abroad, Bellini estimated,
which gives the company about $15 billion to $17 billion to
spend on dividends and share repurchases this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double It &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, Neil Herman, an analyst at Ticonderoga Securities
LLC, suggested in an August report that the company should
double its dividend in order to boost its share price. The
shares, which have declined 3.3 percent this year, might surge
past $35 with an increase of that magnitude, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 23
cents to $26.98 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. They rose to
$27.10 in late trading after the increase was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before today, Microsoft has paid out about 25 percent of
earnings as dividends since starting the payments in 2003,
according to Bloomberg data. Dividend-paying companies with
similar market valuations to Microsoft are paying closer to 40
percent to 50 percent, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also said today it will continue its $40
billion stock buyback plan begun in 2008. The program, which
expires in 2013, had about $12.2 billion remaining as of June
30, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IPC index fell 2.1 percent to 34,337.97. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alfa SAB (ALFAA MM), the world&#8217;s largest producer of
aluminum engine heads, dropped 2.3 percent to 147.91 pesos on
concern that Greece wasn&#8217;t closer to receiving more financial
aid, stoking fears that the global economy will continue to
struggle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB (KOFL MM), Latin America&#8217;s largest Coke
bottler, advanced 2.3 percent to 125.77 pesos after agreeing to
buy the bottling operations of Grupo Cimsa in a transaction
valued at 11 billion pesos ($831 million). Cimsa shareholders
will receive 75.4 million newly issued Coca-Cola Femsa shares
valued at 118 pesos each, the companies said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cemex SAB (CEMEXCPO MM), the largest cement maker in the
Americas, plunged 8.7 percent to 5.57 pesos, extending its two-

this year and trade at their lowest price since March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. (DIS), the world&#8217;s
biggest theme-park operator, unveiled plans for attractions
based on the top-grossing 3-D movie &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; starting at its
Animal Kingdom in Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Cameron, who directed Fox&#8217;s 2009 science-fiction
thriller, will serve as a creative consultant in development of
&#8220;Avatar&#8221; lands at the parks, officials of Burbank, California-
based Disney said today at a press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company has increased spending in its resorts division,
including a new theme park in Shanghai, a vacation project on
the Hawaiian island of Oahu and an expansion of California
Adventure in Anaheim. Investments in parks, resorts and other
properties totaled $2.56 billion through nine months of the
fiscal 2011, almost double the year earlier tally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With this agreement, we have the extraordinary
opportunity to combine James&#8217;s talent and vision with the
imagination and expertise of Disney,&#8221; Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction is scheduled to begin by 2013 and take five
years, said Disney, which licensed worldwide theme park rights
to &#8220;Avatar&#8221; from Cameron&#8217;s Lightstorm Entertainment and News
Corp.&#8217;s Twentieth Century Fox studio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project is expected to cost about $400 million,
according to a person with knowledge of the situation who wasn&#8217;t
authorized to speak publicly. Cameron&#8217;s first &#8220;Avatar&#8221; film
sequel is scheduled for release in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fell 20 cents to $32.31 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 14 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Box-Office Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Avatar&#8221; has collected $2.78 billion in worldwide
theatrical sales, the most of any film, according to Box Office
Mojo, an industry researcher. That eclipsed the previous record
of $1.84 billion for &#8220;Titanic,&#8221; also directed by Cameron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film took place on a moon called Pandora, where humans
leading a mining effort were pitted against the native Na&#8217;vi
people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme parks accounted for 28 percent of Disney&#8217;s $38.1
billion in sales in the year ended in September 2010 and
contributed $1.32 billion in operating income, or 17 percent of
the total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locations for other &#8220;Avatar&#8221; themed lands will be
determined by Disney and its international theme park partners,
the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Molycorp Inc. (MCP), the owner of the
world&#8217;s largest rare-earth deposit outside China, fell the most
since its 2010 initial public offering after JPMorgan Chase 
Co. lowered its rating, citing declines in rare-earth prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molycorp dropped $11.56, or 22 percent, to $41.45 at 4:02
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
began trading in July 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut its recommendation to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;overweight,&#8221; Michael Gambardella, a New York-based analyst,
said in a report today. JPMorgan lowered its price target for
Molycorp to $66 from $105. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rare earths, a group of 17 elements used in electronics and
magnets, have dropped in price because of selling by
speculators, Gambardella said. Molycorp, based in Greenwood
Village, Colorado, was the best-performing U.S. IPO last year,
more than tripling after rare-earth prices soared as China cut
export quotas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A large part of this year&#8217;s run up and recent drop was
caused by a host of players in China speculating on rare earth
oxides,&#8221; Gambardella said in the note. &#8220;We are taking a more
cautious stance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerium oxide has dropped 30 percent since its peak in June,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Lanthanum oxide and
neodymium oxide prices have also fallen, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China accounted for more than 90 percent of rare-earth
output in 2009 and more than half of its consumption, U.S.
government data show. &lt;/p&gt;

it&#8217;s opening an investigation into Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) after finding
evidence of practices that could potentially restrict
competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation was opened following a complaint,

18 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have received the formal notice on the CNC

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, is
offering a new software product that automates marketing and
speeds up sales to entice businesses to use its servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all of a company&#8217;s product and customer data is on IBM&#8217;s
servers, IBM&#8217;s analytics can help it sell more efficiently to
other businesses and consumers, the company said in a statement.
For example, sales campaigns could be based on where products
are geographically located and marketing campaigns could be
automatically generated based on the tone of a customer&#8217;s
Twitter post about a product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new product, which is the next step in IBM&#8217;s Smarter
Commerce initiative, is part of a push to make $7 billion by
2015 from cloud computing, which allows a company to store and
access data from IBM&#8217;s servers, the company said. IBM, based in
Armonk, New York, has made &#8220;heavy investments&#8221; in the area,
including $2.5 billion in acquisitions and hundreds of millions
of dollars in research, said Craig Hayman, who oversees Smarter
Commerce as general manager of IBM Industry Solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product &#8220;clarifies what these acquisitions in the fall
were about, and gives a clear example of one of the ways IBM
plans to pursue the cloud,&#8221; said Josh Olson, a Des Peres,
Missouri-based analyst for Edward Jones  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acquisitions, Competitors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, IBM acquired Unica Corp. and Coremetrics, which
use analytics for online marketing, and Sterling Commerce, which
helps companies manage their relationships with partners and
suppliers. The company has said it plans to spend about $20
billion on acquisitions through 2015, after ending last year
with $10.7 billion in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competitors Oracle Corp. (ORCL), SAP AG (SAP) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) have
not gone as far as IBM in using cloud technology for business
services, Gene Alvarez, a Stamford, Connecticut-based analyst
for Gartner Inc., said. IBM&#8217;s technology could attract
industries like health care and telecommunications by doing for
business-to-business transactions what Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) does on
its website, providing individualized marketing, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now have organizations that you never would have
thought of as e-commerce organizations, wanting a system like
that,&#8221; Alvarez said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natura Cosmeticos SA (NATU3), Latin
America&#8217;s largest cosmetics maker, declined for a sixth day in
Sao Paulo after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended selling the
stock on concern profits will suffer from rising competition and
inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natura extended the longest losing streak since June,
dropping 4.5 percent to 32.82 reais at 2:06 p.m. New York time.
It was the biggest decliner on the 68-member Bovespa index,
which advanced 0.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Natura faces intensifying competitive and structural
headwinds that raise uncertainty around future growth,&#8221;
analysts at Goldman Sachs, including Irma Sgarz, wrote in a note
to clients today. They cut their rating to &#8220;sell&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report from the national statistics agency today showed
that consumer prices rose 0.53 percent in the month through mid-
September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. echoed the concern in an e-mail to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Natura suffers a lot with rising inflation,&#8221; wrote
analysts Andrea Teixeira and Felipe Oliveira, who have a
&#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on the stock. &#8220;Sales growth continues to be

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin
America&#8217;s largest Coke bottler, said it will account for half of
Mexico&#8217;s Coca-Cola sales after completing an agreement to buy
the bottling operations of Grupo Cimsa with new shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction, valued at 11 billion pesos ($837 million)
in stock and assumed debt, tops the acquisition of Mexican
bottler Grupo Tampico for 6.55 billion pesos of shares and 2.75
billion pesos of debt announced by the Mexico-City based company
in June. Tampico was Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s largest purchase since it
bought Panamerican Beverages Inc. for $3.6 billion in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition announced yesterday of Cimsa, a closely
held company that sells Coca-Cola products mostly in the central
states of Morelos and Mexico, marks the second transaction this
year in which Coca-Cola Femsa offered shares instead of cash.
That&#8217;s designed to reduce resistance by family-owned companies
to sell out and exit the soft-drink business completely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidation of Coke bottlers in Mexico &#8220;is likely to
continue as third-generation owners of smaller Coke bottling
operations swap their controlling equity stakes for minority
positions in a larger bottler,&#8221; Alan Alanis, a New York-based
analyst with JPMorgan Chase  Co., said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa rose 1.89 pesos, or 1.5 percent, to
124.87 pesos in Mexico City trading at 12:05 p.m. New York time.
The shares gained 20 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Cuernavaca, Mexico-based Cimsa
&#8220;confirms that our company represents an attractive,
transparent and diversified investment vehicle for families that
have been in the beverage industry for a long time,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Carlos Salazar said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mexico Consolidation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cimsa and Tampico transactions follow the merger,
completed in June, of Mexico&#8217;s second-largest and third-largest
Coke bottlers to form Arca Continental SAB. There are now eight
family-owned Coca-Cola bottlers left in Mexico that may be
targets for Coca-Cola Femsa or Arca Continental, said Alanis,
the JPMorgan analyst. He rates Coca-Cola Femsa &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders of Cimsa, whose bottling operations are called
Corporacion de los Angeles SA, will receive 75.4 million newly
issued Coca-Cola Femsa shares valued at 118 pesos each, the
companies said yesterday. Coca-Cola Femsa will absorb net debt
of 2.1 billion pesos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost Savings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cimsa, which also has operations in the states of Guerrero
and Michoacan, is forecast to sell 159 million unit cases this
year, Coca-Cola Femsa said. A 13.2 percent stake in Promotora
Industrial Azucarera SA, a Mexican sugar company, is included in
the acquisition. Cimsa&#8217;s bottling unit is forecast to have 2011
revenue of 4.79 billion pesos and earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization -- a measure of cash flow
known as Ebitda -- of 1.1 billion pesos, Coca-Cola Femsa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2011 estimated Ebitda margin for Cimsa is 23 percent,
higher than 20 percent for Coca-Cola Femsa in this year&#8217;s first
half, Luis Miranda, an analyst at the Mexican unit of Banco
Santander SA, wrote in a report today. He recommends buying
Coca-Cola Femsa shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view this news as positive,&#8221; Miranda wrote. &#8220;The
operation is accretive from the operating side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company expects to achieve annual cost savings of more
than 260 million pesos from Cimsa&#8217;s bottling unit because it
touches Coca-Cola Femsa&#8217;s territories on three sides, Hector Trevino, the company&#8217;s chief financial officer, said in a
telephone interview. The amount of &#8220;synergies&#8221; allowed the
company to pay 10 times annual Ebitda, compared with 9.6 times
for Tampico, he said. Cost savings with Tampico will be in a
range of 180 million pesos to 270 million pesos, Trevino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Achievable&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re very sure that the 260 million pesos of annual
synergies is very achievable and perhaps a bit conservative
because of the proximity,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the issue of new shares for the acquisition, Cimsa
will own 3.8 percent of Coca-Cola Femsa. Coca-Cola Co. (KO)&#8217;s stake
in the company will drop to 29.4 percent from 30.6 percent and
Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB will have about 50 percent, down
from 51.9 percent. Tampico will hold 3.2 percent, and the
remaining 13.6 percent of the shares trade publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cimsa operates three bottling plants and 18 distribution
centers and has 4,600 employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa and Cimsa will seek shareholder approval in
special meetings. The transaction also requires approval from
Mexico&#8217;s antitrust agency and Coca-Cola Co., according to Coca-
Cola Femsa&#8217;s statement. Coca-Cola Femsa will hold a conference
call tomorrow at 11 a.m. New York time to discuss the deal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) offered to resolve a European Union investigation into
claims the company blocked competition from rival providers of
maintenance services for mainframe computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the Brussels-based EU antitrust
regulator, today asked for comments on IBM&#8217;s commitments to
ensure the availability of spare parts and technical data. The
commission also closed a separate probe over IBM&#8217;s mainframe
computers after three competitors dropped complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission in 2010 opened investigations into Armonk,
New York-based IBM over possible conduct that may have blocked
competitors in mainframe software and maintenance contracts by
restricting access to parts. While IBM has shifted its focus
away from hardware toward its more profitable software and
services businesses, the mainframe operations have high gross
margins and help pull in revenue for other divisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems that IBM has taken a pragmatic approach and
determined that these commitments do not constitute a
significant issue for them and that it&#8217;s preferable to get a
settlement and put this probe behind them instead of fighting
till the end,&#8221; Christian Riis-Madsen, an antitrust partner in
Brussels at law firm O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP, said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-Discriminatory Terms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM offered commitments to resolve concerns it may have
imposed unreasonable conditions for supplying competing
mainframe maintenance-service providers in breach of EU
antitrust rules. IBM will ensure that third-party providers
receive technical information &#8220;under reasonable and non-
discriminatory terms,&#8221; the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in an e-mailed statement that it
&#8220;welcomes&#8221; the commission&#8217;s decision &#8220;to close the
investigation of IBM&#8217;s mainframe and associated intellectual
property rights.&#8221; The company said it also looked forward to
providing the basis for the final resolution of the probe into
maintenance practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 1.8 percent to $176.30 in New York Stock Exchange
trading at 4:32 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM does not agree with the commission&#8217;s preliminary
assessment&#8221; that the company may have abused &#8220;a dominant
position on the market for certain inputs necessarily required
for the maintenance of IBM mainframe hardware and software,&#8221;
the commission said in an EU document published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments on IBM&#8217;s practices can be submitted to the
commission within a month. After that, the agency will either
make the commitments legally binding, without saying whether
there was an infringement, or start another round of market
testing if there are substantial changes to the remedies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) is another U.S. technology company under EU
scrutiny, with a focus on whether the world&#8217;s largest Web search
company has a dominant position that allows it to influence the
behavior of Internet users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Antitrust Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said last week
that he is investigating whether Mountain View, California-based
Google is a gate keeper and able to influence the behavior of
Internet users. A string of antitrust probes against technology
companies by Almunia&#8217;s predecessor, Neelie Kroes, resulted in
1.68 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in fines against Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT) and a record 1.06 billion-euro penalty against Intel Corp. (INTC)
Intel has an appeal pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM began developing mainframe computers in the 1940s and
1950s and is now among the few companies selling the systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I commend IBM&#8217;s readiness to address our concerns about
fair competition in the market for large computers,&#8221; Almunia
said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A U.S. senator known on Wall Street
for taking on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has a new target -- a tax
benefit for derivatives traders that has also been derided by
Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor and tax-code critic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The special congressional committee set up to cut $1.5
trillion from the federal deficit should consider taxing futures
and other derivatives at ordinary income rates, Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, wrote in a letter to the panel.
The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that a similar
administration proposal could raise about $2.8 billion in
revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures, non-equity options and other types of derivatives
transactions are currently taxed at a top rate of 23 percent;
ordinary income is taxed up to 35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tax system &#8220;encourages bets on derivatives over direct
capital investments that are key to economic growth,&#8221; Levin
said in a Sept. 15 letter. &#8220;Closing this tax loophole would put
a stop to that market distortion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin&#8217;s reputation for expertise in financial matters was
enhanced by his committee&#8217;s investigation of the 2008 credit
collapse, which was released in April and criticized Goldman
Sachs for its role. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the
state oil company, and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) are negotiating an
arbitration settlement of about $6 billion for assets seized by
President Hugo Chavez in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela will pay any ruling issued by the World Bank&#8217;s
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, or
ICSID, that is in Exxon&#8217;s favor, Carlos Escarra, the country&#8217;s
prosecutor general, told reporters today in Caracas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They started asking for $20 billion,&#8221; Escarra said,
referring to Exxon&#8217;s original demands for compensation. &#8220;Talks
dropped to around $12 billion, and now they are around $6
billion. Venezuela has to pay -- we are clear on that. The
problem now is how much we will pay.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez, since coming to power in 1999, has nationalized
parts of the oil, metals, cement and utilities industries. In
2007, he forced foreign oil producers into joint ventures as
minority partners. Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil and
ConocoPhillips (COP) rejected the revised terms and instead entered
into international arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil does not comment on media reports,&#8221; said
Patrick McGinn, a Houston-based spokesman. Exxon, the world&#8217;s
largest oil company, reduced the amount it&#8217;s seeking for the
takeover of its Cerro Negro venture in the Orinoco heavy crude
belt to $7 billion from $12 billion last year, PDVSA said in a
bond prospectus at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Venezuela is evaluating the amount that we would consider
to be a triumph,&#8221; Escarra said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venezuela Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said the country
proposed paying Exxon $1 billion in compensation, Reuters
reported. Phone calls after business hours to PDVSA, as the
state oil company is known, were not returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbitration Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the figure for the settlement has been coming down
with the passage of time, that is good news for the sovereign
and PDVSA,&#8221; Boris Segura, a Latin America strategist with
Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York, said today in
an interview from New York. &#8220;But most importantly, Mr. Escarra
was unequivocal in saying that Venezuela will abide by the
results of the arbitration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based ICSID ruled on June 10 that it has
jurisdiction over any disputes after Feb. 21, 2006, for the
Cerro Negro project, according to documents posted on the
agency&#8217;s website. PDVSA previously argued that the matter should
be resolved in Venezuelan courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cerro Negro joint venture refined tar-like crude into
synthetic oil from wells in the Orinoco belt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional Arbitration &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon initially won an order in the U.K. blocking PDVSA
from selling $12 billion of assets anywhere in the world. The
order was overturned by a U.K. court in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escarra, who was sworn into office as state prosecutor on
Aug. 30, said he previously advised Chavez to withdraw Venezuela
from the World Bank investment dispute unit when he was a
lawmaker in Venezuela&#8217;s National Assembly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my opinion, we should leave. Ecuador and Bolivia have
already pulled out, and Argentina is pushing for a Latin
American arbitration court,&#8221; Escarra said. &#8220;But as the
prosecutor, I follow instructions from Chavez.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon fell 2.8 percent to close at $71.97 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own Venezuelan
government bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries rose 17 basis
points, 0.17 percentage point, to 1,315 basis points today at
5:21 p.m. in New York, according to JPMorgan  Chase Co.&#8217;s
EMBI+. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on the government&#8217;s benchmark 9.25 percent bonds
maturing in 2027 rose 31 basis points to 14.84 percent. The
price fell 1.4 cents on the dollar to 66.17 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As risky assets worldwide were under pressure today,
don&#8217;t expect a positive day for Venezuelan assets, not even with
this news,&#8221; Segura said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coal producers slumped after Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR)
 and Walter Energy Inc. (WLT)  cut output and sales
forecasts, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha fell 17 percent to $22.30 while Walter dropped 12
percent to $66.25. Arch Coal Inc. (ACI)  lost 11 percent to
$16.12. Patriot Coal Corp. (PCX)  retreated 11 percent to
$10.11. Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU)  declined 6.9 percent to
$39.96. James River Coal Co. (JRCC)  sank 15 percent to $7.74. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Railroad stocks slid on concern shipping demand from the
coal industry will weaken. CSX Corp. (CSX)  erased 8.1 percent
to $18.59. Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC)  sank 8.3 percent to
$61.93. Union Pacific Corp. (UNP)  lost 6 percent to $83.07. &lt;/p&gt;

received a higher takeover offer of $2.20 a share in cash and
stock from &#8220;Allos Company A,&#8221; an entity formed by an anonymous

to acquire Allos, rose 3.2 percent to $14.71. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analogic Corp. (ALOG)  climbed 4.4 percent, the most

share, beating the 62 cent average estimate of two analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AOL Inc. (AOL)  sank 16 percent, the most since Aug. 9,
to $11.77. The Web services company won&#8217;t merge with Yahoo! Inc.
(YHOO US) in the near future, TheWrap reported, citing Arianna
Huffington, editor of the Huffington Post, which was bought by
AOL in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. (AAWW)  slipped 13
percent, the most since August 2010, to $37.65. The U.S. carrier
of freight for airlines was cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at
SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  fell 7.2 percent to $73.52, the
lowest price since June 2007. The House of Representatives
Committee on Energy and Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the
Department of Energy, saying it is &#8220;concerned&#8221; about a rush to
complete loan guarantees. The world&#8217;s largest maker of thin-film
solar modules is awaiting final approval for three projects by
Sept. 30, and the projects&#8217; rejection would have a &#8220;material
negative impact&#8221; on forecast earnings per share, according to
Collins Stewart LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freeport-McMoRan Copper  Gold Inc. (FCX)  slipped 7.7
percent to $35.59, the lowest price since August 2010. The
world&#8217;s largest publicly traded copper said a strike at its

since Aug. 8, to $3.72. The maker of medical robotics&#8217;s Chief
Executive Officer Bruce J. Barclay said the company expects to
strengthen its cash position in the future. He spoke at the UBS
Global Life Science Conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  rose 6.7 percent, the most
intraday since March 2009, to $23.98. The world&#8217;s largest
personal-computer maker&#8217;s board plans to meet to consider
whether to oust Leo Apotheker as chief executive officer after
less than 11 months on the job, two people familiar with the
matter said. Directors may appoint former EBay Inc. CEO Meg
Whitman as his successor, possibly on an interim basis, said one
of the people, who asked not to be named because the plans
aren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Genome Sciences Inc. (HGSI)  soared 12 percent, the
most since March 10, to $14.58. Sales of the Rockville,
Maryland-based drugmaker&#8217;s Benlysta, the first new treatment for

&lt;p&gt;NuVasive Inc. (NUVA)  retreated 12 percent, the most
since Oct. 29, to $18.65. The maker of spinal-surgery products
lost a patent-infringement trial brought by Medtronic Inc. (MDT
US), which accused NuVasive of infringing three patents for
implants capable of being inserted trans-laterally between
adjacent vertebrae, a plate and screw system used to stabilize
vertebrae in the cervical spine and a tissue retractor,

jury award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  gained 4.2 percent to $29.54, the
highest price since Aug. 3. The Redwood City, California-based
software supplier reported a first-quarter profit of 48 cents a
share, topping analysts&#8217; estimates by 1 cent, as companies
increased spending on database software and applications that
help run their businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. (OMEX)  slumped 33
percent to $2.16, the biggest decline in the Russell 2000. An
appeals court upheld a ruling that property the company that
searches for treasure recovered from a sunken ship code-named
&#8220;Black Swan&#8221; must be returned to Spain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. (OREX)  surged 50 percent, the
most in the Russell 2000 Index, to $2.19. The drugmaker, which
is one of three companies with rival obesity treatments
competing for approval, is renewing development of the
experiment obesity drug Contrave after reaching an agreement
with U.S. regulators to further study heart risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Biosciences of California Inc. (PACB)  fell 24
percent to $4.25, the lowest price since its initial public
offering in October. The maker of gene-mapping systems said it
plans to cut about 28 percent of its workforce and record a
restructuring charge of about $5.2 million in the third quarter.
The shares were cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight&#8221; at Piper
Jaffray Cos. and to &#8220;underweight&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; at JPMorgan
Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Range Resources Corp. (RRC)  rose 4.7 percent to $67.96,
the highest price since June 2008. The shares rose on a rumor
that Royal Dutch Shell PLC was interested in acquiring the
natural gas producer that is one of the biggest landholders in
the Marcellus Shale field in Pennsylvania, the Wall Street
Journal reported. Range Resources wasn&#8217;t formally approached by
Shell, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the
situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Image Inc. (SIMG)  jumped 10 percent to $6.51,
the highest price since Aug. 3. The designer of chips that
transmit television signals got a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating in new coverage

&lt;p&gt;Bearish options on U.S. health-care
companies have climbed higher than those in any other U.S.
industry, with prices reaching the most since 2008, as American
and European budget cuts threaten sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puts to sell the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) cost
56 percent more than calls to buy the exchange-traded fund, the
highest level among U.S. ETF options with average daily volume
of at least 1,000 contracts, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The fund, which tracks Pfizer Inc., Johnson 
Johnson, Merck  Co. and 49 other companies, gained 4.8 percent
this year through yesterday, versus a 4.4 percent loss for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama&#8217;s deficit proposal would cut $320
billion from U.S. health programs, reducing the amount the
government pays for drugs and increasing individuals&#8217; payments
for Medicare coverage, according to the plan released Sept. 19.
Austerity measures in Germany, France, Spain and other European
nations will lower payments for pharmaceuticals by as much as 25
percent and substitute generic drugs over branded names,
reducing profit margins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the budget cuts come down pretty hard on this area,
that would be tough,&#8221; Mark Demos, who helps oversee $18 billion
at Fifth Third Asset Management in Minneapolis, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;Investors are very sensitive to
government spending. Investors will start asking the companies,
&#8216;How much are you exposed to the cut to this program or that
program?&#8217; and that should provide a lot of uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied Volatility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, for
three-month options 10 percent below the ETF&#8217;s price is 30.38,
or 56 percent higher than the 19.42 level for calls 10 percent
above. The spread of 10.96 points exceeds the 7.61 average over
the past five years and compares with the Sept. 16 level of
14.87, the widest since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the VIX, rose 4.5 percent to 37.32 at 4:15 p.m. New York time
after the Federal Reserve announced plans to buy $400 billion of
long-term debt and said there are &#8220;significant downside risks&#8221;
to the economic outlook. The gauge of SP 500 contracts dropped
32 percent from a 29-month high on Aug. 8 through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s VStoxx Index, which measures the price of options
to protect against Euro Stoxx 50 Index losses, rose 3.2 percent
to 44.14 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government programs face cuts after the 2012 elections as
policy makers confront forecasts showing health-care spending
will consume 20 percent of the economy in 2020, according to
data compiled by the Office of the Actuary at the U.S. Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The potential for less
spending on Medicare and Medicaid may translate into lower
payments to hospitals, insurers and drug companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$3 Trillion Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The health-care proposals are part of a $3 trillion package
of spending cuts and tax increases to trim the U.S. budget
deficit. Republican leaders in Congress, such as House Speaker
John Boehner of Ohio, said they wouldn&#8217;t accept tax increases
and urged a congressional debt panel to scale back entitlement
programs such as Medicare, the U.S. health program for the
elderly and disabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No country is going to be able to afford to increase the
percentage of GDP spent on health care,&#8221; Roche Diagnostics
Chief Operating Officer Daniel O&#8217;Day said in an Aug. 23
interview. &#8220;What they&#8217;re all looking for is how we can take
this certain pie we have for health care and better leverage it
for society.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sovereign-debt crisis in Europe has added to concern
about the industry. Spain adopted measures including cuts to
health spending on Aug. 19 in an effort to save an additional 5
billion euros ($6.9 billion). Greece&#8217;s unpaid hospital bills
forced drugmakers including Australia&#8217;s largest, Parkville-based
CSL Ltd., and Roche Holding AG of Basel, Switzerland, to write
down the value of bonds from the cash-strapped government&#8217;s
health-care system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a large amount of uncertainty as to what the
downside is,&#8221; William Hillegass, head of health-care equity
derivatives trading for the Americas at Barclays Plc in New
York, said in a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know
what&#8217;s finally going to get through in the U.S. as far as
entitlement reforms. In Europe, branded pharmaceuticals have
really been impacted by the austerity programs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Campanini, a spokesman for Merck, and Al Wasilewski,
a spokesman for Johnson  Johnson (JNJ), declined to comment on the
options trading. Joan Campion, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health Valuation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Health-care stocks in the SP 500 trade for 12 times
reported earnings, or 9 percent below the valuation for the
entire index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Only two
out of 10 industries, financials and energy, are cheaper in
relation to the SP 500, even after the group rallied 4.8
percent in 2011 for the second-biggest advance. Before this
year, health-care stocks on average had a valuation 7.5 percent
higher than the index, according to data since 1993. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stocks have fallen enough to reflect lost business from
changes in regulations, and the group will benefit from aging
populations in the U.S. and Europe, according to David James,
who helps oversee $2.5 billion including 600,000 Pfizer shares
as a senior vice president of James Investment Research Inc. in
Alpha, Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s more opportunity than people think,&#8221; James said
in a telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s bearish options trade at 1.46 times the level for
bullish ones, near the four-year high of 1.49 on July 25 that
preceded a 17 percent slide to a two-year low on Aug. 10.
Pfizer, Abbott Laboratories and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., three
of the ETF&#8217;s top six holdings, also have skew levels that are
near the highest in the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Increase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven of the 10 contracts linked to the ETF with the
biggest increase in ownership over the past 14 days were puts,
Bloomberg data show. The March $28 puts, 15 percent below the
ETF&#8217;s price at yesterday&#8217;s close, had the largest gain in open
interest, adding 10,000 options to 10,228, followed by March $24
puts and October $32 puts. The January $30 puts had the most
outstanding contracts, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The headline risk to health care is all about cost-
cutting,&#8221; Lillian Seidman Davis, an options strategist with a
concentration in health care at Miller Tabak  Co. in New York,
said in a telephone interview yesterday. &#8220;The market is telling
you that there&#8217;s risk to the downside. When skew is priced this
high, it&#8217;s a cautionary signal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     Sept. 21 (Bloomberg) -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, closed below $100 for the
first time since March 2009 as financial stocks fell amid
concerns about the European debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares fell $4.75, or 4.6 percent, to $97.86 at 4:03
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the lowest
closing price since March 20, 2009. The stock dropped briefly
below $100 earlier this month before climbing back above $100 by
the end of the trading session. Goldman Sachs has declined 42
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell amid an overall decline in U.S.
financial stocks, with the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financials
Index dropping 4.9 percent. Moody&#8217;s Investors Service lowered
credit ratings on Bank of America Corp. (BAC) and Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC)
and reduced Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s short-term rating today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Most of it is still Europe and the uncertainty about what
the resolution of the sovereign debt problems will be,&#8221; said
David Hilder, an analyst at New York-based Susquehanna Financial
Group. &#8220;The Moody&#8217;s downgrades certainly didn&#8217;t help.&#8221; Hilder
has a &#8220;positive&#8221; rating on Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and
Wells Fargo and a &#8220;neutral&#8221; on Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS), the sixth-biggest U.S. bank by assets,
sustained the biggest decline in the SP 500 Financials Index as
the stock fell $1.30, or 8.6 percent, to $13.82. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apache Corp. (APA) agreed to buy oil and
natural gas assets in the North Sea from Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM),
including the Beryl field, for $1.75 billion as it seeks to
boost production in one of its most successful regions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fields produce 19,000 barrels of oil and 58 million
cubic feet of natural gas a day, Houston-based Apache said in a
statement today. Estimated proved reserves were the equivalent
of 68 million barrels of oil at the end of last year. Apache
said it plans to fund the transaction with cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase adds to the $11 billion Apache spent last year
on acquisitions that included BP Plc fields in Texas and Egypt
and a gas business in Canada. The company has almost doubled
production at the Forties Field, the U.K&#8217;s largest, since buying
it in 2003. The latest move is expected to increase Apache&#8217;s
North Sea output by 54 percent and proved reserves by 44
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re clearly going to attempt to replicate similar
success they had at Forties,&#8221; said Leo Mariani, an analyst at
RBC Capital Markets in Austin, Texas. &#8220;There&#8217;s a pretty good
chance that they make some nice money on it over time,&#8221;
Mariani, who has a &#8220;sector perform&#8221; on Apache shares and owns
none, said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash Flow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Exxon assets Apache is purchasing include the Nevis,
Ness, Nevis South, Skene and Buckland fields, a stake in the
Beryl/Brae gas pipeline and the SAGE gas plant, and non-operated
interests in the Maclure, Scott and Telford fields. Apache also
receives exploration acreage in Benbecula, west of Scotland&#8217;s
Shetland Islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache&#8217;s payment to Exxon will be reduced by cash flow
generated by the business from the effective date of Jan. 1,
2011, to the closing expected by the end of the year, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Steven Farris said on a conference
call with analysts and investors. The company&#8217;s cash outlay at
the closing may be $1.5 billion to $1.55 billion before a tax
benefit, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache said 40 percent of the $1.75 billion price may be
deductible against future income. Farris said the transaction is
expected to add to earnings, cash flow and production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-Risk Projects &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s agreement has a price of $25.74 per barrel of oil
equivalent of proved reserves, according to a note to clients
from Sterne Agee analysts led by Michael McAllister. That&#8217;s more
than four times the price per unit in Apache&#8217;s 2003 deal with
BP, though comparisons are misleading because of the increase in
Brent crude prices since then, said Sterne Agee, which has a
&#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Apache. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a portfolio of low-risk exploitation projects,
and we believe the complex structural setting holds reserve
upside,&#8221; Farris said in the statement. &#8220;Apache has
demonstrated the ability to increase the efficiency of mature
North Sea assets, find new reserves to extend field life, and
operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP, Total SA and ConocoPhillips (COP) are also trying to sell
mature assets in the North Sea. Deals have been hampered by the
cost of dismantling decades-old platforms. U.K. law holds
sellers responsible for decommissioning if the buyer can&#8217;t pay,
leading sellers to demand letters of credit for the potential
costs and adding to the expense of deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache can add value to the fields by pushing back
decommissioning and extending their life, spokesman Bill Mintz
said by phone from Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An increased tax on production imposed in the last U.K.
budget has also scuppered transactions, according to industry
group Oil  Gas U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and Apache Corp. are vying to be
the largest U.S. independent oil and gas producers by market
value, based on fluctuations in their share prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apache fell $3.17 cents, or 3.4%, to $91.35 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
trader and his father were accused by U.S. regulators of making
illegal trades based on confidential information related to the
Wall Street firm&#8217;s exchange-traded fund investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Mindlin, 33, and Alfred Mindlin, 68, reaped at
least $57,000 in illicit profits by trading in December 2007 and
March 2008 &#8220;with knowledge of massive, market-moving trades&#8221;
that Goldman Sachs planned to execute in four securities, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said today in a statement.
The Mindlins denied the claims, which were outlined in an
administrative proceeding filed by the SEC&#8217;s enforcement unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The younger Mindlin, who worked on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s ETF
desk, learned of the firm&#8217;s plans to buy and sell large amounts
of securities underlying an ETF known as SPDR SP Retail ETF,
according to the order. He tipped his father, and the two took
long and short positions depending on whether Goldman Sachs
intended to buy or sell, the order said. The insider-trading
claims are the SEC&#8217;s first involving ETFs, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are aggressively working to identify and prosecute
illegal insider trading across multiple markets and derivatives
products regardless of the complexity of the trading pattern,&#8221;
Sanjay Wadhwa, associate director of the SEC&#8217;s New York regional
office, said in the statement. The agency is seeking
disgorgement of ill-gotten gains and unspecified penalties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing Wrong &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mindlins did nothing wrong and the allegations
shouldn&#8217;t have been brought against them, according to their
lawyer, Robert Knuts of Park  Jensen LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a situation where a son working in the securities
industry suggested a trading strategy to his father and helped
the father understand and execute the strategy,&#8221; Knuts said in
an e-mailed statement. &#8220;That strategy was not based on any
confidential information obtained by the son. Instead, it is
based on the well-known re-balancing phenomenon within the ETF
industry and publicly available information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elder Mindlin is a certified public accountant,
according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC investigators typically pursue insider-trading cases in
federal court rather than through an administrative proceeding,
where penalties are limited. The agency withdrew claims last
month against former Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta after he
sued the agency, arguing that an administrative hearing denied
him the right to a jury trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael said in an e-
mailed statement that the firm &#8220;fully cooperated&#8221; with the
SEC&#8217;s investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of the trading was conducted in private, undisclosed
accounts held outside of Goldman Sachs and none of the trading
involved client information,&#8221; Raphael said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer Mindlin left Goldman Sachs in 2009, according to
the administrative order. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. antitrust enforcers are
investigating whether Google Inc. (GOOG) illegally increased
advertising rates 50-fold for rival Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), according
to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Trade Commission is probing the increase, along
with other allegations against Google related to advertising, as
a result of complaints from Microsoft, according to the person,
who wasn&#8217;t authorized to publicly comment. The complaints are
being examined as part of a larger antitrust probe into Google
that began earlier this year, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If true, the Microsoft allegations could be used to help
the FTC build a case showing that Google abused its power as the
owner of the world&#8217;s most popular search engine, violating the
Sherman Act and other antitrust laws, said Andre Barlow, an
antitrust lawyer at Doyle, Barlow  Mazard PLLC in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot of this conduct, when put together with a firm with
market power, could be viewed as a violation&#8221; of antitrust
laws, said Barlow, who hasn&#8217;t been briefed on the investigation
and doesn&#8217;t represent those involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When investigating the ad complaint, the FTC will consider
the motives for the accusations by Microsoft, the world&#8217;s
largest software maker and one of Google&#8217;s biggest competitors,
said Barlow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ad Rates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adam Kovacevich, a spokesman for Mountain View, California-
based Google, said that while company officials didn&#8217;t know the
details of Microsoft&#8217;s allegations about ads, rates are usually
determined in part by how closely related an ad is to a user&#8217;s
search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the reasons our ad system works so well is that it
is built on showing relevant ads to consumers,&#8221; Kovacevich
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Evans, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, confirmed the company had made advertising complaints
against Google and declined to discuss specifics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t be permitted to pursue practices that
restrict others from innovating and offering competitive
alternatives,&#8221; Evans said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s doing now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google fell $7.43 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $539.20 on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. Microsoft fell 99 cents, or 3.7 percent, to
$25.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cecelia Prewett, an FTC spokeswoman, declined to comment on
her agency&#8217;s investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers and competitors criticized Google at a U.S.
Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee hearing today, saying
the company favors its own services in search results over
rivals. Google Chairman Eric Schmidt defended the company&#8217;s
actions as helping consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft first complained in September 2007 that Google
drastically raised the rate for an ad for Windows Live, a
predecessor to Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine, one of the main
rivals to Google&#8217;s Internet search, according to the person
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost increased to $5 per mouse click from 10 cents a
click for placing a Windows Live ad next to search results for
the word &#8220;hotmail,&#8221; Microsoft&#8217;s e-mail product, according to
the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low-Quality Website &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google told Microsoft at the time that the rate increased
because users who clicked on the ad were directed to a low-
quality website, according to the person. The site was the home
page for Windows Live, whose services included Hotmail,
Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s complaint about the ad rate increase is similar
to those raised by MyTriggers.com and Foundem, price-comparison
sites that are Google competitors, in an Ohio court case and a
European Union complaint respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge John P. Bessey in Columbus last month dismissed the
MyTriggers case. Bessey later allowed MyTriggers to submit an
amended complaint. Google has denied it unfairly singled out
Foundem or MyTriggers in raising their ad rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft complaint highlights the growing battle among
Microsoft, Google and other search-engine companies for control
of the fast-expanding, $40 billion U.S. online advertising
market, said Eric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law
Institute at Santa Clara University in California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who wouldn&#8217;t like a piece of that action?&#8221; he said in an
interview. &#8220;There are going to be illegitimate complaints, and
with an organization as large and as complicated as Google,
there may be some legitimate complaints.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Complaints &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other Microsoft advertising complaints under
investigation by the FTC include an accusation that Google
pressured advertisers to enter into contracts that make it
difficult to also advertise with Yahoo! Inc. or on Bing, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also under review is Microsoft&#8217;s assertion that Google
created technological hurdles to block advertisers from
comparing the number of times potential customers click on the
ads they run on Google versus those on competing sites, the
person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kovacevich, the Google spokesman, rejected the Microsoft
complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We never forbid advertisers from advertising on other
platforms,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We place no restrictions on advertisers
transferring their own ad campaign data to other platforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broader Investigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC is investigating the broader issue of whether
Google is abusing its dominance in online search. Google
disclosed on June 24 that the FTC has begun a review of its
business practices and said it would work with the agency to
answer questions about its services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was among several companies recently subpoenaed
by the FTC in the investigation, said Evans, the company
spokesman. He declined to name the other companies or elaborate
on the subpoena&#8217;s contents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the agency began sending civil investigative
demands, which are similar to subpoenas, to technology
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTC is examining whether Google unfairly ranks search
results to favor its own businesses and is using its control of
the Android mobile operating system to discourage smart-phone
makers from using rivals&#8217; applications and services, the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inquiries about Google&#8217;s advertising practices are a theme
running through the FTC investigation, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising made up $28.2 billion, or 96 percent, of
Google&#8217;s $29.3 billion in annual revenue last year, according to
company filings with the government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advertising Key &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without advertising,&#8221; Google and its rivals &#8220;don&#8217;t
exist,&#8221; said Karsten Weide, a media and entertainment analyst
for market researcher IDC in San Mateo, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google took 59 percent of the U.S. online search
advertising revenue in the second quarter of this year compared
with second-place Microsoft at 9 percent and Yahoo at 7 percent,
according to a report by IDC this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evans disputed those figures, citing a July report from
IgnitionOne Inc., a New York-based online marketing company,
that said Google had 81 percent of U.S. search advertising
revenue in the second quarter. Yahoo and Microsoft, which have a
search engine partnership, had a combined 19 percent share,
according to the IgnitionOne report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several companies that advertise on Google&#8217;s search results
declined to comment on its advertising practices. Those
declining to comment were Mark Siegel, a spokesman for ATT
Inc., Jessica Sutera, a spokeswoman for Monster Worldwide Inc. (MWW),
Christine Bock, a spokeswoman for Vonage Holdings Corp. (VG) and
David Frink, a spokesman for Dell Inc. (DELL) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) and
Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), two U.S. producers of coal used in
steelmaking, tumbled after they respectively cut output and
sales forecasts because of mining disruptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Alpha fell $4.62, or 17 percent, to $22.30 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Walter
declined $8.75, or 12 percent, to $66.25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha&#8217;s full-year production will be 102.5 million to 109.5
million tons, compared with a previous prediction of 104 million
to 112 million tons, the Abingdon, Virginia-based company said
today in a statement. Alpha cited &#8220;unexpectedly curtailed
customer activity&#8221; in Asia and lower-than-expected output from
some mines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter&#8217;s second-half sales will be &#8220;similar&#8221; to the 5.2
million metric tons recorded for the first half, the Birmingham,
Alabama-based company said in a statement. Its previous forecast
for second-half sales was 5.9 million tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha and Walter are both trying to integrate mines bought
earlier this year in separate acquisitions. Alpha bought Massey
Energy Co. for $7.1 billion in June and said today output from
some Central Appalachian Massey mines has disappointed. Walter
purchased Western Coal Corp. for C$5.3 billion ($5.31 billion)
in April, giving it production in British Columbia. Rainfall in
the Canadian province has curbed output, Walter said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Difficult&#8217; Geology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter said third-quarter earnings will be $1 to $1.16 a
share. The average of 15 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by
Bloomberg was for $3.24. Walter forecast fourth-quarter earnings
of $2.63 to $2.95 a share. The average from the analysts&#8217;
estimates was for $3.17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it&#8217;s dealing with &#8220;difficult&#8221; geology at
its Mine Number 7 in Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is possible these challenges could tempt a large
company to look to buy Walter&#8217;s world-class assets &#8216;&#8216;on the
cheap,&#8217;&#8217; Jeremy Sussman and Lucas Pipes, analysts at Brean
Murray Carret  Co. in New York, said in a note today. They
maintained their &#8216;&#8216;hold&#8217;&#8217; rating for Walter and &#8216;&#8216;buy&#8217;&#8217;
recommendation for &#8216;&#8216;Alpha.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter jumped 21 percent on Sept. 7 after the London-based
Times said Anglo American Plc and BHP Billiton Ltd. may be
considering takeover bids. Walter investor Audley Capital
Advisors LLP said in July that the company should explore a
sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said Sept. 12 it appointed Walter J. Scheller
III as chief executive. Keith Calder resigned as CEO on June 30,
citing differences of opinion with the board concerning
&#8216;&#8216;management philosophy.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpha completed the Massey acquisition 14 months after an
explosion at Massey&#8217;s Upper Big Branch mine in West Virginia
killed 29 people, the deadliest coal accident in 40 years. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Kaitlyn Kiernan and Jeff Kearns" date="Sep 21, 2011 12:41 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-21/buy-apple-coca-cola-calls-as-economy-slows-goldman-sachs-says.html"><headline>Buy Apple, Coca-Cola Calls as Economy Slows, Goldman Sachs Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bullish Apple
Inc. (AAPL), Coca-Cola Co. and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) options
because those companies depend less on economic growth, which is
projected to slow this year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those equities are attractive for bullish options
strategies based on the levels the firm&#8217;s stock analysts project
the shares will reach, Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall, New
York-based equity-derivatives strategists, said. They
recommended buying over-the-counter call options 5 percent above
the share price while selling calls 15 percent above, a strategy
known as a call spread which cuts the cost of the transaction
while capping potential profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumer staples and telecom services provide an
attractive combination of defensiveness, 2012 earnings growth
and high dividend yields,&#8221; Fogertey and Marshall wrote in a
report to clients today. They said the strategy team likes the
technology industry because of its &#8220;overall strong balance
sheet, high foreign sales exposure and stable earnings
outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 declined 11 percent from July 22 through
yesterday amid concern that the world&#8217;s largest economy may slip
into a recession. The International Monetary Fund cut its
forecast for global growth yesterday and predicted &#8220;severe&#8221;
repercussions if Europe fails to contain its debt crisis or U.S.
policy makers deadlock over a fiscal plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry Weightings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposals were based on industry-weight recommendations
made by Goldman equity strategists, who suggested that investors
buy so-called defensive stocks that are less reliant on economic
growth, Fogertey and Marshall said. David Kostin, Goldman&#8217;s
equity strategist, cut his year-end SP 500 forecast to 1,250
from 1,400 last week. That compares with the average 1,311
estimate among 12 strategists tracked by Bloomberg. The gauge
fell 0.2 percent yesterday to 1,202.09. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our portfolio strategy team recommends that investors
overweight Staples given their defensive characteristics and
improving margin outlook,&#8221; the options strategists wrote.
&#8220;Consumer staples has outperformed on average during the late
expansion phase of the business cycle and is also well-
positioned in a recessionary scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. gross domestic product may expand by 1.6 percent this
year, according to the median of 66 economist estimates in a
Bloomberg survey. That&#8217;s down from a median forecast of 1.7
percent in August and below last year&#8217;s 3 percent rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fogertey and Marshall recommended buying the call spreads
on Apple, Coca-Cola, Verizon, Philip Morris International Inc. (PM),
Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO), Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), EMC Corp., Crown Castle
International Corp. (CCI), Dean Foods Co. (DF) and SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman also suggested buying six-month puts 5 percent
below the share price while selling put options 15 percent below
on 10 companies in the consumer-discretionary, industrial and
materials categories. They recommended the trade on Northrop
Grumman Corp. (NOC), Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD), Vulcan Materials Co. (VMC), Gap
Inc. (GPS), Aeropostale Inc. (ARO), Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT), L-3
Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL), Raytheon Co. (RTN) and Manitowoc Co. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Victoria Slind-Flor" date="Sep 21, 2011 11:51 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-21/comcast-dr-pepper-microsoft-vietnam-intellectual-property.html"><headline>Comcast, BT, Dr. Pepper, Microsoft: Intellectual Property</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Comcast Corp. (CMCSA), the largest U.S.
cable-television provider, sued a unit of BT Group Plc (BT/A), the
U.K.&#8217;s biggest fixed-line phone company, seeking a ruling that
it doesn&#8217;t infringe eight BT patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast, based in Philadelphia, asked for a jury trial and
an award of legal fees from London-based BT Telecommunications
Plc in a complaint filed Sept. 19 in federal court in
Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is substantial controversy of sufficient immediacy
and reality&#8221; between the companies &#8220;to warrant the issuance of
a declaratory judgment,&#8221; Comcast said in court papers. The
company also wants the BT patents ruled invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast, with revenue of $37.9 billion last year, operates
cable-TV systems and provides high-speed Internet and phone
services to homes and businesses. BT Group, with revenue of
about $31 billion last fiscal year, offers fixed and mobile
communications services in more than 170 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patents cover network-traffic management, pricing
methods, fault monitoring and other functions, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in response to a motion by BT to
amend another patent lawsuit in the same court filed last year
against Cox Communications Inc. and Cable One Inc. asking for
unspecified treble damages. The amendment would add Comcast as a
defendant, according to a Sept. 1 filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BT&#8217;s constant investment in innovation has seen it develop
a large portfolio of patents which are corporate assets, so it
is only right that we are seeking to protect that investment,&#8221;
Kris Kozamchak, a BT spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast lawyers said in a Sept. 19 letter to U.S. District
Judge Sue L. Robinson that adding Comcast would &#8220;expand many
times over&#8221; the process of document gathering, confuse the
issues and &#8220;strain the patience&#8221; of jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is Comcast Cable v. British
Telecommunications, 1:11-CV-00843, U.S. District Court, District
of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pepper, Texas Bottler Square Off Over Beverage Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pepper Snapple Group Inc. and one of its regional
bottlers are locked in a trademark battle related to the
beverage&#8217;s history and the use of cane sugar in its formula. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beverage company, based in Plano, Texas, sued in June
in federal court in Sherman, Texas, accusing Dr. Pepper Bottling
Co. of Dublin of infringing Dr. Pepper trademarks by using a
bottle with an unauthorized modified label. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public is confused by the different label, and other
bottlers&#8217; sales are negatively affected by the Dublin bottler&#8217;s
actions, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product is a soft drink first made 116 years ago in
Waco, Texas. The defendant, based in Dublin, Texas, is the first
bottler of the product, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regional bottler, unlike many others, refused to switch
to high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener, and also doesn&#8217;t use
beet sugar. According to the response it filed Sept. 12, Dublin
Dr. Pepper has always used only cane sugar, and as a result its
product is sought out by Dr. Pepper aficionados worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comparable battle was fought in federal court in Dallas
between PepsiCo Inc. and a Texas company that imported made-in-
Mexico Pepsi manufactured with cane sugar. That case ended with
an order barring the Texas company from importing and selling
products made in other countries bearing the Pepsi marks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was PepsiCo Inc., v. Marroko USA LLC, 3:09-cv-
00338-B, I.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas
(Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case brought by Dr. Pepper Snapple, the regional
bottler claims that the beverage company tacitly approved its
actions, including the special label indicating its product is
&#8220;Dublin Dr. Pepper.&#8221; Dr. Pepper Snapple has &#8220;reveled and
openly welcomed the free exposure and increased name recognition
provided by Dublin Dr. Pepper,&#8221; the bottler said in court
papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bottler asked the court to declare it&#8217;s not infringing
the Dr. Pepper trademarks or for an award of money damages. It
also seeks litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pepper Snapple asked for an order barring the use of
&#8220;Dublin Dr. Pepper&#8221; by the regional bottler and a declaration
that the contract between the companies is terminated or
terminable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Pepper Snapple is represented by Van Harold Beckwith
and Jonathan Robert Mureen of Houston&#8217;s Baker Botts LLP,
together with Clyde Moody Siebman and Lawrence Augustine
Phillips of Siebman Reynolds Burg  Phillips LLP of Sherman,
Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dublin Dr. Pepper is represented by Richter Darryl Burke,
Samuel Franklin Baxter and Steven D. Wolens of McKool Smith PC
of Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Inc. v. Dr. Pepper Bottling
Co., 4:11-cv-00398-MHS-ALM, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Texas (Sherman). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Applies to Register &#8216;Charm&#8217; as Software Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world&#8217;s largest software maker, is
seeking to register &#8220;charm&#8221; as a trademark, according to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application, filed Sept. 12, is for use of the
trademark with computer programs, graphical user interface
software and operating system programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company has asked the
International Trade Commission to block entry of mobile
telephones using the Android system and made by Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. This included Motorola&#8217;s Charm phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An initial ruling on that dispute, which is over patented
technology, is expected in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola&#8217;s &#8220;charm&#8221; trademark was registered April 19.
Other &#8220;charm&#8221; trademarks include registration in June 2006 by
Charm Sciences of Lawrence, Massachusetts, for diagnostic kits
and scientific instruments; a June 2008 registration by a
resident of Newport Coast, California, for use with cosmetics;
and a December 1992 registration by a Willowbrook, Illinois,
mattress company for use with beds, mattresses, box springs and
sofabeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a developers&#8217; conference last week, Microsoft identified
&#8220;charms&#8221; as icons for commands that can be swiped in from the
side of the screen in the Windows 8 user interface, the Seattle
Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam Has &#8216;Room to Improve&#8217; on WTO Commitments, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam needs to reduce support for state companies,
clarify contract procedures and improve intellectual property-
rights enforcement to move toward a market-based economy, a U.S.
government official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s always room to improve, and that continues to be
the case,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Commerce Secretary Suresh Kumar said
in an interview in Ho Chi Minh City when asked about Vietnam&#8217;s
adherence to its World Trade Organization commitments. &#8220;There
needs to be greater transparency for rules and regulations,
greater transparency in public procurement tender awards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam joined the WTO in 2007 and is one of nine countries
negotiating the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership trade accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama has identified Vietnam as a
priority market to fulfill a pledge to double American shipments
abroad by 2015. Still, a move in May by the Vietnamese
government to restrict some imports to three seaports is an
example of changing rules &#8220;mid-stream&#8221; that damages business
confidence, Kumar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s the type of thing which doesn&#8217;t make for an open
market,&#8221; Kumar said yesterday during a visit to the city
formerly known as Saigon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures took effect in June and limit the entry of
mobile phones, some types of alcohol, and cosmetics to the ports
of Haiphong, Danang and Ho Chi Minh City. Previously the goods
could enter through any port, land crossing or airport.
Vietnam&#8217;s government has said the restrictions are designed to
prevent the entry of counterfeit and low-quality goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vietnam&#8217;s participation in the TPP talks is a &#8220;positive
step&#8221; that demonstrates a desire to boost trade, Kumar said.
The other countries involved in the talks include Australia,
Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru and Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. will propose rules for state-owned companies as
part of the TPP negotiations, Barbara Weisel, an assistant U.S.
Trade Representative, told reporters on Sept. 15 after a round
of discussions in Chicago. Investment rules and intellectual-
property protections also need more work, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kumar noted the sale of &#8220;rip-off&#8221; apparel using U.S.
brands at the airport in the central Vietnamese city of Danang
during his visit to the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a violation&#8221; of Vietnam&#8217;s WTO commitments, Kumar
said. &#8220;Of course it is going to be raised.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Michigan Says It Made &#8216;Errors&#8217; in Digitization &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The University of Michigan responded to a copyright-
infringement lawsuit by the Authors Guild by issuing a statement
in which the school said it made &#8220;a number of errors, some of
them serious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school had planned to release 27 works by French,
Russian and American authors that it deems &#8220;orphans&#8221; for free
downloads to about 250,000 students and faculty, according to
the lawsuit filed Sept. 12 in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Authors Guild, the Australian Society of Authors and
the Quebec Writers Union were among the plaintiffs in the suit
claiming the school obtained unauthorized scans of copyright-
protected books that Google Inc. (GOOG) performed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school&#8217;s statement, published on the university
library&#8217;s website, acknowledged that &#8220;our pilot process is
flawed.&#8221; Instead, the school said it will create &#8220;a more
robust, transparent and fully documented process&#8221; for access to
the so-called orphan works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It claimed that the widespread dissemination of the list of
scanned works &#8220;has had the intended effect: rights holders have
been identified.&#8221; The school&#8217;s mistake &#8220;have not resulted in
the exposure of even one page of in-copyright material,&#8221;
according to the university statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other schools that are co-defendants in the suit are
University of California, University of Wisconsin, Indiana
University and Cornell University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Authors Guild Inc. v. Hathitrust, 1:11-cv-
06351-HB. U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oto Melara SpA&#8217;s trade-secrets claim against Hyundai Wia
Corp. was rejected by a court in Seoul, the Korea Herald
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oto Melara, based in La Spezia, Italy, sued in 2010
claiming a naval gun sold by Hyundai Wia was made by reverse-
engineering a sample of its own, according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the South Korean military had been buying the
Italian company&#8217;s gun since 1975, Hyundai drew up the plan for
its version in 2001, before the country&#8217;s Defense Ministry
loaned Hyundai a sample of the Oto Melara product, according to
the Korea Herald. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court found there were significant technological
improvements in the South Korean company&#8217;s gun and that some of
the technology used to produce it wasn&#8217;t secret, being available
in engineering texts and on the Internet, the Korea Herald
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Heavy Computer in Cyber Attack, Possible Data Theft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011), Japan&#8217;s largest maker of
heavy machinery, was struck by hackers, had its computers
infected and is believed to have had confidential data stolen,
the Daily Yomiuri reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 80 servers and computers at factories where
submarines, missiles and nuclear power plants are built were
targeted, the newspaper reported. Some viruses could have
allowed hackers to eavesdrop on conversations near the computers
or even to operate webcams, according to Yomiuri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi Heavy made the discovery that some of its
computers were infected in mid-August and brought in an Internet
security company to investigate the breach, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kramer Levin Comes to Menlo Park With King  Spalding Hires &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kramer Levin Naftalis  Frankel LLP hired Paul J. Andre and
Lisa Kobialka for its newly opened Menlo Park, California,
office, the New York-based firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two new hires, both intellectual-property litigators,
join from Atlanta&#8217;s King  Spalding LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andre has litigated patent cases for clients whose
technologies include life sciences, computer science and
electrical arts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree in biology and a master&#8217;s
degree in immunology from Middle Tennessee State University, and
a law degree from Fordham University. He was a candidate for a
doctorate in cellular and molecular biology at Mt. Sinai School
of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kobialka has done trade secret, false advertising and
unfair competition, and patent litigation for technology
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She has an undergraduate degree from the University of
California at Davis, a master&#8217;s degree in music from the San
Francisco Conservatory of Music and a law degree from the
University of San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks don&#8217;t typically disclose what
they&#8217;re charging municipalities to arrange derivatives, a
practice that isn&#8217;t required, Antonia Creanza, a JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) banker on trial for fraud, told a Milan court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, &#8216;How does the bank make money?&#8217;&#8221; Creanza
told the court today under questioning by her lawyer. &#8220;I would
explain that we would retain a margin. Never has a legal adviser
told me, &#8216;Look you need to detail the gross margin,&#8217;&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, UBS AG (UBSN), Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa Bank Plc are
on trial on charges of mis-selling swaps to Milan, derivatives
that adjusted payments on a 1.7 billion-euro ($2.4 billion) bond
offering from 2005. Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo said the banks
misled Milan by telling the city it could save about 55 million
euros with the bond sale and a series of swaps. Robledo says the
banks earned 101 million euros in hidden fees. The banks deny
the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selling swaps to municipalities for UniCredit SpA and
a unit of Dexia SA, Creanza told the court she joined JPMorgan&#8217;s
interest-rate derivatives team in 2004, then headed by Antonio Polverino. JPMorgan was one many banks that courted Milan, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From December 2004 to March 2005, before Milan&#8217;s public
tender for the financing, JPMorgan discussed various financing
scenarios with the city, Creanza told the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fee Reduced &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bid to manage the bond offering for a commission
of 7 basis points of the total amount raised, Creanza said. The
bank was surprised by the city&#8217;s request to cut its fee to 1
basis point, matching Depfa&#8217;s winning bid, Creanza said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eventual decision to match the lower fee was taken at
the bank&#8217;s highest levels, including Tony Best, then the
European head of sales, and Fawzi Kyriakos-Saad, then head of
European credit and rates, she said. The bank cut its fee for
reputational reasons because the deal was then the biggest of
its kind in Europe, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the bank &#8220;we discussed ways of doing other business for
the city, how to create other opportunities, the opportunity
that there might be a swap, for example,&#8221; Creanza said. The 1
basis-point fee covered only the bond underwriting, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creanza, 42, said the banks, which the prosecutor says
breached rules they operate under as U.K.-registered advisers,
weren&#8217;t Milan&#8217;s advisers and that allegation hasn&#8217;t been proven
in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks did explain to the city the disadvantages of
getting competing quotes for the swaps from firms not involved
in placing the bond, she said. Seeking external bids would have
exposed the city to market movements because the process would
have taken about 75 minutes from the pricing of the bond to the
pricing of the swap, Creanza said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial continues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V), which faces slower
growth in the U.S. in the wake of new regulations, is urging
Ukraine&#8217;s central bank to drop a draft law that restricts
foreign card issuers&#8217; operations in the former Soviet republic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The draft law envisages that only a newly created Ukrainian
national network can process electronic payment transactions by
Ukrainians in Ukraine, according to Joshua R. Floum, the general
council of the world&#8217;s largest payments network. He spoke in a
Sept. 16 interview in Yalta, Ukraine, after meeting central bank
management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The legislation concerns our business, we have a strong
disagreement over the domestic monopoly issue,&#8221; said Floum, who
was attending a conference at Black Sea resort. &#8220;If we were
excluded from Ukraine, it does take away a lot of incentive to
do business here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the second-biggest payment
network, are both active in Ukraine, which has a population of
46 million. Card transactions totaled 20.47 million hryvnia
($2.56 million) in the first half of this year, compared with
29.5 million hryvnia in 2010, according to central bank data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the (draft) law is changed, the outlook is very
good,&#8221;  Floum said. &#8220;For growth, the sky is the limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floum said the payment network is &#8216;&#8216;very anxious&#8217;&#8217; to
provide the central bank with technical support as they work
through the rulemaking process, noting that Visa has an
advantage over any &#8216;&#8216;domestic scheme&#8217;&#8217; due to its global network
capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Regulations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Visa is dealing with regulatory issues
in the U.S. after the Federal Reserve in July completed new
rules to cap debit-card swipe fees charged to merchants. Floum,
who testified in front of the U.S. Congress, said the company
has &#8216;&#8216;a very good strategy to mitigate&#8217;&#8217; consequences of new
regulation on debit-card transaction fees that is set to take
effect in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We will modify our fee structure,&#8217;&#8217; he said. &#8216;&#8216;We are
going to move from a variable fee that the merchants pay to the
banks for the visa fees. We are going to ask merchants and their
banks to pay a fixed fee rather than a variable fee based on the
transaction.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa has also &#8216;&#8216;a strategy to win decisions from merchants
for both&#8217;&#8217; signature and pin debit transactions, Floum said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed limited debit fees to 21 cents per swipe in June.
The system replaces a formula based on a percentage of the
purchase price that averaged 44 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big Merchants &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;We opposed the law, it was not a good idea and we
continue to have that feeling,&#8217;&#8217; Floum said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Floum blamed the bigger U.S. merchants, including Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., for pushing U.S. lawmakers to include the rule in
last year&#8217;s Dodd-Frank Act, the financial regulatory overhaul
signed into law by President Barack Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and payment networks came close to halting the new
rules this year as lawmakers pushed to delay their
implementation. In the end, the merchants won, largely due to
the lobbying of Congress, Floum said. &lt;/p&gt;

to reduce pharmaceutical spending, Expansion reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Carol Perkins arrives at the
office, she checks e-mails, organizes files, and calls
corporations as part of a fund-raising effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perkins, 60, works at the Urban League of Essex County in
New Jersey through a U.S. senior-citizen jobs program that used
to pay for an average of 20 hours a week of training and work.
In April, Congress sliced tens of millions of dollars in
funding, and Perkins&#8217; schedule was cut by at least half --
forcing her to turn to welfare to pay the rent after her monthly
take home fell more than $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m devastated,&#8221; said Perkins, of Montclair, New Jersey,
who said her previous administrative support jobs at New York-
based JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Bear Stearns Cos. were
eliminated. &#8220;We need jobs. It&#8217;s as if they have forgotten about
us seniors and we&#8217;ll wind up out on the street. I just want to
work.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The funding cut illustrates the conflict between the need
to put people back to work and the mandate of a 12-member
congressional supercommittee to cut $1.5 trillion from the
deficit. Scaling back the job training for U.S. seniors will
mean fewer work opportunities as President Barack Obama pushes a
job stimulus plan, unveiled Sept. 8, aimed at easing
unemployment that has been 9 percent or higher for five straight
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also shows how cuts to federal spending can exacerbate
the jobless situation and shift seniors into other public
assistance programs, negating some of the savings, according to
groups that help run the training. Organizations said they&#8217;ve
reduced paid training, work hours, and in some cases are turning
away seniors seeking the job-based training. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeless Seniors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many in the program, which is aimed at unemployed, low-
income people who are 55 or older, need the paid training and
work: Almost 40 percent were homeless or at risk of being
homeless in 2009, according to the Labor Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unemployment rate for people age 55 and older is at
levels not seen since at least 1948, according to the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. It peaked at 7.3 percent in 2010 and was at
6.6 percent in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, the seniors&#8217; rate was below 3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older Americans are more likely than any other age group to
remain out of work for 99 weeks or more, according to a December
2010 report by the Congressional Research Service, which
provides policy and legal analysis to lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;45% Funding Cut &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the Senior Community Service Employment Program
was cut 45 percent, to about $450 million for the year that ends
June 2012, from $825 million approved in 2010, under an April
budget deal forged by Congress and Obama. The previous year
included $225 million from federal Recovery Act money, and
excluding that appropriation the drop was 25 percent, according
to the Labor Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration in proposing the cut found
&#8220;little evidence&#8221; that spending on seniors&#8217; job training
&#8220;successfully promotes unsubsidized employment or provides
cost-effective community service.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting the program is necessary as the government seeks to
close the deficit, Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against
Government Waste, a Washington-based advocacy group, said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are ways to help people find work without spending
a lot of money,&#8221; Schatz said. &#8220;The objective has to be to help
as many as possible with the least cost.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Program Merits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrinking the seniors jobs program shows how efforts to
curb the deficit by slashing spending can exacerbate the jobless
situation, said Lita Levine Kleger, a spokeswoman for Arlington,
Virginia-based Experience Works Inc., which helps low-income
seniors with employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I understand there&#8217;s this conversation in Congress about
making tough choices, but there has to be some discussion on the
merits of what actually works,&#8221; Levine Kleger said in an
interview. &#8220;This program gets people jobs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experience Works cut about 140 staff positions and closed a
customer-service center in Waco, Texas, Levine Kleger said.
They&#8217;re turning away interested applicants, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants in the U.S. program generally earn minimum
wage and work an average of 20 hours a week. The goal is to help
participants get paying jobs, according to the Labor Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unnecessary Spending&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting the training and work effort makes little fiscal
sense, according to lawmakers such as U.S. Representative
Charles Rangel, a New York Democrat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you take away this, what other problems are you
creating?&#8221; Rangel said in an interview. &#8220;What are seniors
supposed to do if they can&#8217;t find a job and are on a limited
income? When you talk about taking away money from seniors who
are fragile economically, that has an effect. I wish when people
talked about spending, they&#8217;d talk about cutting unnecessary
spending.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican Representative Michael Simpson of Idaho, a House
Appropriations committee member who sits on three panels, said
the senior training service is an employment initiative that
simply fell victim to the deficit-reduction drive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anybody is going to be pleased,&#8221; Simpson
said in an interview. &#8220;The reality is that as we try to reduce
spending, it&#8217;s taken a larger budget reduction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To qualify, a seniors&#8217; income must be 125 percent of
federal poverty guidelines, or $13,613 a year for a family of
one, in most states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participation is expected to fall to 70,537 people in the
year ending June 30, 2012, according to an agency report. That&#8217;s
down almost half from 130,223 the agency estimated for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;It&#8217;s Absurd&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s absurd,&#8221; Marc Morial, chief executive officer of
the National Urban League Inc., a New York-based civil rights
group that focuses on economic issues, said in an interview.
&#8220;Obama is talking about jobs, and this is a jobs program. The
best deficit reduction program is a jobs program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting the funds also worsens the U.S. deficit as seniors
have less disposable income to spend, pay less in taxes, and
rely more on government aid such as food stamps, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valerie Farrer, 77, of Verona, Wisconsin, in September 2009
qualified for the aid, working in the town library and
eventually teaching jobs skills at Experience Works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her schedule has been scaled back to 22 hours a week from
28 hours following the budget cuts, she said, and her income has
dropped $200 a month. Farrer said she doesn&#8217;t turn on the air
conditioner, has cut back on groceries and limits herself to
necessities to help save money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She gets some help from Social Security. That income is
drained on such expenses as supplemental Medicare insurance and
car insurance, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;It&#8217;s Devastating&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s devastating when the hours are cut,&#8221; Farrer said in
an interview. &#8220;You feel as though you&#8217;re trapped. With the
program, there&#8217;s a reason to get up every day. Then the hours
are cut and it turns back into depression.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallout is being felt at the Urban League of Essex County
in Newark, New Jersey, which lost about $1.2 million in funding
on June 30, Vann Holland, director of workforce operations, said
in an interview. That left enough money to help 132
participants, said Holland, not enough for the 500 seniors
currently being aided. To help stretch dollars, training hours
were reduced to 10 hours from 20 hours a week, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may run out of money end of December or January,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We may have to end the program.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Caucus and Center on Black Aged Inc. in
Washington, which assists low-income seniors, fired nine full-
time staffers, and the 1,800 participants in D.C. and eight
states now train 15 hours a week, down from 20 hours, Karyne
Jones, chief executive officer, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food Stamps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some participants have lost their apartments or have gone
to agencies to get food stamps,&#8221; Adrienne Wiggins, the
program&#8217;s coordinator for the group, said an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Oliphant, 65, of Washington, earned about $660 a
month for 20 hours of training as a job counselor through the
program. With a reduction in hours, she said in an interview
that she now gets about $500 for 15 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s had a big impact,&#8221; said Oliphant, who lives with
her son and pays for utilities and her groceries. &#8220;With the
cutbacks, it&#8217;s just enough to get by. It&#8217;s very stressful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Perkins, the reduced training hours have left her
worried about paying her rent, she said. She no longer buys
vision contacts and she scrimps on groceries. Some weeks she
skips doing her laundry, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand what Congress is doing,&#8221; Perkins said
in an interview. &#8220;You&#8217;re older now but you still have skills.
This program gives you hope.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said
investors should keep buying commodities because &#8220;supply
disappointments&#8221; will support prices even as the sovereign-debt
crisis and slowing economies threaten demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index of 24
raw materials will climb 20 percent in the next 12 months, said
Jeffrey Currie, Goldman&#8217;s London-based head of commodity
research. Copper will jump 43 percent to a record $11,000 a
metric ton, while crude oil in New York surges 62 percent to
$131 a barrel, he forecast. The bank correctly advised investors
to sell oil and copper in April and turned more bullish the
following month as metals and energy rebounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities erased their gains for the year today, leaving
the SP GSCI spot index down 3.9 percent in 2011, after the
Federal Reserve said there are &#8220;significant downside risks&#8221; to
the economic outlook. The gauge has still jumped 31 percent in
the past two years, outperforming global equities and
Treasuries, as adverse weather threatened global crops and
China&#8217;s demand for copper, cotton and soybeans surged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite the recent macroeconomic uncertainty, commodity
prices have been remarkably resilient,&#8221; Currie said in a report
today. &#8220;Driving this resiliency and substantially less
volatility has been continued evidence of a relatively stronger
fundamental picture due to a combination of supply
disappointments and significant demand&#8221; from emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI spot index fell 4.9 percent to 607.49 at 3:57
p.m. in New York, bringing the gauge down more than 20 percent
from this year&#8217;s high and heading for a so-called bear market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the week ended Sept. 13, hedge funds and other money
managers cut their bullish bets on raw materials for the time in
five weeks, U.S. government data show. Investors placed 29
percent less cash in commodity exchange-traded products in the
first seven months of the year, Barclays Capital said on Sept.
14. Societe Generale SA&#8217;s global asset-allocation team went
&#8220;underweight&#8221; on commodities last week, saying that the asset
class is in the &#8220;danger zone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that a global recession and/or financial
crisis would be required to derail our constructive commodity
views,&#8221; Currie said. &#8220;We continue to recommend an overweight
positioning in commodities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper Shortage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the six months ended in June, copper supplies trailed
demand by 130,000 tons, the International Copper Study Group
said yesterday. The most-expensive drought in Texas history has
parched pastures, prompting ranchers to cull the most breeding
cows ever and driving livestock prices to a record. The hottest
July since 1955 in the U.S. Midwest eroded corn yields and will
leave inventories before next year&#8217;s harvest at the lowest level
since 1996 as a percentage of consumption, government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy commodities in the GSCI Enhanced Index will advance
almost 26 percent in the next 12 months, and industrial metals
will jump 23 percent, Goldman said. Agriculture will climb 4.8
percent and precious metals by 4 percent, according to the
report. The bank lowered its three-month forecast for New York
oil by 15 percent to $97.50 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the recent sell-off presents a relatively
good opportunity for longer-dated purchases,&#8221; Currie said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued mutual
fund firm American Century Cos. over claims it was shortchanged
in an $848 million optioned-share sale to Canadian Imperial Bank
of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Century failed to disclose material information
regarding the sale and the shares weren&#8217;t purchased at their
fair market value, lawyers for JPMorgan said in a public version
of the complaint filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court. The
complaint was initially filed under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegation that American Century breached an option
agreement is without merit and the edited complaint filed in
Delaware yesterday is an inaccurate and incomplete
representation of the facts,&#8221; American Century said in a
statement e-mailed by Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIBC, Canada&#8217;s fifth-largest bank, announced in July that
it agreed to buy a 41 percent stake in American Century from
JPMorgan. The cash acquisition is the third-largest purchase by
the Toronto-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased a roughly 45 percent interest in Kansas
City, Missouri-based American Century for about $900 million in
January 1998, according to the complaint. Under a 2009 option
agreement between American and JPMorgan, American could buy all
of the shares JPMorgan owned in the firm and resell them to a
third party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, said in its complaint that it
learned of the share sale through a public announcement. The
transaction was completed on Aug. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Withheld Information &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American Century improperly withheld information
regarding the CIBC stock sale from JPMorgan&#8217;s director designee
on American Century&#8217;s board,&#8221; lawyers for the bank said in the
redacted complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Century &#8220;understated its financial position&#8221; to
an independent adviser, causing a report that served as the
basis for the share repurchase to understate the firm&#8217;s fair
market value, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking a trial to determine unspecified
damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Century accused JPMorgan of filing the complaint
as a &#8220;tactical reaction to an adverse result&#8221; in another
matter recently concluded in favor of the firm. Doyle declined
to identify that matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The heavily edited complaint removes information that
reflects negatively on JPMorgan&#8217;s conduct in the other matter,&#8221;
American Century said in the statement. &#8220;We believe that the
information JPM removed from the complaint is not confidential
and we will soon be taking appropriate action to have the
redacted information unsealed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. American Century
Companies Inc., CA6875, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the
second-ranked adviser on global mergers this year, promoted
Gregg Lemkau to become head of mergers and acquisitions in
Europe and the Asia-Pacific region, a newly created position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemkau, 42, who has been co-head of technology, media, and
telecommunications since 2008, will keep responsibilities for
many of his current clients, the New York-based bank said in an
internal memorandum to employees obtained by Bloomberg News.
Joanna Carss, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London,
confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemkau, who joined Goldman Sachs in 1992, became a partner
in 2002. He previously worked as chief operating officer of the
investment banking division. He will join a global mergers team
overseen by co-heads Yoel Zaoui and Gene T. Sykes, with Richard Campbell-Breeden as head of mergers for Asia outside Japan and
Dusty Philip and Michael Carr as co-heads for the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has advised on 208 announced transactions for
a total value of $405 billion so far this year, second only to
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s $428 billion, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The bank was the top-ranked merger adviser in
2010, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world&#8217;s largest consumer-payment networks, will raise debit-card
fees charged for small-ticket purchases to the full amount
allowed under new rules, according to an analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world&#8217;s largest network, and No. 2 MasterCard may
increase fees from 8 cents on a $2 purchase to 23 cents, Thomas McCrohan, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, wrote in a
note. They will eliminate the so-called interchange portion of
the fee, charging the highest amount allowed by rules announced
in June, McCrohan said yesterday in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The change &#8220;will kill the economics for small-ticket debit
purchases and influence a shift back to credit cards,&#8221; McCrohan
wrote. &#8220;It will almost certainly lead to a merchant revolt
against the card networks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve said June 29 that U.S. debit-card
transaction fees, mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, can&#8217;t exceed
24 cents on an average transaction, replacing a formula that
averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44 cents.
The limits, championed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, an
Illinois Democrat, spurred banks to curtail debit-card rewards
programs and add fees for checking accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fee increase could be an attempt by San Francisco-based
Visa and MasterCard to recoup fees for banks, to affect consumer
use of mobile payment services or to influence a pending
lawsuit, McCrohan wrote. The caps may reduce revenue at U.S.
banks by $8 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg Government show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard&#8217;s Interchange Structure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MasterCard recently informed our issuers that we will
implement a two-tiered interchange structure,&#8221; James Issokson,
a spokesman at Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, said in an
e-mailed statement. &#8220;As we have noted throughout this process,
setting price caps will -- and has -- created distortions in the
market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Valentine, a Visa spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed capped debit fees at 21 cents per swipe. It will
let issuers tack on 5 basis points of each transaction, or
almost 2 cents based on the average debit ticket of $38, and a
conditional 1-cent adjustment for lenders that follow certain
fraud-prevention standards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ex-Galleon Group LLC trader and
expert-networking consultant were sentenced yesterday to 10
years and four years in prison for their roles in a nationwide
insider-trading scandal, just three weeks before Raj Rajaratnam,
the man at the center of the investigation, is to learn his
fate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zvi Goffer, the trader, and Winifred Jiau, who worked for
Primary Global Research LLC, were convicted in June in separate
Manhattan federal court trials. Jiau was sentenced yesterday to
four years after the government asked for as long as 10 years.
Goffer received a 10-year term following a U.S. request that he
serve almost 13 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, co-founder of Galleon, was found guilty in
May of directing the largest hedge-fund insider-trading ring. He
should be given a prison term of as long as 24 1/2 years when
sentenced, prosecutors said. His sentence was postponed
yesterday from Sept. 27 to Oct. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentences for Goffer and Jiau are more severe than in
typical insider-trading cases where a defendant gets and trades
on information only once, said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor
at Columbia Law School in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These were professionals engaging in this as their
regular course of business,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;They went about it
systematically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of people have been charged with participating in
overlapping insider-trading rings by the office of U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in Manhattan. The Goffer and Rajaratnam trials
featured phone conversations secretly recorded by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation. The two, along with Jiau, were
convicted based partly on the testimony of co-conspirators
cooperating with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors at Jiau&#8217;s trial saw instant electronic messages that
a hedge fund analyst sent his boss while they were on the phone
with her. The analyst also recorded the calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goffer, who co-founded Incremental Capital LLC after he was
fired from Galleon in 2008, was convicted of all 14 criminal
counts against him. Goffer&#8217;s brother, Emanuel, and Michael
Kimelman were convicted at the same trial. Prosecutors said Zvi
Goffer headed a ring that made more than $10 million trading in
3Com Corp., Axcan Pharma Inc., Kronos Inc. and Hilton Hotels
Corp. based on information misappropriated by two lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan
to send Goffer to prison for as long as 12 years and seven
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goffer, 34, claimed he&#8217;s a changed man who deserves a
lesser sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau, 43, of Fremont, California, was convicted of one
count each of conspiracy and securities fraud. A jury found her
guilty of passing earnings and other information about Nvidia
Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to Noah Freeman, a
former SAC Capital Advisors LP portfolio manager, and Samir
Barai, founder of New York-based Barai Capital Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors argued Jiau should get eight to 10 years in
prison in papers filed with U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff.
Jiau&#8217;s lawyers downplayed her role in the chain of inside-traders and called the government&#8217;s suggested sentence
&#8220;draconian.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Ms. Jiau was at the &#8216;heart&#8217; of anything in this case,
it was of the gang that couldn&#8217;t shoot straight,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are U.S. v. Goffer, 10-cr-00056, and U.S. v.
Jiau, 11-cr-00161, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;ATT Says It Wants Trial of U.S. Suit to Block T-Mobile Deal &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT Inc. (T) is eager for a trial of the U.S. Justice
Department&#8217;s lawsuit challenging its proposed acquisition of
wireless carrier T-Mobile USA Inc., a lawyer for the company
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no talk of settlement yesterday in federal court
in Washington as Mark Hansen, an attorney for ATT, told U.S.
District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle that the company wants to get
to trial as quickly as possible. Huvelle, who had earlier told
the parties to come prepared to discuss settlement prospects,
set a trial date for Feb. 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeking a prompt trial because we&#8217;re very
interested in closing this transaction,&#8221; Hansen, of Kellogg,
Huber, Hansen, Todd, Evans  Figel PLLC in Washington, said
during the hour-long hearing. &#8220;We need to have the cloud of
uncertainty removed. We&#8217;re already a month beyond where we want
to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department sued Dallas-based ATT and Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)&#8217;s T-Mobile unit on Aug. 31, saying a
combination of the two companies, which would make ATT the
biggest U.S. wireless carrier, would &#8220;substantially&#8221; reduce
competition. Last week, seven states joined the government&#8217;s
case seeking to stop the $39 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ATT is still &#8220;hopeful&#8221; it can address the Justice
Department&#8217;s antitrust concerns and reach a settlement, Michael
Balmoris, an ATT spokesman, said in an e-mail after the
hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. ATT Inc., 11-cv-01560, U.S. District
Court, District of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Servier Founder Charged in Deaths Granted 4 Million-Euro Bail &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacques Servier, chairman of France&#8217;s second-largest
drugmaker, must post bail of 4 million euros ($5.51 million) and
his freedom may be restricted as he faces charges that he helped
hide the risks of a drug suspected of causing the deaths of as
many as 2,000 people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servier and five affiliated companies of Laboratoires
Servier, which he founded, were charged yesterday by French
magistrates, the company said in a statement. Servier must
provide a financial guarantee of 6 million euros by Dec. 15,
according to the release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Servier, 89, was charged with involuntary manslaughter,
aggravated deception and fraud, the newspaper Le Monde reported,
citing his lawyer. The company remains innocent until proven
guilty and will &#8220;finally be able to defend itself in a judicial
setting,&#8221; it said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mediator, the diabetes drug at the root of the case, was

&lt;h2&gt;JPMorgan, Citigroup Seek Dismissal of Thornburg Lawsuit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Citigroup Inc. (C) and other banks asked
a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by defunct Thornburg Mortgage Inc.,
saying the complaint didn&#8217;t adequately show that fraud occurred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trustee Joel Sher sued the banks for $2 billion in April,
alleging they helped push Thornburg, now called TMST Inc., into
a &#8220;free-fall&#8221; bankruptcy. Making &#8220;unjustified&#8221; margin calls,
the banks extracted more than $700 million of margin and
interest payments from Thornburg, then sold their collateral and
left the company to file for Chapter 11 protection during the
credit crisis in May 2009, Sher claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, including Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN), Royal Bank of
Scotland Plc and UBS AG (UBSN), or their affiliates, were trading
partners of Thornburg&#8217;s in repurchase and swap transactions used
to finance its mortgage business, the banks said in a Sept. 20
filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Baltimore. Under the repo
agreements, they could make margin calls at any time if the
counterparty had a margin deficit, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sher didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call seeking comment
on the banks&#8217; filing. He has updated the suit since it was
initially filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was named in the TMST suit because it bought
assets from Bear Stearns Cos., a lender to Thornburg. Sher filed
at least eight lawsuits from April 28 to April 30, seeking money
from Barclays Plc (BARC), Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America
Corp. (BAC) and other companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is Thornburg Mortgage Inc., 09-17787,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;UBS Moved Executive in FSA Risk-Management Case to Zurich &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UBS AG executive accused of risk-management failures and
facing a potential fine by the U.K. finance regulator was moved
as early as 2008 from London to Zurich by Switzerland&#8217;s biggest
bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Pottage, the former chief executive officer of UBS&#8217;s
wealth-management division in London, will challenge the
Financial Services Authority at a court hearing in November over
its attempt to fine him for not ensuring the unit had controls
to prevent unauthorized trades that began in 2006, according to
three people familiar with the case. He now works in risk
management, two people with knowledge of his role said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA fined UBS 8 million pounds ($12.5 million) in 2009,
at the time the third-largest penalty imposed by the regulator,
for failing to prevent employees in the international wealth-management business from making as many as 50 unauthorized
trades a day with funds from at least 39 customer accounts. The
case is an example of UBS failing to police errant trading in
London years before the bank said this week it lost $2.3 billion
from unauthorized trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that the machine has got going, every single bad
thing is going to come out,&#8221; said Fred Ponzo, a capital markets
adviser at Greyspark Partners in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottage was authorized by the FSA until Dec. 15, 2008,
according to the watchdog&#8217;s website. He had authorization for
roles including chief executive, significant management,
director, apportionment and oversight, investment adviser and
insurance mediator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pottage declined to comment when reached at a UBS number in
Zurich. Yves Kaufmann, a UBS spokesman in Zurich, also declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Hamilton, an FSA spokesman, declined to comment.
Tobias Lux, a spokesman at the Swiss regulator, declined to
comment on the case. Pottage&#8217;s lawyer, John Fordham, also
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Madoff Trustee Loses Bid to Quash Request for Rehearing &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm lost a bid to quash
investors&#8217; request for a new hearing on how he calculates who
gets compensated for losses in Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York said Aug. 16 that
trustee Irving Picard can ignore fictitious profits on money
Madoff never invested when calculating losses and who is
entitled to be repaid. Some investors who wouldn&#8217;t get paid
under the formula asked for a &#8220;rehearing,&#8221; saying the appeals
court ruled differently in a previous case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s move to strike the request was denied, according
to a court filing Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A group of Madoff investors had urged the court to require
Picard to use their final account statements, which included
fictitious profits on money Madoff never invested, to determine
losses. Picard&#8217;s formula limits the number of investors who can
claim money, and cuts the size of many claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking the court earlier this month to refuse to rehear the
issue, Picard said in a filing the investors failed to follow
the court&#8217;s rules. Some investors filed a 24-page petition
without asking for permission to file an oversized brief, he
said. Told by the court to shorten it, &#8220;the petitioners seek to
dodge the court&#8217;s order,&#8221; Picard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They split the arguments into two 15-page petitions, put
some of the appellants on one petition and the rest on the
other, and ask the court to consider the petitions as one,&#8221;
Picard said. &#8220;The court should strike the newly filed
petitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is in a federal prison in North Carolina,
serving a 150-year sentence for the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities
LLC, 10-2378, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Google Says Oracle Seeking $2 Billion in Android Dispute &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG) said Oracle Corp. (ORCL) lowered its damages request
to at least $2 billion in a patent and copyright dispute over
Android software, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which said the estimate includes $1.2 billion in
damages for unjust enrichment in 2012 alone, asked a federal
judge to exclude parts of the calculation that it says aren&#8217;t
supported by the evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco
threw out Oracle&#8217;s earlier estimate that it&#8217;s entitled to as
much as $6.1 billion in damages in a lawsuit claiming Google
infringed its Java patents when it created the Android operating
system, now running on more than 150 million mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle&#8217;s new damages report &#8220;ignores governing law and the
guidelines of this court&#8217;s July 22, 2011, order,&#8221; Google lawyer
Robert Van Nest said in a letter to Alsup Sept. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alsup ruled in July that a new estimate should start as low
as $100 million, a figure that Mountain View, California-based
Google was offered in 2006 to license Java from Sun Microsystems
Inc. Google rejected that offer by Sun, which Oracle later
acquired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Redwood City,
California-based Oracle, the largest maker of database software,
declined to comment on the Google filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two companies have made little headway this week in
negotiations aimed at resolving the lawsuit, a person briefed on
the talks said. Google Chief Executive Larry Page and Oracle CEO
Larry Ellison participated in a settlement conference that
lasted as long as 10 hours on Sept. 19 and returned to federal
court in San Jose, California, yesterday for further meetings
with a magistrate judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle America Inc. v. Google Inc., 10-03561,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Rambus Was &#8216;Dethroned&#8217; by Intel, Micron Attorney Tells Jury &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus Inc. (RMBS)&#8217;s computer memory failed to become an industry
standard because it was &#8220;dethroned&#8221; by Intel Corp. (INTC), not as a
result of collusion by rivals, a lawyer for Micron Technology
Inc. (MU) told a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In closing arguments at a state-court trial in San
Francisco, William Price, a lawyer for Micron, said yesterday
that Rambus was aware of technical problems with its version of
dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, when it signed a 1996
contract to work with Santa Clara, California-based Intel Corp.,
the world&#8217;s largest chipmaker. The jury began deliberating
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationship was &#8220;conceived in fraud,&#8221; Price told
jurors. &#8220;Intel lived with Rambus&#8221; in an attempt to develop
Rambus-designed memory, or RDRAM, into a product, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What Intel concluded at the end was RDRAM was not the
product they thought it was, and that Rambus was not the company
they thought it was,&#8221; Price said. Intel &#8220;selected Rambus to
become king, and Intel dethroned Rambus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus contends that Boise, Idaho-based Micron and Ichon,
South Korea-based Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660) colluded to cut the
prices of their own DDR, or double data rate, memory chips and
deserted their commitment to produce RDRAM, relegating it to a
niche role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rambus, which doesn&#8217;t make the chips it designs, said it
would have made $3.95 billion in royalties without the alleged
conspiracy. Under California law, a jury finding of damages in
that amount would be automatically tripled to $11.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rambus Inc. v. Micron Technology Inc., 04-0431105, California Superior Court (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Banks Don&#8217;t Provide Swap Costs, JPMorgan Executive Tells Court &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks don&#8217;t typically disclose what they&#8217;re charging
municipalities to arrange derivatives, a practice that isn&#8217;t
required, Antonia Creanza, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker on
trial for fraud, told a Milan court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every time I sold a derivative to a public
administration, even before getting to the details, the first
question was always, &#8216;How does the bank make money?&#8217;&#8221; Creanza
told the court yesterday under questioning by her lawyer. &#8220;I
would explain that we would retain a margin. Never has a legal
adviser told me, &#8216;Look you need to detail the gross margin,&#8217;&#8221;
she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Depfa Bank Plc are
on trial on charges of mis-selling swaps to Milan, derivatives
that adjusted payments on a 1.7 billion-euro ($2.4 billion) bond
offering from 2005. Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo said the banks
misled Milan by telling the city it could save about 55 million
euros with the bond sale and a series of swaps. Robledo says the
banks earned 101 million euros in hidden fees. The banks deny
the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After selling swaps to municipalities for UniCredit SpA and
a unit of Dexia SA, Creanza told the court she joined JPMorgan&#8217;s
interest-rate derivatives team in 2004, then headed by Antonio
Polverino. JPMorgan was one many banks that courted Milan, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From December 2004 to March 2005, before Milan&#8217;s public
tender for the financing, JPMorgan discussed various financing
scenarios with the city, Creanza told the court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lehman to Drop Appeal of Ruling in $11 Billion Barclays Suit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., which is gathering creditor
support for a $65 billion liquidation plan before a November
vote, said it will drop its attempt to collect $11 billion from
Barclays Plc in a dispute over the sale of Lehman operations in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman also won&#8217;t appeal a Sept. 14 ruling by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge James Peck in Manhattan rejecting its claim
that Barclays owed about $500 million for allegedly unpaid
bonuses. Peck previously ruled against Lehman in the larger suit
against London-based Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While there are aspects of the decisions with which we do
not agree, we are also cognizant of the burdens that continued
litigation of these issues would place on the court and the
assets of the estate,&#8221; the defunct firm said in a statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After appealing Peck&#8217;s ruling in the bigger suit, Lehman
said yesterday it &#8220;respects the time and effort the court has
devoted to the serious issues raised by the estate.&#8221; Because of
the cost of continuing the litigation, Lehman said, &#8220;we have
determined that we will not pursue these issues through appeals,
believing that the resources of the court and the estate will be
better employed at this point to move the bankruptcy toward a
conclusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, once the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest investment bank,
has spent about $1.4 billion on lawyers and managers since its
2008 bankruptcy filing, the largest in U.S. history, with assets
of $639 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm&#8217;s bankruptcy became the most
expensive in U.S. history in April 2010, when it topped the $757
million cost of energy trader Enron Corp.&#8217;s three-year
liquidation, according to data compiled by Lynn LoPucki, a
bankruptcy-law professor at the University of California, Los
Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s creditors range from banks and hedge funds to the
New York Giants and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, as well as
individuals who hold Lehman bonds. Lehman filed for bankruptcy
on Sept. 15, 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BofA&#8217;s $8.5 Billion Mortgage-Bond Deal Defended by Investors &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for a group of investors that includes BlackRock
Inc. (BLK) defended their $8.5 billion mortgage-bond settlement with
Bank of America Corp., saying a delay in getting court approval
costs them money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They believe this is a very positive settlement,&#8221; Robert
Madden, who represents 22 institutional investors, told a
federal judge in Manhattan at a court hearing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Pauley heard arguments about
whether the settlement should be considered for approval in
federal court or returned to state court in New York, where it
was originally filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp., the mortgage-bond trustee
that sought approval for the settlement, opposes moving the case
to federal court. The removal by an investor group -- Walnut
Place LLC and related entities -- threatens to &#8220;significantly
delay&#8221; the state-court proceeding, the bank said in a court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Delay hurts investors,&#8221; Madden said in an interview
after the hearing. When Bank of New York filed the proceeding in
state court, a judge set a November hearing to consider
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed settlement resolves a fight with the
institutional investors, which wanted Bank of America to buy
back home loans that were packaged into bonds by Countrywide
Financial Corp. Bank of America, based in Charlotte, North
Carolina, acquired Countrywide in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of New York Mellon v. Walnut Place LLC,
11-cv-5988, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Liberty Media Fends Off Bank of New York Challenge to Spinoff &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Media Corp. (LINTA) fended off Bank of New York Mellon
Trust Co.&#8217;s legal challenge to its splitoffs of the Liberty
Capital and Liberty Starz tracking stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delaware Supreme Court yesterday upheld a ruling that
clears the way for Liberty, controlled by billionaire John
Malone, to transfer assets of the two tracking stocks to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The splitoffs are part of Malone&#8217;s efforts to simplify
Liberty&#8217;s financial structure and make it more attractive to
investors, Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets
Ltd. in New York, said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Heine, a Bank of New York spokesman, declined to
comment on the court ruling in an e-mailed statement. Liberty
Media executives plan to complete the splitoff of the units
tomorrow, Courtnee Ulrich, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the deals, officials of Englewood, Colorado-based Liberty want to redeem outstanding shares of the units in
exchange for shares in a newly formed company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Starz holds Liberty Media&#8217;s interest in television
company Starz Entertainment, according to the parent company&#8217;s
website. Liberty Capital holds assets, including production and
distribution company Starz Media LLC, and investments in Time
Warner Inc. (TWX), Time Warner Cable Inc. and Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is Bank of New York Mellon Trust
Company, N.A. v. Liberty Media Corp., 284, 2011, Delaware
Supreme Court (Dover). The Chancery Court case is Liberty Media
Corp. v. Bank of New York Mellon Trust Co., 5702, Delaware

&lt;h2&gt;AIG Hires Ex-IRS Deputy Counsel Potter to Protect Tax Assets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc. (AIG), the bailed-out insurer,
hired Clarissa Potter, former deputy chief counsel of the
Internal Revenue Service, to help protect tax assets accumulated
by the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potter will be deputy tax director, reporting to Tal
Kaissar, director of tax, the insurer said yesterday in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses at New York-based AIG and its subsidiaries helped
rack up more than $25 billion of so-called deferred tax assets
as of Dec. 31 that may lower obligations to governments. Chief
Executive Officer Robert Benmosche, 67, said last month the
insurer is assembling a &#8220;world-class team&#8221; to manage the
assets and that they may be used for buybacks when AIG is
prepared to repurchase stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The complexity of AIG&#8217;s global structure requires a
holistic approach to compliance with domestic and international
tax law,&#8221; Kaissar said in the statement. Potter&#8217;s &#8220;first-hand
understanding of tax policy makes her uniquely positioned to
help AIG in this regard.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. (PFE)&#8217;s credit rankings were
cut by Fitch Ratings for failing to pay off more of its debt
since the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker acquired Wyeth in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based rating service reduced Pfizer to an A+
from AA- saying its leverage level &#8220;is still not commensurate
with&#8221; the higher rating. Fitch expected the New York-based
company to reduce its debt to 1.3 times earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, said Michael Zbinovec, a Fitch analyst based in Chicago. Instead, the New
York-based company cut its debt to 1.5 times Ebitda, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zbinovec said Pfizer had tripled its debt load after the
$68 billion acquisition of Wyeth in 2009. A combination of the
debt and a reduction in revenue growth prevented the drugmaker
from reaching the target, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s ability to pay its debt obligation is somewhat
constrained,&#8221; Zbinovec said. &#8220;But the new rating should be
good for the next year and a half even with the acceleration in
patent expirations that will affect Pfizer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent on Pfizer&#8217;s best-selling drug Lipitor expires in
November. The cholesterol medicine generated $10.7 billion in
2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch also revised its outlook to stable from negative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Priceline.com
Inc. (PCLN) are among 26 stocks JPMorgan Chase  Co. says may return
more than the market if U.S. equities drop like they did after
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list includes companies with high price-to-book and
price-to-earnings ratios that are also liked by analysts and are
considered growth stocks, Thomas Lee, the New York-based firm&#8217;s
chief U.S. equity strategist, wrote in a note today. Stocks that
meet the criteria may perform better than benchmark gauges in
two scenarios: if the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index plunges like
it did in 2008 after Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy, or if it rallies,
which is what happened following the Asian crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark gauge for American equities is down 17
percent from its high in April after the U.S. lost its AAA
credit rating from SP and concern about the European debt
crisis grew. Since the beginning of August, the index has traded
between about 1,100 and 1,300. While U.S. equities reacted in
opposite directions after the two previous crises, Lee said the
valuation levels and fundamentals of the 26 stocks may mean
they&#8217;re poised to outperform no matter which direction the SP
500 moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What worked both post-Asia &#8217;98 and post-Lehman failure
&#8217;08?&#8221; Lee wrote in the note. &#8220;It is not entirely a surprise
that &#8216;growth&#8217; outperformed, but the fact these other style
attributes outperformed is less obvious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee considered companies in the SP 500 Pure Growth Index
and corporations with an enterprise value at least 8.8 times 
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.
He looked for price-to-book values higher than 2.89 and price-
to-earnings ratios above 13.9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is the list of 26 stocks that met the
criteria, according to Lee. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks are having the worst quarter
on record relative to U.S. Treasuries and gold, which may force
investors to buy equities to rebalance their allocations,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Marko Kolanovic said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and emerging-market equities have returned 43
percentage points less, the most during a quarter since at least
2002, according to data compiled by Kolanovic, whose analysis is
based on a model portfolio composed of stocks, bonds and gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This underperformance may trigger significant quarterly
rebalance flows into equities and out of Treasuries at the end
of next week,&#8221; Kolanovic, the New York-based global head of
equity derivatives strategy at JPMorgan, wrote in a note to
clients yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks lagged behind by 42 percentage points during the
fourth quarter of 2008, after the bankruptcy by Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. spurred the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression, JPMorgan data show. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
bottomed at a 12-year low in March 2009, beginning a bull market
that produced a 102 percent gain through April 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern that European officials may fail to contain the
region&#8217;s debt crisis and the U.S. economy will slip into a
recession has prompted investors to shun risky assets. Benchmark
measures for 32 of the 45 nations in the MSCI All-Country World
Index have posted 20 percent declines from their respective
peaks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Investors have
sought refuge in U.S. government debt and precious metals,
pushing yields on 10-year notes to a record low and gold futures
to all-time highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolanovic performed the study using a model portfolio that
has 30 percent invested in the SP 500, 20 percent in the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index and 10 percent in the Russell 2000 Index.
It holds 35 percent in 20-year and seven-year Treasuries, and 5
percent in gold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AppNexus Inc., the online
advertising company backed by Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), has turned
profitable and may go public late next year, founder and Chief
Executive Officer Brian O&#8217;Kelley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company has raised $65.5 million since
it was founded in 2007, with the last round of $50 million led
by Microsoft in October. AppNexus had its first profitable month
in August, O&#8217;Kelley said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The financials, the revenue, the profit and the growth
are all strong enough that we could be going public as soon as
late next year,&#8221; said O&#8217;Kelley, 34. &#8220;That&#8217;s really the path.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AppNexus provides technology, data and analytics that
companies such as Microsoft and EBay Inc. use to buy and sell
online display-advertising. The market for graphical display ads
is set to climb 25 percent in the U.S. in 2011, and will almost
double to $22 billion in 2015 from this year&#8217;s level, according
New York-based EMarketer Inc., which tracks digital marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The idea of real-time bidding is going to become
increasingly important,&#8221; said David Hallerman, an analyst with
EMarketer in New York. &#8220;There is sheer growth of display-ad
inventory as people spend more time online.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AppNexus said its revenue has grown fourfold this year
compared with 2010. The company hasn&#8217;t hired investment banks
and the IPO timing depends on market conditions, O&#8217;Kelley said.
Newly issued stocks during their first publicly traded year are
performing the worst since July 2009, according to the Bloomberg
IPO Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Media, DoubleClick &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Kelley said he prefers an IPO to a sale as the management
team wants to be in charge of building AppNexus into a global
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would be hard to see a sale as the right outcome,&#8221;
O&#8217;Kelley said. &#8220;I feel immense loyalty to the team we&#8217;ve built.
As a public company we can control our destiny.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of O&#8217;Kelley&#8217;s top employees came from companies that
were bought. He and co-founder Mike Nolet worked at online
advertising company Right Media Inc., and left when Yahoo! Inc.
purchased it in 2007. Michael Rubenstein, now AppNexus
president, was at DoubleClick Inc. when Google Inc. (GOOG) purchased it
in 2008 for about $3.1 billion. AppNexus began with 20 employees
and projects to be at 200 at end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the next few months, O&#8217;Kelley will build the business
through acquisitions in Europe. His management team has talked
to more than 80 European companies on a trip this week,
including customers and potential takeover targets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which opened an office in London this summer,
was drawn to Europe through partnerships with Hi-Media SA (HIM), a
Paris-based electronic payments company, and Microsoft, the
world&#8217;s largest software maker, O&#8217;Kelley said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the fourth-biggest seller of display ads in the
U.S., unveiled partnerships this month with AppNexus and
MediaMath. Microsoft&#8217;s share is less than one-third of
Facebook&#8217;s and about half of Google&#8217;s, according to EMarketer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AppNexus&#8217;s investors also include Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway, First Round Capital, Venrock Associates, Kodiak Venture
Partners and Khosla Ventures. Bloomberg LP, the parent company
of Bloomberg News, is an investor in Andreessen&#8217;s venture-
capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz. &lt;/p&gt;

announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Regulla&#8217;s years at Goldman, the U.S. bank oversaw
the sale of cosmetics-ingredient maker Cognis to BASF SE (BAS) for
about $3.8 billion as well as the $609 million initial public
offering of AZ Electronic Materials SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His arrival coincides with Bank of America&#8217;s dismissal of
13 investment bankers in its industrials group, including
managing directors David Iwan and Egan Antill, two people with
direct knowledge of the actions said Sept. 20. Bank of America
is ranked second in the U.S. and globally in industrial-firm
fees, according to Dealogic, an information and consulting
service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions of industrial companies accounted
for about 15 percent of all MA activity in the last decade,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s debt woes have led to a pause in chemical mergers
and acquisitions as chief executives take extra time to decide
whether to pursue takeover targets and private equity firms
suffer stiffer constraints on fund-raising. By mid-year,
chemical makers in Europe alone had accumulated $25 billion in
cash after instigating cost cuts during the recession, according
to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategic buyers dominated in the $14 billion of chemical
dealmaking in the second quarter, PricewaterhouseCoopers said in
an August report. Private equity accounted for only 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank may lower
its benchmark interest by 50 basis points when policy makers
meet next month to bolster the euro-region economy, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB may cut borrowing costs to 1 percent at the Oct. 6
meeting, Greg Fuzesi, an economist at JPMorgan in London, said
in an e-mailed note. If the central bank lowered its key rate by
25 basis points at that meeting, &#8220;we would expect another move
to follow very quickly, at the latest by&#8221; December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro-region economy may &#8220;slide back into recession,
with gross domestic product declining at a 1 percent annualized
pace&#8221; from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the second quarter of
2012, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management
Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said the global financial system risks
repeating the crisis of 2008 if Europe&#8217;s debt crisis escalates
and spreads to the U.S. banking industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is where the parallels with 2008 are relevant, even
though I think they are being over exaggerated,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said
in an interview on CNBC today. &#8220;It was when the financial
system really imploded that financial firms stopped extending
credit to anybody that the corporate world had to destock and we
know what happened after that. We are not far off the same sort
of thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $3.4 trillion has been erased from equity values
this week, driving global stocks into a bear market, as the
Federal Reserve&#8217;s new stimulus and a pledge by Group of 20
nations fails to ease concern the global economy is on the brink
of another recession. O&#8217;Neill said the Fed&#8217;s plan to shift $400
billion of short-term debt into longer term Treasuries hasn&#8217;t
convinced investors it will strengthen growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fear that it&#8217;s all dependent on the Fed, together
with this mess in Europe, is really getting people more and more
worried as this week comes to an end,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;The
markets have taken the latest FOMC move rather badly, which adds
a whole new angle to it. It&#8217;s the first time since the global
rally started in early 2009 that the markets have rejected a Fed
easing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline in U.S. stocks after the announcement on Sept.
21 of the Fed&#8217;s announcement contrasts with the reaction to the
second round of quantitative easing. The SP 500 Index rose 24
percent from the day Chairman Ben S. Bernanke first signaled the
policy in August 2010 to its conclusion in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks fell for a third day today, with the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index slipping 1.5 percent as of 1:52 p.m. in London.
The FTSE 100 Index declined 1.2 percent. U.S. stock futures also
fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The solution for the U.S. is not more tinkering by the
Fed, but doing things like micro-policies to get U.S. companies
to spend more money on investment and jobs,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Group of 20 finance chiefs late yesterday promised to
address rising risks to the global economy and pushed Europe to
contain its debt crisis. The European Central Bank may act to
tackle risks to growth as soon as next month should economic
data disappoint, Governing Council member Luc Coene said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As the problem in Europe spreads from Greece to more and
more other countries and in particular Italy, the exposure that
so many people bank-wise have to Italian debt means the systems
can&#8217;t cope easily with that and it would spread way beyond
Europe&#8217;s borders,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;This is why the policy
makers need to stop being so sleepy and get on and lead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. (BAC) is among a
group of lenders that may face a wave of new lawsuits claiming
cash-strapped counties were cheated out of millions of dollars
by a system used for more than a decade to register mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said state
attorneys general and county officials across the U.S. have
expressed interest in his lawsuit against Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems Inc. and Bank of America, filed in Texas
state court on Sept. 21. Dallas County could be owed as much as
$100 million in filing fees, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a big new front,&#8221; said Christopher L. Peterson,
associate dean and professor at the University of Utah S.J.
Quinney College of Law. &#8220;This case is scary because if Dallas
wins then there are a lot of other counties around the country
that are going to follow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MERS, a unit of Reston, Virginia-based Merscorp Inc., says
on its website that its aim is to place every mortgage in the
country on an electronic, rather than a paper, system that
allows members to buy and sell mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MERS acts as the lender&#8217;s nominee and remains the mortgagee
of record as long as the note promising repayment is owned by a
MERS member. Dallas County claims this allows banks to buy and
sell loans without properly recording transfers with counties
and paying the fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The MERS business model and practices are legal and
comply with the recording statutes and regulations of Texas,&#8221;
Janis Smith, a spokeswoman for Merscorp, said in an e-mail. The
claims in the lawsuit &#8220;are without legal or factual merit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shirley Norton, a spokeswoman for Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America, the biggest U.S. lender by
assets, declined to comment on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liability in the Dallas case could exceed $1 billion, based
on the number of mortgages in the county, Peterson said. Local
laws impose substantial penalties, as well as back payments of
fees and taxes, if false documents were filed in land
transactions, said Peterson, who has advised private plaintiffs
making similar claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faulty mortgages and foreclosures have already cost the
five biggest home lenders $66 billion, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America&#8217;s credit rating was cut
on Sept. 21 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service in part because the
bill for mortgage disputes may climb past the $39 billion
committed since 2007. County clerks in Kentucky have also sued
MERS, while officials in Massachusetts and Michigan say they are
exploring the possibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas case is Dallas County v. Merscorp Inc., CC-11-
06571-E, County Court at Law, Dallas County, Texas. The Kentucky
case is Christian County Clerk v. Mortgage Electronic
Registration Systems Inc., 5:11-cv-00072, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Kentucky (Louisville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Sues American Century Over $848 Million Share Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sued mutual fund firm American Century
Cos. over claims it was shortchanged in a $848 million optioned
share sale to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Century failed to disclose material information
regarding the sale and the shares were not purchased at their
fair market value, lawyers for JPMorgan said in a public version
of the complaint filed Sept. 21 in Delaware Chancery Court. The
complaint was initially filed under seal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegation that American Century breached an option
agreement is without merit and the edited complaint filed in
Delaware yesterday is an inaccurate and incomplete
representation of the facts,&#8221; American Century said in a
statement e-mailed by Chris Doyle, a spokesman for the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIBC, Canada&#8217;s fifth-largest bank, announced in July that
it agreed to buy a 41 percent stake in American Century from
JPMorgan. The cash acquisition is the third-largest purchase by
the Toronto-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan purchased a roughly 45 percent interest in Kansas
City, Missouri-based American Century for about $900 million in
January 1998, according to the complaint. Under a 2009 option
agreement between American and JPMorgan, American could purchase
all of the shares JPMorgan owned in the firm and resell them to
a third party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, said in its complaint that it
learned of the share sale through a public announcement. The
transaction was completed on Aug. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;American Century improperly withheld information
regarding the CIBC stock sale from JPMorgan&#8217;s director designee
on American Century&#8217;s board,&#8221; lawyers for the bank said in the
redacted complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. American Century
Companies Inc., CA6875, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Trustee Sues Atlantic Security Bank for $120 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee overseeing the liquidation of Bernard L.
Madoff&#8217;s firm sued Atlantic Security Bank for $120 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is one of several filed by Irving Picard to
recoup what he said is &#8220;customer property&#8221; from companies that
invested with Fairfield Sentry Ltd., a so-called feeder fund
that placed money in the con man&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. Atlantic
Security Bank is incorporated in the Cayman Islands and has
offices in Panama, according to Picard&#8217;s suit filed yesterday in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. A phone number for the bank
couldn&#8217;t be immediately located. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Atlantic Security Bank, 11-02730,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Family Wins Partial Dismissal of $198 Million Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s family won dismissal of part of a $198
million lawsuit by the liquidator of the con man&#8217;s firm, while
the judge left Irving Picard free to pursue most of his claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland struck Picard&#8217;s
claims for some transfers of money out of the jailed Ponzi
scheme operator&#8217;s firm. Picard, who sued Madoff&#8217;s brother, two
sons and niece, is free to amend his suit, the judge said in a
court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard&#8217;s 2009 lawsuit against the brother, Peter Madoff,
sons Andrew and Mark Madoff and niece Shana Madoff Swanson, all
of whom held senior positions at the defunct money-management
firm, claimed they spent more than $198 million of investors&#8217;
money and treated the con man&#8217;s investment firm as their
&#8220;family piggy bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Madoff was chief compliance officer at Bernard L.
Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Madoff&#8217;s sons, Andrew and
Mark, were co-directors of trading at the investment firm, and
Shana Madoff was compliance director, according to Picard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Madoff committed suicide in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mark and Andrew Madoff had no prior knowledge of Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s crimes and contacted the U.S. Department of Justice and
the SEC immediately after their father told them he had
defrauded his investment advisory clients,&#8221; Martin Flumenbaum,
a lawyer for Andrew Madoff and Mark Madoff&#8217;s estate, said in an
e-mail yesterday. &#8220;Whether or not the trustee amends his
complaint to reassert some or all of the claims that were
dismissed today, we fully expect to prevail on the merits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Spada, who has been representing Peter Madoff, had
no comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Smith, a lawyer for Shana Madoff, didn&#8217;t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refusing to dismiss the entire suit, Lifland said the
family&#8217;s failure to stop Madoff&#8217;s fraud was &#8220;unsurprising given
their close familial relationship with Madoff and proximity&#8221; to
his firm. However, Picard&#8217;s suit contains &#8220;some correctable
pleading deficiencies&#8221; that need to be amended, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Peter Madoff, 09-1503, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS Trader Adoboli Faces Added Fraud Charge, Prosecutor Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kweku Adoboli, the UBS AG (UBSN) trader charged with fraud and
false accounting that may have resulted in a $2.3 billion loss,
said through his lawyer that he was &#8220;sorry beyond words&#8221; after
facing an additional fraud charge at a court hearing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 31-year-old, who holds a Ghanaian passport, didn&#8217;t
apply for bail when he appeared at a magistrate&#8217;s court in
London. Prosecutor David Levy said the alleged loss may exceed
$2.3 billion. Adoboli wasn&#8217;t required to enter a plea yesterday
and another hearing was scheduled for Oct. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trader is &#8220;sorry beyond words for what happened
here,&#8221; said Patrick Gibbs, Adoboli&#8217;s lawyer. He apologized for
his &#8220;disastrous miscalculations,&#8221; Gibbs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoboli, who appeared yesterday wearing a dark grey suit,
white shirt and navy tie, has been in police custody since he
was arrested Sept. 15 on suspicion of making the unauthorized
trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors charged him Sept. 17 with fraud and false
accounting dating back to 2008. The prosecution yesterday added
a charge to extend the fraud allegations to 2008 as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If convicted, he faces as many as 10 years in prison,
according to sentencing guidelines. Time spent in custody
beforehand would be deducted from any sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Louise Hodges, another of Adoboli&#8217;s lawyers, declined to
comment after the hearing. Yves Kaufmann, a spokesman for UBS in
Zurich said &#8220;the loss arising from the unauthorized trades is
$2.3 billion, as we have stated&#8221; previously. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smith Barney Lead Plaintiff Thrown Out, Never Owned Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. (C)&#8217;s Smith Barney unit can&#8217;t be sued by the
lead plaintiff in a six-year-old shareholder fraud class action
because the fund never owned any shares that are the basis of
the lawsuit, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William H. Pauley III, citing &#8220;epic
failures&#8221; by the lawyers on both sides of the case, yesterday
dismissed the lead plaintiff, Operating Local 649 Annuity Trust
Fund. The fund&#8217;s attorneys told the judge that their client
owned more than 75,000 shares of a similarly named security and
not those involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pauley called the effect of the error &#8220;seismic,&#8221; and said
it has caused &#8220;considerable waste of time and resources.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After six years of litigation, including extensive motion
practice, an appeal to the Second Circuit, remand, more motion
practice, and discovery, lead counsel learned that the lead
plaintiff never purchased any of the securities at issue in this
action,&#8221; Pauley, in Manhattan, wrote in yesterday&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein Liebhard partner Stanley Bernstein said the
lawyers relied on the union&#8217;s certification that it had bought
the mutual fund shares and brokerage statements that mistakenly
reflected the mutual fund shares along with their ticker symbol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We did not just rely on somebody&#8217;s word,&#8221; Bernstein said
in a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;We had the underlying core
documentation from the broker. And it was wrong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Platt, a partner in the New York office of Wilmer
Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP, which represents Citigroup,
declined to comment on Pauley&#8217;s opinion yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mistake will require several motions to be rebriefed, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Smith Barney Transfer Agent Litigation,
05-cv-07583, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank Swap Ruling May Apply to Other Cases, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German top court ruling on swaps that Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)
lost in March may also apply in cases involving other
derivatives, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Frankfurt Regional Court will review to what extent the
top court ruling governs currency options as well, Presiding
Judge Bruno Menhofer said yesterday at a hearing in a lawsuit
against the lender seeking 30 million euros ($40 million) in
damages. The court&#8217;s assessment is preliminary, he said. The
case was brought by travel company Schauinsland-Reisen GmbH. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Court of Justice, Germany&#8217;s highest civil
court, ruled in March that Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank must
cover losses caused by a derivative it branded a &#8220;CMS Spread
Ladder Swap,&#8221; because the bank didn&#8217;t disclose the product had
a initial negative market value. Deutsche Bank is arguing that
ruling only applies to the same kind of product. Former
customers are hoping to capitalize on the ruling to collect
damages for other bets that went sour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The top court has used very, very strong language as
regards disclosure duties the bank has,&#8221; said Menhofer. &#8220;The
ruling is a leading precedent setting clear standards and we
have to see how they apply to the product at issue here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is LG Frankfurt, 3-04 O 50/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saad Group&#8217;s Al-Sanea Wins End to $9.2 Billion Asset Freeze &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maan al-Sanea, founder of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s Saad Group, won
dismissal of a $9.2 billion asset freeze in the Cayman Islands
after Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi  Brothers Co. admitted failing to
disclose evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algosaibi agreed it &#8220;breached its duty of full and frank
disclosure&#8221; when it won the asset freeze against al-Sanea in
2009, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands ruled Sept. 21.
Algosaibi applied last month to voluntarily dismiss the freeze
after it found new evidence that should have been revealed
earlier. Al-Sanea still faces a fraud lawsuit filed by Algosaibi
in New York and probes in Bahrain and Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since AHAB started its litigation scheme over two years
ago, I have been resolute in my complete rejection of its
desperate claims that I somehow defrauded the Algosaibis,&#8221; al-
Sanea said yesterday in a statement, using Algosaibi&#8217;s initials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The asset freeze was part of a global legal dispute between
the companies after they defaulted in 2009 on a total of about
$15.7 billion in loans from more than 100 banks. Al-Sanea, one
of Saudi Arabia&#8217;s richest men who married into the Algosaibi
family before founding Saad Group, faces claims he forged
signatures to take out as much as $10 billion in fake loans
through Algosaibi&#8217;s Money Exchange unit, which he ran. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dismissal of the asset freeze doesn&#8217;t prove al-Sanea&#8217;s
innocence or reduce his legal troubles, said Eric Lewis, a legal
coordinator for the Algosaibi family. Al-Sanea has refused to
appear in court in the Cayman Islands, Lewis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Algosaibi &#8220;voluntarily withdrew the freezing order and did
not seek a new one, despite all the essential allegations of
fraud and forgery having been proven correct,&#8221; Lewis said.
&#8220;Maan al-Sanea has spent two years in procedural maneuvers to
avoid a court from considering his vast fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing, General Dynamics Seek End to $3 Billion Claims Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co. (BA) and General Dynamics Corp. (GD) urged a federal
claims court judge to end the companies&#8217; 20-year-old dispute
with the U.S. in which the government sought $3 billion over a
canceled Navy aircraft contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the companies asked U.S. Federal Claims Judge
Robert Hodges during a hearing yesterday to find that the case
over the A-12 bomber can no longer be litigated because of
classified data, noting that the parties, with their cross
claims, &#8220;have fought to a draw&#8221; after two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have come the conclusion that it&#8217;s time for the Boeing
Company to lay down its sword,&#8221; said Boeing&#8217;s lawyer, Charles
Cooper of Cooper  Kirk in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight has moved back and forth among courts since it
began in 1991, reaching the U.S. Supreme Court in September
2010. In May, the high court set aside a ruling that put the
U.S. in line to recover $3 billion from the companies. The case
was sent back to a lower court to determine whether the
government had a responsibility to disclose classified
information vital to the performance of the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department said yesterday that it will continue
to pursue the claim, arguing that the justices had an
opportunity to dismiss the case and didn&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the Supreme Court had wanted that outcome, it could
have ordered that outcome,&#8221; Justice Department lawyer Bryant
Snee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, lawyers for Boeing, which also filed claims
against the government, sent a letter to the department urging
it to drop the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The time has come for all parties to step back, to

&lt;p&gt;Galleon Sentencing Scorecard: Average Prison Term Is 3 Years &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam will be
sentenced on Oct. 13 for insider trading after being convicted
by a jury in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors say Rajaratnam, who was convicted in May,
should serve as long as 24 1/2 years in prison, calling him the
&#8220;modern face of insider trading.&#8221; On Sept. 21, judges in
Manhattan sentenced two other convicted insider traders -- Zvi
Goffer and Winifred Jiau -- to prison terms of 10 years and four
years, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Rajaratnam&#8217;s arrest in October 2009, judges in
Manhattan federal court have sentenced 12 defendants in cases
linked to Galleon. All but two pleaded guilty. The average
prison term has been 35.75 months, or almost three years behind
bars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, those convicted at a trial get longer prison
terms than those pleading guilty. In addition to the two Galleon
defendants who took their cases to a jury, Manhattan judges
since 2003 have imposed sentences in three other cases where the
main charge was insider trading and a jury returned a guilty
verdict. The average sentence has been six years and two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About two dozen others are waiting to be sentenced in the
Galleon cases. They include Emanuel Goffer, a former trader and
brother of Zvi Goffer, who was convicted at a trial, and Anil
Kumar, a former McKinsey  Co. executive who pleaded guilty and
testified against Rajaratnam in a bid for leniency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rajaratnam case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Approves Madoff Trustee Settlement With Tremont Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge approved a $1 billion settlement of a lawsuit by
liquidator of Bernard Madoff&#8217;s firm and hedge-fund firm Tremont
Group Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the deal approved yesterday by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Burton Lifland, trustee Irving Picard will accept a cash payment
of more than $1 billion from funds associated with Tremont. In
exchange, the Tremont funds will be allowed to make claims on
the Madoff estate of about $3 billion, according to court
filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement is &#8220;fair and reasonable,&#8221; Lifland said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the parties settling were Oppenheimer Acquisition
Corp., an affiliate of the Oppenheimer mutual funds that bought
Tremont, and Oppenheimer&#8217;s parents, MassMutual Holding LLC and
Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, New York Life Insurance Co. and six
other insurance companies assailed the settlement. As limited
partners of the hedge-fund firm&#8217;s Opportunity III fund, they
said they would lose if a court rules that the Ponzi scheme&#8217;s
so-called net winners should be compensated, because they
wouldn&#8217;t be allowed to recalculate their claims. A U.S. appeals
court yesterday denied Picard&#8217;s move to strike a request by
Madoff investors for a second hearing on the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard sued Tremont and related entities for $2.1 billion,
saying they ignored warnings that Madoff could be running a
Ponzi scheme and profited from it, according to a complaint
unsealed in March. The payment from Tremont, the second-biggest
so-called feeder into Madoff&#8217;s multibillion-dollar fraud, will
add to the $2.6 billion in the fund for Madoff customers, Picard
has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Tremont Group Holdings Inc., 10-5310,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PharmAthene Wins Rights to Profit From Siga Smallpox Drug &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siga Technologies Inc. (SIGA) must share with PharmAthene Inc. (PIP)
profit from sales of a smallpox drug that may total more than
$400 million, a judge ruled. Trading in shares of both companies
was halted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaware Chancery Court Judge Donald Parsons Jr. in
Wilmington said yesterday New York-based Siga breached its
obligation to negotiate in good faith on ST-246, an antiviral
drug for use in case of a biological attack. Parsons rejected
PharmAthene&#8217;s claim that Siga breached a binding license
agreement. He also denied claims for a lump sum award and
instead ordered the companies to share the profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The plaintiff is entitled to share in any profits
realized from the sale of the drug in question,&#8221; Parsons said
yesterday in a 118-page opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis Goldberg, a Siga spokesman, said the company couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment on the ruling. Siga was preparing a
statement, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stacey Jurchison, a spokeswoman for Annapolis, Maryland-
based PharmAthene, said the ruling appears to have granted the
company a &#8220;50 percent profit split.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We think it is a very good outcome,&#8221; Jurchison said in a
phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford Wins Reversal of $43 Million Award in Fatal Crash Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co. (F) won reversal of an Illinois jury&#8217;s $43
million damage award in a lawsuit filed after a 2003 crash
killed a 73-year-old man and severely burned his wife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Illinois Supreme Court yesterday threw out the verdict
rendered after a 2005 trial concluding that Dora Jablonski and
the estate of her husband, John, failed to prove the gas tank of
their 1993 Lincoln Town Car had been defectively designed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their car burst into flames after being hit in the rear by
another vehicle traveling at an estimated 55 to 65 miles per
hour while they were stopped at a highway construction zone in
southwest Illinois, causing an item in the trunk to pierce the
tank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs presented insufficient evidence from which a
jury could conclude that Ford breached its duty of reasonable
care&#8221; on three negligent design theories, the court said. It
rejected a fourth argument as not viable under state law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradley M. Lakin, the Wood River, Illinois, attorney who
took the case to trial, didn&#8217;t immediately reply to telephone
messages seeking comment on yesterday&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ford is gratified by the court&#8217;s decision,&#8221; Marcey
Evans, a spokeswoman for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker,
said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The 1993 Town Car exceeded all federal crash safety
standards,&#8221; she said. &#8220;While the Jablonskis were victims of a
tragic accident caused by a distracted driver who rear-ended
them at 60 miles per hour, it was unfair to blame Ford for their
injuries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Zabel Said to Get Deputy U.S. Attorney Post in N.Y. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Zabel, a federal prosecutor in Manhattan, was
promoted to deputy U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zabel served as co-head of litigation at Akin Gump Strauss
Hauer  Feld LLP from 1999 until 2009, when he rejoined the
prosecutor&#8217;s office in Manhattan. He replaces Boyd Johnson III,
who is leaving to join the law firm Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale
 Dorr LLP, according to the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School,
Zabel worked as an assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan from
1991 to 1999, holding positions including chief of the office&#8217;s
narcotics unit. He co-wrote two reports published in 2008 and
2009 by the group Human Rights First, &#8220;In Pursuit of Justice,
Prosecuting Terrorism Cases in the Federal Courts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He twice won the Attorney General&#8217;s Award for Distinguished
Service for his role in the prosecutions of a violent criminal
organization known as the Latin Kings and members of the Gambino
organized crime family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson, a graduate of Hamilton College and Cornell Law
School, has been a prosecutor in the office since 1999, holding
positions including chief of the public corruption unit and head
of the international narcotics trafficking unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is scheduled to start work with Washington-based Wilmer
Hale&#8217;s litigation and white-collar practices on Oct. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the supervision of both men, prosecutors in the
office have won several insider-trading cases including the May
conviction of Raj Rajaratnam, co-founder of Galleon Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said it
exited a bet that the euro will strengthen against the dollar
after the 17-nation currency weakened to below a so-called stop-
loss level that triggered the end of the trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade was stopped at a &#8220;theoretical loss&#8221; of 4.2
percent including interest, the New York-based company said in a
note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The recent sharp increase in risk aversion, much of this
originating in Europe, and upward pressure on the dollar across
a wide range of currencies lately, has pushed the cross below
our 1.35 closing stop,&#8221; Goldman said in the note written by
analysts including chief strategist Thomas Stolper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro rose 0.6 percent against the dollar to $1.3551 at
9:42 a.m. in London. The single European currency has weakened
1.8 percent against the dollar from last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recapitalizing 16 European banks
which came close to failing stress tests won&#8217;t ease the
financial crisis because the banks are small and the market&#8217;s
attention is on larger French lenders, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks that didn&#8217;t achieve a core Tier-1 capital ratio
of at least 6 percent under the European Banking Authority&#8217;s
tests are &#8220;individually small,&#8221; and they weren&#8217;t examined for
their entire investments in sovereign debt, which is now the
market&#8217;s concern, the analysts led by Jernej Omahen in London
wrote in a note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union officials may speed up the recapitalization
of the 16 banks, the Financial Times reported yesterday. The EBA
is pushing banks to raise more and better capital to meet the
Basel III guidelines and boost investor confidence in the
industry amid the sovereign debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The current bank crisis is a symptom of markets&#8217;
skepticism in sustainability of European public finances; to
this, recaps do not provide an answer,&#8221; the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16 banks include Banco Comercial Portugues SA, Espirito
Santo Financial Group SA, Germany&#8217;s HSH Nordbank AG and
Norddeutsche Landesbank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New World Resources Plc had its

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA), the
world&#8217;s biggest payments networks, may face a merchant backlash
by raising debit-card swipe fees on the smallest purchases to
the maximum allowed under U.S. caps that take effect next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MasterCard will impose the highest fees permitted on all
debit transactions, including so-called small-ticket purchases,
for cards issued by the biggest U.S. banks, said a person with
direct knowledge of the matter. Visa will do the same, Thomas McCrohan, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, wrote in a
Sept. 21 note, without saying how he got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The networks, which pass the fees to lenders such as
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and Citigroup Inc., now charge retailers
1.55 percent of the purchase price plus 4 cents for small-ticket
transactions of less than $15. That comes to about 7 cents for a
$2 cup of coffee. The cost to merchants for that item would more
than triple under rules created by the Federal Reserve, which
capped the fees at 21 cents, plus 5 basis points of the total
and a conditional 1 cent for fraud-prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mom-and-pop coffee shop that processes lots of $3
transactions is really going to get hurt by this,&#8221; said Brian Dodge, a spokesman for the Retail Industry Leaders Association,
a trade group that represents the biggest U.S. merchants,
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Home Depot Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new fee structure won&#8217;t apply to cards issued by banks
and credit unions with less than $10 billion in assets, which
are exempt from the law, a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price Controls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the debate in Congress last year and the rule-making
process that ensued, banks and payment networks said that
capping swipe fees, or interchange, would be tantamount to
government price controls and result in unintended consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MasterCard recently informed our issuers that we will
implement a two-tiered interchange structure,&#8221; James Issokson,
a spokesman for Purchase, New York-based MasterCard, said
yesterday in a statement. &#8220;As we have noted throughout this
process, setting price caps will -- and has -- created
distortions in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Valentine, a spokesman for San Francisco-based Visa,
John Hall of the American Bankers Association and the Federal
Reserve&#8217;s Susan Stawick declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest network, and No. 2 MasterCard
processed 36.9 billion debit-card purchase transactions in the
U.S. last year, company data show. About 20 percent of all
debit-card purchases are small-ticket, according to Brian Riley,
senior research director at TowerGroup, a Boston-based research
and advisory firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lobbying Fight &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers and financial firms spent about $30 million and
deployed more than 500 lobbyists in the battle to influence the
legislation and rule-making, people briefed with the
expenditures said in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fee caps, set to take effect Oct. 1, replace a formula
that averages 1.14 percent of the purchase price, or about 44
cents for the typical $38 debit transaction. The change may cut
annual revenue at the biggest banks by $8 billion, data compiled
by Bloomberg Government show, and the increase for small-ticket
purchases may help them recoup some of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That also may help Visa and MasterCard assuage their
biggest bank customers and stave off competition from other
debit networks, including Pulse, a unit of Discover Financial
Services (DFS), and First Data Corp.&#8217;s Star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fee-Fixing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Visa and MasterCard have customers on the bank side so
they have to make sure their issuers are happy, and on the other
side they have to make sure the retailers aren&#8217;t getting charged
too much,&#8221; said Trish Wexler, a spokeswoman for the Electronic
Payments Coalition, which represents banks and networks. &#8220;There
are unintended consequences that result when the government
steps in and pretends to know better than the free market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limits, championed by U.S. Senator Richard Durbin, an
Illinois Democrat, have led banks to end debit-card rewards
programs and add fees for checking accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The looming increase in small-ticket swipe fees
&#8220;underscores the anti-competitive nature of the fee-fixing
relationship that big banks have with Visa and MasterCard and
reaffirms the need for reasonable regulation of the swipe-fee
system,&#8221; Max Gleischman, a spokesman for Durbin, said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) chief
Economist Bruce Kasman said Greece is insolvent and headed
toward a depression that will cause catastrophic damage across
Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a social contract that&#8217;s been broken between
Greece and the rest of the region,&#8221; Kasman said today during a
panel discussion at the Institute of International Finance
annual meeting in Washington. &#8220;Greece is insolvent and the
European Union needs to deal with that. It hasn&#8217;t yet come to
terms with that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kasman said the uncoordinated and sporadic response from
the region&#8217;s political leaders has &#8220;fed fears&#8221; in the markets
that they don&#8217;t have the wherewithal to deal with the region&#8217;s
fiscal problems. The lack of clarity in solving Greece&#8217;s credit
problems has exacerbated the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Damage is done,&#8221; Kasman said. &#8220;Europe in our mind is
entering recession.&#8221; Greece is heading toward a depression, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said poor risk-management, not sophisticated products,
is to blame for financial-company losses and failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you don&#8217;t invest in risk-management, it doesn&#8217;t matter
what business you&#8217;re in, it&#8217;s a risky business,&#8221; Cohn said
today at a panel discussion in Washington sponsored by the
Institute of International Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of financial-company collapses dating back to
Barings Plc or Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has &#8220;never been
sophisticated products, it&#8217;s been a risk-management issue or a
separation of duties problem&#8221; in which a trader was able to
manipulate operational controls in the back office, Cohn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has a &#8220;robust separation of duties in our
organization&#8221; between traders and back-office administrators so
that traders can&#8217;t manipulate operational controls, he said.
&#8220;We have just continuously reiterated a farther divide in how
those people interact to make sure we&#8217;re protecting the assets
of the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goldman Sachs allows employees to change jobs and
move into the trading business from the back office, Cohn said
the New York-based company ensures that those traders lose
access to administrative processes they had in the back office. &lt;/p&gt;

for employee compensation. Shareholders Ken Brown and Central
Laborers Pension Fund filed similar suits the following month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Judge Bernard J. Fried ordered the
lawsuits dismissed on Sept. 21, according to court documents
filed today. The plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal in January
2010, after New York-based Goldman Sachs said its ratio of
compensation and benefits to net revenue for 2009 was its
&#8220;lowest as a public company,&#8221; Fried said in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fried denied the plaintiffs&#8217; request for attorney fees and
expenses, and rejected a request from Brown -- who died in
December 2010 -- for an incentive fee award of $25,000. Brown&#8217;s
attorney, Lynda J. Grant, didn&#8217;t immediately return a voice-mail
message seeking comment on Fried&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay Record &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, which set a Wall Street pay record in 2007, was
pilloried by politicians and labor unions for its compensation
practices after getting taxpayer aid during the financial
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman had a 2007 compensation and benefits expense of
$20.2 billion, or 43.9 percent of revenue, that came to an
average of $661,490 per employee, according to company reports.
The pay expense dropped to $10.9 billion, or 48 percent of
revenue, in 2008 and was $16.2 billion, or 36 percent of
revenue, in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Goldman Sachs officials set aside $8.44 billion
for the company&#8217;s compensation pool in the first six months of
this year. That was 9 percent less than in the same period in
2010 as revenue tumbled 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein&#8217;s
$19 million compensation for 2010, which included a $5.4 million
cash bonus, was almost double the prior year&#8217;s award even as
Goldman Sach&#8217;s profits fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and other firm executives agreed to forgo cash
bonuses in 2009 and take restricted stock grants as compensation
to mute criticism of the firm&#8217;s pay practices. Goldman Sachs
officials received billions of dollars in pay and bonuses last
year while the firm settled claims by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission that executives misled investors in
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm agreed to pay $550 million, the largest penalty
ever levied by the SEC against a Wall Street firm, to resolve
regulators&#8217; claims that marketing materials about the
investments had &#8220;incomplete information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Brown v. Blankfein, 650003/2010, and Central
Laborers&#8217; Pension Fund v. Goldman Sachs, 600036/2010, both in
New York State Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN), the biggest
U.S. online travel agency by stock market value, appointed
former Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) executive Darren Huston as chief
executive officer of its European hotel unit, Booking.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kees Koolen, the founder and former head of Booking.com,
will serve as chairman, the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company
said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in Priceline&#8217;s international business, the bulk of
which comes from Booking.com, surged 90 percent to $612.9
million in the second quarter, accounting for 56 percent of
total sales. Since acquiring Amsterdam-based Booking.com in
2005, Priceline&#8217;s annual revenue has more than tripled and the
stock price has jumped more than 20-fold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Globally, there are significant opportunities for our
business, both in core markets and in developing ones,&#8221; Huston,
45, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Booking.com offers access to more than 165,000 hotels in 43
languages. Priceline also owns Agoda.com in Bangkok. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priceline fell $1.02 to $513.59 at 4 p.m. today on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have gained 29 percent this
year, compared with the 7.5 percent drop in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huston joined Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software
maker, in 2003 and spent the last three years as corporate vice
president in the consumer and online business. From 2005 to 2008
he was CEO of Microsoft Japan, the largest unit of the Redmond,
Washington-based company outside the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to Microsoft, Huston was a senior vice president at
Starbucks Corp. (SBUX), handling acquisitions and product development
at the world&#8217;s biggest operator of coffee shops. Huston has a
master&#8217;s degree in business administration from Harvard Business
School. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julio Callegari, who oversees 4.3
billion reais ($2.3 billion) as head of fixed-income securities
at JPMorgan Asset Management in Brazil, said the odds the
Brazilian government may remove the tax on foreign-exchange
derivatives are &#8220;relatively high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Callegari commented today in an interview at JPMorgan&#8217;s
offices in Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On IOF tax and inflation risks: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The important message is, if the Brazilian real
depreciates too fast, and more than the fall in commodity
prices, then this is a risk for inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not our baseline yet, but taking into account the
risks for the global economy, the odds of recession are quite
clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this scenario, it means we could see further
depreciation of emerging-market currencies, and possibly this
would trigger this kind of attitude, removing the IOF or more
selling of U.S. dollars by the central bank.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk that they remove the IOF tax -- particularly on
derivatives -- the odds are relatively high.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the outlook for inflation after the central bank&#8217;s surprise
interest-rate cut in August: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are generally very cautious at this point in terms of
risk we are taking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are reducing duration in the fixed-income portfolio
and our bias, and particularly after the last Copom decision
when they surprised the market, out bias is for the inflation-
linked bonds.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe in decoupling, certainly Brazil will
perform better than the developed world in this scenario, but
this doesn&#8217;t mean decoupling. This just means that on a relative
basis, we&#8217;ll suffer less, but we&#8217;re going to suffer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) expects to make a
final decision in 2013 about how much more to invest in an
effort to add as many as 6 billion barrels of crude reserves to
an oil field shared by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. energy company is moving ahead with
a pilot project by injecting steam into the Wafra field in a
border area between the neighboring countries after early work
showed &#8220;very promising&#8221; results, Kenneth Sniffen, a spokesman
for Saudi Arabian Chevron, said today in an interview in Manama,
Bahrain. Saudi Arabian Chevron is a fully owned subsidiary of
California-based Chevron Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Wafra field is mature, and it&#8217;s producing at a
declining rate,&#8221; Sniffen said. &#8220;We want to add 500,000 barrels
a day to whatever amount the field will be producing once
injecting steam is applied on a large scale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wafra will be the world&#8217;s largest project for recovering
oil through steam injection once Chevron applies the technique
to the entire field. The company hopes to be injecting steam
into most, if not all, of the deposit by 2017, Sniffen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron has injected steam to help produce crude at a field
in Bakersfield, California, for almost 50 years and at a deposit
in Indonesia for almost 30 years. Wafra yields about 240,000
barrels a day of light and heavy crudes, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in OPEC, has 264.5
billion barrels of total proved crude reserves, according to the
BP Statistical Review of World Energy, published in June. Kuwait
has 101.5 billion barrels in reserves, according to the same
review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) is cutting orders to
vendors in the supply chain for its iPad tablet computer, a move
that may result in slower sales for companies including Hon Hai
Precision Industry Co., JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several supply-chain vendors indicated in the past two
weeks that Apple lowered fourth-quarter iPad orders 25 percent,
the first such cut that analysts at JPMorgan&#8217;s electronic
manufacturing services team in Hong Kong said they have ever
seen. The report didn&#8217;t list the affected companies, and Gokul Hariharan, one of the report&#8217;s authors, said he couldn&#8217;t comment
when reached by Bloomberg News today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a vendor such as Hon Hai, the cut could mean a drop to
13 million units in the fourth quarter from 17 million units in
the third quarter, JPMorgan analysts wrote in the Sept. 25
report. The report said JPMorgan U.S. analyst Mark Moskowitz,
who covers Apple, does not expect to lower his projection of
10.9 million to 12 million units of iPad shipments in the third
and fourth quarters after the supply chain adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced orders from Apple to iPad suppliers could reflect
both weakening demand in Europe due to economic conditions there
as well as a strategy by Apple, the world&#8217;s biggest company by
market value, to operate with reduced inventory, Wanli Wang, a
Taipei-based industry analyst at RBS Asia Ltd., said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s back to reality,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;Now it seems even
for Apple, due to the market situation, we need to be
conservative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Confirmation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far there is no confirmation from Apple that it has
reduced orders to suppliers, Wang said. Carolyn Wu, a Beijing-
based spokeswoman for Apple, didn&#8217;t respond to calls for comment
on the report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edmund Ding, spokesman for Hon Hai, didn&#8217;t respond to an e-
mail or answer calls to his Taiwan and China mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Cupertino, California-based iPad maker fell
$8.21, or 2 percent, to $396.09 at 9:48 a.m. on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. The stock had climbed 25 percent this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s iPad may account for 73 percent of tablet computer
sales this year, according to research firm Gartner Inc.
Products that run on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system,
including Samsung Electronics Co.&#8217;s Galaxy tablets, will
probably have about 17 percent of the market, Gartner said in a
Sept. 22 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of its current dominant market position, Apple
doesn&#8217;t have to rush to introduce its iPad 3 tablet computer as
potential rivals have failed to emerge to siphon sales from the
current model, JPMorgan&#8217;s Moskowitz wrote in a Sept. 16 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) may release a product late this year that
could become the number-two tablet in the market behind the
iPad, Moskowitz wrote in that report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. (KO), the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drinks maker, plans to spend $3 billion to expand in Russia
in the next five years, doubling its investment in the country,
said Ahmet Bozer, president of the company&#8217;s business in Eurasia
and Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola will expand production and sales capacity
countrywide after first-half volume rose 16 percent in Russia,
Bozer said today by phone from the southern Rostov region, where
the company opened a plant today. Bozer is Coca-Cola&#8217;s president
for its Eurasia and Africa unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russians drink about 69 eight-ounce servings of Coca-Cola
products a year, compared with an average 89 worldwide. The
company has sought sales growth from Russia since the collapse
of the Soviet Union in 1991. U.S. consumers each guzzled 394
servings last year on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Russia has a long time to go before reaching any
ceiling,&#8221; Bozer said. He is visiting the carbonated-beverage
factory with Coca-Cola Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based company, which acquired Russian juice
makers Nidan and Multon in the past six years, doesn&#8217;t have
acquisitions targeted in Russia now, Bozer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PepsiCo Inc. bought Wimm-Bill-Dann, Russia&#8217;s biggest food
and beverage company, this year, taking the lead in Russia&#8217;s
juice and dairy market over Coca-Cola. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Euro zone banks need at least 150
billion euros ($202 billion) of capital provided through a
Europe-wide Troubled Asset Relief Program akin to the U.S. plan,
according to a report by JPMorgan Cazenove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France could lead with a capital injection of about 15
billion euros to 20 billion euros for its banks, analysts at
JPMorgan led by Kian Abouhossein said in a note to clients
today. Societe Generale (GLE) SA would be one of the &#8220;key
beneficiaries&#8221; if France led the European TARP program, they
said. The minimum required to reopen European bank funding
market is 112 billion euros, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We assume a Euro TARP rather than specific support only
for the most distressed institutions, as we believe a general
solution is required to restore general confidence and reopen
the funding markets for all institutions,&#8221; Abouhossein said in
the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TARP, a $700 billion program, was started in 2008 to
inject capital into banks following the collapse of the U.S.
housing market and the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan estimates the capital requirement would be about
5.5 billion euros for Societe Generale and about 600 million
euros for BNP Paribas (BNP) SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We assume that France would move first independently,
given the recent pronounced pressure on its banks funding
costs,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts said. &#8220;Germany could potentially
also act independently.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modeling a European financial rescue on TARP &#8220;would be a
good solution,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President Gary D. Cohn
said at a panel discussion with other bank executives yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) agreed to
acquire a majority stake in India&#8217;s ReNew Wind Power Pvt. for 10
billion rupees ($200 million), extending the U.S. bank&#8217;s
investments in emerging economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReNew Wind plans to have 1,000 megawatts of wind-generation
capacity by 2015, the companies said today in an e-mailed
statement. The Mumbai-based power producer, founded by Sumant Sinha, a former chief operating officer of Suzlon Energy Ltd.,
India&#8217;s largest wind-turbine maker, expects to have its first 85
megawatts operating by June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian wind-power companies are raising money to fund their
expansion as the nation plans to add 2,400 megawatts of wind
energy capacity in the financial year ending March 31 and had
14,723 megawatts as of July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReNew Wind will invest the money in renewable energy and
acquire projects &#8220;on an opportunistic basis,&#8221; Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Sinha said in a telephone interview. He
said Goldman&#8217;s investment will be made over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman has invested $1.5 billion worldwide
in clean energy companies, the statement said. India, the
biggest market for new wind park installations after China and
the U.S., is dominated by Ahmedabad-based Suzlon, which
installed 41 percent of new capacity in the last financial year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman will have representatives on ReNew Wind&#8217;s board and
the company may consider trading publicly in the future, Sinha
said. &#8220;There are no listing plans in the near future but
several years down the road, that could be the exit
possibility&#8221; for an investor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual Targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ReNew Wind Power plans to expand its capacity by 200 to 300
megawatts annually, according to today&#8217;s statement. The company
has signed agreements with Suzlon, Germany&#8217;s Kenersys GmbH and
Regen Powertech Pvt. to build and operate wind farms in India,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank has invested more than $2 billion through
private equity and its own funds in India since 2006, according
to the statement. The recipients included vehicle maker Mahindra
 Mahindra Ltd. (MM) and TVS Logistics Services Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ankur Sahu and Andrew Wolff were named by Goldman as
co-heads for its principal investment area in Asia, according to

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. (CVX) and its partners on
the Carabobo 3 block in Venezuela&#8217;s Orinoco heavy oil belt,
including state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, may be
able to start early production in the third quarter of 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which has a 34 percent stake in the block, is
holding talks with joint venture partners and expects to make a
decision on how to develop the project in the next &#8220;couple of
months,&#8221; Ali Moshiri, Chevron President for Africa and Latin
America, said in an interview in Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in the phase of deciding which path we want to
take, whether that&#8217;s full development or early production,&#8221;
said Moshiri. &#8220;The financing will be the second phase. It
depends on the size of the project that we want to move ahead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron produced 58,000 barrels of oil a day in Venezuela
in 2010 and was selected last year to participate in a group to
develop the Carabobo 3 project, according to an annual report
filed with U.S. regulators. Venezuela&#8217;s Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said today in at a conference in Puerto La Cruz that the
South American country was asking its joint venture partners to
speed up plans for early production in the Orinoco and wouldn&#8217;t
accept any delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;First production could be as early as the third quarter
of 2012, but early production will be a collective decision,&#8221;
said Moshiri. PDVSA, as the Caracas-based company is called, has
60 percent of the Carabobo 3 project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moshiri, addressing a dinner at an oil conference, said
that the future of Venezuela&#8217;s oil industry depended on
developing heavy crude oil and that the industry needed prices
of at least $60 to $80 a barrel to develop heavy crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Venezuela has the capacity to set any production target
that it wants,&#8221; said Moshiri. &#8220;You have to find a way to
finance it, because heavy oil requires tremendous investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. health-care law and budget
cuts will drive consolidation in the industry as companies
compete for fewer dollars and to protect profits, said JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM)&#8217;s Jim Woolery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Budgetary constraints around health care, say over the
next five years -- that&#8217;s a headwind on profitability,&#8221;
Woolery, JPMorgan&#8217;s co-head of North American mergers and
acquisitions, said today at the Bloomberg Dealmakers Summit in
New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s a major catalyst for consolidation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in the health-care industry will need to get
larger to combat those challenges, Woolery said. JPMorgan
advised Medco Health Solutions Inc. (MHS) on the $29.1 billion deal
announced in July in which St. Louis-based Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX)
would take over Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based Medco. The
acquisition requires approval from U.S. antitrust regulators and
would create the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefits manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will face sharp scrutiny from regulators, said
Frederick Frank, vice chairman of Peter J. Solomon Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In pure antitrust rules, this is an endangered deal,&#8221; he
said at the summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolery disagreed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It hasn&#8217;t been challenged by the government yet,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I do think that the deal is going to go through.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been 1,088 acquisitions in the past year of U.S.
health-care companies, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The announced and completed purchases had an average disclosed
price of $318.5 million with a typical premium of 39 percent.
Express Scripts&#8217; pending Medco purchase would be the biggest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large drugmakers also need to look to deals to gain new
products, Frank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big pharma companies, if you look at history, are not
good at R,&#8221; Frank said today at the summit, referring to the
research half of research and development. He cited Paris-based
drugmaker Sanofi&#8217;s $20 billion purchase of Genzyme Corp. this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small drugmakers and biotechnology companies &#8220;are good at
R, but not very good at D,&#8221; Frank said. &#8220;They can&#8217;t afford it.
So, there&#8217;s a natural relationship here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) and Intel Corp. (INTC) will invest $4.4 billion over five years
to create a hub for next-generation computer chip technology in
New York, the state&#8217;s Governor Andrew Cuomo, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, will
spend $3.6 billion to develop computer chips using 22-nanometer
and 14-nanometer process technology, said Michael Loughran, a
company spokesman. A nanometer is one billionth of a meter and
measures the size of transistors in a chip. Lower numbers
indicate more advanced technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Corp., IBM, Globalfoundries Inc., Taiwan
Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. will
focus on transforming 300-millimeter wafer technology into 450-
millimeter technology, which will produce twice the number of
chips, according to a statement from Cuomo&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is really all about the computing systems IBM and
others will construct using advanced technologies,&#8221; John Kelly,
senior vice president and director of research at Armonk, New
York-based IBM, said at a press conference in Albany. &#8220;This
will create computers that will help doctors diagnose advanced
diseases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment will retain and create 6,900 jobs in the
state, including 2,500 new technology roles, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support the project, the state will make a $400 million
investment in the State University of New York College of
Nanoscale Science and Engineering in Albany, the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unprecedented Investment&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and development facilities located in Canandaigua,
Utica, East Fishkill and Yorktown Heights also will receive
cash, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This unprecedented investment in New York&#8217;s economy will
create thousands of jobs and make the state the epicenter for
the next generation of computer chip technology,&#8221; Cuomo said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose $3.20, or 1.8 percent, to $177.71 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are up 21
percent this year. Intel, based in Santa Clara, California,
gained 30 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $22.54 in trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commissioner Elisse Walter said she doesn&#8217;t anticipate the
agency will recommend repealing the Tower Amendment governing
disclosure in municipal securities sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter, speaking at a Sifma conference in New York City,
said the SEC is in the process of drafting a report that will
recommend ways to improve disclosure in the $2.9 trillion
municipal bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1975 Tower Amendment to federal securities regulation
prohibits the SEC from requiring state and local issuers to file
disclosure documents with the agency when they sell debt. The
responsibility lies with underwriters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Italian city of Cassino was
ordered by a court to disclose the terms of a settlement it
reached with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to terminate a derivative that
cost taxpayers as much as 2 million euros ($2.7 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An administrative court published a ruling yesterday saying
Bloomberg News should be granted access to the swaps contracts
and settlement after a lawsuit under the country&#8217;s freedom-of-
information laws. The central Italian city and the bank agreed
to end the swaps contract in 2009 without disclosing the terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with shrinking income and growing expenses, cities
throughout Italy bought swaps to cut their short-term interest
expenses, while putting them at the risk of rising interest
costs. About 300 were losing a total of 912 million euros on
derivatives as of March, Bank of Italy data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ruling will create a precedent,&#8221; said Elio Lannutti, a senator and member of the opposition Italian Values
party, who also heads the Adusbef consumer group. &#8220;This ruling
re-establishes the law, which was violated by the obscure
dealings that prohibit taxpayers from choosing and judging their
local administrations and their relations with banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of 33,000, and site of heavy fighting during World
War II, sought to keep the settlement secret, citing a
confidentiality clause in its agreement with JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. lender by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city will comply with the court order once received,
said Enzo Salera, Cassino&#8217;s finance chief. The city can still
appeal to the country&#8217;s highest administrative court, the
Council of State. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Greater Transparency&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The taxpayers of Cassino deserve to understand how the
government managed to lose millions of dollars in their
interest-rate swap with JPMorgan,&#8221; said Matthew Winkler,
editor-in-chief of Bloomberg News. &#8220;We continue to seek greater
transparency, accountability and disclosure of the financial
terms in this case to shed light on how taxpayer money is being
used.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2003, Cassino entered a seven-year swap with Bear
Stearns Cos., which JPMorgan bought in 2008, to adjust payments
on about 22 million euros of debt. The swap switched the city&#8217;s
4.7 percent fixed interest rate payment for a variable rate,
according to a June 2009 report by Italy&#8217;s financial police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city paid a floating rate based on the U.S.-dollar
London interbank offered rate, an &#8220;extremely risky&#8221; bet given
that Libor was at a record low, police said in testimony to the
Italian Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Libor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month U.S. dollar Libor was at a 1 percent in June
2003 and by January 2006 had surpassed 4.7 percent, according to
data compiled by the British Bankers&#8217; Association. The measure
climbed as high as 5.7 percent in September 2007 as credit
markets began to seize up, before declining to a record low of
0.25 percent by December 2009 after policy makers cut rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was named an interested party in the lawsuit
because of the potential impact on the firm. The bank is
separately on trial in Italy in the first European criminal case
involving swaps. Together with Deutsche Bank AG (DBK), Depfa Bank Plc
and UBS AG, JPMorgan faces charges in Milan for fraud for
tricking the municipal government into buying the contracts. The
lenders deny the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a judgment published earlier this month, Italy&#8217;s highest
administrative court ruled that Pisa&#8217;s provincial government has
the right to annul swaps contracts with Dexia Crediop SpA and
Depfa Bank Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News also sued the European Central Bank in
December to make it release documents showing how Greece used
derivatives to hide its fiscal deficit and helped trigger the
region&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. The case is pending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
dismissal of lawsuits over employee bonuses filed in New York by
shareholders who called the awards a waste of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Police  Fire Professionals of America Retirement
Fund and Judith A. Miller sued the investment bank in December
2009, accusing directors and executives of breaching their
fiduciary duties by reserving half of the company&#8217;s net revenue
for employee compensation. Shareholders Ken Brown and Central
Laborers Pension Fund filed similar suits the following month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Judge Bernard J. Fried ordered the
lawsuits dismissed on Sept. 21, according to court documents
filed yesterday. The plaintiffs agreed to the dismissal in
January 2010, after New York-based Goldman Sachs said its ratio
of compensation and benefits to net revenue for 2009 was its
&#8220;lowest as a public company,&#8221; Fried said in his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fried denied the plaintiffs&#8217; request for attorney fees and
expenses, and rejected a request from Brown -- who died in
December 2010 -- for an incentive fee award of $25,000. Brown&#8217;s
attorney, Lynda J. Grant, didn&#8217;t return a voice-mail message
seeking comment on Fried&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, declined to
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Brown v. Blankfein, 650003/2010, and Central
Laborers&#8217; Pension Fund v. Goldman Sachs, 600036/2010, both in

&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Judge Asks to Review Sentencing Report on Jiau &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. judge who is to sentence Galleon Group LLC co-
founder Raj Rajaratnam for insider trading on Oct. 13 asked to
see the sentencing report for Winifred Jiau, a former consultant
for Primary Global Research LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiau was sentenced to four years in prison last week for
her role in an insider-trading ring. She was convicted in June
of one count each of conspiracy and securities fraud for passing
earnings and other information about Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) and Marvell
Technology Group Ltd. (MRVL) to two hedge fund managers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 54, was convicted in May of 14 criminal counts
of conspiracy and securities fraud for directing what
prosecutors said was the largest hedge-fund insider trading
ring. The U.S. has said Rajaratnam should be sentenced to a term
of 19 1/2 to 24 1/2 years, a penalty the defense has called
&#8220;grotesquely severe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The request by U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in
Manhattan, who presided over Rajaratnam&#8217;s trial, was granted
Sept. 23 by U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who sentenced Jiau,
according to a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Judge Holwell would like to review that presentence
report in preparation for the upcoming sentencing of the
defendant Raj Rajaratnam,&#8221; Thomas McCarthy, a senior U.S.
probation officer, wrote in the request to Rakoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. said Rajaratnam made $63.8 million using illegal
tips to trade in the stocks of companies including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., Intel Corp. (INTC), Google Inc. (GOOG), ATI Technologies Inc. and
Clearwire Corp. (CLWR) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara, declined to comment on yesterday&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn Cites Diplomatic Immunity to Fend Off Maid&#8217;s Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-
Kahn, who was cleared last month of charges that he assaulted a
hotel maid in New York, asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit
brought by his accuser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strauss-Kahn, 62, said in a motion filed with Judge Douglas
McKeon in New York State Supreme Court in the Bronx borough of
New York City yesterday that the lawsuit filed by the maid,
Nafissatou Diallo, should be thrown out because Strauss-Kahn had
diplomatic immunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As managing director -- which is the chief executive
position at the IMF -- Mr. Strauss-Kahn enjoyed absolute
immunity from civil suit under applicable principles of
international law,&#8221; according to the filing by William W.
Taylor III, an attorney for Strauss-Kahn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr.&#8217;s office last
month dropped sexual-assault charges filed against Strauss-Kahn
in May after Diallo accused him of trying to rape her in his
suite at the Sofitel in midtown Manhattan. Diallo, 33, sued
Strauss-Kahn on Aug. 8, seeking unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diallo&#8217;s attorneys, Kenneth P. Thompson and Douglas H.
Wigdor, said in a statement that Strauss-Kahn&#8217;s claim of
diplomatic immunity will fail because he isn&#8217;t a diplomat, was
in New York on personal business and paid for his own room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This baseless motion is another desperate attempt to
avoid having to answer for the deplorable acts he committed
against Ms. Diallo,&#8221; Thompson and Wigdor said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Diallo v. Strauss-Kahn, 11-307065, New York
State Supreme Court (Bronx County). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merkin Fund Investor Lawsuits Over Madoff Losses Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits filed by investors in three of J. Ezra Merkin&#8217;s
hedge funds, holding him and BDO International responsible for
their losses in Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, were dismissed by
a federal judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts in Manhattan ruled that
investors in funds named Ascot Partners, Gabriel Partners and
the Ariel Fund can&#8217;t show that Merkin lied about money invested
in Madoff&#8217;s fund or that BDO, an accounting firm, ignored &#8220;red
flags&#8221; of the fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The offering memoranda and prospectuses contain warnings
sufficient to preclude a claim of intentional or reckless
misrepresentation in those documents,&#8221; Batts said in an opinion
released yesterday. &#8220;In addition, plaintiffs&#8217; allegations of
red flags are unavailing given the opposing considerations of
Madoff&#8217;s immense reputation and deep deception.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in 2008 by a group of investors seeking
to represent a class of all the investors in the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arthur Abbey, a lawyer representing the investors, didn&#8217;t
return a phone message and e-mail seeking comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 73, is serving a 150-year term in federal prison in
North Carolina after pleading guilty to orchestrating history&#8217;s
biggest Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Merkin and BDO Seidman Securities
Litigation, 08-cv-10922, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asks Judge to Put Thornburg Suit on Hold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sued by defunct Thornburg
Mortgage Inc. (THMRQ), asked a bankruptcy judge to put the lawsuit on
hold while a district judge decides whether to take the case.
Bankrupt TMST Inc.&#8217;s contract claims should be dismissed because
Goldman Sachs was exercising its rights after an
&#8220;incontrovertible margin default,&#8221; the New York-based bank
said in a Sept. 23 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMST trustee Joel Sher filed at least eight lawsuits from
April 28 to April 30, seeking  more than $2 billion from
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc., Barclays Plc, Bank of
America Corp. and other companies, alleging that they made
unjustified margin calls that helped to cause Thornburg&#8217;s
downfall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. Marketer Used Mafia Lessons to Instill Fear &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A News Corp. (NWSA) unit that used lessons gleaned from Mafia
films to motivate employees and crush rivals is the latest arm
of Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s media empire to be swept up in a probe that
began with hacking and bribery allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Already the subject of inquiries in America and the U.K. of
police payoffs and illegal voice-mail access by its British
newspapers, News Corp. has been asked by U.S. investigators for
documents relating to its News America Marketing Group, which
places in-store ads in supermarkets and retailers worldwide,
according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government last month asked a lawyer at Williams 
Connolly LLP for documents from a 2009 trial between News
America and a New Jersey advertising company, Floorgraphics
Inc., according to the person, who declined to be identified
because the request was confidential. New York-based News Corp.
in July hired Brendan Sullivan, a criminal defense lawyer at the
Washington law firm, amid claims of illegal hacking at the now-
defunct News of the World tabloid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expanding review by U.S. prosecutors of potential
wrongdoing at News of the World, which represented only 1
percent of annual revenue for News Corp., has now touched a
subsidiary that generated four times that much, and about 12
percent of the parent company&#8217;s profit for fiscal 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That unit, rivals claimed in court papers, has expanded by
flouting antitrust laws, and in one case, computer hacking. News
America&#8217;s CEO, also publisher of the New York Post, testified in
one case that he used popular Mafia films such as &#8220;&#8216;A Bronx
Tale&#8221; and &#8220;The Untouchables&#8221; to teach employees how to
instill fear in potential clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a pattern of anticompetitive behavior by News
Corp.,&#8221; said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for
Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog
group. &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen it in Britain, and we&#8217;ve seen it in
America.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suzanne Halpin, a spokeswoman for News America, declined to
comment on the U.S. request for information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte Sued for $7.6 Billion in Taylor Bean Collapse &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte  Touche LLP, one of the so-called Big Four
accounting firms, was sued for failing to detect a fraud that
allegedly led to more than $7 billion in losses at defunct
mortgage lender Taylor, Bean  Whitaker Mortgage Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deloitte, which audited Taylor Bean&#8217;s financial statements
from 2002 to August 2009, ignored red flags in the company&#8217;s
books, allowing the lender&#8217;s former chairman, Lee Farkas, to
orchestrate a fraud that toppled the company, according to the
complaints filed yesterday in state court in Miami. Taylor
Bean&#8217;s bankruptcy trustee, Neil Luria, and its Ocala Funding
unit are seeking more than $7.6 billion in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Deloitte&#8217;s negligence, and willful blind eye, was the
fuel without which the looters&#8217; fraud would have sputtered out
long before it resulted in the multibillion-dollar debt under
which TBW collapsed,&#8221; according to Luria&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims are &#8220;utterly without merit,&#8221; Jonathan Gandal,
a spokesman for New York-based Deloitte, said in an e-mail.
Taylor Bean and Ocala were wholly owned private companies
through which &#8220;convicted felon Lee Farkas and his co-
conspirators committed their crimes,&#8221; Gandal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bizarre notion that his engines of theft are entitled
to complain of injury from their own crimes and to sue the
outside auditors they lied to defies common sense, not to
mention the law,&#8221; Gandal said in the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Luria, Plan Trustee of the Taylor, Bean 
Whitaker Trust v. Deloitte  Touche LLP; Ocala Funding LLC, v.
Deloitte  Touche LLP, Circuit Court of the 11th Judicial
Circuit, Miami-Dade County, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carter&#8217;s Ex-Executive Elles Pleads Not Guilty to Fraud Charges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joseph Elles, a former sales executive at Carter&#8217;s Inc. (CRI),
pleaded not guilty to charges he reported inflated sales at the
world&#8217;s biggest maker of children&#8217;s clothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Janet King in Atlanta granted Elles
$100,000 bail after his arraignment yesterday on 32 counts
including securities fraud, wire fraud, causing the filing of
false financial statements and falsifying corporate books and
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elles, 57, a former executive vice president, &#8220;induced&#8221;
customers such as Kohl&#8217;s Corp. (KSS) to make &#8220;substantial purchases&#8221;
of Carter&#8217;s products at unauthorized millions of dollars in
discounts that he didn&#8217;t disclose, according to the indictment
filed Sept. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elles allegedly hid those discounts, causing the company to
overstate profit, prosecutors said. He also aided others, some
of whom U.S. prosecutors haven&#8217;t identified, according to the
indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities Exchange Commission sued Elles in
December. The SEC charges mirror the indictment by the U.S.
Attorney&#8217;s Office in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC agreed not to sue Atlanta-based Carter&#8217;s because of
the company&#8217;s &#8220;prompt and complete self-reporting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond Joseph Burby, a lawyer for Elles, said in an e-
mailed statement that his client will defend himself against the
charges and &#8220;absolutely denies that he intended to defraud
anyone in connection with the purchase or sale of Carter&#8217;s
securities, as alleged in the indictment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors should have waited to see what the evidence
&#8220;revealed about the conduct of all employees at Carter&#8217;s and
Kohl&#8217;s who were involved in this matter,&#8221; Burby said in his
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors yesterday asked the judge to set bond at
$200,000, saying that Elles&#8217;s financial statements indicated he
has&#160;close to $1 million in cash.&#160;Attorneys for Elles sought a
lower bond, arguing that their client isn&#8217;t a flight risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He came here today to voluntarily surrender,&#8221; Burby told
King. &#8220;He is going to be here when the court needs him to be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elles faces as long as 10 years in prison if convicted,
Assistant U.S. Attorney David M. Chaiken said yesterday in
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Elles, 11-CR-445, U.S. District Court,
Northern District Court of Georgia (Atlanta). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp. Faces Another Round of Hacking Claims From 2008 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp., former publisher of the shuttered News of the
World tabloid, was hit last week with accusations that reporters
hacked into voice mails as late as 2008, a year after a reporter
and detective were jailed for the offense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jade Goody, the reality TV star who died of cervical cancer
in 2009, may have had her phone hacked by News of the World
reporters in the months leading up to her death, according to
Max Clifford, her former public-relations representative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If proven true, the allegation indicates hacking continued
two years after private investigator Glenn Mulcaire and former
royal reporter Clive Goodman illegally accessed story subjects&#8217;
voice mails. Goodman and Mulcaire were jailed in 2007 for
hacking. James Murdoch, deputy operating chief of News Corp. and
head of the company&#8217;s U.K. publishing unit, has repeatedly said
he didn&#8217;t know hacking was widespread at the tabloid and that
wrongdoing took place before he joined the company in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it was going on as late as 2008, serious questions
will be asked as to what procedures were in place to stop it
from happening again internally,&#8221; said Niri Shan, the head of
media law at Taylor Wessing LLP in London. Murdoch &#8220;is in
charge, so he&#8217;s ultimately responsible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News Corp.&#8217;s directors will also be sued in the U.S. by
victims of News of the World hackers, lawyer Mark Lewis said in
an interview broadcast on Sky News last week. Lawyers are
looking at what directors at the New York-based corporation
should have known about hacking activities and will seek to
speak with James Murdoch and his father, News Corp. Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Rupert Murdoch, Lewis said in a separate
interview on the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Macquarie Wins A$95 Million Tax Dispute Over Minara Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macquarie Bank Ltd., a unit of Australia&#8217;s biggest
investment bank, won a A$95 million ($93 million) dispute with
the Australian Tax Office over the 2004 sale of a stake in
nickel producer Minara Resources Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Court Justice Richard Edmonds in Sydney yesterday
dismissed the tax office&#8217;s claim that Macquarie used a tax
avoidance scheme when it engineered the sale of 165.5 million
shares held by MatlinPatterson Global Opportunities Partners LP
at A$2.90 each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit of the Sydney-based Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) claimed
at a hearing in June that the government was attempting to
assess taxes against it on profit made by MatlinPatterson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Hurst, an outside spokesman for Macquarie, declined to
comment on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MatlinPatterson, which was Minara&#8217;s second-biggest
shareholder, bought a 35.9 percent stake in 2003 in the mining
company as part of an attempt to take it over, according to
court documents. Macquarie arranged a &#8220;bought deal&#8221; in
February 2004 for the MatlinPatterson shares, purchasing them
for A$2.65 each and selling them on to institutions for A$2.90,
earning A$41.4 million on which the bank paid A$12 million in
taxes, according to the court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Macquarie Bank Ltd. v. Commissioner of
Taxation. NSD105/2010. Federal Court of Australia (Sydney). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gribkowsky Trial Set For October Over Formula One Stake Sale &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German regional court allowed breach of trust, accepting
bribes and tax evasion charges against Gerhard Gribkowsky, a
former Bayerische Landesbank risk manager, to go to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial over the sale of the lender&#8217;s stake in Formula
One racing is set to start Oct. 24, the regional court said in
an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus magazine had reported on the trial date earlier this
weekend and had said that Formula One Chief Executive Officer
Bernie Ecclestone will testify in the case, without saying where
it had obtained the information. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Yuriy Humber and Stephen Bierman" date="Sep 27, 2011  7:18 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-09-27/exxon-confident-it-can-book-oil-reserves-in-russian-arctic.html"><headline>Exxon Confident of Right to Book Russian Arctic Oil Reserves</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) says it will be
able to book oil and gas reserves it finds in an Arctic and
Black Sea venture with OAO Rosneft even though its Russian
state-run partner owns the licenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see this as one of the most prospective areas for
exploration in the whole world,&#8221; Glenn Waller, Exxon&#8217;s head of
Russia, told reporters today at the Sakhalin Oil and Gas 2011
conference in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. &#8220;That is what is driving us.
Access to new resources.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon agreed to form a venture with Rosneft on Aug. 30,
pledging to spend $3.2 billion exploring for oil and gas in
Russia&#8217;s Arctic Kara Sea and deep-water Black Sea. Prime
Minister Vladimir Putin is encouraging partnerships with
international explorers to maintain output at a world-leading 10
million barrels a day for the next decade. Putin said the Exxon-
Rosneft alliance may lead to $500 billion in investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The west Siberian basin that&#8217;s the source of more than half
Russia&#8217;s oil output extends north under the Kara Sea, according
to Waller. Rosneft selected Exxon for the Arctic blocks after a
planned venture and share swap with BP Plc collapsed in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Confident &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident that we will be able to book those
reserves that belong to us&#8221; under stock exchange rules,
following the exploration period, Waller said. Rosneft holds the
license, and almost 67 percent of the exploration venture, while
Exxon has 33 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Rosneft aim to drill the first exploration well
in 2015, according to a Rosneft presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The partners will hold &#8220;step-by-step&#8221; talks with the
state as they seek tax incentives to make the challenging
project profitable, Waller said. The Kara Sea is icebound for
much of the year, and projects in its Arctic waters will need to
contend with nuclear waste from former test sites and dumps,
according to Waller&#8217;s presentation at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government understands it needs to change some taxes to
make the projects effective, Waller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosneft, Russia&#8217;s largest oil producer, will decide in the
first half on an offer from Exxon to join projects in areas
including Texas, Canada and the Gulf of Mexico, he said. Rosneft
and Exxon don&#8217;t plan to bring in other partners for now, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian Mowat, JPMorgan Chase 
Co.&#8217;s emerging-market strategist, comments on the outlook for
the Indian stocks. He spoke in an interview with Bloomberg-UTV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BSE India Sensitive Index jumped 3 percent to 16,524 at
the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai, the biggest gain in almost a
month. The gauge lost 6.1 percent in four sessions before today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On U.S., Europe: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are very significant risks to capital markets. We
have a formal 40 percent probability of a U.S. recession. In the
U.S., there is 1 percent growth and 3.8 percent inflation. These
are times I&#8217;d like to call stagflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The Fed announcement last week highlighted very little
monetary flexibility. The virtual war between republicans and
democrats are making chances of fiscal stimulus extremely low.
European crisis is building momentum. It&#8217;s extremely difficult
for northern Europeans to subsidize problems in Eastern Europe.
There are problems within ECB where senior Germans are leaving
ECB. It&#8217;s a difficult idea to sell to the Germans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On emerging market equities: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our preferred asset is the U.S. dollar. Emerging-market
stocks may have good fundamentals but they&#8217;re owned heavily by
international investors. We are in the second stage of a bear
market. ASEAN sold down heavily in spite of good fundamentals.
People are trying to lock in profits before they evaporate. This
will continue until some sort of resolution of Europe&#8217;s crisis
is reached. India and China, where inflation is high, will deal
with it by maintaining tight monetary policy. They will prepare
for a slowdown in growth rather than not fight inflation at this
time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On commodity prices: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commodity markets are still in a state of denial about
what is going on. They are far too bullish on global growth and
they are very na&#239;ve what is happening in China. The decline in
commodity prices is a real possibility. There is stagflation in
the U.S. A sharp decline in commodity prices is the best thing
that can happen to us and the European consumer. It will boost
real income. I see the decline as a good economic event, even
though there will be pain as commodity prices decline.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On India strategy: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My strategy is to hold U.S. dollars. If we get a fall in
the commodity markets we will raise interest in current-account
deficit markets like India and Turkey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;India is a current-account deficit economy, which needs
capital to flow to everyday. Market expectations are extremely
low on politics, earnings and hopes of inflation coming down. I
expect Indian markets to be declining. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;India valuations will stop declining once growth slows
down. The current market scenario in India favors defensives
like staples and telecom. We will look at buying interest rate
sensitives when monetary tightening eases.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On central bank action: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Our expectation is of a further increases in the repo
rate in the next few quarters. The Reserve Bank of India is
concerned about stopping inflationary pressure. They have a
limited influence in the economy. The RBI can&#8217;t address the
official deficit as long as types of deficit-expanding schemes
like the rural income schemes continue.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On outlook for the rupee: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The rupee will continue to sell-off as the RBI has a
policy of minimum intervention. This is about capital protection
at a time of heightened inflation, and not a reflection of the
fundamentals.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the software maker

smartphones, agreed to share patents with handset-maker Samsung
Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Smartphones with Microsoft&#8217;s revamped Windows Phone 7

licenses were doubling annually before the iPhone was introduced
in 2007, announced an alliance with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) in February to
develop smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary&#8217;s largest

JPMorgan Cazenove because of slowing economic growth in Hungary,
the costs of foreign-currency loans and a tax on banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan cut the price estimate for the end of 2012 to
4,400 forint from 6,800 forint, keeping its recommendation at
&#8220;overweight,&#8221; according to a research report by analysts

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) passed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) in market value based on closing
share prices to become the world&#8217;s second-most valuable
technology company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose $1.62 to $179.17 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange, giving it a market value of $214 billion. Microsoft
fell 13 cents to $25.45 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, giving it a
market value of $213.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the first time since 1996 that IBM closed ahead of
Microsoft, though IBM had passed the software company on an
intraday basis in May. Microsoft was worth three times as much
as IBM in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano divested the
company&#8217;s PC business six years ago, calling it commoditized, to
invest in software and services. Microsoft, whose Windows and
Office software are used primarily on PCs, lost its spot as the
most valuable technology company last year to Apple Inc. (AAPL), as
sales of iPad tablets and iPhones crimped PC demand. Apple is

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG), owner of the world&#8217;s
most popular search engine, will sell an analytics service for
online advertisers, in a direct challenge to offerings from
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Analytics Premium costs $150,000 a year and gives
increased processing power, phone support and the ability to
measure the impact of a new campaign within four hours of
posting it online, said Amy Chang, director of product
management, in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, California-based Google is adding new
services catering to large businesses to lessen its reliance on
online advertising. While a free version of Google&#8217;s analytics
tool has hundreds of thousands of users, added features in the
paid version may lure corporate clients who currently rely on
services from IBM and Adobe, Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everyone is struggling to get better ad spend,&#8221; Chang
said. &#8220;Google Analytics allows everyone across the board on a
marketing team to be a data-driven marketer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, gained an advertising-
analysis service with its purchase of Coremetrics Inc. last
year. San Jose, California-based Adobe added a similar business
through its 2009 purchase of Omniture Inc. for $1.55 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google said it will have dedicated salespeople and support
teams for its paid data service. The four-hour turnaround for
analysis compares with 24 hours for the free version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It changes the decision making from days into minutes and
that matters to a lot of marketers and a lot of clients,&#8221; Chang
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that have signed up for the paid service include
Travelocity.com Inc., Gucci Group NV, TransUnion Corp. and Papa
John&#8217;s International Inc. (PZZA), Google said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson (JNJ)&#8217;s Cordis unit&#8217;s
appeal of a lower court ruling that one of its patents wasn&#8217;t
infringed by Boston Scientific Corp. (BSX) was rejected by a federal
appeals court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its ruling yesterday the Washington-based Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears appeals of patent
cases, said a trial court in Delaware correctly determined that
Boston Scientific didn&#8217;t infringe patent 5,879,370. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent, issued in March 1999, covers an expandable
stent that is fabricated from a single piece of metal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit was filed in April 1998, and has had a lengthy
procedural history, with several trips through the appeals
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its most recent ruling the appeals court said the
Delaware court correctly determined that there wasn&#8217;t enough
evidence to support a jury&#8217;s finding that Boston Scientific
infringed a part of the disputed patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cordis Corp.&#8217;s argument at the appeals court was made by
Gregory L. Diskant of New York&#8217;s Patterson Belknap Webb  Tyler
LLP. Boston Scientific&#8217;s case was argued by Frank P. Porcelli of
Boston&#8217;s Fish  Richardson PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appellate court case is Cordis Corp. v. Boston
Scientific, 10-01316, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower court case is Cordis Corp. v. Boston Scientific,
1:98-CV-00197-SLR, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft to Share Patents With Samsung, Market Windows Phone &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the software maker seeking to challenge
Apple Inc. and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s dominance in smartphones, agreed to
share patents with handset-maker Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will receive royalties for mobile phones and
tablets built by Samsung that use Google&#8217;s Android operating
system, according to a Sept. 28 company statement. The companies
also agreed to cooperate on the development and marketing of
Windows Phone, Microsoft&#8217;s mobile software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smartphones with Microsoft&#8217;s revamped Windows Phone 7
software have struggled to compete with Apple&#8217;s iPhone and
Android-based devices. Microsoft, whose Windows Mobile software
licenses were doubling annually before the iPhone was introduced
in 2007, announced an alliance with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) in February to
develop smartphones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LG Seeks to Block Osram-Equipped BMW, Audi Sales in S. Korea &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LG Electronics Inc. (066570) and LG Innotek Co. filed suit in Seoul
against Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) and Audi AG&#8217;s South Korean
units to block local sales of their vehicles equipped with
light-emitting diode package headlamps made by Osram GmbH. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two LG Group affiliates said the Osram&#8217;s LED headlamps
infringed their patents, according to an e-mailed statement from
LG Electronics yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sega European Trademark Filing Hints at New Title in Yakuza Game &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sega Sammy Holdings Inc. (6460)&#8217;s Sega unit, creator of the Yakuza
and Sonic Hedgehog electronic games, is moving its Yakuza game
in a new direction, the Gaming Union Network reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publication based its report on European trademark
filings by Sega for &#8220;Yakuza Dead Souls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous games in the Yakuza series were released
exclusively for Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 3, and Gaming Union
Network predicted the new game will likely also be a PlayStation
exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danish Jewelry Maker Pandora A/S Registers Trademark in China &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora A/S, the maker of customizable charm bracelets,
registered its trademark in China, the Glostrup, Denmark-based
company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mark&#8217;s registration covers jewelry, watches and related
products, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandora has enforced its IP rights in the U.S. by filing at
least five suits in federal court, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Station Sues Mississippi Riverboat Casino for Infringing Mark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Station Casinos LLC&#8217;s IP holdings company filed a trademark
infringement suit against the operators of a riverboat casino in
Vicksburg, Mississippi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta Investments  Developments LLC of South Carolina
bought the Horizon Vicksburg Casino from Tropicana Entertainment
Inc. (TPCA) for $3.25 million Dec. 7, 2010, according to a Tropicana
regulatory filing. The only intellectual property that was part
of the sale was the name &#8220;Horizon,&#8221; and purchasers were
required to remove any mention of the names &#8220;Tropicana&#8221; or
&#8220;Trop&#8221; within 90 days of closing of the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta Investments closed the casino for renovation in March
2011, reopening in June as the Grand Station Hotel  Casino,
Station Casinos said in the complaint filed Sept. 27 in federal
court in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Station objects to the name, saying it infringes on its
trademarks that include &#8220;Station Casinos,&#8221; &#8220;Palace Station,&#8221;
&#8220;Boulder Station,&#8221; &#8220;Texas Station,&#8221; &#8220;Sunset Station&#8221; and
&#8220;Santa Fe Station.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vicksburg casino&#8217;s use of &#8220;station&#8221; in its name and
in its website -- www.grandstationcasino.com -- are likely to
cause the public to assume falsely that an affiliation exists
between Station Casinos and the Mississippi casino, according to
court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Las Vegas-based Station claims it has suffered &#8220;monetary
loss and irreparable injury&#8221; as a result of the Mississippi
casino&#8217;s use of &#8220;station&#8221; in its name. The company asked the
court to bar the use of its marks or any &#8220;confusingly similar
variations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the company seeks an award of the profits the
riverboat casino has earned in connection with its unauthorized
use of the &#8220;Grand station&#8221; mark, together with awards of money
damages, litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counsel for Delta Investments didn&#8217;t respond immediately to
an e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Station is represented by Tamara Beatty Peterson and Laura
Bielinski of Denver-based Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is NP IP Holdings LLC v. Delta Investments 
Development LLC, 2:11-cv-01553-PMO-LRL, U.S. District Court,
District of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven Has No Standing to Sue, Judge in Denver Cases Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven LLC, the Las Vegas-based copyright-enforcement
organization, was told it lacked standing to pursue a copyright
infringement case in federal court in Denver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is significant because judge who made this
determination is overseeing all 57 copyright infringement cases
Righthaven filed in that court since Jan. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Righthaven filed the cases on behalf of the Denver-based
MediNews Group Inc. The suits related to the unauthorized use of
content from MediaNews Group&#8217;s &#8220;Denver Post.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The owner of the itmakesense.com website was sued March 31
for using content from the newspaper on the itmakessenseblog.com
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each case Righthaven claimed to own the copyright to the
work that was allegedly infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his Sept. 27 ruling, U.S. District Judge John L. Kane
said he gave a close reading to the copyright assignment
agreement between MediaNews Group. He noted that under the
agreement, Righthaven has no rights to the particular copyright
&#8220;other than the right to proceed in association with a
recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This limitation means that Righthaven isn&#8217;t an owner as
defined by copyright law, Kane said. As such &#8220;it lacks standing
to institute an action for copyright infringement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said that because he wished to &#8220;discourage the
abuse of the statutory remedies for copyright infringement,&#8221; so
in addition to ruling there was no reason for the trial to go
ahead, he awarded attorney fees and litigation costs to the
defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Righthaven LLC v. Leland Wolf, 1:11-cv-00830-
JLK, U.S. District Court, District of Colorado (Denver). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Sept. 8 court filing in a Righthaven case in a Nevada
federal court on behalf of Las Vegas-based Stephens Media Group,
a defendant who was awarded attorney fees has asked for seizure
of Righthaven&#8217;s intellectual property, real estate and bank
accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case is Righthaven v. Hoehn, 2:11-cv-00050-PMP-RJJ,
U.S. District Court, District of Nevada (Las Vegas). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Court Order Blocking Psystar Product Sales Is Upheld &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. (AAPL) won an appeals court ruling upholding a lower-
court order blocking Psystar Corp., maker of Macintosh computer
clones, from selling copies of Apple Inc.&#8217;s operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, filed in federal court in San Francisco in 2008,
was related to a Psystar software product that made it possible
for customers to run the Mac Snow Leopard operating system on a
non-Apple computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cupertino, California-based Apple had claimed that Psystar,
based in Doral, Florida, was selling inferior computers and
servers using unauthorized copies of the operating system. It
was also accused of selling downloadable updates for Snow
Leopard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district court found that Psystar infringed the Apple
copyrights. While Psystar didn&#8217;t appeal the infringement
finding, it asked the appeals court to reconsider the lower
court&#8217;s rejection of its contention that Apple&#8217;s software
license agreement was unenforceable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psystar had argued that the license provision requiring
Apple&#8217;s operating system be run only on Apple computers was an
unenforceable misuse of its copyright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple argued that Psystar failed to prove copyright abuse
because the license agreement didn&#8217;t restrict creativity or
competition. The appeals court agreed, and also affirmed the
lower court&#8217;s ruling barring future infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court agreed with Psystar that Apple failed to
present an adequate argument for the sealing of Apple records in
the case file. It ordered the lower court to unseal those
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court case is Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp. 10-
15113, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The lower
court case is Apple Inc. v. Psystar Corp., 3:08-cv-03251-WHA,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San
Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group&#8217;s Expected Water Company Profit Is Trade Secret &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carlyle Group&#8217;s profit expected from Missoula, Montana&#8217;s
Mountain Water Co. is covered by a protective order and can&#8217;t be
revealed to the public, the Missoulian newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based private-equity fund manager is seeking
approval from Montana&#8217;s Public Service Commission of its $102
million purchase of Park Water Co. and its Mountain Water unit,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a pre-purchase investment committee memo it provided,
Carlyle said it planned to sell the water companies within five
to 10 years, according to the Missoulian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An economist witness to the Montana Consumer Counsel, who
couldn&#8217;t reveal the Carlyle financial information to which he
had access, filed documents with the Public Service Commission
saying that while he didn&#8217;t necessarily agree with the
reasonableness of the group&#8217;s profit assumptions, he didn&#8217;t see
them as &#8220;problematic to ratepayers,&#8221; the Missoulian reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malaysian Hoteliers Fear Reports to Board Reveal Trade Secrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoteliers in Malaysia&#8217;s Sarwak state are reluctant to
register with that country&#8217;s Tourism Promotion Board for fear of
divulging their trade secrets, the Borneo Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official of the board told the Borneo Post that only 50
percent of the region&#8217;s hotels, homestays and bed and breakfast
inns had registered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the hoteliers&#8217; fears were unfounded as the
commission works &#8220;in a private and confidential mode&#8221; and runs
statistics on an overall basis, not on individual hotels,
according to the Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of reported hotel guests in the region declined
more than 10 percent over last year, mainly related to the
economy and a state election, the Post reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FIH Erhvervsbank A/S, a Danish
bank, plans to stop lending to a number of real estate
companies, potentially triggering bankruptcies by the businesses
and other creditors, Jyllands-Posten reported, citing Chief
Executive Officer Bjarne Graven Larsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIH, which needs to generate cash to refinance 46 billion
kroner ($8.4 billion) in state-guaranteed bonds through 2013, is
asking companies to pay back loans as they come due, the Viby,
Denmark-based newspaper quoted the executive as saying. A credit
crunch may make it difficult for the businesses to find
alternative funding, probably making bankruptcies unavoidable,
Jyllands-Posten said, citing Larsen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. plans to offer
online pay television service from Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) and Verizon
Communications Inc. (VZ) through Xbox Live, in an bid to channel more
entertainment to its video-game console, people with knowledge
of the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, is in talks with
almost two dozen providers of music, sports, movies and TV shows
in the U.S. and Europe, and may announce an expanded Xbox Live
streaming service as soon as next week, said one of the people,
who weren&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is promoting the Xbox
360 console as a way to switch easily between games, DVDs and
pay TV. He said on Sept. 14 that by Christmas, Microsoft will
add the Bing search engine to the Xbox and use its Kinect
controller&#8217;s voice recognition to sift through shows on the Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We all know the frustrations of using guides and menus
and controllers, and we think a better way to do all of this is
simply to bring Bing and voice to Xbox,&#8221; Ballmer said at a
developers conference. &#8220;You say it, Xbox finds it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also expects to sign deals with Time Warner
Inc. (TWX)&#8217;s HBO cable channel, Sony Pictures Entertainment&#8217;s Crackle
streaming service, NBC Universal&#8217;s Bravo and Syfy channels and
Lovefilm UK, a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wayne Hickey, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment, as did Bobbi Henson, a spokeswoman for Verizon, and
Jennifer Khoury of Comcast, which controls NBC. Greg Belloni, a
Sony spokesman, had no immediate comment. Dorothy Jean, a
spokeswoman for Lovefilm, declined to comment. An HBO
spokesperson declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pay-TV Tether &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new applications from Philadelphia-based Comcast&#8217;s
Xfinity TV service and New York-based Verizon&#8217;s FiOs would
require users to prove they already are pay-TV customers in
regions where the services operate, two of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox 360 plays DVDs and video games, and owners can pay
$60 a year for the Xbox Live premium service, which allows for
multi-user play over Web. Console owners can also add
subscriptions to Netflix Inc. (NFLX)&#8217;s and Hulu LLC&#8217;s online film and
television services, and pay-TV through ATT Inc. (T)&#8217;s U-verse in
its markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surge in online entertainment has thrust the Xbox 360
and its console rival, Sony Corp. (6758)&#8217;s PlayStation 3, into
competition with other Web-connected devices in the home, from
DVRs to television sets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since last year, Microsoft has integrated social networking
features into Xbox Live, letting viewers chat with each other
while watching movies and shows. The company announced in June
that 35 million people used its paid Xbox Live service around
the world, spending an average of 60 hours a month playing games
and watching entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comcast had 22.5 million pay-TV customers as of June 30.
Verizon Fios had 3.8 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable and satellite TV providers such as Comcast are
looking to stem defections by putting their services on more
devices and making it easier for them watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Comcast CEO Brian Roberts demonstrated a TV
interface called Xcalibur that uses Web-connected servers to
forgo the need for a set-top box at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 9 cents to $25.58 yesterday in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. Comcast lost 33 cents to $22. Verizon slid 5
cents to $36.84 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) passed Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) to become the world&#8217;s second-most
valuable technology company, a reflection of industry changes
including the shift away from the personal computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s market value rose to $214 billion yesterday, while
Microsoft&#8217;s fell to $213.2 billion. It&#8217;s the first time IBM has
exceeded its software rival based on closing prices since 1996,
according to Bloomberg data. IBM became the fourth-largest
company by market value, based on yesterday&#8217;s closing price,
and, in technology, trails only Apple Inc. (AAPL) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano sold IBM&#8217;s PC
business six years ago to focus on corporate software and
services. Though Microsoft has expanded into online advertising
and games, it gets most of its revenue and earnings from the
Windows and Office software used primarily on PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM went beyond technology,&#8221; said Ted Schadler, an
analyst with Forrester Research Inc. &#8220;They were early to
recognize that computing was moving way beyond these boxes on
our desks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM remained ahead of Microsoft for a second day today,
sliding $4.30 to $174.87 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, as Microsoft dropped 56 cents to $24.89 in
Nasdaq Stock Market trading. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, has
gained 19 percent this year, while Microsoft, based in Redmond,
Washington, has fallen 11 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, which long competed against IBM and Microsoft in the
PC business, passed Microsoft in market value last year, on
rising sales of iPhones, iPods and iPads. Apple&#8217;s market
capitalization is $353.5 billion based on today&#8217;s close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano&#8217;s Strategy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano, who is also chairman, has spent his nine years
at the helm sharpening the company&#8217;s focus on software and
services for corporations and government. Once known as the
world&#8217;s largest computer company, IBM in 2005 sold its PC unit
to Lenovo Group Ltd. (992), calling it &#8220;commoditized.&#8221; The company
has spent more than $25 billion investing in its software,
computer-services and consulting businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maneuvers have helped increase per-share profit for
more than 30 straight quarters. Palmisano has boosted sales by
20 percent from 2001 through last year, while keeping the costs
of the 426,000-employee company little changed. IBM pulled in
more than half of its $99.9 billion in revenue last year from
services and is now the world&#8217;s largest computer-services
provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is betting it can add another $20 billion to
revenue through 2015. Palmisano is investing in emerging markets
and analytics, as well as cloud-computing and an initiative
called Smarter Planet to connect roads, electrical systems and
other infrastructure to the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Railways, Waterways &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Computing is now found in things that no one thinks of as
&#8216;computers&#8217;,&#8221; said Palmisano at a trade show keynote in
February. &#8220;Today, there are nearly a billion transistors per
human, and each one costs one ten-millionth of a cent. Yes, some
of these transistors are going into servers, PCs, smart phones,
MP3 players and tablets. But an increasing number of them are
going into appliances and automobiles, power grids, roadways,
railways and waterways.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM plans to almost double operating earnings to at least
$20 a share in 2015. Investors have taken notice: Shares have
climbed 35 percent since the company first announced the goal in
May 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software company, was worth
three times as much as IBM in January 2000 and hit a market
capitalization of more than $430 billion in July 2000, according
to Bloomberg data. Microsoft fell to about $135 billion in March
2009 during the economic downturn, before recovering with the
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which had $69.9 billion in revenue for the
fiscal year ending in June, got about 60 percent of its sales
from the Windows and Office units in the most recent quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were trapped in the classic innovator&#8217;s dilemma&#8221;
because their software business was so good,&#8221; said Schadler.
&#8220;The bet that Microsoft made in the PC business was to double
down and double down and double down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CEO Steve Ballmer said investors may not appreciate the
company&#8217;s progress in other businesses, including server
software and online versions of Office, given the higher profile
of its consumer businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are saying, &#8216;Where do you go next?&#8217;,&#8221; said
Ballmer at the company&#8217;s annual meeting in November. There
probably isn&#8217;t &#8220;as much appreciation for the incredible growth
and success we&#8217;ve had with enterprises since people relate
better to the consumer market. But it&#8217;s great products with
great earnings and particularly in some high-visibility
categories.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox, Bing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s server software and Office divisions boosted
sales last quarter, as did the entertainment division, which
includes its Xbox games business. Revenue at the online services
division, including the Bing search engine, climbed to $662
million, while its operating loss widened to $728 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also cut a deal with Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) this year to make
its Windows Phone the primary operating system for the company&#8217;s
smartphones. The deal is designed to help both companies compete
against Apple and Google Inc. (GOOG)&#8217;s Android operating system, which
is available for free to handset makers such as Motorola
Mobility Holdings Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile and Cloud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM briefly passed Microsoft in market value rank on an
intraday basis in May, and the companies may continue to switch
positions, said Joel Achramowicz, an analyst for Blaylock Robert
Van LLC in Oakland, California. While IBM has largely convinced
investors it can execute its stable growth strategy, Microsoft
has to prove it can move beyond PCs to tackle the mobile and
cloud computing markets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now, we&#8217;re on the cusp of a major offensive move on
the part of Microsoft to position itself with some significant
leadership, this time in the mobile sector,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Investors are skeptical, so the opportunity here is actually
bigger for Microsoft than it is for IBM.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, mobile computing is unlikely to ever be as
profitable for Microsoft as the PC business, said Forrester&#8217;s
Schadler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re never going to win in that business the way they
did in the PC business,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Group of 20 nations may agree
to take coordinated measures to ease monetary policy at their
November meeting as global growth slows, according to Goldman
Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Central banks have to be forward looking,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill
in an interview in London today. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be completely
surprised if we had some kind of coordinated move at the
November meeting and, if there were, Brazil would definitely
play a role in that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s central bank unexpectedly cut the Selic benchmark
interest rate by half a percentage point to 12 percent on Aug.
31 as the risk of recession in Europe and the U.S. shifted
policy makers&#8217; focus away from the fastest inflation in six
years. Turkey and Israel have also lowered rates to protect
their economies from the impact of Europe&#8217;s debt problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s decision to cut the benchmark rate was &#8220;quite
smart,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. The probability of the country meeting
its inflation target of 4.5 percent next year has &#8220;risen
significantly&#8221; because of the global economic crisis, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s debt crisis led investors to dump emerging market
assets in the past two months, pushing the real down 18 percent
against the dollar since the end of July. The Brazilian currency
had gained 13 percent in the previous 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real needs to weaken a further 10 percent to 15 percent
to make Brazilian stocks more &#8220;interesting,&#8221; according to
O&#8217;Neill, who ranks Brazil in &#8220;rising third&#8221; place for equity
investment among the so-called BRIC nations, behind China and
Russia and ahead of India. China is the &#8220;most compelling&#8221; and
&#8220;very cheap,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill, who coined the term BRIC in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we had a further decline in the real, I think the
Brazilian stock market would look more interesting than it has
for a year,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government report today that
showed larger U.S. corn inventories than forecast has cut the
&#8220;probability of an extreme bull case&#8221; for prices, analysts at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn supplies totaled 1.128 billion bushels as of Sept. 1,
the U.S. Department of Agriculture said today. That&#8217;s 20 percent
higher than 942 million expected on average in a Bloomberg
survey of 24 analysts. Prices are headed for the biggest monthly
drop in at least five decades and plunged to a three-month low
today in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s data signaled a &#8220;greater inventory cushion,&#8221;
Goldman analysts Lindsay Drucker Mann, Robert Koort and Evan
Stampler said in the e-mailed report. &#8220;We continue to project
weak feed demand and limited ethanol production growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles outpaced forecasts as consumption in the U.S.
fell 2.3 percent from a year earlier to 2.54 billion bushels in
the three-months ended Aug. 31. Demand dropped after prices
rallied to a three-year high in June on adverse weather
concerns. Futures tumbled in September amid concern that slowing
global growth will trim commodity demand. The U.S. is the
world&#8217;s biggest user, producer and exporter of the grain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn futures for December delivery tumbled the 40-cent
exchange limit, or 6.3 percent, to $5.925 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the lowest for a most-active contract
since July 1. The price lost 23 percent for September, capping
the biggest monthly decline in records going back to 1959. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, demand for U.S. exports may continue to support
prices, the analysts said. The bank maintained its $7 forecast
for the season that began Sept. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stronger exports driven by tight global corn inventories
and competitive U.S. prices will offset the larger supply,&#8221;
Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. reserves before the 2012 harvest will fall to 669
million bushels, or 5.2 percent of consumption, down from 8.5
percent estimated for this year, Goldman said. U.S. corn
production this year may fall to 12.426 billion bushels from
12.447 billion last year, the analyst said. On Sept. 12, the
USDA forecast this season&#8217;s harvest at 12.497 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)&#8217;s Nigerian unit
said gunmen attacked a vessel supplying one of its offshore oil
platforms, wounding one worker and seizing another. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The incident has been reported to security and relevant
government agencies&#8221; after the attack in southern Akwa Ibom
state, Nigel Cookey-Gam, a spokesman in Lagos, said in an e-
mailed statement. Exxon doesn&#8217;t know where the seized worker has
been taken and the injured individual is &#8220;stable,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Violence has risen in the southern Niger River delta, home
to Nigeria&#8217;s oil and gas industry, after a period of relative
quiet that followed a government amnesty in 2009 and the
disarming of thousands of fighters. Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s largest
oil producer and fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed attacks in the delta cut Nigeria&#8217;s oil output more
than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg
shows. Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) said this month it shut 25,000
barrels a day of crude output from its Imo River field in the
country&#8217;s southern Abia state because of the level of theft. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s Angolan unit

August or September next year, from 450,000 now, Expansao said,

&lt;p&gt;The company, which operates the Block 15 project about 350
kilometers (218 miles) off the coast, is developing the Kizomba
satellite fields to extend the life of the area, Luanda-based
Expansao cited De Mahieu as saying. Output will decline in the
meantime as some fields near the end of their life, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Angolan projects are pumping oil more than 95

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Europe face about a 40
percent likelihood of a prolonged period of economic stagnation
should policy makers fail to restore confidence, according to
analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The prospect of a long period of stagnant growth is a
plausible risk and a legitimate concern for the major developed
economies,&#8221; Jose Ursua, a Goldman economist in New York, wrote
in a report. &#8220;Whether these countries manage to avoid a &#8216;Great
Stagnation&#8217; by a pick-up in the recovery is likely to depend on
policy being able to restore confidence and putting in place
reforms that can decisively jolt growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and Europe are already exhibiting signs that would
be typical of stagnations, characterized by &#8220;high and sticky&#8221;
unemployment, an average 0.5 percent growth rate in per capita
gross domestic product and stock markets that underperform
historical averages, Ursua wrote after analyzing 93 episodes of
the condition in the past 150 years. Economies face a higher
probability of such periods after market crashes &#8220;precisely of
the type observed during 2008-2009,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constraints on monetary policy today are &#8220;tighter&#8221; than
in 2008 for developed economies to avoid lengthy periods of
stalled growth, according to the report, dated Sept. 28. Central
bankers may begin to consider &#8220;truly unconventional
&#8216;unconventional&#8217;&#8221; policies as a result, Ursua wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bad News&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bad news is that it is still far from clear whether
enough has been done to jolt economic growth upwards and outside
the zone where prolonged stagnation is a serious risk,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The good news is that policy makers are more aware&#8221; of
the damage wrought by stagnation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is replacing $400 billion of
short-term government debt with bonds of longer maturity in a
bid to lower borrowing costs and bolster the economic recovery.
Most Bank of England policy makers said this month it&#8217;s
&#8220;increasingly probable&#8221; more asset purchases will be needed to
support growth, while European Central Bank officials are likely
to debate restarting their covered-bond purchases and further
measures to ease monetary conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will expand 1.8 percent in the third
quarter according to a Bloomberg survey of economists conducted
Sept. 2 to Sept. 7, down from a 2.1 percent estimate in an
August survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Manufacturing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report today showed Chinese manufacturing shrank for a
third month in September, and German retail sales fell the most
in more than four years in August. Two years into the euro-area
debt crisis and with investor concern growing that Greece will
be unable to avoid default, the U.S. is urging European
governments to go further and show more urgency. German
lawmakers yesterday approved an expansion of the European
Financial Stability Fund, and the overhauled rescue package may
be in place by mid-October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ursua wrote that the chances an emerging economy will
stagnate are &#8220;much lower&#8221; than for developed nations, and its
research put China, Russia and India at the bottom of the scale.
For all countries, the unemployment rate rises an average of 3
percentage points from the period before the bout of stagnation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income levels for a country saddled with a decade of
stagnation would be 20 percent lower than if it expanded at the
average rate since the end of World War II, Ursua said.
Inflation also is usually &#8220;much lower and flatter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This reflects demand pullbacks that may be difficult to
correct if they persist for a sufficiently long period of
time,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;It also underscores the importance of
policy efforts focused on averting deflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
