Harrington" date="Apr 05, 2010  7:25 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-05/-unloved-junk-offers-best-bond-returns-to-goldman-sachs-credit-markets.html"><headline>`Unloved' Junk Offers Best Bond Returns to Goldman Sachs: Credit Markets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Speculative-grade bonds with the
highest rankings may offer the best returns after trailing the
riskiest debt in a record credit-market rally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is recommending high-yield, high-
risk bonds with rankings in the BB tier, the first below
investment grade on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s scale. Pioneer
Investment Management Inc. favors BB and B bonds, the next
lowest bracket, while saying the riskiest debt is overvalued.
Debt ranked in the BB category gained 39.1 percent in the past
12 months, underperforming the CCC tier by 66 percentage points,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk bonds have rallied at an unprecedented pace since
December 2008 after the market seizure that followed the failure
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Companies are issuing record
amounts of the debt as the economy improves, corporate default
rates decline and the Federal Reserve holds interest rates at
near zero, spurring investors to seek higher yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BBs have been in an unloved space, too risky for
investment-grade investors but not risky enough for high-yield
investors,&#8221; said Alberto Gallo, a strategist at Goldman Sachs
in New York. &#8220;That has preserved a lot of value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors seeking higher returns amid low rates will drive
up prices on BB debt, which also offers some protection from
defaults if the economic recovery flags, Gallo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gains in speculative-grade debt are justified by lower
default rates, said Andrew Feltus, a money manager who helps
oversee $8 billion of high-yield debt at Pioneer in Boston. His
$2.8 billion Pioneer High Yield Fund has returned 62 percent in
the past year, in the top 5 percent of funds, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;CCCs Look Rich&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;CCCs look rich to me,&#8221; Feltus said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not in love
with leveraged buyouts, and the default rates will be higher for
these securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield, high-risk, or junk, debt is rated below Baa3 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and lower than BBB- by SP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own corporate bonds rather than government debt fell
yesterday to 148 basis points, or 1.48 percentage point, the
lowest since November 2007, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
Global Broad Market Corporate Index shows. The average yield
rose to 4.075 percent, the highest since Feb. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged loan prices climbed 0.07 cent to 91.91 cents on
the dollar, the highest since June 2008, according to the
SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index. Supervalu Inc., the
second-largest U.S. grocery chain, extended the maturity of $2
billion of bank loans to 2015, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. The Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based retailer
also extended $500 million of its $1 billion term loan to
October 2015 from June 2012, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae&#8217;s current-coupon 30-year fixed-rate mortgage
bonds fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.65 percent, holding near
the highest level since Aug. 10, Bloomberg data show. The Fed
ended its unprecedented purchases of the debt last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk rose from a more
than two-week low today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, rose 1.2 basis point to a mid-price of 84.6
basis points as of 1 p.m. in New York, according to Markit Group
Ltd. The index typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In London, the Markit iTraxx Europe Index on 125
investment-grade companies fell 0.69 basis point to 76.6 basis
points, Markit prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk Bond Offerings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexstar Broadcasting Group Inc. of Irving, Texas, and Fort
Myers, Florida-based Radiation Therapy Services Inc. led five
companies that began marketing at least $1.34 billion of high-
yield bonds yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies in the U.S. have issued $70.125 billion of junk
bonds in 2010 as corporations with speculative-grade rankings
sought to take advantage of the lowest borrowing costs since
October 2007. That compares with $12.8 billion for the same
period in 2009, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield Master II
index gained 4.99 percent this year, following a 57.5 percent
return in 2009. Debt graded in the CCC tier and below has more
than doubled in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tightening Spreads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads on BB ranked debt have fallen 0.66 percentage point
to 4.07 percentage points since the start of the year, the Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index shows. That&#8217;s down from the
record spread of 14.68 percentage points in December 2008 and
above the long-term average of 3.84 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For debt ranked CCC and lower, relative yields have
declined 0.81 percentage point this year to 9.19 percentage
points, index data show. That compares to the record 44.3
percent spread over benchmarks in December 2008 and is below the
long-term average of 12.56 percentage points, index data show.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;BB rated bonds have returned 4.9 percent this year, while
bonds rated B and CCC have returned 3.8 percent and 7.1 percent,
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bonds of companies with the highest junk ratings are
poised to thrive in an economy that may slow as the Fed begins
withdrawing a record $1 trillion in excess cash that propped up
the banking system during the recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sweet Spot&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;BBs in particular are the sweet spot for a slow recovery
environment,&#8221; said Goldman Sachs strategist Gallo, who said
investors in the bonds will benefit as the Fed keeps interest
rates low to guard against another slump, while foreign
investors seek higher yielding assets that offer a cushion
against another slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, based in New York, estimates that the
economy will grow at 2.6 percent in 2010, below the 3 percent
median forecast, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Moody&#8217;s said the speculative-grade default rate will
decline to 2.9 percent by the end of the year from a record 12.9
percent in November, companies with the lowest rankings will
need a strong recovery to reduce debt and avoid default, Gallo
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed officials said they planned to keep the main overnight
interest rate near zero for an &#8220;extended period&#8221; after meeting
on March 16. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan
Stanley, Credit Suisse Group AG and other banks objected to
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s plan to build its real estate
unit into an asset-management business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business would be &#8220;a reorganization plan for debtors&#8217;
employees and management separate, apart and ahead of the
reorganization plan for creditors,&#8221; the banks said yesterday in
a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit called Lamco, staffed by current employees and
managers, would run the defunct investment bank&#8217;s real estate
and private-equity assets, also taking on business from outside,
Lehman said in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lehman parent would have sole control and ownership of
the assets, denying &#8220;any governance or ownership interest&#8221; to
affiliates that helped to fund Lamco, or to creditors, the banks
said. They described the proposed Lamco deal as an &#8220;insider
transaction,&#8221; not an &#8220;arms-length sale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The objection was filed by seven banks and two investment
companies that are derivatives creditors of a Lehman affiliate,
including Merrill Lynch  Co., its parent Bank of America Corp.
and Deutsche Bank AG. By putting Lehman managers and employees
ahead of creditors, Lamco would turn the Chapter 11
reorganization &#8220;on its head,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman&#8217;s U.K. units objected to the plan in a separate
filing, saying Lehman hadn&#8217;t provided enough information to
assess its merits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A hearing on the proposal is scheduled for April 14 in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan may expel workers from
the BG Group Plc and Eni SpA-led Karachaganak venture, as the
government steps up pressure while seeking a stake in the
central Asian nation&#8217;s second-largest producing oil field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have questions on about 270 of the venture&#8217;s employees
and have started by suing seven for receiving their labor
permits and visas improperly,&#8221; Alexander Ogay, a senior
official at the Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office in Astana, said in a
phone interview. &#8220;The punishment for the violation is a fine
and deportation, if the court upholds the prosecutor&#8217;s claim.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan is cracking down on the venture, Karachaganak
Petroleum Operating BV, while seeking to enter the country&#8217;s
only major oil development without state participation. The
government wants a stake to boost profit from the project,
Kairgeldy Kabyldin, the head of state-run energy producer
KazMunaiGaz National Co., said in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s more likely than not that the government will get
the stake; the question is what stake and at what price,&#8221;
Tatyana Kalachova, an analyst at Renaissance Capital&#8217;s Kazakh
unit, said by e-mail. &#8220;The noise is the signal of a deeper
problem. The problem with Karachaganak might be capex overruns
and insufficient local content.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repercussions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Francesca Ciardiello, a spokeswoman for Karachaganak
Petroleum in Aksai, Kazakhstan, declined to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg News in the past two days. Last month,
Gulnara Sharibayeva, another spokeswoman, said the venture is
confident its business practices comply with Kazakh law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven workers received visas and work permits through
the venture rather than their employers who are shareholders in
Karachaganak, in breach of Kazakh law, Ogay said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading, England-based BG Group and Rome-based Eni are the
largest shareholders in Karachaganak Petroleum, each with a 32.5
percent stake, while Chevron Corp. has a 20 percent interest and
OAO Lukoil holds 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Kazakhstan pushes the venture too hard it will have
repercussions on the project and wider economy,&#8221; Dominic
Lewenz, head of oil  gas research at Visor Capital, said by
phone. &#8220;We&#8217;ve already seen the Phase III expansion stalled.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture is considering the third-phase expansion at a
cost of $14.5 billion, KazMunaiGaz said in January. BG estimated
in 2007 that the expansion would cost $8 billion by 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Illegal Earnings&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A negotiated settlement is the most likely outcome,&#8221;
Lewenz said. &#8220;The partners in the venture may be more willing
to sell a stake if they get guarantees of the project&#8217;s future
stability or potential access to new oil reserves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Karachaganak venture is in talks to sell a 10 percent
stake in the field to the government for $1 billion to resolve a
dispute over export oil taxes, a person familiar with the matter
told Bloomberg News in December. Karachaganak Petroleum sought
to recover more than $1 billion in duties from the state, Energy
Minister Sauat Mynbayev said on Sept. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan&#8217;s economic crimes and corruption agency is now
probing &#8220;illegal earnings&#8221; of 104 billion tenge ($708 million)
at Karachaganak, saying on March 26 that the venture profited in
2008 from oil output that wasn&#8217;t approved by the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Finance Ministry asked Karachaganak Petroleum to pay
about 20 billion tenge after a probe of its 2004 taxes,
according to a copy of a ministry letter obtained by Bloomberg
News in February. It extended the tax probe into payments by the
venture in the years 2005 to 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bullish
Amazon.com Inc. options because they are trading near the lowest
prices in two years and the maker of the Kindle portable reader
may rally on increased electronic book sales, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Amyn Bharwani and Marko
Kolanovic recommended purchasing Amazon's July $135 calls while
selling the same month's $155 calls, a strategy known as a call
spread that cuts the price of the trade while capping profit.
Seattle-based Amazon, the world's largest Internet retailer,
gained 0.3 percent to $132.22 at 9:47 a.m. New York time to pare
this year's loss to 1.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade is "attractive" because Amazon's three-month
implied volatility, the key gauge of options prices, is at about
36, in the fourth percentile of readings over the past two years
and down from a peak of 111 over that period, the strategists
said. They cited analyst Imran Khan, who has an "overweight"
rating on the shares and forecasts that they will advance to
$180 by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We see a lot more upside to Amazon," Khan wrote in a
March 30 report calling the company one of JPMorgan's "top
ideas" for this year. Amazon's Kindle is the "dominant
dedicated device" as electronic book sales are poised to reach
25 percent of total U.S. book sales, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon must rise to $141.07 for the trade to break even,
Bharwani and Kolanovic wrote. If the stock is below $135 at
expiration July 16, the investor loses the premium paid to enter
the trade. The maximum profit is returned if the stock price
exceeds $155 at expiration, the New York-based strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Investors who are long the stock and want to materialize
the gain the stock has had over the past year while limiting
their downside risk may want to consider replacing their stock
with calls or call spreads," Bharwani and Kolanovic said. "The
lack of dividends on the stock makes this compelling." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. failed to persuade a
U.S. appeals court to take a second look at a patent-
infringement case that forced it to change the company's popular
Word software and resulted in a damage award that has grown to
more than $290 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on April
1 rejected a request that the Dec. 22 ruling won by closely held
I4i LP of Toronto be heard by the full 12-member court. The
decision was announced in a notice on the court's Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has called the case the largest patent-
infringement verdict ever upheld on appeal. The request for a
rehearing centered on testimony related to damages, whether
Microsoft's infringement was intentional, and whether Microsoft
should have been forced to remove what the company called an
"obscure functionality" or stop selling Word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I4i's invention is related to customizing extensible markup
language, or XML, a way of encoding data to exchange information
among programs. Microsoft issued an update to Word to comply
with the court order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word is part of Microsoft's Office software, used by more
than 500 million people. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft is
testing Office 2010 with customers. The completed version is
scheduled to be released by June. The unit that sells Office is
Microsoft's biggest, with $18.9 billion in sales in the year
ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XML is a common way of encoding data, and nothing in the
order prevented Microsoft from continuing to offer that feature
in Word, or for allowing customized XML when it's used in plain
text. The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. I4i's patent was issued in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 2009-1504, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower-court case is I4i LP v. Microsoft Corp., 07-cv-113, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Gets U.S. Patent for Order Tracking by Video &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc., the largest online retailer, received a
patent for video tracking of order processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 7,689,465, issued March 30, covers the capture of
images of an order being processed, and the sending of those
images to the customer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology can also be used to notify third parties,
who pay to have their promotional material included in a
shipment, according to the patent. A customer will be able to
see her own name and address put on the order, and what is
included in the order, before it is shipped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The invention also may be used to verify customer
complaints about an order, according to the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon applied for the patent in March 2005 with assistance
from Meyertons, Hood, Kivlin, Kowert  Goetzel PC of Austin,
Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand Lawmakers Propose Barring Software Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand lawmakers are considering changing that
country's patent code to outlaw software patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parliament's Commerce Select Committee made its final
recommendation in a 197-page report released at the end of
March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee said the patenting of software is
"inconsistent" with the open-source model. Permitting software
patents would "stifle innovation and competition," the
committee said in its report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report noted that the issue of embedded software is
problematic and urged the Intellectual Property Office of New
Zealand to develop guidelines for inventions containing embedded
software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to software, the new law would ban the
patenting of plant varieties, human beings and biological
processes for their generation, methods of treating humans by
surgery and therapy, and methods of diagnosis practiced on human
beings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand's present patent law, enacted in 1953, was
based on a 1949 U.K. patent bill that has since been repealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing New Zealand patent law "has a low threshold for
patentability compared with most other countries," according to
the committee's report. This low threshold "can lead to broader
patent rights" in New Zealand than in other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result, technology that may be freely available in
other countries may be protected by patents in New Zealand.
Lawmakers said this has the potential to discourage innovation
and inhibit growth in productivity and exports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Wins Tiffany Trademark Appeal, Faces Ad Claim &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay Inc. didn't infringe Tiffany  Co.'s trademark because
of fake goods sold on its Web site, an appeals court ruled,
while returning Tiffany's lawsuit to the trial court for further
action on a false-advertising claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay's ads promoting Tiffany merchandise may be misleading
and in violation of federal law, the New York-based appeals
court said April 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"The law prohibits an advertisement that implies that all
of the goods offered on a defendant's Web site are genuine when,
in fact, as here, a sizeable portion of them are not," a three-
judge panel wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling may force EBay to change its advertising policy
to include disclaimers that some trademark goods, like Tiffany
jewelry, may be counterfeit. The judges said they "rather doubt
that the consequences will be so dire" that advertising will be
deterred because sellers can't confirm the authenticity of goods
for sale as EBay maintained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany said in a statement that it is "very
disappointed" by the ruling and considering an appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"EBay knew that counterfeit merchandise was being sold on
its site -- and EBay took no effective steps to stop it,"
Tiffany Chief Executive Officer Michael J. Kowalski said in the
statement. "EBay deliberately misled consumers for profit, and
unfortunately the court has justified its actions." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiffany, based in New York, and other retailers have said
online sales of fake brands of clothes, bags and jewelry cost
the industry about $30 billion a year. EBay, the most-visited
U.S. e-commerce site, said the ruling validates its "leading
efforts to fight counterfeiting." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We continue to support cooperation, rather than
litigation, as the best way to address these issues in
everyone's best interests," Michael R. Jacobson, general
counsel of the San Jose, California-based company, said in a
statement, predicting an EBay victory on the false-ad claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tiffany v. EBay, 08-3947, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Boeing Ready With Tanker Bid, Has Trademark Application &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co., whose quest to gain the U.S. Air Force's $35
billion air-tanker contract was set back with the extension of
the bidding deadline to July 9, already has a pending
application for a trademark for the aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago-based Boeing, which is presently the only known
bidder for the contract, applied to register "KC-767" as a
trademark in March 2006, according to the database of the U.S.
Patent and Trademark Office. The mark is to be used for
aircraft, Boeing said in its application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the designations-systems.net Web site, the Air
Force approved the KC-767 in September 2002 for a Boeing tanker
based on its 767 aircraft. Boeing is the maker of the KC-135
tanker the Air Force first ordered in 1954, which the new tanker
is intended to replace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense said March 31 it was extending
the bidding deadline to July 9 if the European Aeronautic
Defence and Space Co. decides to submit a bid. Netherlands-based
EADS asked for an extension after partner Northrop Grumman Corp.
dropped out of the competition on March 8, saying the bidding
contest favored the Boeing aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knoll Settles 'Barcelona' Trademark Dispute with Alphaville &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knoll Inc., a maker of office furniture, settled a
trademark dispute with Alphaville Design Inc., according to a
company statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alphaville, a furniture wholesaler based in Fremont,
California, sued Knoll in federal court in San Francisco in
November 2007, seeking a declaration it wasn't infringing the
"Barcelona" trademarks used for furniture designed by Mies van
der Rohe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California company claimed Knoll's trademarks were
invalid. In settling the dispute, Alphaville and its owners
acknowledged the validity of the trademarks and Knoll's rights
to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return, East Greenville, Pennsylvania-based Knoll
granted Alphaville the right to sell similar products for a
limited amount of time, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel signed the dismissal
order on March 29. No damages, litigation costs or attorney fees
were awarded to either party, according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Alphaville Design Inc., v. Knoll Inc. 3:07-cv-
0569-MHP, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nature Publishing Group Recalls Biofuel Article for Plagiarism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scholarly article about the use of biofuel was retracted
for plagiarism by the journal Nature Reviews Genetics, The
Scientist.com reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is first such action for any of the 15 journals
published by Nature Publishing Group, according to The
Scientist.com &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article, "Plant genetic engineering for biofuel
production: towards affordable cellulosic ethanol," was by a
plant scientist from Michigan State University, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Miriam B. Sticklen of the university's Department
of Crop  Soil Sciences submitted her retraction notice to
Nature Publishing, which placed it on the publication's Web
site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said she had paraphrased without attribution an article
to which she had access as a peer reviewer. The article she
reviewed, on plant cell wall reconstruction, was published in
the journal Plant Science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scientist.com Web site reported that Sticklen told her
university's research-integrity investigation committee she
suffered from a medical condition that affected her memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She is the named inventor on a number of U.S. patents
related to transgenic plants and plant reproduction, according
to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s Sam Palmisano, who increased net income almost fourfold
in eight years at the helm, may need a multibillion-dollar
acquisition soon to keep up the pace, some investors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s time for a bold stroke, or a series of bold
strokes,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, senior portfolio manager at
Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, who helps handle $12.8
billion, including 390,000 IBM shares as of Dec. 31. &#8220;It really
takes a major acquisition or a series of midsize acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IBM has boosted earnings per share through buybacks,
expense controls and other measures, rivals Oracle Corp. and
Hewlett-Packard Co. have eclipsed its stock-price performance,
lifted by big acquisitions that helped revenue soar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Palmisano, IBM has spent $25 billion buying
companies. Compare that with at least $42 billion for Oracle and
Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s $45 billion. IBM&#8217;s share price has risen 32
percent in the Palmisano era, versus 54 percent for Oracle and
168 percent for Hewlett-Packard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue will rise 3.8 percent this calendar year at IBM as
Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s sales increase by 6.9 percent and Oracle&#8217;s by
24 percent in the same period, according to a Bloomberg survey
of analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion, some investors say: Palmisano&#8217;s current
strategy may have its limits. During the past eight years, he
has worked to shift IBM&#8217;s focus from hardware to services and
software, which are more profitable. He&#8217;s also cut operating
expenses and headcount, sent work overseas and sold off low-
margin businesses. All this may not be enough to maintain IBM&#8217;s
earnings growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Maximized the Model&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve maximized the model to the full extent they
can,&#8221; said Ben Rogoff, a manager at Polar Capital Partners in
London who helps oversee $2.5 billion, including more than
127,000 IBM shares, as of Dec. 31. &#8220;It takes a fair amount of
MA to move the needle on a $100 billion revenue company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average and
the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index for four straight years, IBM has
trailed the market for the past 52 weeks. The shares missed the
stock market&#8217;s best first-quarter gain since 1998, falling 2
percent as the SP 500 Index rose 4.9 percent and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average gained 4.1 percent. IBM rose $1.10 to $129.35
at 4:10 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through internal growth and deals, revenue has more than
doubled at Oracle and Hewlett-Packard since their 2002 fiscal
years. Hewlett-Packard, led by Mark Hurd, increased sales to
more than $114 billion last year, passing IBM&#8217;s $96 billion. At
Oracle, CEO Larry Ellison has snapped up more than 60 companies
since 2005 to fuel revenue. Sales have grown 18 percent at IBM
under Palmisano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Elephant in the Room&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Revenues are the elephant in the room,&#8221; said Brian
Marshall, an analyst at Broadpoint AmTech Inc. in San Francisco.
&#8220;They have to boost revenues materially.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While IBM will continue to focus on smaller deals, its
unsuccessful $7 billion bid for Sun Microsystems Inc. shows it
is open to acquiring larger companies, a person familiar with
the company&#8217;s acquisition strategy said. The person said IBM
isn&#8217;t likely to spend more than $10 billion on a single deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM spokesman Michael Fay said the company has undergone a
&#8220;profound transformation&#8221; since 2002. It has added $12 billion
in pretax profit, created $80 billion in free cash flow and met
or beat earnings forecasts for the past 19 quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s shift to high-margin software and service
businesses and its expansion into cloud computing, analytics and
new geographic markets provide significant opportunity for
revenue and profit growth, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Wherewithal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s biggest purchases under Palmisano were $5 billion for
Cognos Inc. in 2008 and $3.5 billion for PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP&#8217;s consulting business in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano declined requests for an interview. The company&#8217;s
best year under his leadership was 2009, when IBM shares rose 56
percent. That compared with 23 percent for the SP 500, 38
percent for Oracle and 42 percent for Hewlett-Packard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have the financial strength to invest for growth and to
deliver on our objectives as we have done over the decade,&#8221; Fay
said. &#8220;None of this is to say IBM will or won&#8217;t do large
acquisitions as it did with PWCC and Cognos.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM began an initiative March 31 to help some startup
software companies develop their technology as a way for IBM to
identify partners and acquisition targets. IBM has bought about
75 of the 1,500 partners it has worked with, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors are especially critical of IBM&#8217;s devotion to
stock buybacks, a practice that dates back to the tenure of
former CEO Louis Gerstner and has continued under Palmisano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sucking in the Stock&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It means you don&#8217;t have any prospects out there,&#8221;
Sorrentino said. &#8220;You buy back stock because it&#8217;s the only way
to add to your bottom line. You&#8217;re sucking in the stock to
shrink the company down.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano has spent almost three times as much on stock
buybacks as on acquiring new companies. Since 2002, the company
has spent $68.5 billion on buybacks, equal to 41 percent of its
current market value. That has increased IBM&#8217;s earnings per
share almost fivefold as net income rose less than fourfold.
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. estimates that 22 cents, or 17
percent of IBM&#8217;s earnings-per-share growth, will come from
buybacks this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors will penalize IBM if it spends too much on
buybacks, said Bill Gorman, an analyst at PNC Capital Advisors,
a unit of PNC Financial Services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wall Street won&#8217;t put a multiple on a company that speeds
up buybacks to hit a certain growth target,&#8221; Gorman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit Slowdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure will mount on IBM to do acquisitions as its
earnings growth slows, some investors say. Since 2002, IBM&#8217;s net
income has risen at an average 21 percent compound growth rate,
almost nine times the pace of revenue, which climbed 2.4 percent
annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sustaining that pace of profit growth isn&#8217;t realistic,
given IBM&#8217;s sluggish revenue, said Kevin Landis, chief
investment officer at Firsthand Capital Management in Santa
Clara, California, which manages $300 million. His firm sold all
its IBM shares last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The simple math is the bottom line usually doesn&#8217;t grow
that much faster than the top line at most companies,&#8221; Landis
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s net income growth will slow over the next two years,
falling from 10 percent in 2010 to 9 percent next year and to 7
percent in 2012, according to estimates by Richard Nguyen, an
analyst at Societe Generale in Paris. A Bloomberg survey of
analysts shows a similar slowdown in earnings per share and net
income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 27 analysts tracked by Bloomberg, 17 recommend buying
the shares and 10 advise holding them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acceleration Needed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM&#8217;s revenue will rise an average of 3.9 percent
compounded annually through 2012, according to Bloomberg
consensus estimates. That growth must accelerate to 12 percent
to 13 percent yearly to achieve the same rate of earnings
growth, said Sorrentino at Huntington Asset Advisors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment bankers who have pitched deals to IBM say the
company may look at larger companies than in previous years,
such as storage makers EMC Corp. and NetApp Inc. Other targets
could include networking firm Juniper Networks Inc. and Research
In Motion Ltd., maker of the BlackBerry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although IBM has said it&#8217;s not interested in the mobile-
handset market, the company will have to expand into wireless
software and services to stay competitive in the corporate-
technology field, some investors say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Midsize Possibilities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM will continue to buy companies of all sizes to
complement its internal growth,&#8221; said Alec Ellison, global head
of technology investment banking at Jefferies Group Inc. Ellison
has sold small companies to IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rogoff at Polar Capital says it&#8217;s more likely IBM will
examine small and midsize targets such as BMC Software Inc.,
Brocade Communications Systems Inc., NetApp and Juniper. A
single deal could add $2 billion to $3 billion in annual sales
and plug holes in IBM&#8217;s product line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of assets available out there,&#8221; Rogoff
said. &#8220;IBM and others are feeling the pressure of a new cycle
and need to find the right pieces to the puzzle.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brocade doesn&#8217;t comment on rumor or speculation, John Noh,
a spokesman for the San Jose, California-based company, said in
an e-mail. Hopkinton, Massachusetts-based EMC also doesn&#8217;t
speculate on rumors, said spokeswoman Lesley Ogrodnick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juniper Deal? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juniper declined to comment, said Melanie Branon, a
spokeswoman for the Sunnyvale, California, company. Waterloo,
Ontario-based RIM doesn&#8217;t comment on rumors or speculation,
spokeswoman Marisa Conway said. At BMC, Mark Stouse declined to
comment on IBM&#8217;s potential interest in the Houston-based
company. Jodi Baumann, a spokeswoman for Sunnyvale-based NetApp,
didn&#8217;t respond to messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juniper, which makes networking equipment, would accelerate
IBM&#8217;s expansion into cloud computing, which is central to
Palmisano&#8217;s strategy. &#8220;Juniper would be a strategic deal for
them,&#8221; Societe Generale&#8217;s Nguyen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors say IBM doesn&#8217;t need big acquisitions to
increase earnings per share. After reducing expenses by $3.7
billion last year, &#8220;we assume the company can reduce their cost
structure through restructuring by $1.5 billion this year,&#8221;
said Dick Glasebrook, a managing director at Straus Group, a
unit of Neuberger Berman, which owned 13 million shares of IBM
as of Dec. 31. &#8220;Throw in the buybacks, you can get in double-
digit earnings growth.&#8221; He expects $1 billion a year in reduced
costs after this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid Investment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will remain attractive to some investors as a reliable,
liquid investment even if earnings growth slows, said Gorman at
PNC Financial Services, which owned 4.5 million IBM shares on
Dec. 31. Gorman estimates IBM&#8217;s net income growth will slow to 7
percent to 8 percent this year and the following two years,
while earnings per share growth runs between 8 percent and 9
percent annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some investors aren&#8217;t waiting. &#8220;The stock will get dragged
down because of slow earnings,&#8221; said Paul Meeks, a principal at
Winsor Asset Management in Charleston, South Carolina, which
invests $300 million and sold its IBM shares last year. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why I&#8217;m no longer in it. I don&#8217;t see the price appreciation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Olusegun Aganga, a managing director
at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., was today named as finance minister
of Nigeria, Africa&#8217;s largest oil producer and most populous
nation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aganga, who has degrees from the University of Oxford and
the University of Ibadan, will head a team that will brief
acting President Goodluck Jonathan every two weeks on the state
of the economy, Jonathan said at a swearing-in ceremony in the
capital, Abuja. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team &#8220;must help to fast-track the process of our
development as this is the most important task in the life of
our nation,&#8221; Jonathan said. &#8220;Our present and our future depend
on it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan, 52, named 38 members of his Cabinet today,
replacing many of the ministers he dismissed two weeks ago. He
dissolved the former Cabinet on March 17, five weeks after
taking over from President Umaru Yar&#8217;Adua, who hasn&#8217;t been seen
in public since traveling to Saudi Arabia on Nov. 23 for medical
treatment. He has since returned to Nigeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former mines minister, Diezani Alison-Madueke, was
named as the new petroleum minister. Nigeria, the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports, is producing 2.6 million barrels a
day, the former petroleum minister said on March 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information Minister Dora Akunyili, National Planning
Minister Shamsudeen Usman and Finance Minister of State Remi
Babalola all returned to their former posts in the 42-member
Cabinet. Four places in the Cabinet are still unoccupied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&#8216;Comparative Advantage&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aganga is a qualified accountant and worked for Ernst 
Young LLP before joining Goldman Sachs in London in 2001, where
he started at the European prime brokerage division, which
provides financing, trading and other services to hedge funds.
He was promoted to managing director, the second-highest rank in
the company, in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Nigeria planning a eurobond sale in a few months,
&#8220;his professional profile could to some extent be a comparative
advantage,&#8221; said Samir Gadio, Vice President at Rencap
Securities in Lagos, a unit of Moscow-based Renaissance. &#8220;His
appointment may be positively perceived by international
investors and global markets for the same set of reasons.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aganga will have to help push ahead with policies that have
been delayed by Yar&#8217;Adua&#8217;s absence, including an end to fuel
subsidies and the implementation of the budget, which wasn&#8217;t
approved until March 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, which has a population of about 150 million, has a
budget of 4.6 trillion naira ($30.7 billion) for fiscal 2010.
The government is spending on roads, bridges, houses, schools
and power plants in a bid to improve the country&#8217;s
infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Prayers &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s term in office runs out in May, 2011, and
&#8220;time is short for him to make an impact,&#8221; said Bismarck
Rewane, chief executive officer of Financial Derivatives Co.
Ltd. in Lagos: &#8220;There&#8217;s the challenge of maintaining fiscal
discipline at a time of profligacy in the dying days of any
administration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The budget was delayed in part because Yar&#8217;Adua never
formally transferred authority to Jonathan, his deputy. That
prompted parliament to proclaim Jonathan as acting president on
Feb. 9 to end a power vacuum that left key decisions pending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we continue to pray for the speedy recovery of the
President, permit me to emphasize the policy continuum of
governance and to insist on the imperative of this team to roll
up its sleeves, and to redouble efforts so as to meet the
expectations of our people who are yearning for good
governance,&#8221; Jonathan said today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographer Annie Leibovitz was
sued by Brunswick Capital Partners LP, a Manhattan-based
investment firm, for failing to pay at least $315,000 in fees it
claims are due as part of her financing deal with the private-
equity firm Colony Capital LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brunswick entered into an agreement with the two parties in
February 2009, to seek &#8220;strategic financing&#8221; for the
photographer, it said April 2 in a lawsuit in New York State
Supreme Court in Manhattan, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In exchange for a $50,000 initial retainer and weekly
$10,000 payments, Brunswick worked &#8220;exhaustively&#8221; to obtain a
list of lenders for Leibovitz that included Colony, Brunswick
claimed. Leibovitz was sued along with her studio and other
business entities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants have failed to compensate Brunswick Capital
for the benefits they have received,&#8221; Brunswick said in an 11-
page complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leibovitz &#8220;never indicated to Brunswick Capital any
dissatisfaction&#8221; with its performance, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brunswick is entitled to a 2 percent &#8220;success fee&#8221;
stemming from Leibovitz&#8217;s deal, which is worth $40 million,
Brunswick said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leibovitz, 60, was sued in July in by a creditor, Art
Capital Group Inc., which accused her of reneging on a sales
agreement connected with a $24 million loan. She settled that
case in September 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colony settled Leibovitz&#8217;s debt with Art Capital Group on
March 8, and announced &#8220;a new partnership&#8221; with the
photographer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender dropped its lawsuit against her, Art Capital and
Leibovitz said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew Hiltzik, a spokesman for Leibovitz, said he didn&#8217;t
have an immediate comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brunswick case is Brunswick Capital Partners LP v.
Leibovitz, 600849/2010, New York State Supreme Court , New York
County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Accused of Using EMG Technology With IPad &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., the maker of iPods and Macintoch computers, was
accused of using a closely held California company&#8217;s technology
with its new iPad device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMG Technology LLC said it will seek to include the iPad
device in its pending patent infringement case against Apple in
federal court in Tyler, Texas. The trial date is set for
September 2011, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple was sued in November 2008 by EMG, which had claimed
its patent was wrongfully being used in the iPhone for
navigating the internet. The patent covers the display of
Internet content for the iPhone and other mobile devices. EMG
seeks unspecified damages, according to a complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple refuses to pay reasonable royalties for its use of
EMG&#8217;s patents relating to navigating Internet mobile Web sites
and applications, which were filed in 1999, several years before
Apple&#8217;s mobile patents were filed,&#8221; said Elliot Gottfurcht,
managing member of Santa Monica, California-based EMG and lead
inventor on the patents asserted in the case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Holds Off Boston Scientific Unit Plea in Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge reserved ruling on a guilty plea by Boston
Scientific Corp.&#8217;s Guidant unit to charges it hid problems with
its implantable heart defibrillators, citing objections raised
by plaintiffs suing the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Donovan Frank in St. Paul, Minnesota,
said yesterday he will rule on the plea and a related settlement
within three weeks when he decides whether to put the company on
probation and order restitution. Boston Scientific agreed to pay
$296 million in November to settle a U.S. Justice Department
probe of the unit&#8217;s handling of the devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have a locker full of angry letters from plaintiffs,&#8221;
Frank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The medical device-maker agreed to plead guilty to two
misdemeanors for excluding defibrillator-malfunction reports
from product updates sent to doctors and failing to alert the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration to the defects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said in court papers that Guidant officials
learned as early as 2002 that some of the defibrillators had
short-circuiting problems that led to some users&#8217; deaths. The
company didn&#8217;t disclose the defects for more than three years,
the government added in the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Boston Scientific halted all sales of heart-
rhythm devices because of an erroneous filing with regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When a corporation who makes life-saving devices lies to
the FDA, that puts the implantees and others at risk,&#8221; Charles
Zimmerman, an attorney for plaintiffs, said during yesterday&#8217;s
hearing. &#8220;Today Guidant comes before the court and asks you to
accept a plea of guilty in which they admit they have lied.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Donovan, a Boston Scientific spokesman, had no
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Guidant LLC, 10-mj-00067, U.S. District
Court, District of Minnesota (St. Paul). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potential Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro&#8217;s New Chief to Face Probes of Refinery Blast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory Goff will take over as Tesoro Corp.&#8217;s chief
executive May 1 to face a wave of state and federal
investigations following the worst industrial accident in the
oil refiner&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A chemical explosion killed five at Tesoro&#8217;s Anacortes,
Washington, plant on April 2, intensifying safety concerns among
federal investigators about the nation&#8217;s refiners. Two employees
remain hospitalized in critical condition, said a spokeswoman at
Seattle&#8217;s Harborview Medical Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blast triggered the second federal investigation in six
months of Tesoro, the biggest independent refiner on the U.S.
West Coast. The Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board,
an independent U.S. federal agency, is investigating an Oct. 21
fire at the company&#8217;s Salt Lake City plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goff, 53, will be tested in his ability to manage the
company&#8217;s seven refineries, as well as its relationship with
federal authorities, said John Parry, vice president of IHS
Herold Inc., a consulting firm in Norwich, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
the Washington Department of Labor and Industries and the
state&#8217;s Ecology Department are investigating the Anacortes
explosion, Tesoro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional scrutiny of San Antonio-based Tesoro comes
days after the company named a successor to retiring Chief
Executive Officer Bruce Smith. Goff, formerly a senior vice
president at Houston-based ConocoPhillips, was selected after a
seven-month search. He previously managed ConocoPhillips&#8217;s
refineries in Asia and Europe and most recently focused on
supplies and trading of refined products and crude oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goff couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &#8220;Mr. Goff is not yet
an employee of the company so it would not be appropriate for
him to be involved at this point,&#8221; Tesoro spokesman Lynn
Westfall said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We intend to fully
cooperate with all agency investigations to bring about a
thorough analysis of the incident.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Tesoro is hit with lawsuits over the deaths at
Anacortes, settlements might range from $10 million to $20
million, depending on the circumstances, said David Perry, a
plaintiff&#8217;s lawyer in Corpus Christi, Texas, who represented
clients in the 2005 blast at a Texas City, Texas, plant owned by
London-based BP Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota Hid Defect in Violation of Law, LaHood Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp. &#8220;knowingly hid a dangerous defect&#8221;
that caused its vehicles to accelerate unexpectedly, the U.S.
said, for the first time accusing the world&#8217;s largest automaker
of breaking the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood proposed a record civil
penalty of $16.4 million, the most the government can impose.
The fine recommended April 5 escalates the confrontation between
Toyota and LaHood, who initially praised the carmaker for its
handling of recalls the company attributed to faulty accelerator
pedals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine was announced the week after Toyota reported U.S.
sales rose 41 percent in March with the help of no-interest
loans and discount leases, signaling the Toyota City, Japan-
based company may be recovering from recalls of more than 8
million vehicles worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Transportation Department&#8217;s action showed &#8220;safety
matters and they&#8217;re going to be tough as nails,&#8221; Joan
Claybrook, a former head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said in an interview. &#8220;That&#8217;s very appropriate.
They caught Toyota red-handed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Japanese automaker waited at least four months before
telling the agency that accelerator pedals might stick, LaHood
said in a statement April 5. Companies have five business days
to report safety defects, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We now have proof that Toyota failed to live up to its
legal obligations,&#8221; LaHood said in the statement.&#160;&#8220;Worse yet,
they knowingly hid a dangerous defect for months from U.S.
officials and did not take action to protect millions of drivers
and their families.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota hadn&#8217;t received NHTSA&#8217;s letter on the fine,
according to an e-mailed statement April 5 from the company&#8217;s
North American sales unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have already taken a number of important steps to
improve our communications with regulators and customers on
safety-related matters as part of our strengthened overall
commitment to quality assurance,&#8221; the company said, without
saying whether it will exercise its right to dispute the fine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon to Pay $32.2 Million to Settle Royalties Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S. energy company, agreed
to pay $32.2 million to resolve U.S. government claims that it
underpaid royalties on natural gas produced on federal and
American Indian lands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement resolves violations of the False Claims Act
that Mobil Corp. committed between March 1988 and November 1999,
the Justice Department said yesterday in a statement. Mobil,
which was acquired by Exxon in December 1999, &#8220;systematically
underreported&#8221; the value of gas extracted from the leases, the
Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement amount is equivalent to less than one hour
of sales at Irving, Texas-based Exxon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Harold Wright
under the provisions of the federal whistleblower statute that
allows private citizens to file actions on behalf of the
government and share in any recovery. Because Wright is
deceased, his heirs will receive $975,000, the Justice
Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokeswoman Margaret Ross didn&#8217;t respond to a
telephone message seeking comment on the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility Settles U.S. Dispute for $750 Million, Qabas Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility, the Middle East&#8217;s biggest logistics company,
agreed to pay the U.S. government $750 million to settle a
dispute over U.S. military bills, Al-Qabas reported, without
saying where it got the information from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility, formerly known as Public Warehousing Co., said in
a statement to the Kuwait Stock Exchange March 31 that it
delayed announcing its 2009 results in the hope reaching a
settlement. It was indicted in November for allegedly
overcharging on a multibillion-dollar contract to supply food
for U.S. troops in Kuwait and Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agility could not be reached for comments when contacted by
Bloomberg News April 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford Panamanian Asset Sale Yields $14.2 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission obtained more
than $14.2 million for Stanford Financial Group investors in a
Panamanian asset sale, the agency said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money &#8220;has been secured for the benefit of the
worldwide victims of R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s alleged multibillion
dollar fraud scheme,&#8221; the commission said April 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The regulator last year sued Stanford, two associates and
three of his businesses, alleging they were part of a
&#8220;massive&#8221; fraud involving the sale of certificates of deposit
through the Antigua-based Stanford International Bank Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Dallas issued an asset-freezing order
and appointed a receiver to run the Texas financier&#8217;s
businesses. Stanford was later indicted by a federal grand jury
in Houston on charges he led a $7 billion fraud. He has denied
any wrongdoing and is being held without bail pending a trial in
January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford was the sole owner of an entity that owned
Stanford Bank (Panama) SA, a Panama City-based bank and
brokerage business, and another firm called Stanford Casa de
Valores SA, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After U.S. authorities obtained the asset-freeze order,
Panamanian banking and securities regulators assumed control of
Stanford assets in that country, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, in court papers, opposed the sale of his
Panamanian assets, arguing they were being sold for less than
they were worth. U.S. District Judge David Godbey in Dallas
approved the transaction in a Feb. 10 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Little, a court-appointed representative for the
financier&#8217;s investors, declined to comment. Stanford&#8217;s defense
lawyers, Ruth Brewer-Schuster and Christina Sarchio, also didn&#8217;t
reply to e-mails or calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC case is Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Stanford International Bank Ltd., 09cv00298, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney Pleads Guilty to Stealing $2.2 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York lawyer Marc A. Bernstein pleaded guilty to grand
larceny for stealing $2.2 million from malpractice and personal
injury clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein, 55, also pleaded guilty to scheming to defraud
and failure to file tax returns in New York state court
yesterday, according to Tracy Golden, a spokeswoman for the
Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s office. Bernstein was promised a
sentence of no more than three to nine years, Golden said. A
restitution hearing will be held June 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein stole settlement and escrow money from 16 medical
malpractice and personal-injury clients between 2006 and 2009,
according to prosecutors. He typically negotiated a settlement
for the victim and then kept the money, prosecutors have said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein also stole a $900,000 deposit he was supposed to
hold in escrow for a real estate purchaser. He made up stories
about the settlement money being unavailable, wrote bad checks,
and typically used the cash to pay off personal debts or other
clients, prosecutors have said. He also was charged with failure
to file state personal income tax returns from 2003 through 2007
and a fraudulent 2008 return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein, who was admitted to the bar in 1982, was a name
partner in the firm Bernstein  Bernstein LP. His license to
practice law was suspended in April 2009. Manhattan Assistant
District Attorney Leah Keith said in court there may be more
victims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernstein had faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted
at trial of the top charge, grand larceny in the second degree. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s accepted responsibility for what he has done,&#8221; said
Arthur Aidala, Bernstein&#8217;s lawyer. He said the judge would be
made aware of mitigating factors before sentencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are People v. Bernstein, 2348/2009, 3553/2009,
and 01354/2010, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
energy company, said it never deliberately underpaid royalties
on natural gas pumped on federal and American Indian land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department yesterday announced that Exxon
agreed to pay $32.2 million to resolve violations of the False
Claims Act committed between March 1988 and November 1999. Mobil
Corp., which was acquired by Exxon in December 1999,
"systematically underreported" the value of gas extracted from
the leases and "knowingly" underpaid what it owed, the
department said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We reject any accusation that the company deliberately
under-reported the value of the natural gas," David Eglinton, a
spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mailed
statement. "The settlement agreement in this case, signed by
the government, expressly denies any knowing under-reporting
with respect to royalty." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eglinton said the agreement was signed in 2008. The Justice
Department's statement didn't explain why it waited until now to
announce the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount Exxon agreed to pay is equivalent to less than
one hour of the company's sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement stemmed from a lawsuit filed by Harold Wright
under the provisions of the federal whistleblower statute that
allows private citizens to file actions on behalf of the
government and share in any recovery. Because Wright is deceased,
his heirs will receive $975,000, the Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other energy companies that previously settled similar
cases with the government include Burlington Resources Inc.,
which is now part of ConocoPhillips, Chevron Corp. and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, the department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute centered on whether the energy companies could
deduct costs such as pipeline fees from the value of the gas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China Index may stage a

quarter amid improving fundamentals and liquidity, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI China, tracking mostly Hong Kong-traded Chinese

by 2.5 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, in the first three
months of the year, JPMorgan analysts led by Frank Li wrote in a

&lt;p&gt;H shares will likely offer better returns than yuan-

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. has almost
doubled the number of its Tokyo commodity traders to meet demand
from utilities seeking to use coal-derivatives to hedge against
price swings, said a person with knowledge of the expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-biggest U.S. bank has increased the headcount to
around 10 in the last 18 months, in part to meet the needs of
utilities such as Chubu Electric Power Co. and J-Power, the
country&#8217;s biggest power wholesaler, said the person, who
declined to be named because the information is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan joins Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Plc in
boosting sales of swaps and other products to help Japanese
utilities mitigate risk from volatile fuel costs. J-Power&#8217;s
profit dropped by a third in fiscal 2008 and Chubu posted a loss
after benchmark Australian power-station coal prices rose to a
record in July then fell 61 percent five months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Utilities&#8217; hedging needs have grown rapidly over the past
few years as physical coal prices became more volatile,&#8221; said
Ken Hasegawa, the energy team manager at broker Newedge in Tokyo.
&#8220;The question is whether other power companies will follow
suit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mika Nemoto, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Securities Japan
Co., declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J-Power, officially known as Electric Power Development Co.,
hired Barclays commodities banker Toyohiko Kuroda last year to
bolster management of risks associated with coal procurement,
Masato Uchiyama, director of the utility&#8217;s energy business
division, said in an interview on April 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coal Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility, which buys 20 million metric tons of coal
annually, transacts coal swaps for part of that total to hedge
against price fluctuations, said Uchiyama, 54. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps allow utilities to pay a fixed price for coal while
another party, usually a bank, pays a floating price, based on
market benchmarks. If the benchmark goes up during the term of
the contract, the utility gets a payment from the bank, and if
it goes down, the utility pays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nagoya-based Chubu Electric transacted 15 million tons
worth of over-the-counter coal swaps free on board at
Australia&#8217;s Newcastle port in the year ended March 31 after
forming an alliance with a unit of Electricite de France SA in
2007, said Yoshio Komura, director of Chubu&#8217;s trading unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s third-biggest generator formed Chubu Energy Trading
Inc. in 2007 to procure the fuel for resale to other users in
Asia and trade derivatives, Komura said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spot power-station coal prices at Newcastle, the world&#8217;s
largest export harbor for the fuel, retreated to an average
$71.71 a ton in 2009 from $129.02 the previous year as the
global economic recession eroded demand. Prices climbed to a
record $192.50 in July before plunging to $75.25 in Dec. 5, 2008.
Coal gained 14 cents to $94.98 a ton in the week ended April 3,
according to the globalCOAL NEWC Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan, the world&#8217;s biggest power-station coal importer in
2009, ships in about 92 million tons annually. Australian
suppliers led by Xstrata Plc and Rio Tinto Plc account for more
than half while Indonesia, the second-biggest supplier, provides
about 20 percent, according to the finance ministry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sphera Global Healthcare Fund, an
Israeli hedge fund that&#8217;s beaten the market since its founding
in 2007, is avoiding shares of local generic-drug maker Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., which has given investors a 105
percent return over the past five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Sphera is building a stake in Teva&#8217;s arch-rival
Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest pharmaceutical company, which
has lost 20 percent in that time including dividends. New York-
based Pfizer, selling for 7.4 times estimated earnings, is the
least expensive of the 10 largest drugmakers. Teva, at 12.6
times profit, is the most expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as something is cheap, we&#8217;ll hold it,&#8221; said Ori
Hershkovitz, 36, who&#8217;s a partner in the Tel Aviv-based fund and
the head of research, in an interview last month. &#8220;As long as
something is expensive, we&#8217;ll short it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That contrarian strategy has paid off. The $120 million
fund returned 17 percent since inception in March 2007, compared
with a loss of 0.4 percent for a Standard  Poor&#8217;s index of
global health-care stocks. Now, Hershkovitz says Pfizer
shares are attractive because of its diversified product
portfolio, presence in fast-growing emerging markets and 4.2
percent dividend yield. The New York-based company probably will
get positive clinical trial results by September for the
tanezumab pain treatment, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only is Pfizer a good value now, &#8220;but also we have a
short-term catalyst,&#8221; he said. The fund increased its Pfizer
holding this year. The company accounts for 15 percent of Sphera
Global Healthcare&#8217;s assets, up from 12 percent previously, even
as growth for makers of lower-priced generic medicine outpaces
that of branded drug companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares declined more than warranted because its 2012
forecast in February disappointed investors and because of
setbacks with cancer drug Sutent and Alzheimer&#8217;s drug Dimebon,
he said. Pfizer is &#8220;poorly regarded by the market,&#8221; said
Hershkovitz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Started with capital from Mori Arkin, the Israeli
entrepreneur who led Agis Industries Ltd. until its 2005
takeover by Perrigo Co., the Sphera health fund began accepting
external investors in March 2007. The fund taps a network of
Israeli doctors for opinions on new drugs and hired a veteran
Teva patent lawyer to analyze prospects for generic challengers,
said Hershkovitz, who joined at the fund&#8217;s inception after
working as an analyst for Leader  Co. Investment House Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arkin, Hershkovitz and two other partners seek companies
whose shares are temporarily depressed by bad news, or whose
stock may benefit from catalysts such as drug approvals within
two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generic Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sphera Global Healthcare is avoiding Teva, the world&#8217;s
biggest generic-drug company, even as growth of lower-priced
copied medicines outpaces that of branded pharmaceuticals.
Pfizer is preparing to lose most of the $11.4 billion in 2009
sales for Lipitor, the top-selling medicine, starting next year
when cheaper copies enter the market from companies such as
Teva. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, based in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva, was the
fund&#8217;s biggest holding when it started four years ago, and
comprised as much as 15 percent of its holdings until Sphera
sold the shares in 2008. The drugmaker in January told investors
it&#8217;s aiming to more than double sales to $31 billion by 2015,
and last month agreed to buy Germany&#8217;s Ratiopharm GmbH,
snatching it away from Pfizer in an auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Sphera missed out on Teva&#8217;s last rally, the company&#8217;s
American depositary receipts probably won&#8217;t budge much from
about $65 in the next several months, said Hershkovitz. Teva has
advanced 41 percent in the past year to close yesterday at
$63.51 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Looking back I think of course we could have done it
differently,&#8221; the fund manager said. &#8220;Right now, if you look
long term, you can find opportunities that are 20 percent to 30
percent cheaper.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi-Aventis SA is one of them, he said. The fund added
to its stake in the Paris-based company this year as the shares
slumped on the prospect of a generic competitor in the U.S. to
Sanofi&#8217;s Lovenox anti-clotting drug, he said. Sanofi fell from a
52-week high of 58.90 euros on Jan. 20 to as low as 51.68 euros
two weeks later after Novartis AG said Jan. 22 it planned to
sell a version of the drug as soon as it obtains U.S. Food and
Drug Administration approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sell-off wiped 9.52 billion euros ($12.7 billion) off
Sanofi&#8217;s market capitalization, more than Lovenox contributes in
earnings, he said. &#8220;The stock grossly overreacted,&#8221; said
Hershkovitz. Sanofi now sells for 8.5 times this year&#8217;s
estimated earnings, compared with an average price-earnings
ratio of 11 for the 10 largest drugmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sphera added to its stake in Pfizer and Sanofi this year
after selling U.S. drugmaker Merck  Co. when shares peaked
above $40 in January, Hershkovitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve percent of the fund is in Basel, Switzerland-based
Novartis, which Sphera regards as the &#8220;best-managed company in
our universe,&#8221; said Hershkovitz. Ten percent is invested in
Novartis&#8217;s cross-town competitor Roche Holding AG, which he said
has the best science. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California-based biotechnology companies Onyx
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and NeurogesX Inc. account for about 9
percent of the fund. Onyx is working with Germany&#8217;s Bayer AG on
the tumor-fighting drug Nexavar, while NeurogesX is developing a
pain-treating patch. The fund views both companies as takeover
targets, Hershkovitz said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ali Hedayat, co-head in the Americas
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s largest internal hedge fund, has
left the firm, the second senior departure from the unit in less
than a month, said three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedayat&#8217;s departure follows last month&#8217;s exit by Pierre
Henri Flamand, who ran the Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies
division from London. Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs
in New York, declined to comment. Hedayat, 35, who was promoted
to managing director in October 2006, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, generates about 10 percent of its revenue from
proprietary trading, or bets with the firm&#8217;s own money, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar has said. Goldman Sachs Principal
Strategies, a unit within the firm&#8217;s equities division,
rebounded from losses in 2008 to fuel the firm&#8217;s 7 percent gain
in equity revenue to $9.89 billion in 2009, according to the
company&#8217;s earnings report in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principal strategies seeks to profit from discrepancies in
relative values of financial instruments, convertible bonds and
&#8220;various types of volatility trading,&#8221; according to the
report. In early 2008, a group of traders from principal
strategies led by Raanan Agus and Kenneth Ebert created a $7
billion hedge fund called Goldman Sachs Investment Partners and
became part of Goldman Sachs Asset Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flamand, 39, is setting up his own hedge fund and a Goldman
Sachs executive in London said last month that the firm supports
Flamand&#8217;s plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedayat, who graduated from McGill University in Montreal
in 1996 with a double major in finance and economics, started at
Goldman Sachs in 1997 as a financial analyst covering Latin
American markets. He joined the principal strategies group in
2000 and moved to the London office in 2002, before returning to
New York in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Iusacell SA, Mexico&#8217;s third-
largest wireless carrier, applied to bid in a government auction
for the use of fiber-optic lines, aiming to boost competition
with Telefonos de Mexico SAB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell would face a coalition formed by Grupo Televisa
SA, Telefonica SA and Megacable Holdings SAB, which said last
month they would bid jointly. The group and Iusacell were the
only registrants for the auction, according to a document
published yesterday by the Communications and Transportation
Ministry. Auction results are scheduled for June 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fiber lines will give the winning bidder a way to route
long-distance phone and Internet traffic across Mexico without
having to contract with Telmex, the nation&#8217;s largest land-line
phone carrier. The lines are owned by Comision Federal de
Electricidad, the state-run power utility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telmex, controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, is the only
provider of long-haul telecommunications traffic services in
some parts of Mexico. The Comision Federal de Electricidad also
provides the service in some areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iusacell gained 66 centavos, or 1.4 percent, to 49.66 pesos
at 4 p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading. The company,
whose majority shareholder is billionaire Ricardo Salinas,
trails Slim&#8217;s America Movil SAB and Telefonica in Mexican
wireless subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the largest computer-services provider, is offering
financing to partners of Sun Microsystems Inc., the server-
computer maker acquired by IBM rival Oracle Corp. this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As much as $500 million will be available for Sun partners
who switch to selling IBM systems -- integrated servers,
software and storage -- to their clients, Armonk, New York-based
IBM said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has won over some Sun resellers and is trying to get
more with the financing perk, said Bernie Spang, IBM&#8217;s director
of strategy for information-management software. The company had
sought to buy Sun last year, according to people familiar with
the matter. That bid dissolved after the companies disagreed on
price and terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The goal of this effort is to sweeten the pot,&#8221; Spang
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deborah Hellinger, a spokeswoman for Oracle, didn&#8217;t respond
to an e-mail seeking comment. The company completed its purchase
of Sun in January for about $7.4 billion. IBM trails Microsoft
Corp. and Oracle in software sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM also unveiled a new system that helps analyze data 20
times faster for industries such as finance and health care.
Last quarter, the company introduced its new Power7 systems,
which are tailored for specific projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 8 cents to $129.01 at 2:14 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares had fallen 1.5 percent
this year before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, denied it bet
against clients in the mortgage-derivatives market and said it
was &#8220;grateful&#8221; for government assistance in the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although Goldman Sachs held various positions in
residential mortgage-related products in 2007, our short
positions were not a &#8216;bet against&#8217; our clients,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and President Gary Cohn wrote
in a letter introducing the firm&#8217;s annual report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has been criticized for its role in the
subprime mortgage-securities market and as a trading partner to
American International Group Inc., the insurer bailed out by the
U.S. government. Harris Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate
reputations found that 60 percent of respondents gave Goldman
Sachs negative ratings for &#8220;ethical standards.&#8221; Only AIG,
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac scored lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs posted $11.6 billion profit for fiscal 2007,
a record at the time, aided by bets that the subprime mortgage
market would decline even as clients continued to purchase the
securities. U.S. home prices have slumped 28 percent from their
all-time high in July 2006, spurring the worst recession since
the 1930s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm did not generate enormous net revenues or
profits by betting against residential mortgage-related
products,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote. &#8220;Our relatively early
risk reduction resulted in our losing less money than we
otherwise would have when the residential housing market began
to deteriorate rapidly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxpayer Aid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm received $10 billion of taxpayer
aid in the credit crisis, which it repaid in June. That money
led politicians and pundits to blame Goldman Sachs for profiting
from taxpayers. Labor unions led protests calling for bonus
payments to be canceled, and a Rolling Stone magazine writer
last year labeled the firm a &#8220;great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity&#8221; and criticized it for selling
securities backed by subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs is grateful for the indispensible role
governments played and we recognize that our firm and our
shareholders benefitted from it,&#8221; Blankfein and Cohn wrote.
&#8220;It is impossible to know what would have happened to the
financial system absent concerted government action around the
world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said AIG&#8217;s bailout in 2008 helped the bank
and every other financial institution, because the insurer&#8217;s
collapse would have been &#8220;extremely&#8221; disruptive to financial
markets, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $182.3 billion bailout ensured that Goldman Sachs and
other counterparties were repaid in full. Much of the $12.9
billion Goldman Sachs received from the insurer&#8217;s rescue was
paid out to meet AIG-related &#8216;obligations,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had &#8220;minimal&#8221; economic exposure to AIG
after it demanded collateral and insured against a default
through the credit default swaps market, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bullish
McDonald&#8217;s Corp. options because they are at near record lows
and the world&#8217;s largest restaurant company may rally on
stronger-than-estimated earnings and a smoothie introduction,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists John Marshall and Maria
Grant recommended purchasing June $70 call options to buy the
shares, which slipped 0.3 percent to $67.81 yesterday to pare
this year&#8217;s gain to 8.6 percent. Implied volatility, the key
gauge of options prices, is 15.76 for three-month contracts,
near its record low of 15.03 on March 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Potentially strong April earnings and a national smoothie
launch in May are drivers for upside,&#8221; the strategists wrote.
The product &#8220;should be rolled out nationwide by Memorial Day,
potentially creating volatility in May.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based strategists cited Goldman analyst Steven
Kron, who recommends buying the shares and says they may advance
on accelerating profit margin gains and lower commodity prices.
Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald&#8217;s may report first-quarter
profit excluding some items of 96 cents a share, the average of
17 estimates in a Bloomberg survey, when it releases results

&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank,
hired Robert Kissell of JPMorgan Chase  Co. to customize
clients&#8217; stock trading programs and help evaluate their
strategies for buying and selling shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissell joined UBS&#8217;s client trading and execution team to
advise asset managers and institutional investors on selecting
algorithms, according to an internal memo sent to clients
yesterday. He will work with the firm&#8217;s direct execution and
portfolio trading groups to assess transaction costs and help
construct and rebalance clients&#8217; holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, like rival banks, is expanding its line of electronic
trading products and building algorithms in multiple asset
classes to help clients execute transactions more easily.
Citigroup Inc. said last week that it&#8217;s overhauling its platform
of trading strategies in an attempt to grow its share of U.S.
equities from 14 percent. Trading algorithms are computer
programs that automatically execute orders based on the goals of
investors and the characteristics of a given stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Smith, a New York-based spokeswoman for UBS,
confirmed the contents of the memo. JPMorgan spokesman Brian
Marchiony didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissell, an executive director, reports to Tim Gee,
Americas head of equities sales trading, and Owain Self, head of
algorithmic trading for the U.S. and Europe, Middle East and
Africa. He will work in New York and Stamford, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissell spent six years at JPMorgan, where he was head of
quantitative trading strategies, the memo said. Before that he
held similar jobs at Citigroup and Instinet Inc., the New York-
based broker and operator of electronic markets including dark
pools. He is writing a book on transaction cost analysis and co-
wrote &#8220;Optimal Trading Strategies&#8221; with Morton Glantz. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s railway fund
is betting on U.S. freight companies such as Union Pacific Corp.,
CSX Corp. and Norfolk Southern Corp., following Warren Buffett&#8217;s
decision to take over Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 138 billion yen ($1.5 billion) JPM Global Railway Stock
Fund expects the companies to benefit from a move to carrying
goods by rail instead of roads to reduce fuel costs and
pollution, said Peter Kirkman, the fund&#8217;s lead portfolio manager.
Railroads burn less diesel than trucks for each ton of cargo
carried, giving operators a fuel-efficiency advantage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Government policy will continue to move toward
environmental concerns,&#8221; Kirkman, who works for J.P. Morgan
Investment Management Inc., said in a telephone interview from
New York yesterday. &#8220;Moving freight by train rather than road
is highly advantageous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Purchasing stakes in the U.S. rail companies has helped the
fund gain 11 percent in value since its January start and beat
the advances in Japan&#8217;s Topix Index and the Nikkei 225 Stock
Average. The fund, which has 19.8 percent of its holdings in the
U.S., was started Jan. 26 and is sold only in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. rail&#8217;s prospects spurred Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. last year to agree to spend $27 billion to buy 77.4 percent
of Burlington Northern it didn&#8217;t own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama earlier this year granted $8 billion
for 13 high-speed train corridors across the U.S., including a
portion to improve existing rail lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economic Rebound &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Pacific, the U.S. railroad with the biggest
locomotive fleet, is predicting growth in freight this year amid
more demand for transporting commodities as the U.S. economy
returned to growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North American railroad volume, considered a leading
indicator for economic conditions, has gained 1.5 percent in the
year to March 27, according to the Association of American
Railroads, rebounding from a 16.2 percent slump last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are only four major players and so it&#8217;s a fairly
small market,&#8221; Kirkman said. &#8220;Freight transport will continue
to grow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Union Pacific fell 0.2 percent to $73.64 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday. It has gained 15 percent
this year. CSX has gained 8.2 percent this year while Norfolk
Southern has advanced 9.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund doesn&#8217;t have a benchmark. Its gains compare with an
8.7 percent increase in the Topix index and a 9.5 percent
advance in the Nikkei 225 Stock Average. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s head of
environmental commodities including carbon emissions, Gerrit
Nicholas, has left the firm, according to a bank official
briefed on the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Sberlati, a vice president at the New York-based
securities firm, will become head of North American
environmental commodities, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced. Goldman
Sachs spokesman Melissa Daly declined to comment. Nicholas
couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks including Goldman Sachs, London-based Barclays Plc
and JPMorgan Chase  Co. have been monitoring negotiations on
U.S. climate-change legislation, which stalled in the Senate,
dampening prospects for a &#8220;cap-and-trade&#8221; market for carbon-
dioxide emissions. The firms are seeking to play a key role in
any new nationwide system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon allowances in a smaller trading program running in
10 Northeastern states fell 41 percent in 2009 and 7.4 percent
this year. The decline reflects, in part, uncertainty about the
outcome of climate-change talks, said Kedin Kilgore, named in
January to head Barclays Capital&#8217;s carbon-trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There isn&#8217;t enough guidance out of D.C. to know if we
will have a confirmed trading program this year and whether a
federal program will fully supersede any regional program,&#8221;
Kilgore, head of U.S. emissions trading at Barclays unit, said
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. carbon market has the potential to surge to more
than $300 billion by 2020, according to Point Carbon, an Oslo-
based firm that analyzes environmental markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co., the
lender to the owners of Florida&#8217;s Sawgrass Marriott Resort,
asked a bankruptcy court for permission to take over and sell
the company&#8217;s assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman yesterday asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Paul M. Glenn
in Jacksonville, Florida, to lift the automatic stay, a part of
the bankruptcy code that shields a company from creditors&#8217;
efforts to collect on its assets. Goldman Sachs Mortgage is a
division of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, owed about $193 million, claims the company no
longer has a stake in the property and can&#8217;t restructure its
debts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The resort property that is the subject of this
bankruptcy is worth less than the amount of the debt, and there
is clearly no equity in the property,&#8221; lawyers for the lender
said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RQB Resort LP, which filed bankruptcy March 1 to stop a
prior foreclosure action by Goldman, owns the 65-acre resort in
Ponte Vedra Beach that is home to the TPC Sawgrass golf club
where the U.S. PGA Tour&#8217;s Players Championship is held, court
papers show. Affiliate RQB Development also sought protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2006, Goldman helped finance RQB Resort and RQB
Development&#8217;s $220.5 million purchase of the property, court
papers show. RQB representatives met Goldman in March 2009 and
said that they might have &#8220;liquidity issues&#8221; by August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negotiation Effort &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, the owners hired Perella Weinberg Partners LP to
broker a solution with Goldman. After almost three months of
negotiating, the owners believed that Perella had fashioned an
agreement on a restructuring except for one issue, according to
court documents. In October, Goldman told the owners it intended
to foreclose, the resort owner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When asked in early November why the restructuring was no
longer an alternative, Goldman Sachs stated that its management
had changed its mind and preferred to own the resort,&#8221; RQB said
in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RQB Resort is the exclusive partner to the PGA Tour&#8217;s
Tournament Players Club at Sawgrass, known as TPC Sawgrass,
court papers show. The 508-room hotel resort has rights to
85 percent of the starting times each day to the Players Stadium
Course through 2089. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tiger Woods made his Feb. 19 apology for his marital
infidelity at the TPC Sawgrass golf club. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The course was ranked ninth on Golf Digest&#8217;s list of
America&#8217;s 100 Greatest Public Courses for 2009-2010. The TPC
Sawgrass is known for its 17th hole, where World Golf Hall of
Fame architect Peter Dye placed the green on an island in a
small lake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Masters Tournament started today, with Phil Mickelson,
Lee Westwood, Yong-Eun Yang, and 60-year-old Tom Watson tied for
the early lead at 5-under par. Woods, the No. 1 golfer in the
Official World Ranking, is 1-under par through the first 6
holes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re RQB Resort LP, 10-01596, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Middle District of Florida (Jacksonville). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest

Property Consultants Inc. seeking a ruling that it doesn&#8217;t
infringe four U.S. patents for computer power-management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft also alleges the
patents, awarded since 1998, are not valid and asks a federal
judge in Wilmington, Delaware, to stop St. Clair from saying the
Microsoft Windows operating system uses the inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of consolidated lawsuits filed in the same court
last year, Grosse Pointe, Michigan-based St. Clair &#8220;clearly
identified the Windows Power Manager&#8221; as using the technology,
Microsoft lawyers said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s complaint, filed yesterday, relates to patent-
infringement actions filed by St. Clair in May 2009 against
computer makers including Acer Inc. and Dell Inc.; and in
September 2009 against Apple Inc. and Toshiba Corp., according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of St. Clair weren&#8217;t immediately available to

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Financiero BBVA Bancomer SA,
Mexico&#8217;s biggest lender, hired Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to arrange meetings with bond investors,
according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mexico City-based bank plans to hold the meetings from
today through April 15, said the person, who declined to be
identified because he isn&#8217;t authorized to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBVA Bancomer may be seeking to borrow money to fund an
increase in lending, said Pierre-Alexandre Pechmeze, a Paris-
based analyst at Oddo  Cie. The lender last sold debt March 25,
issuing 2.9 billion pesos ($236 million) of five-year, floating-
rate notes in three tranches, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They want to grow their own book,&#8221; Pechemeze said.
&#8220;They are counting on a recovery in the Mexican economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BBVA Bancomer is a unit of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria
SA, Spain&#8217;s second-biggest bank. Bancomer&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Ron Burkle&#8217;s Yucaipa
Cos. offered $600 million for Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s Miramax studio,
according to a person with knowledge of the bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Yucaipa is successful, brothers Harvey and Bob
Weinstein, filmmakers who founded Miramax, would manage the
studio and its 700-movie library, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alec and Tom Gores also bid for Miramax, said two people
with knowledge of the situation. The brothers, both private-
equity billionaires, were considering an offer in the $500
million range, one of the people said last month. Disney said in
February it was seeking bids for the studio. The company is
telling suitors $650 million is the least it will consider,
according to two people involved in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Los Angeles Times reported yesterday that Miramax had
received three offers including $600 million from Burkle and
$650 million from Hollywood film producer David Bergstein, the
highest of the bids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bergstein is advising a &#8220;well-capitalized offshore
entity&#8221; on a Miramax bid, a spokesman for his Pangea Media
Group, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burkle wasn&#8217;t available to comment. The Gores also couldn&#8217;t
be reached. Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman for the Weinstein Co.
in New York, didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call seeking
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankruptcy Petition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Burbank, California-based
Disney, didn&#8217;t return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, rose 26 cents to
$35.58 at 12:36 P.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares had gained 9.5 percent this year before
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bergstein faces an involuntary bankruptcy petition. U.S.
bankruptcy Judge Barry Russell on March 30 appointed an interim
trustee to oversee assets that include THINKfilm LLC and London-
based Capitol Films, among other companies he controls, Variety
reported at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sale of Bergstein&#8217;s film libraries was halted in March
when creditors, including the Screen Actors Guild, the Directors
Guild of America and the Writers Guild of America, filed an
involuntary bankruptcy petition, the trade magazine reported.
Pangea is not named in the bankruptcy case, the spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
the country&#8217;s biggest lenders may end a push to boost their
share of the mortgage market as wholesale funding for the loans
becomes scarcer and business credit demand recovers, according
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Fujitsu Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resumption of business credit growth by 2011 means
Australian banks will have to prioritize lending and allocate
more funds to companies rather than home buyers, according to
the semiannual JPMorgan/Fujitsu Australia Mortgage Industry
Report released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nations&#8217; top four banks -- Commonwealth Bank of
Australia, Westpac Banking Corp., Australia  New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. and National Australia Bank Ltd. -- used the
financial crisis to extend mortgage market dominance as smaller
lenders struggled to obtain credit. The banks have increased
their share of local mortgages to 76 percent from 65 percent
before the tightening of global credit, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Australian major banks will look to achieve the best
possible returns on the increasingly scarce wholesale funding,&#8221;
Scott Manning, a Sydney-based analyst at JPMorgan, said in the
report. &#8220;The banks may find themselves happy with the size of
their current housing portfolio and look to optimize
profitability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual mortgage lending growth, which peaked at 21 percent
in 2003, is likely to stay at 8 percent for a third year in 2010,
according to today&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CA Inc. Chairman Bill McCracken
summoned five board members to Manhattan in June and laid out a
plan to revamp the software maker through acquisitions, jumping
into a market that may pit him against his old bosses at
International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten months later, McCracken, now also chief executive
officer, has led more than $600 million in purchases, adding
technology that can help retailers monitor sales data online or
hospitals move patient information to external servers. He says
such software will be adopted by the entire industry as
companies outsource storage to lower costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to stop this train -- it&#8217;s going to
happen,&#8221; McCracken, 67, said in an interview this week. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet my career on it. I&#8217;ll bet my reputation on it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are taking notice. Big holders like T. Rowe Price
Group Inc. and State Street Corp. have boosted their stakes and
analyst Katherine Egbert at Jefferies  Co. said CA is &#8220;getting
interesting&#8221; for the first time in years. The market for these
types of &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; applications may triple to $150
billion by 2013, according to Gartner Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a clear strategy, it&#8217;s aggressive,&#8221; said San
Francisco-based Egbert, who rates the shares &#8220;buy&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t
own any herself. &#8220;They&#8217;re attacking a big space.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Onus of Proof&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That space will present challenges. Islandia, New York-
based CA will face increasing competition as IBM, the biggest
computer-services provider, paves its own way into the market.
IBM, which spends 10 times as much on research as CA and has
more than four times more cash, makes its own cloud-computing
platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have competitors in the cloud space, but we like our
hand,&#8221; said Jen Knecht, a spokeswoman for IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s hard to determine who will lead the market because the
business is still nascent, said Shaul Eyal, an analyst at
Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The onus of proof is undoubtedly on Bill McCracken,&#8221; said
Eyal, who has a &#8220;market perform&#8221; rating on CA stock and doesn&#8217;t
own it. &#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be easy, but they can effectively
compete in this market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CA can win customers by being the &#8220;neutral&#8221; vendor not
attached to hardware, said McCracken, who spent more than three
decades at IBM. The CEO said he&#8217;s &#8220;constantly, obsessively and
maniacally&#8221; controlling costs to keep the company competitive,
as evidenced by this week&#8217;s announcement of 1,000 job cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron Speech &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cost controls have allowed McCracken to focus on
acquisitions to build the cloud business. The company will
unveil new cloud programs, the result of integrating its
purchases, next month at CA World, a convention it holds every
18 months, McCracken said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He invited director James Cameron to keynote the event,
tying his vision for a new type of moviemaking -- using a 3-D
camera for &#8220;Avatar,&#8221; -- with CA&#8217;s plans for a new type of
business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have the right strategy. We&#8217;re convinced. Now it&#8217;s a
matter of having to do it,&#8221; said McCracken, who&#8217;s been CA&#8217;s
chairman since 2007. He became CEO after John Swainson retired
at the end of last year. CA still sees growth in selling
software for mainframe computers, McCracken said. The company
trails only Armonk, New York-based IBM in that market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CA has gained 2.1 percent this year, compared with a 7.1
percent increase in the SP 500 Index. CA rose 8 cents to $22.94
at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;T. Rowe Buy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last quarter of 2009, State Street added more than 1
million CA shares to its holdings and T. Rowe bought 7 million,
according to regulatory filings. Arlene Roberts, a State Street
spokeswoman, declined to comment. Tom Watson, a T. Rowe analyst,
said the firm&#8217;s investment is based on CA&#8217;s cost controls,
management and growth opportunities like cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve been working for a long time to improve the
business from the bottom up,&#8221; said Watson, who is in Baltimore.
&#8220;It makes me think it&#8217;s probably a pretty good investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies are moving toward storing and accessing data
through servers over the Internet, eliminating the cost of
maintaining their own. Rather than building the platform where
companies store their data, CA is creating software that helps
automate and monitor the move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an urgency within CA that I&#8217;ve never seen before,&#8221;
said Chris O&#8217;Malley, a 23-year CA veteran tapped by McCracken to
head up the cloud-computing division. &#8220;It&#8217;s exciting for CA not
to be the sleepy vendor that follows the markets but to be the
aggressive vendor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Little Bit Disruptive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3Tera Inc., which CA bought last month, helps companies
move applications on and off external servers. Terms of that
deal weren&#8217;t disclosed. CA announced last month it would pay for
$350 million for Nimsoft Inc., which helps customers monitor
applications on servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCracken declined to comment on future acquisitions,
except to reiterate that the company would spend at least $300
million on purchases in growth markets like cloud computing or
security software in the current fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition spree &#8220;shows tremendous vision,&#8221; Nimsoft
CEO Gary Read said. &#8220;Of course it still needs to be executed
over the next few years. You have to be a little bit disruptive
today in the market and sometimes your own business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GSW Immobilien AG, a German property
company owned by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Cerberus Capital
Management LP, aims to raise about 140 million euros ($187
million) in an initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berlin-based joint venture will offer as much as 15
percent on top of the base amount, according to terms of the
deal obtained by Bloomberg News. Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank
AG are managing the sale, which is scheduled for the second
quarter, as joint global coordinators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company aims for a free float of at least 49.9 percent
of the stock after the IPO in a primary and secondary share
sale. The amount to be raised from the secondary offering has
yet to be confirmed, according to the term sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering comes after German companies raised 1.7
billion euros from IPOs in March, the biggest amount since July
2007, Bloomberg data show. Kabel Deutschland Holding AG, the
country&#8217;s largest cable company, sold 759 million euros of stock
and chemicals distributor Brenntag AG raised 748 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GSW was sold by the city of Berlin to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
Whitehall Funds unit and Cerberus, the U.S. investment fund, for
almost 2 billion euros in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s 49,700 properties have space of about 3.1
million square meters (33.4 million square feet) and were valued
at about 2.6 billion euros at the end of last year, according to
a statement today. GSW also manages another 17,000 homes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wi-Lan Inc., the Ottawa-based owner
of patents for wireless technology, sued Apple Inc., the maker
of the iPad tablet, and 18 other computer and phone makers,
claiming they&#8217;re infringing its Bluetooth patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in Marshall, Texas, April
7, seeks unspecified damages for the alleged patent infringement
and an order to stop the companies from using the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue is patent 5,515,369, which was issued in May 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bluetooth is used to transmit data and voice between
devices like computers and phones without wires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dallas-based McKool Smith PC represents Wi-Lan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman at Cupertino, California-

&lt;p&gt;Other defendants include Motorola Inc. and Dell Inc.
Jennifer Erickson, a spokeswoman at Schaumburg, Illinois-based
Motorola and David Frink, a spokesman for Round Rock, Texas-
based, said their companies don&#8217;t comment on pending litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Wi-Lan Inc. v. Acer Inc., 2:10-cv-124, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the second patent-infringement suit Wi-Lan filed in
the past 10 days. On April 1, the company sued Calix Inc. of
Petaluma, California, for infringing two patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calix, a maker of digital subscriber line (DSL) products,
is accused of infringing Wi-Lan&#8217;s 5,956,323 and 6,763,019
patents, which were issued in December 1999 and July 2004
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was also filed in Texas federal court, also by
lawyers from McKool Smith. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Microsoft Sues St. Clair Patent-Licensing Firm &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software maker, sued
patent-holder St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants Inc.
seeking a ruling that it doesn&#8217;t infringe four U.S. patents for
computer power-management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft also alleges the
patents, awarded since 1998, aren&#8217;t valid and asks a federal
judge in Wilmington, Delaware, to stop St. Clair from saying the
Microsoft Windows operating system uses the inventions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of consolidated lawsuits filed in the same court
last year, Grosse Pointe, Michigan-based St. Clair &#8220;clearly
identified the Windows Power Manager&#8221; as using the technology,
Microsoft lawyers said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s complaint, filed yesterday, relates to patent-
infringement actions filed by St. Clair in May 2009 against
computer makers including Acer Inc. and Dell Inc.; and in
September 2009 against Apple Inc. and Toshiba Corp., according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute are patents 5,710,929, 5,758,175, 5,892,959 and
6,079,025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials of St. Clair weren&#8217;t immediately available to

Trademark Office, covers a mobile device with a moving mechanism
that permits the two displays to be &#8220;substantially coplanar.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technology makes it possible for the screens to be
stacked or spread, creating a larger surface for the display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application was filed in April 2009, with the
assistance of the Jianq Chyun Intellectual Property Office of
Taipei. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mattel Seeks Non-Infringement Declaration on PixFusion Patents &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel Inc.&#8217;s Fisher Price has asked a federal court to
declare it&#8217;s not infringing two patents held by a New York
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;El Segundo-based Mattel was sued for patent infringement by
PixFusion in federal court in Texas in December 2009, in which
it was accused of infringing patents 5,623,587 and 6,351,265,
which cover a method of combing electronic images of heads and
bodies. Six other defendants were named in that suit, according
to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the two companies had discussed licensing
arrangements, and counsel for Mattel told PixFusion its products
didn&#8217;t infringe, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California toy company claims that the two patents it&#8217;s
accused of infringing are invalid. In a complaint filed April 7
in federal court in Manhattan, Mattel asked for a court
statement that it&#8217;s not infringing and for a declaration of
invalidity for both patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Mattel asked the court to order PixFusion to
quit claiming the toy company is infringing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mattel is represented by Brian P. Murphy, C. Erik Hawes and
F. Teresa Garcia-Reyes of Philadelphia&#8217;s Morgan Lewis  Bockius
LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Fisher Price Inc. v. PixFusion LLC, 1:10-cv-
03009-UA, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent infringement case is PixFusion  LLC V. Oddcast
Inc., 2:09-cv-00390-TJW, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trademark &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WaMu&#8217;s Gone, Yet Bank&#8217;s Trademark-Acquisition Work Goes On &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though Washington Mutual Inc. was closed by the Office
of Thrift Supervision in September 2008, trademark-acquisition
work for the Seattle-based bank continues, the Seattle Times
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seattle&#8217;s Perkins Cole LLP filed trademark applications
this year on behalf of Washington Mutual for &#8220;The card that
rewards you and your pet&#8221; and &#8220;Your Pet. Your Card. Perfect
Together,&#8221; the Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also is trying to block Lakeland, Florida-based
Magnify Credit Union&#8217;s application to register &#8220;Simplify
banking. Magnify life.&#8221; as a trademark, claiming it&#8217;s too
similar to WaMu&#8217;s &#8220;Simpler banking. More smiles.&#8221; phrase,
according to the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Times reported that bankruptcy-court records reveal
that almost half the $65,575 Perkins Coie billed the bank in
January was for IP work, which the bank said in a statement was
to &#8220;protect and maximize the value of Washington Mutual Inc.&#8217;s
assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida AM Gets $105,000 After &#8216;Orgy&#8217; Video Shows School Logo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University settled a
trademark dispute with the Miami-based operator of an adult-
oriented Web site, United Press International reported
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The school had objected to a video posted on RK Netmedia
Inc.&#8217;s Daredorm.com Web site featuring the school colors and
logo with what appeared to be eight students involved in an
orgy, according to UPI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RK Netmedia paid the school $105,000, apologized, and said
it would &#8220;try to keep the video from further showings,&#8221; the
wire service reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement will be used to pay $15,000 in attorney
fees, with the balance used for scholarships for undergraduates
at the school, according to UPI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Copyright &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed Savers Sued for Infringing &#8216;Fruit, Berry  Nut Inventory&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seed Savers Exchange Inc., the largest non-governmental
seed bank in the U.S., was sued for copyright infringement by a
Michigan writer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kent Whealy of Charlevoix, Michigan, is the author of
&#8220;Fruit, Berry  Nut Inventory,&#8221; and registered the copyright
for the work in March 1990. He accused the seed-savers&#8217; group of
publishing a fourth edition of his work without permission, and
for representing that it owned the copyright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decorah, Iowa-based seed-savers group advertised the
work in its 2010 catalogue, offering it for sale for $24 and
$30, for paperback and hardcover editions, respectively. Whealy
says the seed group lists others&#8217; names as authors, and claims
the copyright to the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This publication is &#8220;substantially similar&#8221; to Whealy&#8217;s
work, and infringes his copyright, he said in the complaint he
filed yesterday in federal court in Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims he&#8217;s suffered damages and &#8220;irreparable harm&#8221;
and asked the court to bar further infringement by the seed-
savers group. Additionally, he seeks an award of money damages
and the profits the seed-savers&#8217; group realized from its alleged
infringement, in addition to attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whealy is represented by Antonio M. Trillo of Reinhart
Boerner Van Deuren SC of Milwaukee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IP Moves &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blank Rome Hires Former Darby  Darby Patent Specialist Lessler &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blank Rome LLP hired Jay P. Lessler for its IP and
technology group, the Philadelphia-based firm said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lessler, who does patent acquisition and litigation, joins
from New York&#8217;s Darby  Darby PC, which said in mid-March it was
closing down. He represents clients with inventions in chemical,
pharmaceutical, and computer software technologies, including
drug delivery systems, polymer chemistry, semiconductors,
preservative systems, nutritional supplements, petrochemicals,
cellulose-based products (such as absorbent materials), and
organic syntheses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree in computer science from
Columbia University, a master&#8217;s degree in chemistry from New
York University and a law degree from Fordham University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. has started testing a
reduced-sugar soft drink in Germany, preparing a second attack
on Bionade GmbH, the organic drinks maker that has rejected
takeover bids from the world&#8217;s largest beverage producer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has been testing consumer reaction to a naturally
fruit-flavored soft drink called Tumult since February in about
40 Alex bar-restaurants owned by British pub operator Mitchells
 Butlers Plc. A 0.33-liter bottle of Tumult costs 2.80 euros
($3.72), 20 cents more than a bottle of Fanta or Coke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tumult is Coca-Cola&#8217;s second swipe at Bionade, which with a
6 percent market share is Germany&#8217;s third-largest non-cola soft
drink brand behind Coke&#8217;s Fanta and Sprite. Coca-Cola in 2008
introduced Spirit of Georgia, with &#8220;less sugar and carbonic
acid&#8221; than rival sodas, according to its Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tumult is addressing adult consumers, and we will examine
the drink&#8217;s acceptance in the coming months,&#8221; said Kristina
Brehm, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola in Germany. The drink hasn&#8217;t
been officially announced, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has made approaches to buy Bionade, according to
the company&#8217;s co-owner and Chief Executive Officer Peter
Kowalsky. The Atlanta-based beverage producer made an offer
worth &#8220;hundreds of millions,&#8221; he said in an interview in 2007.
Dr. August Oetker KG, the family company that owns Germany&#8217;s
largest brewery, bought a majority stake in Bionade last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brehm declined to comment about offers for Bionade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirit of Georgia &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirit of Georgia had less than 1 percent market share last
year in the German non-cola soft drinks market, which is worth
about 1.3 billion euros ($1.7 billion), according to data
provided by the country&#8217;s industry group for non-alcoholic
beverages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Organic soft drinks have shown an above-average growth
pace in the past and I expect the segment to continue growing in
the future,&#8221; Detlef Gross, head of the industry group, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bionade&#8217;s drinks are made through a fermentation process
that generates gluconic acid, which is found naturally in honey
and fruit, rather than alcohol, according to the company&#8217;s Web
site. Bionade says it uses only natural ingredients, and its
drinks carry the seal of the European Union&#8217;s organic food
control board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bionade is being offered in five different flavors while
Spirit of Georgia is available in three. Tumult, which uses some
fermented ingredients, is currently being sold in a &#8220;fruity&#8221;
and a &#8220;bittersweet&#8221; variety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ostheim, Germany-based Bionade, which was founded in 1985
and had forecast turnover of as many as 230 million bottles in
2009, isn&#8217;t concerned about the potential new competitor,
Kowalsky said. None of the more than 30 rival products on the
German market has lowered its own market share, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bionade, which generates the major part of revenue in its
domestic market, aims to accelerate international expansion, the
executive said. In neighboring Austria, the beverage is being
served in bars and restaurants and is sold in organic grocery
stores. The company is currently hiring vendors in what Kowalsky
calls &#8220;trendsetter cities&#8221; including Barcelona and San
Francisco, where Bionade is available in more than 100 bars. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Senior Federal Reserve officials
had &#8220;serious misgivings&#8221; about allowing the former chairman of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York&#8217;s board to serve while
owning shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a House chairman
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed officials argued against allowing Stephen Friedman
to stay on as chairman while simultaneously investing in Goldman
Sachs before the central bank waived its conflict of interest
policy in January 2009, House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee Chairman Edolphus Towns said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Senior officials had misgivings about granting the waiver
but were overruled,&#8221; Towns, a New York Democrat, and
Representative Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat, said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oversight Committee will schedule a hearing &#8220;to learn
more from Mr. Friedman and senior Fed officials about how he was
permitted to make windfall profits by trading stock in a company
he had a role in regulating,&#8221; the lawmakers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Goldman Sachs opted to become a Fed-supervised bank
in September 2008, the Fed approved a waiver for Friedman to
remain chairman of the New York Fed&#8217;s board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman bought additional stock in Goldman Sachs after
receiving the waiver, drawing criticism from members of Congress
including Towns and Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the
senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. Friedman
resigned the Fed post in May 2009, citing the distraction caused
by the controversy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed changed its policies in November to bar non-bankers
serving as directors of a regional Fed bank from being board
members or employees of a company that owns or is part of a
bank, thrift or credit union. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s March trade deficit is
temporary and the pressure for the yuan to gain remains intact,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weak exports in March were likely due to the Lunar
New Year effects as exporters suspend production for an extended
period after the holiday,&#8221; wrote Hong Kong-based analysts Song
Yu and Helen Qiao in a report on April 10. &#8220;Given the strong
underlying exports growth and rising overheating pressures, we
believe a modest yuan revaluation is still on the agenda.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China posted its first trade deficit in six years in March,
even as the yuan remained pegged to the dollar. Exports gained
24 percent from a year earlier, after climbing 46 percent in
February. Imports jumped 66 percent last month from the same
period last year, compared to a 45 percent increase in February.
This resulted in $7.24 billion shortfall, versus the median
forecast for a $390 million deficit in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s yuan traded at 6.8248 per dollar as of 9:33 a.m. in
Shanghai versus 6.8239 on April 9, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trading System. The central bank has kept the
currency around 6.83 since July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman on April 1 raised its three- and six-month
projections for the yuan to reflect expectations the currency
will be allowed to strengthen this quarter. It predicted the
yuan will appreciate to 6.74 per dollar by the end of June and
6.66 by the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers will probably allow appreciation to resume by
widening the currency&#8217;s trading band versus the dollar to 1
percent, from 0.5 percent, and commencing a &#8220;downward crawl&#8221;
of the central bank&#8217;s reference rate, Goldman said on April 1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tenaga Nasional Bhd., Malaysia&#8217;s
biggest power producer, rose to its highest level in almost two
years after JPMorgan Chase  Co. increased its earnings and
share price estimates on a strengthening ringgit and economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares climbed 2.2 percent to 8.70 ringgit at 10:24 a.m.
local time, set for the highest close since June 6, 2008. The
stock is the second-biggest gainer on the benchmark FTSE Bursa
Malaysia KLCI Index today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher power demand and the strength of the ringgit are
&#8220;positive drivers which we think will cushion the impact from
higher coal prices,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts Simone Yeoh and Edmond
Lee wrote in a report dated April 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan increased its forecast for earnings in the year
ending Aug. 31 by 5 percent and for next year by 7 percent,
while the share price estimate was increased to 10.80 ringgit
from 10.30 ringgit. The ringgit has strengthened 7.4 percent
this year, helping to lower the cost of Tenaga&#8217;s foreign
currency debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-controlled Tenaga is benefiting from a recovery in
power demand after Southeast Asia&#8217;s third-largest economy
emerged from its first recession in a decade in the last quarter.
The economy may expand by between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent
this year after contracting 1.7 percent in 2009, Bank Negara
Malaysia said in its annual report on March 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenaga expects electricity demand to increase as much as 7
percent for the year ending Aug. 31, the JPMorgan analysts said.
JPMorgan increased its 2010 economic growth forecast to as much
as 7.7 percent, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, is courting
endowment heads to join its asset-management group, according to
three people with knowledge of the search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company started approaching chief investment officers
at endowments, as well as money managers that oversee such
assets, late last year, said the people, who declined to be
identified because the search isn&#8217;t public. The bank is looking
to expand its portfolio-solutions team of 50 employees, which
invests on behalf of clients and works on asset allocation,
portfolio construction and manager selection, said Andrea
Raphael, a spokeswoman for the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When they hire a CIO, not only can they then sell their
product better, but that gives them internal knowledge,&#8221;
Charles Skorina, whose headhunting firm Charles A. Skorina  Co.
in San Francisco advises endowments, said in an interview last
week. &#8220;This guy comes into Goldman and the Goldman guys say,
&#8216;OK, what kind of products does an endowment need and how should
we structure our products so we can go and sell a complete
set?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacific Investment Management Co. and Perella Weinberg
Partners have added or expanded asset-management services for
endowments as they recover from record losses during the
financial crisis. U.S. institutions will outsource more than
half a trillion dollars in investments by the end of 2012,
according to estimates by consultant Casey Quirk  Associates
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate Search &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portfolio-solutions group is part of Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, catering to endowments, foundations, public
and corporate pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, family
offices and insurance firms, Raphael said. Chris Kojima and
Charles Baillie, partners at the firm, run the group. The asset-
management unit also serves those clients through its fund-of-
funds group, which invests about $80 billion in outside firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm approached candidates through headhunter Charles
Sterling Group LLC in Boston, said two of the people, who had
been contacted and turned down the job. The bank has talked with
candidates from pension funds, endowments and other asset
managers, according to another person familiar with the search.
Raphael declined to comment on the firm&#8217;s recruiting efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. institutions will probably outsource $510 billion in
investments by the end of 2012, more than double the $195
billion as of the most recent data at the end of 2008, according
to Casey Quirk of Darien, Connecticut. Investors most likely to
use outsourcing services are those with $250 million to $750
million in assets, which struggle to find talent and can&#8217;t
access the best investment strategies, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yale&#8217;s Swensen &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It costs about $2 million to $3 million a year to maintain
an investment office with five employees, compared with a fee of
50 basis points on assets under management in a typical
outsourced agreement, Skorina said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endowments outperformed market indexes for years by
following a style pioneered by David Swensen, Yale University&#8217;s
investment chief. The strategy relies on so-called alternative
assets including commodities, real estate and private equity to
outperform market indexes. Some of those hard-to-sell holdings
fell more than public stocks and bonds in the year ending June
2009, leaving endowments with losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investing in alternatives and alternatives being a much
bigger allocation of portfolios has been a big driver in the
interest in outsourcing,&#8221; said Kevin Quirk, a partner at Casey
Quirk. Losses from some alternative investments &#8220;brought into
question whether or not these things are sustainable for the
long term,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rate Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top endowments used outsourcing firms in the 1960s and
1970s, which were &#8220;generally disasters,&#8221; said Josh Lerner, a
Harvard Business School professor who wrote a case study on
Yale&#8217;s endowment. The New Haven, Connecticut school, which
helped to found Endowment Management and Research Corp. in
Boston, fired the manager in 1979 after the institution&#8217;s fund
had dropped 46 percent since 1969 on an inflation-adjusted
basis, according to Lerner&#8217;s research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The intermediaries tended to take a very short-run view
or else engaged in activities that were beneficial for their own
account trading or client development but were detrimental to
the long-run returns of their university clients,&#8221; Lerner said
in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forst &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more than 20 years, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Citigroup Inc. sold swaps as a way for schools, towns and
nonprofit organizations to reduce interest costs and protect
against rising payments on variable-rate debt. In 2008, the
value of Harvard&#8217;s interest-rate swaps tumbled and its endowment
plunged, forcing the school to raise $2.5 billion in bonds that
December as it was squeezed for collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edward Forst, who rejoined Goldman Sachs in September after
11 months helping to oversee finances at Harvard University in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, became co-head of the firm&#8217;s
investment-management division at the end of February with Tim
O&#8217;Neill. Before he left for Harvard, Forst had spent less than a
year helping to run Goldman&#8217;s investment-management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset management, which oversees funds for institutions and
wealthy individuals, is a smaller department at Goldman Sachs
than investment banking and trading. The division&#8217;s 2009 revenue
of $3.97 billion accounted for 8.8 percent of the firm&#8217;s sales.
Revenue at the unit fell 13 percent from 2008 as incentive and
management fees declined. Assets under management climbed 12
percent from a year earlier to $871 billion as rising markets
more than offset fund withdrawals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco Additions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The division doubled its third-party distribution sales
force last year and &#8220;significantly&#8221; increased its coverage of
institutional and private wealth accounts, according to the
firm&#8217;s annual letter to shareholders April 7. The unit serves
2,000 institutional clients and more than 25,000 private wealth
accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco, led by Mohamed El-Erian, the former Harvard fund
chief, last month hired Gregory Hazlett as head of equity
strategies and Andrew Hoffmann to oversee real-asset
investments. They report to Mark Taborsky, an executive vice
president at the firm and former Harvard endowment manager.
Taborsky leads a fund-of-funds unit, based on the alternative-
investing model of endowments, targeting school funds and other
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campus Recruits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other asset managers have recruited chief investment
officers from schools. Perella Weinberg in New York hired
Christopher Bittman, former CIO of the University of Colorado
Foundation, in July to lead a unit that manages money for
endowments. David Russ, a former manager of Dartmouth College&#8217;s
fund, was hired in June at Zurich-based Credit Suisse Group AG
as a chief investment strategist in asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A number of higher-education money managers have left
academia to start their own firms. They include Jack Meyer, who
stepped down from his Harvard Management Co. chief executive
officer post in 2005 to form Convexity Capital Management LP in
Boston with $6.3 billion from clients, and ex-Stanford
Management Co. head Michael McCaffery, who raised $7 billion
from investors including Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen
to start Makena Capital Management LLC in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University funds lost an average of 19 percent in the year
ending June 2009, according to the National Association of
College and University Business Officers, based in Washington,
and Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut. It was the biggest annual
loss in the 35 years for which records have been kept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endowment Turnover &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tumbling endowments has come turnover in the ranks of
managers who oversee the funds. Dartmouth College in Hanover,
New Hampshire, Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts,
and New York University in Manhattan didn&#8217;t immediately fill CIO
positions as they reviewed spending. Wesleyan University in
Middletown, Connecticut, fired CIO Thomas Kannam in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Walsh of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York,
announced plans in February to step down at the end of the
academic year. Christopher Brightman resigned last month from
the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Stanford
University&#8217;s endowment, the third-richest among U.S. colleges,
is searching for a chief investment officer after leaving the
post vacant for more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. introduced a line
of mobile phones today that are focused on social-networking
features to win over teens and young adults who have flocked to
devices from Apple Inc. and Google Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Called Kin One and Kin Two, the phones will be made by
Sharp Corp. and sold in the U.S. by Verizon Wireless starting in
May, Microsoft said in a statement. Microsoft President Robbie
Bach, who oversees the mobile-phone unit, demonstrated the
phones today at an event in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phones represent a new strategy for Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft, which previously had only developed
software for phone manufacturers, rather than getting deeply
into hardware design itself. The move echoes Google&#8217;s decision
to sell the Nexus One handset in addition to offering phone
makers its Android operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We said, &#8216;Look, there&#8217;s a segment here that we can really
go after deeply,&#8221; Bach said today in an interview with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;And once you decide to go deep, you
can&#8217;t go part way and say we&#8217;ll do the software and then we&#8217;ll
hand it off to somebody else. You have to really be involved in
the whole process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kin phones will be available in Germany, Italy, Spain
and the U.K. in the fall from Vodafone Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may develop phone hardware for other segments of
the market in the future, said Todd Peters, vice president in
the company&#8217;s mobile communications marketing group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners or Competitors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk in the strategy is that phone makers who view
Microsoft and Google as partners see these moves as competition,
making them less likely to want to use Microsoft&#8217;s or Google&#8217;s
operating systems, ABI Research analyst Kevin Burden said. Bach
said in January that it would be &#8220;very, very difficult&#8221; for
Google to sell its own phone while keeping manufacturers and
carriers for other Android handsets happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bach said Microsoft&#8217;s approach is different than Google&#8217;s,
because Google sells the Nexus One itself, while Microsoft is
relying on Verizon and Vodafone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They can get away with it because they&#8217;re not selling it
themselves,&#8221; ABI&#8217;s Burden said of Microsoft. &#8220;It looks really
different because they didn&#8217;t set up their own Web site store
for it like Google.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 2 cents to $30.32 at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares are little changed this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social-Networking Sites &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kin phones include cameras, touch screens and slide-out
keyboards for text messaging. The phone takes updates from
social-networking sites such as Twitter, Facebook and MySpace
and displays them in one place on the phone&#8217;s main screen,
called the Kin Loop. Users can drag videos, photos, status
updates, text messages and Web sites to one spot on the phone
and then share the whole package of content with friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokeswoman Melissa Havel declined to disclose
pricing for the phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing market share declines, Microsoft also is releasing a
new version of its phone operating system for handset
manufacturers to use later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Windows dropped to a 7.9 percent share of the
worldwide smartphone-software market in the fourth quarter from
12.5 percent a year earlier, while the iPhone and Android posted
gains, according to ABI Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iPhone took 16.6 percent of the market in the fourth
quarter, up from 10.8 percent the previous year, Oyster Bay, New
York-based ABI said. Android climbed to 8.5 percent from 1.7
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting Young Consumers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Verizon Wireless, based in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, and
U.K.-based Vodafone are targeting young people who will buy
plans for texting and Web access, seeking to expand their
fastest-growing revenue stream. Sales of data plans at Verizon
Wireless rose 46 percent in the fourth quarter, contributing
almost a third of the company&#8217;s wireless-service revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Verizon Wireless kept the Kin&#8217;s target
demographic group in mind at today&#8217;s event, held at a San
Francisco club called Mighty. A rusty truck stood outside
selling sugar waffles. Inside, baristas hired from a local cafe
served up Ethiopian and Brazilian coffee while photos of denim-
and flannel-clad young people flashed on screens around the
room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an age group Microsoft has to court,&#8221; ABI&#8217;s
Burden said. &#8220;They&#8217;re kind of losing this group to Apple and
Google, and what they don&#8217;t want is to have all these late teens
and early 20-somethings not growing up Microsoft.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. book sales will rise 5.8
percent through 2015 as more people buy digital versions for
Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad and Amazon.com Inc.&#8217;s Kindle, even as
traditional book sales drop, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrywide sales will increase to $24.9 billion in 2015
from $23.5 billion this year, Goldman Sachs analyst James
Mitchell said in a report today. E-book sales will jump more
than fourfold in the period to $3.19 billion while print book
sales probably will fall 4.9 percent to $21.7 billion, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple&#8217;s share of the e-book market will surge to 33 percent
in 2015 from 10 percent this year, said Mitchell, who wrote the
report with analysts Ingrid Chung, Fred Krom and Jordan Monahan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com&#8217;s share of the e-book market likely will fall to
28 percent in 2015 from 50 percent this year, and Barnes  Noble
Inc.&#8217;s share will remain at 15 percent from 2012 through 2015
after rising from 5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report by the New York-based analysts doesn&#8217;t include
sales of print books intended for readers in kindergarten
through high school. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple increased 50 cents to $242.29 at 4:30 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have gained 15
percent this year. Amazon.com rose $1.14 to $141.20 in Nasdaq
trading. The shares have increased 5 percent this year. Barnes 
Noble fell 52 cents to $22.25 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The stock has jumped 17 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc.,
the insurer rescued to prevent losses at bank counterparties,
has retired most of its mortgage-linked trades with Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., said a person with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG&#8217;s Financial Products unit wound down credit-default
swaps protecting about $3 billion of mortgage-linked securities,
resulting in $1.5 billion to $2 billion of writedowns last year
for the insurer, said the person, who declined to be identified
because the specific transactions weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swaps were among those excluded from AIG&#8217;s $182.3
billion government bailout, which retired $62.1 billion in
contracts by fully reimbursing banks including Goldman Sachs and
Societe Generale SA. AIG said in February that it expects to
shutter its derivatives unit by year-end and that trades on
about $300 billion to $400 billion in assets will be kept beyond
that date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the Goldman Sachs contracts extinguished last year
were linked to collateralized debt obligations created by the
bank called Abacus and filled with bets on mortgage bonds, the
person said. AIG originally had about $6 billion in Goldman
Sachs trades that weren&#8217;t covered by the rescue. That figure
shrank to $4.3 billion by November 2008. AIG still has about
$1.3 billion in swaps tied to the CDOs, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Products had $770 billion in derivatives at the
end of March, person said. That compares with $940 billion at
the end of 2009 and about $2 trillion at the time of its 2008
bailout. The unit has about 14,400 remaining trades, reduced
from as many as 44,000 before the rescue, the person said. The
retired Abacus trades were reported by the Wall Street Journal
today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wingstop, which had $300 million in revenue last year,
plans to open 60 restaurants in 2010, according to a statement

Aikman is the chicken chain&#8217;s national spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They performed very well through the recession,&#8221; Erik

hopeful that they will continue to perform well,&#8221; he said.
Wingstop has had 27 consecutive quarters of positive same-store

&lt;p&gt;Roark, owner of brands including Carvel ice cream and

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said Japan
Chairman Akio Asuke, a former veteran banker at Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., will step down on June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asuke, 67, will become an adviser starting July 1, the U.S.
bank said in a statement distributed at the Tokyo Stock Exchange
today. He joined Goldman Sachs after resigning as deputy
president at Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp. in June 2002, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asuke&#8217;s departure comes three months after Sumitomo Mitsui
asked Goldman Sachs to convert its preferred shares to an equity
stake. The New York-based firm in 2003 bought 150.3 billion yen
($1.6 billion) of the Sumitomo Mitsui securities to help bolster
capital eroded by losses on holdings and bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs hasn&#8217;t decided who will succeed Asuke or if
the bank will retain the position, said Hiroko Matsumoto, a

&lt;p&gt;Nashville, home of country-music
stars such as Taylor Swift and the Grand Ole Opry, will boost
city-backed debt by almost 40 percent to borrow $633 million for
a new convention center three times the size of the Tennessee
municipality&#8217;s current one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds to be sold tomorrow by Nashville and Davidson
County&#8217;s Convention Center Authority through investment banks
led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. pledge general-fund revenue if
hotel, airport and rental-car taxes and use of the Music City
Center aren&#8217;t enough to repay investors. The tourism revenue
won&#8217;t be adequate, said Councilwoman Emily Evans, a former
municipal bond underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a riverboat gamble with very little upside,&#8221; said
Evans, who worked for 15 years at J.C. Bradford  Co., the
Nashville firm acquired by Paine Webber in 2000. &#8220;It just
doesn&#8217;t seem like a good bet to me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nashville, the home of the Country Music Hall of Fame,
hopes to enhance tourism by creating retail and parking areas,
tripling exhibit space to 350,000 square feet and adding 64,000
square feet of ballrooms, according to the preliminary official
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $415 million Music City Center will enable the city to
compete for larger meetings, add 1,524 jobs and generate almost
$135 million of new annual spending by 2017, according to a
study by HVS Convention, Sports  Entertainment in Chicago on
Jan. 6. The facility is forecast to yield almost $12 million in
new tax revenue beyond tourism levies dedicated to the $40
million-a-year of debt service, said consulting firm HVS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance Down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With convention center attendance down nationwide -- a 30
percent decline in Las Vegas and 28 percent in Orlando, Florida,
two of the largest convention markets in the U.S. -- Nashville&#8217;s
taxpayers may wind up paying part of the cost if use of the new
center falls short, said Heywood Sanders, professor of public
administration at the University of Texas in San Antonio, who
has studied convention centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a leap of faith,&#8221; said Sanders, who&#8217;s writing
a book on convention center financing. &#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty large
chunk of debt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city is selling in four parts, with about $605 million
as taxable Build America Bonds, which come with a 35 percent
subsidy from the U.S. government under economic stimulus
legislation passed last year by Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average yield on Build America securities fell 6 basis
points to a three-week low of 6.17 percent yesterday, according
to the Wells Fargo Build America Bond Index. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism Boost &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A larger convention center is forecast to increase hotel
room-tax receipts for the city to $30.5 million in 2014 from
just over $28 million in 2009, according to a feasibility study
released by HVS on March 26. By 2019, it&#8217;s estimated to exceed
$40 million a year. At the same time the new borrowings will
increase debt backed by the city&#8217;s general fund by 39.6 percent
to $2.23 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have an opportunity to take visitor taxes and fees,
and invest them in a way that creates jobs and grows our local
economy,&#8221; Mayor Karl Dean said in a Jan. 6 statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new facility was needed to attract conventions, said
Marty Dickens, chairman of the convention center authority, in a
phone interview. The city is using the same financial model it
employed for the existing site in 1987, which is now too small
to compete in luring events, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Untested&#8217; Projections &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings, which ranks the bonds being sold at A+, in
evaluating the convention center debt, lowered the city&#8217;s
general obligation grade by one rung on April 6 to AA-, its
fourth-highest level, citing the &#8220;potential additional fiscal
strains of the debt-financed convention center upon an already
pressured general fund,&#8221; the company said. Projections on two
tourism taxes &#8220;are untested&#8221; and &#8220;heavily dependent upon
increased tourism&#8221; at the convention center, Fitch said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We realized the city feels it will be vital to increasing
the desirability of downtown,&#8221; said Amy Laskey, an analyst at
Fitch, in a phone interview. &#8220;The city already operated on a
thinly balanced budget, so the debt does increase the risk for
the general fund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new bond issue is structured with reserves and revenue
projections that exceed what is needed to cover payments to
investors to protect the city&#8217;s general fund, said Dickens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The convention market would have to seriously go to
pieces before we would need general fund dollars,&#8221; Dickens
said. &#8220;A lot of conventions like to come here because of our
reputation as a music city.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Rating &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest portion of the obligations is rated Aa3 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, the
fourth- and sixth-highest rankings, respectively. Ten-year, AAA
rated municipal bonds traded at yields of 3.28 percent, down 2
basis points from a nine-month high today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Riebeling, the city&#8217;s director of finance, didn&#8217;t
return a phone call seeking comment. Wayne Placide, the city&#8217;s
financial adviser with First Southwest Co. in Dallas, referred a
request for comment to Jeff Scruggs, a managing director with
Goldman Sachs. The firm&#8217;s spokesman, Michael DuVally, said
Scruggs couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bullish
Dendreon Corp. options because the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration is likely to approve its prostate cancer therapy
Provenge next month and boost the stock to a record, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategist Marko Kolanovic and
biotechnology industry analyst Cory Kasimov recommended buying
May $40 calls while selling May $50 calls, a strategy known as a
call spread that cuts the price of the trade while capping
potential profit. Dendreon, based in Seattle, fell 0.8 percent
to $38.83 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, paring its rally since
April 9, 2009, to 516 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Options activity suggests market positioning for a
positive outcome,&#8221; Kolanovic and Kasimov wrote in a report.
&#8220;We remain very optimistic (90 percent probability) that
Provenge will be approved on time&#8221; because it nearly won
authorization in 2007, they added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options prices show investors expect the stock to rise or
fall about 24 percent on May 1, when the FDA is scheduled to
announce its decision on Provenge, the JPMorgan analysts said.
Kolanovic and Kasimov also cited the rising number of
outstanding options to purchase the stock and increased trading
of those contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The open interest for Dendreon calls has risen to 388,761
contracts, the most since May. Call volume jumped to a six-month
high of 61,924 contracts on April 6. Dendreon shares closed at a
record $39.66 on April 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a Virus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provenge, if approved, would be the first drug to train the
body&#8217;s immune system to attack cancer cells like a virus. It
could provide a new treatment option for a disease that kills
about 27,000 men a year, according to the National Cancer
Institute. Provenge extended the lives of men with prostate
cancer that had spread to other organs by four months, according
to a study released by the company on April 28, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Provenge therapy involves extracting infection-fighting
white blood cells from patients, mixing them with the vaccine
and injecting that combination to attack tumors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment is designed to be less aggressive and less
toxic than chemotherapy, and used earlier in the progression of
prostate cancer. Men who don&#8217;t yet have symptoms or rapid tumor
growth would get three infusions of Provenge over about a month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may show further losses in its
prime and subprime mortgage portfolios when it reports first-
quarter earnings, according to analyst Dick Bove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Losses have not been curtailed,&#8221; Bove, vice president of
Rochdale Securities LLC in Lutz, Florida, said in a Bloomberg
Radio interview today with Tom Keene. &#8220;In the commercial
industrial loan portfolio and in the consumer portfolio, we
should start to see some improvement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon faces
challenges with low money-lending rates and increasing
regulation, said Bove, who has &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-
based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His margins are going to be stressed because he needs
higher interest rates,&#8221; Bove said. &#8220;His loan volume is likely
to be lower, and they&#8217;re going to be issues with his noninterest
income because of this new Regulation E and the credit-card bill
-- both of which control what he can charge for different
products that he signs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect JPMorgan&#8217;s net income declined from the end
of 2009 on losses from credit cards and home lending, with
mortgage writedowns as high as $2.5 billion per quarter during
2010, compared with $8.3 billion in all of 2009, according to
company data. Bove forecast earnings of 62 cents a share,
compared with the 64-cent average of his and 20 other analysts&#8217;
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares of JPMorgan fell 12 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
$46.02 at 3:31 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove, who has been an analyst since 1965, recommended
selling Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. stock four months before
it collapsed, helping investors avoid a 65 percent plunge in the
shares before he raised them to &#8220;buy&#8221; on Aug. 21, 2008. Lehman
filed the world&#8217;s largest bankruptcy three weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Ambac Financial Group
Inc., the bond insurer that stopped paying some claims and said
it may need to file for bankruptcy, have &#8220;no value,&#8221; according
to JPMorgan Chase  Co. equity analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe any investment in ABK shares at this time is
highly speculative,&#8221; analysts led by Andrew Wessel in New York
wrote today in a note to investors. Their comments came as Ambac
stock jumped as much as 51 percent and extended a three-day
climb in which it quadrupled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac this month said it has &#8220;insufficient capital&#8221; to
finance itself past the second quarter of 2011 and may need to
seek bankruptcy protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wisconsin Insurance Commissioner Sean Dilweg last month
seized $35 billion of Ambac&#8217;s risky mortgage insurance policies,
saying he was seeking to keep the company afloat and forestall
an &#8220;uncontrollable scramble for assets&#8221; among policyholders
and counterparties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pay claims from the mortgage guarantees, the bond
insurer will issue a $2 billion secured note and additional
surplus notes that will rank ahead of common shareholders and be
&#8220;materially dilutive,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete Poillon, an Ambac spokesman, didn&#8217;t immediately return
a telephone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac rose 7 cents, or 3 percent, to $2.32 as of 2:25 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after earlier
climbing to as high as $3.39. Shares have almost quadrupled
since April 8, when the New York-based bond insurer reported a
fourth-quarter profit of $558.1 million. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Shannon D. Harrington" date="Apr 13, 2010  2:21 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-13/synthetic-cdo-bets-threaten-rally-for-ge-capital-glencore-goldman-says.html"><headline>Synthetic Bets Threaten Rally for GE, Glencore Debt</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Structured credit investments with
about $800 billion in bets on companies including General
Electric Co. and Glencore International AG may prevent the cost
of protecting those corporations&#8217; bonds from dropping further,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tighter capital requirements expected to be put in place by
yearend may prompt banks holding pieces of the so-called
synthetic collateralized debt obligations to unwind the
positions, strategist Alberto Gallo said in an interview
yesterday. As trades used to hedge the deals are reversed,
related credit-default swaps are likely to rise relative to the
rest of the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there is a slowdown in the economy, as we expect, and
if regulation becomes tougher, then the names most included in
synthetic CDOs may underperform the rest of the market,&#8221; he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman recommends that investors buy credit swaps on 13 of
the companies most frequently included in corporate synthetic
CDOs, which pay investors yields backed by cash flows from
credit-default swap premiums on a group of companies. Those
include Glencore, General Electric&#8217;s finance unit, Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and European automakers BMW AG
and Daimler AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, investors should sell protection on the
Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, a bet that
swaps on the individual companies will increase more or decline
less than the broader market, Goldman strategists wrote in an
April 9 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bullish&#8217; on Spreads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain bullish on credit spreads and on the market,
but let&#8217;s say regulation comes into play in an environment where
economic growth is slowing down,&#8221; Gallo said. &#8220;Then we would
probably see those names underperforming compared to the rest of
the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic CDOs sell credit-default swaps that receive annual
premiums in return for taking on the risk of losses from
corporate bond defaults. That risk is sliced into so-called
tranches. Investors may, for example, take losses only after the
first 5 percent of companies in the portfolio default, minus the
recovery value. If the losses reach 6 percent, that tranche is
wiped out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unwinding Trades &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proposed changes to bank capital requirements by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision may in some cases double the
amount banks must hold against credit derivatives, Gallo said.
That &#8220;could make it uneconomical for dealers to hold certain
positions on their books and push dealers to unwind the
trades,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also may hinder the creation of new synthetic CDOs, a
process that practically shut down during the financial crisis,
Gallo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in 2008 took losses of up to 90 percent on the
investments after the bankruptcies of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., the collapse of Iceland&#8217;s three biggest banks and the
government seizure of mortgage-finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The failures eroded the built-in cushions that
protected investors from losses and, in many cases, prompted
rankings firms to give certain portions of the synthetic CDOs
their top AAA ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings last month said that about 10 percent of the
synthetic CDO tranches it rates are likely to lose principal
after a Wisconsin regulator&#8217;s seizure of some subprime mortgage
assets at Ambac&#8217;s bond insurance unit triggered payouts on
credit swaps protecting against the unit&#8217;s failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac Assurance Corp. was ranked seventh on a Standard 
Poor&#8217;s list of companies that synthetic CDOs most frequently bet
on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch Ratings said today that it downgraded 99 slices of
synthetic CDOs because of defaults and the &#8220;continued
deterioration in portfolio credit quality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Police in the German port of
Hamburg seized 1.3 metric tons (1.4 tons) of cocaine concealed
in wood briquettes shipped from Paraguay, the biggest-ever haul
of the drug in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In nationwide raids that followed interception of the drug
shipment yesterday, police made seven arrests, seizing cash and
searching 19 properties with suspected links to the crime.
Further individuals are being investigated, Hamburg police said
today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cocaine, hidden in more than 1,240 compressed sawdust
bricks, is of a very high quality and has a street value of 40
million euros ($54 million), according to the police statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customs and police monitored the suspects since last year.
They observed those behind yesterday&#8217;s haul making six &#8220;dummy&#8221;
runs of briquettes without cocaine in shipments between
Asuncion, Paraguay&#8217;s capital, and Hamburg. The cocaine in the
seventh shipment was &#8220;packed very professionally,&#8221; police
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
second-largest corporation, reduced Chief Executive Officer Rex
Tillerson&#8217;s compensation by 16 percent last year after the
company lost more than one-seventh of its market valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson&#8217;s compensation fell to $27.2 million in 2009 from
$32.2 million a year earlier, based on U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission rules. The information was disclosed today
by the Irving, Texas-based company in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, 58, was paid a salary of $2.06 million, a $2.4
million bonus and stock awards worth almost $17 million, the
filing showed. He also accrued $5.47 million from changes in the
value of his pension and deferred compensation, and $280,925 in
the form of personal security, life insurance and the use of
company-owned aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares fell 15 percent in 2009, the second
consecutive annual decline, as the recession squashed demand and
prices for petroleum-based fuels. Net income tumbled 57 percent
last year, the largest annual drop since Exxon Corp.&#8217;s 1999
acquisition of Mobil Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his fifth year as CEO, Tillerson is spending almost $77
million a day to find untapped oil fields and build platforms to
exploit previous discoveries. In December, he signed a $29.2
billion deal to buy XTO Energy Inc. to capture the Fort Worth,
Texas-based company&#8217;s gas-drilling expertise and extensive North
American prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effective Jan. 1, Tillerson&#8217;s annual salary rose 7.3
percent to $2.21 million, the filing said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PetroChina Co. of Beijing is the world&#8217;s largest company by
market value. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mivisa Envases SAU, Spain&#8217;s biggest
maker of cans for food products, has hired Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc. for an initial public offering,
according to two people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mivisa, owned by CVC Capital Partners Ltd., is considering
a share sale this year, possibly in the third quarter, said the
people, who declined to be named because the discussions are
private. Goldman Sachs in London declined to comment, while no
one at Mivisa was immediately available to speak about a
potential IPO. A London-based Citigroup spokesperson couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC bought Mivisa in March 2005 for more than 500 million
euros ($679 million) according to the Spanish newspaper
Expansion. The Murcia, Spain-based food can manufacturer had
sales of about 499 million euros in 2008, according to CVC&#8217;s Web
site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyout firms are seizing on an upswing in stock markets to
sell companies, paying down debt and distributing profits to
investors. Private equity-backed IPOs suffered setbacks in
February as New York-based Blackstone Group LP&#8217;s Travelport Ltd.
and New Look Group Plc, owned by Permira Advisers LLP and Apax
Partners Worldwide LLP, postponed London offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brenntag AG, the German chemical distributor controlled by
BC Partners Ltd., raised 748 million euros last month. Kabel
Deutschland GmbH, the country&#8217;s biggest cable company,
controlled by Providence Equity Partners, in the same month sold
760 million euros of shares. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index has
rallied 13 percent from its low on Feb. 5. as of 3:22 p.m.
London time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett&#8217;s $5 billion
investment in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was partly a bet on the
&#8220;integrity&#8221; of the Wall Street firm, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Director Ronald Olson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Warren and Berkshire stepped up to make this
investment, it was a very strong statement of its belief, his
belief, in not just the strength of Goldman but its integrity,&#8221;
Olson said in an interview this week with Bloomberg Television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, has been criticized for benefiting from $10 billion in
bailout funds in 2008 and its role in the subprime mortgage-
securities market. The bank repaid bailout funds last year and
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, said in a letter to
shareholders that he was grateful for public assistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t look at Wall Street as &#8216;evil,&#8217;&#8221; Buffett said in
an interview last year conducted by the CEO of Business Wire,
the Berkshire subsidiary that posts corporate press releases.
&#8220;I look at Wall Street as given to huge excess sometimes,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to get rid of it. We need something to
allocate capital and distribute securities and all of that
throughout the system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s investment in Goldman Sachs preferred shares, as
financial firms were shut off from their usual sources of
funding in 2008, earns 10 percent interest. Omaha, Nebraska-
based Berkshire also obtained warrants to buy $5 billion of
Goldman Sachs common stock for $115 a share. The bank closed at
$177.84 on the New York Stock exchange yesterday, and has gained
about 37 percent in the past 12 months through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not a Supplicant&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When the financial system went into cardiac arrest in
September 2008, Berkshire was a supplier of liquidity and
capital to the system, not a supplicant,&#8221; Buffett, 79, wrote in
his annual letter to shareholders this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire rose to first place this month in Harris
Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate reputations as the
financial crisis pushed the nation&#8217;s biggest banks toward the
bottom of the list. Goldman Sachs came in 56th out of 60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein defended Goldman Sachs against criticism this
month by telling shareholders in his annual letter that the firm
didn&#8217;t &#8220;bet against&#8221; clients during the decline of the U.S.
mortgage market. He hired a former New York Times reporter to
help burnish the company&#8217;s image and navigate new government
regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not Carping&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire&#8217;s &#8220;board is not carping about this, it&#8217;s not
flinching as a result of the limelight that is on them,&#8221; said
Olson, a director since 1997. &#8220;Would we prefer to have the
investment out of the limelight? Sure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, under fire in Washington for setting aside
billions of dollars for bonuses, said last year it would join
Buffett in providing assistance to 10,000 U.S. small businesses.
Buffett was named as co-chairman of the $500 million initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olson, a partner in the Los Angeles office of law firm
Munger, Tolles  Olson LLP, also serves with Buffett on the
Washington Post Co. board. He specializes in transaction and
corporate governance issues, and he advised the board of Yahoo!
Inc. on Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s takeover proposal, according to his
law firm&#8217;s Web site. The firm advised Buffett on the Goldman
Sachs investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Berkshire board, led by Buffett and Vice Chairman
Charles Munger, 86, is prepared to handle succession and will
make an &#8220;immediate decision&#8221; when the need arises, Olson said.
There are several qualified candidates to take over for Buffett,
who also serves as CEO, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, sold its 9.43 percent stake in Norwegian natural-
gas pipeline network Gassled to Njord Gas Infrastructure AS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil will retain its current capacity rights to
transport gas through the pipeline and will remain a major user
of the system, the company said in a statement on its Web site
today. Continued access to capacity is assured through the
third-party open access regime created when Gassled was
established, the company said. The sale is subject to the
approval of the Norwegian authorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This divestment will have no impact on Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
operated or partner-operated producing assets in Norway,&#8221; the
company said in the statement. Kristin Kragseth, Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
spokeswoman in Norway, declined to comment on the price the
company got for the stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gassled, a joint venture created in 2003 between oil and
gas companies operating on the Norwegian continental shelf, owns
the country&#8217;s gas transport infrastructure. Exxon was among the
partners that complained to Norway&#8217;s government in 2008 when
state-controlled Statoil ASA and Petoro AS took control of the
network, holding 32.1 percent and 38.46 percent respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company began marketing its stake last summer, Eirik
Hauge, a spokesman for Exxon, said in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Total SA, Eni SpA, Dong Energy A/S
and ConocoPhillips are also stakeholders in Gassled. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, may show net income declined from
the end of 2009 on losses from credit cards and home lending
when it reports first-quarter earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit was probably about $2.93 billion, or 64 cents a
share, according to the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. That compares with net income of $3.28 billion, or
74 cents, in the fourth quarter and $2.14 billion, or 40 cents,
a year earlier during the depths of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage writedowns may be as high as $2.5 billion per
quarter during 2010, compared with $8.3 billion in all of 2009,
according to company data. Analysts including Anthony Polini at
Raymond James  Associates said they will be watching to see if
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was able to reduce
provisions against future credit losses as a gauge of whether
the worst of the U.S. housing crisis is over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key factor for this quarter for banks will be to say
reserve builds are largely behind us and the outlook for lower
problem loans and loan losses have improved for the second half
of the year,&#8221; Polini said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the outlook that matters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest competitors will probably post profits
for the quarter, according to the Bloomberg survey, even as U.S.
lenders are collapsing at the fastest pace in 17 years.
Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest U.S. bank behind JPMorgan and
Bank of America Corp., may report earnings of $455 million when
it releases results on April 19, the survey shows. Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America may report a profit of
$1.42 billion on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Quality &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the banks, the thing that matters more than anything
else is the trend in credit quality and the rate of inflow of
new problem loans. That trumps all,&#8221; said Chris Kotowski, an
equity analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t
mean that there aren&#8217;t any new problems coming in, but the rate
of inflows are diminished.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$1.77 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis and the
worst job market in 26 years, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The pace of losses has begun to slow in the past two
quarters and the housing market has shown signs of stabilization
even as the federal government withdraws support from financial
markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Problem Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charge-offs from consumer credit-card and mortgage loans at
JPMorgan are expected to be about $8.6 billion in the first
quarter, a 10 percent increase from the previous three months,
according to Credit Suisse analysts led by Moshe Orenbuch.
&#8220;Reserving remains the largest variable to reported earnings,&#8221;
they wrote in an April 8 research note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has succeeded in generating profit throughout the
global credit contraction, suggesting he may be able to restore
the dividend to pre-crisis levels before major competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which cut its quarterly payout to shareholders to
5 cents from 38 cents in February 2009, may boost the dividend
if the U.S. economy shows several months of improvement in the
jobless rate and there is a &#8220;significant reduction&#8221; in charge-
offs, Dimon said last month in his annual letter to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 54-year-old CEO claimed credit in the letter for
helping to stabilize markets during the crisis by purchasing
Bear Stearns Cos. and Washington Mutual as they headed toward
collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Cards &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is offsetting declines in mortgage banking and
credit cards with trading revenue, which analysts from Credit
Suisse estimated will show an increase to $4.9 billion from $3
billion in the fourth quarter. Credit Suisse said a credit-
market recovery was fueling fixed-income results at JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The credit markets really, really did well in the first
quarter,&#8221; said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets
in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;It&#8217;s mainly because the Fed is
printing money and there&#8217;s a lot of money sitting on the
sidelines coming into the market right now, especially in the
fixed-income side.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy EBay Inc.
options as a &#8220;low cost&#8221; hedge before the most visited U.S.
online retail site reports first-quarter earnings April 21,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists John Marshall and Maria
Grant recommended purchasing May $25 puts giving the right to
sell EBay shares, which climbed 1.5 percent to $27.04 in Nasdaq
Stock Market trading. EBay options prices have fallen as the
stock&#8217;s 20-day historic volatility, a gauge of past price
swings, fell to 19.81 yesterday, the lowest since July 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;EBay options imply a smaller-than-usual move for earnings
next week, but our analysts expect earnings volatility to
continue,&#8221; the New York-based strategists wrote. &#8220;We recommend
EBay holders use inexpensive May options to hedge ahead of what
could be a volatile earnings report.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They said Goldman analyst James Mitchell &#8220;sees the
potential for volatility&#8221; in the company&#8217;s forecast for 2010
and 2011 earnings and expects first-quarter profit of 42 cents a
share, higher than the 41 cent average estimate in a Bloomberg
survey. Options prices show traders are betting on a one-day
gain or loss of about 7 percent after the release, below the 10
percent median move after earnings over the past two years, the
strategists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EBay share-price swings may increase on competition with
Craigslist.org, a U.S. classified-advertising Web site, and
because analysts may reduce profit projections because of a
weaker euro and pound, the report said. Executives also may
update investors on the company&#8217;s Paypal payment processing
unit, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rising expectations for this small but fast-growing part
of their business has been cited as a key reason&#8221; for the
stock&#8217;s 13 percent gain this year through yesterday, the
strategists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The May $25 puts fell 14 percent to 48 cents. Next month&#8217;s
options expire May 21. EBay hasn&#8217;t closed below $25 since March
8. The strategists also said investors who expect the shares to
advance should buy May $28 calls to purchase the stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rallied, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to its biggest gain in almost six
weeks, on better-than-estimated results at Intel Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and CSX Corp. and an increase in retail sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel rallied 3.3 percent after the world&#8217;s largest
chipmaker forecast rising sales this quarter and record profit
margins for the year, fueling optimism that a rebound in
technology spending is strengthening. JPMorgan advanced 4.1
percent, the most since October, after reporting record fixed-
income trading revenue. CSX rose 4.1 percent to an 18-month
high. Equities extended gains as the Federal Reserve said the
economy expanded across most of the nation in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 climbed 1.1 percent to 1,210.65 at 4 p.m. in
New York, its biggest advance since March 5 and the first day
the index exceeded 1,200 since September 2008. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average climbed 103.69 points, or 0.9 percent, to
11,123.11 as 23 of its 30 stocks advanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just a couple of earnings reports so far, but these
are pretty important companies and the numbers look
phenomenal,&#8221; said Brian Barish, president of Cambiar Investors
LCC in Denver, which manages about $5.6 billion. &#8220;Not only is
the bear case not unfolding, it seems to be just categorically
false.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combined operating profit for SP 500 companies increased
30 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier, according
to analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg, which would mark the
first back-to-back quarterly gains since 2007. The SP 500 has
surged 79 percent from a 12-year low in March 2009 as the
economy and corporate earnings returned to growth and the Fed
left interest rates at a record low to foster the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, JPMorgan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel jumped 3.3 percent to $23.52, its highest closing
price since August 2008. Second-quarter revenue will climb as
high as $10.6 billion, exceeding analysts&#8217; predictions, and 2010
gross margins will widen to a record, the chipmaker said late
yesterday. Net income surged almost fourfold in the three months
through March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Texas Instruments, the second-biggest U.S. chipmaker, rose
4 percent to $26.90 for its biggest advance since October.
Teradyne Inc., which makes chip-testing equipment, rallied 7.6
percent for the biggest gain in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan surged 4.1 percent to $47.73 for the top gain in
the Dow. The bank said a &#8220;broad-based&#8221; economic recovery
boosted first-quarter earnings 55 percent. Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon cited stabilizing U.S. home prices and other
signals that the economy may be poised for a &#8220;strong
recovery.&#8221; Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said
delinquencies for credit cards and mortgages in which the
borrower is behind by just one payment also improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mayo&#8217;s Upgrade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Agricole Securities USA Inc. analyst Mike Mayo
raised his recommendation on three U.S. banks, lifting Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to &#8220;buy&#8221; from
&#8220;outperform&#8221; and boosting JPMorgan to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from
&#8220;underperform.&#8221; Mayo also raised his share-price estimate for
Citigroup Inc. to $4 from $3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The worst of credit trends seems to be over for the big
banks,&#8221; Mayo and colleague Chris Spahr wrote in a note to
clients. &#8220;We previously thought that loan losses would approach
the level of the Great Depression,&#8221; they wrote, &#8220;but now feel
more confident that this is about the worst it will be.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America rallied 3.9 percent for the second-biggest
gain in the Dow, while Citigroup jumped 6.7 percent. American
Express Co., Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. climbed at least 1.5
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Railroad Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX jumped 4.1 percent to $55.46 after first-quarter profit
benefited from increased shipping volumes and higher revenue
from each carload. CSX led off quarterly earnings reports for an
industry in which analysts project a rebound in profit after the
recession damped freight demand. Union Pacific Corp., the
biggest U.S. railroad, releases results on April 22. Increases
in earnings would add to evidence that the U.S. economy is
strengthening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexes of financial and information-technology companies
gained the most of 10 industry groups in the SP 500, rising 2.6
percent and 1.7 percent respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG raised its year-end estimate for the
SP 500 by 13 percent to 1,270 today, saying &#8220;equities still
offer value relative to other asset classes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hoarding Cash&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because there&#8217;s been so much talk of double-dip
recession, corporations have been hoarding cash,&#8221; said Marc
Pado, the San Francisco-based U.S. market strategist at Cantor
Fitzgerald LP. &#8220;They&#8217;re sitting on a trillion dollars of cash
and cash equivalents. And for corporations, that&#8217;s a lot. I
think companies are going to be looking more closely at the
potential for acquisitions and corporate buybacks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Retailing Index advanced 1.7 percent, with
Amazon.com Inc. and AutoNation Inc. pacing gains. Retail sales
in the U.S. climbed 1.6 percent, the biggest increase in four
months, and gains for February and January were revised up,
Commerce Department figures showed. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had forecast a median gain of 1.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A report from the Labor Department showed the cost of
living increased 0.1 percent in March after no change the
previous month, in line with the survey median. Another Commerce
Department report showed business inventories rose 0.5 percent
in February, above the 0.4 percent median economist estimate, as
companies built up stocks to meet improving demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s report on regional economic activity, known as
the Beige Book, said the economic activity increased
&#8220;somewhat&#8221; in all of the central bank&#8217;s districts except St.
Louis. Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the U.S. expansion will
remain moderate as the economy contends with weak construction
spending and high unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Moderate&#8217; Recovery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On balance, the incoming data suggest that growth in
private final demand will be sufficient to promote a moderate
economic recovery in coming quarters,&#8221; Bernanke said in
testimony to Congress today. &#8220;Significant restraints on the
pace of the recovery remain, including weakness in both
residential and nonresidential construction and the poor fiscal
condition of many state and local governments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow will bring reports on manufacturing from the New
York and Philadelphia Fed regions as well as data on U.S.
industrial production and jobless claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manufacturing reports &#8220;will tell us if the retail-
sales gains were in new production or inventory liquidations,&#8221;
said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Boston-based broker
dealer Cabrera Capital Markets. &#8220;If the former, it would set up
well for an allocation trade out of cash and into equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude Halts Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil ended a five-day decline, rising 2.1 percent to
$85.84 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after the
U.S. Energy Department reported an unexpected drop in
inventories. Schlumberger Ltd. and ConocoPhillips gained more
than 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. rose 1.3 percent to $245.69, the highest closing
price since the company went public in 1980. The maker of
Macintosh computers and iPods said demand for its new iPad
tablet computer was &#8220;far higher&#8221; than predicted and the
company will delay the device&#8217;s international introduction by a
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosaic Co. fell 2.4 percent to $55.40. North America&#8217;s
second-largest crop-nutrient producer was downgraded to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. U.S. shares
of Canada&#8217;s Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan, also downgraded to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; dropped 2.3 percent to $109.64. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Morris International Inc. declined 2.2 percent to
$51.30. The tobacco producer may miss earnings-per-share
estimates, Citigroup Inc. analyst Adam Spielman wrote in a note
today. The New York-based company is scheduled to post quarterly
earnings on April 22. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should bet that the
difference in yields between Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities and comparable-maturity U.S. debt will narrow as
gains in consumer prices slow, according to strategists at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between yields on two- and 10-year Treasuries will
also contract as longer-term government debt yields decline,
Michael Vaknin, a strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, wrote
in a report today. The yield on the 10-year note may fall in the
second half of this year from 3.86 percent to around 3.25
percent before &#8220;gradually&#8221; advancing in 2011, Vaknin wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in March, in
line with expectations, while the index was unchanged excluding
food and energy, the Labor Department said today. The core
inflation rate has increased 1.1 percent in the past 12 months,
below the average of 2.7 percent since the start of the 1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap in yields between 10-year Treasuries and TIPS was
2.34 percentage points today, down from this year&#8217;s high of 2.49
percentage points in January. The five-year average of the yield
curve is 2.15 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year note yield rose 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.86 percent at 3:47 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. The 3.625 percent security
due February 2020 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face amount,
to 98 2/32. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman initially recommended the trade on a flatter yield
curve on March 24 when the spread was 2.74 percentage points,
and suggested investors cancel the trade if the difference rose
above 2.85 percentage points, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. said a
&#8220;broad-based&#8221; economic recovery boosted first-quarter earnings
55 percent, surprising analysts with record fixed-income trading
revenue and a better-than-expected outlook for consumer credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income at the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets
climbed to $3.33 billion, or 74 cents a share, from $2.14
billion, or 40 cents, in the same period a year earlier and from
$3.28 billion in the fourth quarter, the New York-based company
said today in a statement. Record fixed-income trading revenue
and a reduction in provisions for credit losses helped the bank
beat the average estimate of 64 cents per share projected by 21
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is clear and broad-based improvement in the
economic factors in the United States and around the world,&#8221;
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, told reporters on a
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon cited signs including stabilizing U.S. home prices
that signal the economy may be poised for a &#8220;strong recovery.&#8221;
Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said delinquencies for
credit cards and mortgages in which the borrower is behind by
just one payment also improved in the first quarter, indicating
that consumers&#8217; finances are gaining strength after the worst
recession in more than 70 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which repaid $25 billion in federal aid last
year, remained profitable throughout the financial crisis,
relying on fee income to counter loan losses in mortgage lending
and credit cards. The bank, the No. 1 underwriter of stocks and
bonds in the U.S. last year, generated three-quarters of first-
quarter profit from its investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpected Strength &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nobody saw those types of numbers coming,&#8221; said Paul
Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia and analyst at FBR Capital Markets in Arlington,
Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s earnings bode well for Bank of America Corp. and
other banks, which report earnings later this month, Miller
said. &#8220;Credit remains a wild card here, but Jamie talked very,
very positive about credit and the consumer,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose $1.86, or 4.1 percent, to $47.73 in composite
trading on the New York Stock Exchange at 4 p.m., the biggest
gain in six months and the highest price since Oct. 2, 2008. The
shares are up 15 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China&#8217;s growing, India&#8217;s growing, Japan is growing, home
prices have stopped going down, consumer income is up, consumers
are spending, service and manufacturing indexes are up,
inventories are still low, I could go on and on,&#8221; Dimon said.
&#8220;This could be the makings of a good recovery. We don&#8217;t know
for sure, but if you look at those factors, it&#8217;s pretty good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Real Improvement&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh said on the call that there is &#8220;fundamental real
improvement&#8221; in consumer mortgage and credit-card
delinquencies. That didn&#8217;t translate into lower credit costs for
the quarter, though he said it &#8220;augurs well for future quarters
if those trends sustain themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home lending and credit-card losses continued to pull down
earnings. Retail banking lost $131 million, compared with a $399
million net loss during the fourth quarter and a $474 million
gain a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company decreased provisions against future credit
losses while setting aside $2.3 billion in reserves for lawsuits
stemming from its purchase of Washington Mutual Inc. Credit-card
services lost $303 million, compared with a net loss of $306
million in the prior three months and $547 million a year
earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter revenue climbed 11 percent to $27.7 billion,
beating the highest estimate among analysts in the Bloomberg
survey. Fixed-income revenue was $5.46 billion, compared with
$4.89 billion a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed Income &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said improving fixed-income markets contributed to
the revenue gains, as did a $462 million reversal of provisions
for credit costs in investment banking, which compared with $1.2
billion in expenses a year earlier. JPMorgan cited lower loan
balances, driven by repayments and loan sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank reduced total provisions for credit losses in all
divisions to $7 billion, compared with $8.9 billion in the
previous quarter and $10 billion the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank contributed $2.47 billion of JPMorgan&#8217;s
$3.33 billion in net income, or 74 percent. That compares with
57 percent in the fourth quarter and 75 percent in the first
quarter of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The good news is that the revenue picture was actually
quite strong,&#8221; said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC, in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg Radio.
&#8220;And in particular, within investment banking, fixed-income
trading. That had been an area of concern, so March must have
been a blockbuster month.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Citigroup Inc., the third-biggest lender behind
JPMorgan and Bank of America, may report earnings of $340
million when it releases results on April 19, the Bloomberg
survey shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
may report a profit of $1.1 billion on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon and Cavanagh didn&#8217;t give shareholders immediate hope
of restoring the quarterly dividend, which was cut to 5 cents
from 38 cents in February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We want to see continued sustained improvement in
employment, continued sustained improvement in delinquencies&#8221;
and a better understanding of new bank capital rules before the
dividend will increase, Dimon said, reiterating what he told
shareholders in his annual letter last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh said that increasing the payout to shareholders is
&#8220;going to be down the road a little more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said China may strengthen the yuan
by between 2 percent and 5 percent as early as next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill said in an interview that trading in local
currencies among Brazil, Russia, India and China -- to be
discussed at a heads-of-state summit of so-called BRIC nations
this week in Brasilia -- won&#8217;t work because of China&#8217;s use of a
dollar peg to manage the value of the yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all semantics to talk about trade in local currency
unless they do what the rest of world wants them to, which is
provide more freedom to use these currencies,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill, 53,
said from London. &#8220;The consequences of Chinese policies are
increasingly seen by everyone, including the BRICs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s peg is building as BRIC
leaders get ready to meet this week to discuss boosting trade in
local currency and coordinating positions on reforming the
international financial system after the global credit crisis.
Chinese President Hu Jintao, who arrives in Brasilia tonight
from the U.S., told President Barack Obama yesterday that China
won&#8217;t bow to pressure after the U.S. leader urged the Asian
country to adopt a &#8220;more market-oriented exchange rate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards rose 0.2 percent
to 6.6225 per dollar as of 12:27 p.m. in New York, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts reflect bets the
currency will strengthen 3.1 percent from the spot rate of
6.8258. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stronger Yuan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to describe the
four large, fast-growing economies, said he was pushing up his
forecast for a stronger yuan from the end of the year because it
is increasingly obvious the currency is undervalued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the U.S. Congress hadn&#8217;t been so noisy about this in
the past month, it probably would have already happened,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who has discussed the distortions caused by the dollar
peg with Chinese officials in visits to Beijing. &#8220;It just makes
an enormous amount of sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s exchange rate policy is &#8220;a particularly big
challenge for Brazilian&#8221; manufacturers as the country seeks to
reduce its reliance on commodity exports, O&#8217;Neill said. China
surpassed the U.S. as Brazil&#8217;s biggest trading partner last
year, as exports of iron-ore and soy rose during the global
recession while manufacturing sales to the U.S. declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, even as the countries disagree over how to manage
their currencies, he expects no tension or public criticism of
the yuan&#8217;s peg when Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da
Silva hosts his Russian, Indian and Chinese counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the second meeting for leaders from the four
nations will seek to find common ground about ways to reform the
International Monetary Fund, United Nations and other
international institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Being Mr. BRIC, of course I&#8217;m flattered these guys now
meet together, but beyond all being large economies what else
can they really do collectively,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;This summit
is a very powerful symbol of how hopeless international
organizations have become.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European shares rose, sending the
Stoxx Europe 600 Index to its highest level since September
2008, after results from Intel Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
spurred optimism about the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infineon Technologies AG and STMicroelectronics NV paced a
rally among chipmakers after Intel forecast sales that topped
analysts&#8217; estimates. Allied Irish Banks Plc climbed 7.9 percent
as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended buying the shares.
Ericsson AB rallied the most in more than a year after Credit
Suisse Group AG boosted its rating on the stock. Shares in
Greece declined as billionaire investor George Soros said the
cost of borrowing in the nation&#8217;s rescue package is too high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx 600 gained 0.7 percent to 270.44 in London. The
benchmark gauge for European equities has climbed 6.5 percent in
2010 as the European Union agreed a $61 billion aid proposal to
help Greece tackle the region&#8217;s biggest budget deficit and the
U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to maintain record-low interest
rates for an extended period to secure the economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ll see coming up in these quarterly results some
revenue numbers that reassure people that if last year was all
about cutting costs then this year is about rebuilding sales
with a lower cost base,&#8221; said Jeremy Podger, London-based head
of global equities at Threadneedle Asset Management Ltd., which
has about $93 billion in client assets. &#8220;This will give people
confidence to go back into equities. It&#8217;s a positive story.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first-quarter earnings season began in the U.S. this
week, with analysts predicting combined profit for SP 500
companies increased 30 percent from a year earlier, according to
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The Stoxx 600 has surged 71
percent and the SP 500 has jumped 78 percent from lows in March
2009 as the economy returned to growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National benchmark indexes rose in all of the 18 western
European markets, except Greece. The U.K.&#8217;s FTSE 100 and
France&#8217;s CAC 40 each advanced 0.6 percent, while Germany&#8217;s DAX
gained 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel, the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, yesterday said
second-quarter revenue will climb as high as $10.6 billion,
exceeding analysts&#8217; predictions, and 2010 gross margins will
widen to a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, beat
analysts&#8217; estimates as first-quarter earnings rose 55 percent on
higher trading revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Retail Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales at U.S. retailers climbed in March more than
anticipated, signaling consumers will play a bigger role in a
broadening economic recovery. Purchases increased 1.6 percent
last month, the most in four months, and gains for February and
January were revised up, Commerce Department figures showed
today in Washington. Sales excluding autos rose 0.6 percent,
also surpassing expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basic-resource shares led gains in the European benchmark
index as aluminum, copper, nickel, tin and zinc rose on the
London Metal Exchange. Rio Tinto Group, the world&#8217;s third-
largest mining company, surged 2.1 percent to 3,959.5 pence,
while BHP Billiton Ltd., the largest, rose 1.9 percent to 2,286
pence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infineon, Europe&#8217;s second-largest chipmaker, climbed 2.8
percent to 5.21 euros. STMicroelectronics gained 2.7 percent to
7.73 euros. Cap Gemini SA, Europe&#8217;s largest computer services
company, rallied 5.7 percent to 38.84 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson Upgrade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ericsson AB rallied 4.6 percent to 77.7 kronor, the biggest
gain since March 31, 2009. Credit Suisse raised its
recommendation on the shares to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral,&#8221;
saying the outlook for sales is improving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allied Irish Banks surged 7.9 percent to 1.55 euros as
Goldman Sachs upgraded the shares to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG gained 2.4 percent to 18.48 Swiss francs. Chief
Executive Officer Oswald Gruebel said he&#8217;s upbeat about the
prospects for Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank after a return to
profit, even as he predicted further withdrawals at the private
bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, owner of the world&#8217;s largest
container shipper, climbed 5.9 percent to 45,030 kroner. Neptune
Orient Lines Ltd., Singapore&#8217;s largest container line, rose
after the city-state raised its economic growth forecast.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s raised its price estimate on Maersk by 6.8
percent to 47,000 kroner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postbank Integration &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Postbank AG climbed 4.4 percent to 24.96 euros.
Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s preparations for the integration of Deutsche
Postbank are more advanced than expected as the company pushes
ahead with a shared information technology platform,
Handelsblatt reported, without saying where it got the
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yell Group Plc, the publisher of the U.K.&#8217;s yellow pages
directory, rose 8.2 percent to 54.65 pence after UBS AG added
the shares to its &#8220;most preferred&#8221; list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BT Group Plc jumped 4.4 percent to 129.1 pence after Morgan
Stanley said the U.K.&#8217;s biggest phone company is trading at a
discount to U.S. rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homeserve Plc rallied 5.7 percent to 1,897 pence, the
biggest gain since November. The company said it acquired
National Grid Energy Services LLC&#8217;s service contract business
for about $14 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s ASE Index fell 1.4 percent, extending yesterday&#8217;s
2.2 percent retreat. National Bank of Greece SA, the country&#8217;s
biggest lender, dropped 4 percent to 13.25 euros. EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA, the second largest, declined 5.2 percent to 6.26
euros, the biggest decline on the Stoxx 600 today. Goldman Sachs
analysts lowered price estimates for both banks, according to a
report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece faces the danger of a &#8220;death spiral&#8221; because the
cost of borrowing in the euro region&#8217;s rescue package is too
expensive, billionaire investor George Soros said at an event
late yesterday in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and UBS AG
property funds may receive investments of as much as $100
million each from the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System
as the pension plan seeks to boost real estate holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee system, with $29 billion in assets, is
considering putting money in the open-ended JPMorgan Strategic
Property Fund and the UBS Trumbull Property Fund, according to a
report prepared for pension board trustees. Townsend Group, the
system&#8217;s real estate consultant, recommends the funds to
clients, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tennessee retirement system plans to invest $1 billion
in real estate over the next five years. U.S. property purchases
have plunged since 2007 as values fell and financing dried up.
This year, commercial real estate sales likely will be double
the $52 billion recorded in 2009, while still below their $500
billion peak, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New
York-based research company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s still slow, but it certainly looks better than it
did six to 12 months ago,&#8221; said Robert Bach, chief economist
for Grubb  Ellis Co., a Santa Ana, California-based commercial
broker. &#8220;There seems to be a lot of capital out there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January&#8217;s commercial real estate values in the U.S. were 40
percent below the peak in October 2007, according to the
Moody&#8217;s/REAL Commercial Property Price Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimated Returns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s fund is estimated to return a dividend of 4.25
percent after fees and the UBS fund is expected to yield 4
percent. The gross asset value of the JPMorgan fund was $14.8
billion and the UBS fund $9.7 billion, according to the
Tennessee report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kris Kagel, a spokesman for Zurich-based UBS, and Jackie
Meere of JPMorgan in New York both declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Universities Retirement System of Illinois
approved investing $100 million in the UBS fund in December,
according to meeting minutes. The UBS fund had most of its money
in office buildings, apartments and retail centers as of the end
of September, according to an annual review of UBS Realty
Investors by a staff member of the Illinois retirement system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Egyptian Co. for Mobile Services,
also known as Mobinil, was raised to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc, citing economic growth in the North
African country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An acceleration of the Egyptian economy will be positive
for Mobinil&#8217;s financial performance,&#8221; analysts including Moscow-
based Alexander Balakhnin wrote in a report today. &#8220;Egypt is one
of the most attractive markets in the Central Eastern Europe,
Middle East and Africa region.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy of the most populous Arab country expanded 4.7
percent in the fiscal year that ended in June. The government
expects growth of more than 5 percent this fiscal year as the
economy recovers from the global financial crisis. Egypt&#8217;s
benchmark stocks index, the EGX30 Index, has gained 22 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobinil&#8217;s price estimate was raised 70 percent to 312
Egyptian pounds. The shares added 2 percent, the biggest
intraday gain in almost a week, to 224 pounds at 11:44 a.m. in
Cairo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arab country&#8217;s biggest mobile-phone operator competes
with Vodafone Egypt Telecommunications Co. and Etisalat Misr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is enough room for three players in this market and
that the competitive intensity is unlikely to escalate,&#8221; the

&lt;p&gt;Qatar Telecom QSC, the country&#8217;s
biggest phone-service provider, was cut to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221;
and had its share-price estimate reduced at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc, citing &#8220;slower&#8221; growth in its home market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We reduce our estimates to reflect EBITDA margin erosion
and slower growth of the subscriber base in Qatar,&#8221; Moscow-based
analyst Alexander Balakhnin wrote in a report today. &#8220;Q-tel will
underperform its peers before the competitive environment
stabilizes in Qatar, which is unlikely in the short term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s 12-month price estimate was cut 21 percent to
184 riyals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q-tel, which provides phone services from North Africa to
Asia, held a monopoly in its home market until last year. It
faces competition from Vodafone Qatar QSC, a venture between
Vodafone Group Plc and state-controlled Qatar Foundation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q-tel posted a 21 percent jump in full-year profit last
month as it added new customers and expanded operations. Strong
subscriber growth in Iraq, Algeria and Indonesia led to more
than 76 percent of the company&#8217;s revenue being generated outside
Qatar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greek lenders such as National Bank
of Greece SA and Alpha Bank SA had their share-price estimates
cut by as much as 18 percent at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
said their operating environment continues to deteriorate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lowered its share-price estimate on National
Bank to 10.10 euros from 11.20 euros and on EFG Eurobank
Ergasias SA to 5.10 euros from 5.70 euros, London-based analysts
Heiner Luz, Jacqueline Cheung and Ron Heydenrijk said in a note
to clients today. Alpha and Piraeus Bank SA had their estimates
cut to 4.90 euros from 6 euros and to 4.30 euros from 5 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek lenders have declined 22 percent on average this year
on concern they may struggle to refinance loans and raise
liquidity amid Greece&#8217;s economic crisis. Domestic bank deposits
dropped 3.6 percent in the first two months of the year. The
government has extended its liquidity support program for banks,
which Goldman Sachs estimates will provide as much as 17 billion
euros ($23.3 billion) of additional cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Within the European banks sector context, we advise
investors to avoid Greek banks and highlight our &#8216;sell&#8217; ratings
on National Bank of Greece, which despite structural headwinds
trades at 1.6 times 2009 tangible book value -- a 25 percent
premium to European banks -- and Piraeus,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piraeus &#8220;operates with one of the lowest pre-provision
margins among Greek banks and therefore is most at risk of
becoming loss-making in the short-term, in our view,&#8221; the
analysts said. Piraeus is Greece&#8217;s fourth-largest lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broker has &#8220;neutral&#8221; ratings on Alpha and Eurobank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Bank fell 2.5 percent to 13.46 euros while
Eurobank declined 3.9 percent to 6.34 euros as of 10:47 a.m.
local time in Athens trading. Alpha dropped 1.7 percent to 6.46
euros and Piraeus decreased 1.8 percent to 6.02 euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s head of
investment banking in India, Vedika Bhandarkar, told colleagues
she plans to quit and join Credit Suisse Group, people close to
each firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhandarkar, who&#8217;s been at JPMorgan in India since 1998, is
in talks with Credit Suisse about overseeing its Indian
investment banking unit, according to one of the people, who
asked not to be identified because the discussions are private.
Sandeep Pangal, a managing director in JPMorgan&#8217;s corporate
finance group in Mumbai, may accompany Bhandarkar to the Swiss
bank, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhandarkar and Pangal declined to comment, as did JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kavita Sonawala and Credit Suisse spokesman Adam
Harper. The two bankers have worked together for clients
including NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan&#8217;s largest mobile-phone company,
which they advised on its 2008 purchase of a $2.7 billion stake
in Tata Teleservices Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, lost
the vice chairman of its India business, Kaku Nakhate, last
month. She left to become country head for Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, ranks third among advisers on
mergers and acquisitions in India during the past 12 months,
based on the total dollar value of announced transactions,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
is first and Morgan Stanley second. Zurich-based Credit Suisse
ranks fourth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, JPMorgan is No. eight in advising on
stock sales in the country, behind Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg data
show. Credit Suisse ranks 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse in November said it named Rahul Chawla as
head of global markets solutions for India. In that position,
Chawla will help originate equity and debt capital markets
transactions among other things, Credit Suisse said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s a lot to like in the new HD2
smartphone, manufactured by Taiwan&#8217;s HTC Corp. and available in
the U.S. for Deutsche Telekom AG&#8217;s T-Mobile network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with the huge 4.3-inch touch screen, which T-Mobile
says is the largest available on a phone. Add the same Qualcomm
Inc. Snapdragon processor that powers Google Inc.&#8217;s much-touted
Nexus One phone, also made by HTC. Include a five-megapixel
camera with flash. And put it all into a sleek, thin package
that still manages to fit into a shirt pocket. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So with all that, what do you end up with? A very nice
phone that, because it is powered by Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s soon-to-
be-replaced mobile operating system, has no future. To say the
HD2 may be the best Windows Mobile device ever is a little like
calling someone the most virtuous in the brothel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft recognized the importance of hand-held
devices and smartphones early on, whatever first-mover advantage
it had has long since been squandered. Successive versions of
its mobile software have been quirky and clunky, saddled by the
company&#8217;s determination to treat the devices as if they were
shrunken Windows personal computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, others, most notably Research In Motion Ltd.
with its BlackBerrys, took over the corporate market; then Apple
Inc. rewrote the rules for the consumer market with its iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a Veneer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 6.5 of Microsoft&#8217;s operating system, released last
fall, placed a superficially improved user interface over the
existing software. It proved to be just a veneer, though, and
has done nothing to arrest the company&#8217;s slide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s share of U.S. smartphone subscribers fell to
15.7 percent in the three months that ended in January,
according to comScore Inc. That was a decline of four percentage
points from the preceding quarter. Already trailing RIM and
Apple, Windows Mobile now may be in danger of falling behind
Google&#8217;s Android platform too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft this week unveiled two new phones aimed at
younger, social-networking users, its full next-generation
operating system, to be called Windows Phone 7, won&#8217;t show up on
handsets until late this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the new software won&#8217;t be backward-compatible --
meaning HD2 users shouldn&#8217;t expect to run it, or new
applications written for it. So T-Mobile customers are
essentially being asked to plunk down $199 and sign a two-year
service agreement for a phone whose freshness-expiration date is
already looming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching &#8216;Transformers&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of which is really quite a shame, because the HD2
hardware could make it a genuinely nice experience. Start with
that large screen, which makes movie-watching on a plane or
train a pleasure. T-Mobile ships the device with the two
&#8220;Transformers&#8221; movies preloaded -- which should give you some
idea of the demographic it&#8217;s aiming for -- and an application
from Blockbuster Inc. to download more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screen&#8217;s size and the tactile feedback of its virtual
keyboard make it easy for stubby-fingered users like me to type
even in portrait mode. Its ability to recognize iPhone-like
fingertip gestures to zoom in and out aids in navigation.
Unfortunately, that means getting lost in the phone&#8217;s
complicated package of software and hardware is easier too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of the box, the HD2 uses HTC&#8217;s Sense, a proprietary
user interface that is fairly intuitive and simple to navigate.
But it&#8217;s way too easy to stumble from the Sense interface into
the separate Windows Mobile one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dueling Buttons &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The front of the phone includes two buttons side by side.
Pressing the one with the &#8220;home&#8221; icon takes you from wherever
you are back to the main Sense desktop screen. Pressing the one
next to it with a Windows logo -- Microsoft calls it the Start
button -- takes you to the main Microsoft desktop screen, which
has a different look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the application icons on the Microsoft screen are
the same as you&#8217;ll find on the Sense screen while others may be
for competing versions of critical programs such as the Web
browser. If you&#8217;re using the Sense interface, for example, you
may find yourself in Opera Software ASA&#8217;s widely used mobile
browser; if you&#8217;re in the Windows Mobile environment, you may
end up in Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&#8217;m used to this sort of weirdness in Windows phones,
even I sometimes found myself absentmindedly or accidentally
hitting the wrong button, and wondering just what sort of
usability testing convinced anyone it was a good idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, while I like the HD2 hardware, I can&#8217;t recommend it.
With its doomed operating system, reliance on financially
troubled Blockbuster for movies and the sometimes spotty T-
Mobile network, the HD2 has the feel of an elegant dead end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. claims Grupo
Televisa SA&#8217;s cable unit breached a credit agreement by
objecting to the transfer of a loan from the bank to one
controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in New York in February halted the transfer
after Empresas Cablevision SA complained that assigning the loan
to Slim&#8217;s Banco Inbursa SA might reveal Cablevision&#8217;s
confidential information to a rival cable company owned by Slim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, is asking U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff to order Cablevision to consent to
assigning 90 percent of the $225 million loan to Banco Inbursa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cablevision&#8217;s refusal to consent to JPMorgan&#8217;s proposed
assignment to Banco Inbursa was unreasonable and therefore a
breach of the credit assignment,&#8221; JPMorgan said in its filing
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Televisa unit got the loan in December of 2007 to buy
Bestel SA, which operated a fiber-optic network in Mexico.
JPMorgan originally intended to syndicate the loan but didn&#8217;t do
so in 2008 because of the deteriorating credit market, according
to the ruling. Last year, the bank started efforts to sell the
loan to Inbursa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Inbursa is part of Grupo Financiero Inbursa SA,
controlled by Slim, as is Telefonos de Mexico SAB, or Telmex,
Mexico&#8217;s biggest land-line phone company. Telmex seeks to expand
into other telecommunications markets and is a primary
competitor of Cablevision, Rakoff said in the February ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irreparable Harm &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cablevision had shown it was likely to prevail on its claim
and a probability of irreparable harm, the judge said in
February. The participation agreement, under which the loan was
to be transferred, would enable Inbursa to use JPMorgan as a
vehicle for demanding Cablevision&#8217;s confidential information
&#8220;on a virtual unlimited basis,&#8221; according to Rakoff&#8217;s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa didn&#8217;t immediately comment, and a spokesman for
Slim didn&#8217;t return messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Empresas Cablevision v. JPMorgan, 09-9972, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. investment-
banking head Douglas Braunstein said his clients increasingly
asked bankers in recent weeks to &#8220;dust off&#8221; their work on old
takeover ideas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The requests signal the mergers and acquisitions
business, which dropped to the slowest in six years in 2009, may
rebound in the coming months, Braunstein, 49, said in a speech
to MA lawyers in New Orleans today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The number of inbound calls we have had from clients
who&#8217;ve said &#8216;Please dust off your work on the following target&#8217;
have increased dramatically in the last several weeks,&#8221;
Braunstein said. &#8220;Now in fairness, as all of you know in the
deal profession, there&#8217;s a long distance between the cup and
lip. You won&#8217;t see a real announced level of activity pickup
until quite frankly, at best, the second half of the year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies announced $1.78 trillion of takeovers in 2009,
the least since 2003 and less than half the record of $4.02
trillion reached in 2007, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. So far this year, MA is on pace for $1.96 trillion
of deals, or about 10 percent more than last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is hard not to conclude that activity level will be
better in 2010 than it was in 2009,&#8221; Braunstein said. &#8220;My
father always told me that it&#8217;s always easy to jump a low bar.
But quite frankly, if you want to begin progress you have to
step over that bar. I think for the markets, 2009 was a
remarkable period of healing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braunstein spoke at a conference hosted by Tulane
University Law School. New York-based JPMorgan was the world&#8217;s
third-biggest merger adviser in 2009, after Morgan Stanley and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market premiums that companies demand when selling
themselves are dropping, as fewer companies are trading close to
their 52-week lows and more are near 52-week highs, Braunstein
said. That trend will continue as takeover premiums remain
higher than historical averages, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The discussion on pricing in a sellers boardroom is a
very different discussion than it was a year ago,&#8221; Braunstein
said. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 79 percent from its
low in March 2009 through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The current MA market is now marked by cash-rich corporate
acquirers, an increase in hostile or unsolicited takeover offers
and the growing importance of buyers in emerging markets,
Braunstein said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria will hold talks with
international energy companies to address their concerns over a
proposed oil law, said Shehu Ladan, head of state-owned National
Petroleum Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The door is not yet closed,&#8221; Ladan told reporters today
in Lagos. &#8220;In the next couple of days we&#8217;ll be able to sit down
with all major oil companies and iron out finally those aspects
of the bill that they have problems with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed law seeks to change the way Nigeria&#8217;s oil and
gas industry is regulated and funded, creating &#8220;independent
joint ventures&#8221; that can raise investment funds from financial
markets while increasing taxes and royalties to the government.
Oil companies say the proposed fiscal regime makes it
unprofitable to invest in deep water offshore Nigeria. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp.,
Total SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures that produce most of
Nigeria&#8217;s oil in which National Petroleum, or NNPC, has an
average stake of 59 percent. Nigeria vies with Angola to be
Africa&#8217;s top oil producer and is the fifth-biggest source of
U.S. oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bill in its current form will cut about $50 billion in
planned investments from energy companies, Shell said Feb. 24.
While the proposed law will increase the government&#8217;s share of
oil revenue to 71.7 percent from 45 percent, Ladan said today.
That compares with 53.6 percent in the Gulf of Mexico, 73.1
percent in Angola and 74.9 percent in Norway, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ladan, who retired as a senior executive of the state oil
company last year, was appointed to the top job by acting
President Goodluck Jonathan on April 6, replacing Mohammed
Barkindo. Jonathan also fired former Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman
and appointed Diezani Allison-Madueke, a former executive of
Shell&#8217;s Nigerian unit, in his place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Xenon Capital Partners, an
investment company set up to advise Russian state-owned
companies on mergers and acquisitions in the energy industry,
plans to hire two bankers from JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stan Song and Hamid Gayibov quit JPMorgan last week and may
join three former colleagues from the U.S. bank&#8217;s MA energy
team in Moscow who are already at the firm, according to an e-
mailed statement from Moscow-based Xenon. A JPMorgan spokesman
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition for Moscow&#8217;s bankers is intensifying as the
Russian economy recovers from its worst contraction on record.
Credit Suisse hired five fixed-income specialists last month,
including three from Deutsche Bank AG, while Renaissance Capital
appointed Credit Suisse&#8217;s Nikolai Yukovich to run its emerging-
markets currency team. Otkritie Financial Corp., a local
brokerage part-owned by VTB Group, took on 18 people for its new
debt and currency market units last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenon said it needs more bankers to handle a &#8220;range of MA
mandates for state-owned corporates in the energy sector,&#8221;
describing Song as one of Russia&#8217;s &#8220;most reputable MA
bankers&#8221; and Gayibov as a &#8220;rainmaker&#8221; executive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s former head of investment banking in Russia,
Natalia Tsukanova, set up Xenon last year to advise Igor Sechin,
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin&#8217;s deputy for energy and chairman
of OAO Rosneft, the country&#8217;s largest oil company. Ex-JPMorgan
MA banker Kamil Burganov joined Xenon in February and another
colleague Anton Voronin came over in March, Burganov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty Hires &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenon is expanding as the government consolidates state
assets in industries including energy, aerospace and
shipbuilding to help reduce Russia&#8217;s dependence on oil and gas
exports, and prepares some for sale. Russia is combining six
state-owned regional airlines under OAO Aeroflot. State shipping
company Sovcomflot plans to sell shares in an initial public
offering in late 2010 or early 2011, Chief Executive Officer
Sergei Frank, a former transport minister, told reporters in
Moscow today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xenon plans to hire a total of 20 staff to focus on
consolidation in the domestic energy industry and later help
state-owned companies with foreign acquisitions, Burganov said.
The company has a London office which will eventually advise
companies seeking to list on the London Stock Exchange, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well as consulting on acquisitions, Xenon manages a $2
billion state-owned power utilities fund, Burganov said. The
fund, called Rusenergo, holds stakes in companies including OAO
Rushydro, Russia&#8217;s largest hydropower producer, and electricity
producers known as TGKs and OGKs, Burganov said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fund is focused exclusively on the power sector,&#8221;
Burganov said by phone. &#8220;But our MA advisory work for state-
owned companies will cover oil, gas, oil-services, utilities and
manufacturing sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. may
have grounds to sue Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Barclays Plc
after they demanded $1.2 billion in additional margin to assume
trading positions auctioned by a Chicago exchange, bankruptcy
examiner Anton Valukas said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the high bidder for Lehman&#8217;s equity
derivatives at options and futures exchange CME Group Inc., and
took $445 million of those assets at a private auction in
September 2008, according to previously censored details of
Valukas&#8217;s March 11 report. Barclays was the high bidder for
Lehman&#8217;s energy derivatives and took $707 million in assets from
CME. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DRW Trading was the highest bidder for Lehman&#8217;s foreign
exchange, agricultural and interest-rate derivatives, Valukas
said. The transfer of $2 billion in Lehman deposits for its
proprietary trades at the CME cost the defunct investment bank
$1.2 billion, Valukas said, adding that CME also may be sued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The examiner concludes that an argument can be made that
the transfers at issue were fraudulent transfers,&#8221; Valukas said
in the report, released in its unredacted form yesterday. Under
bankruptcy law, Lehman may be able to undo the auction, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of Valukas&#8217;s job was to explore Lehman&#8217;s grounds for
suing companies that contributed to, or benefitted unfairly
from, the demise of the investment bank and its affiliates
including the brokerage Lehman Brothers Inc., and to say which
kinds of lawsuits are most likely to succeed and what the
possible defenses are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Thus, LBI may have a colorable claim against CME, or any
of the firms that bought LBI&#8217;s positions at a steep discount
during the liquidation ordered by the CME, for the losses that
LBI sustained as a result of the forced sale of house positions
held for the benefit of LBI and its affiliates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CME could defend itself using the Commodity Exchange Act
that gave it power to regulate its exchanges, Valukas said.
Goldman and Barclays could use the same act to challenge
bankruptcy law, Valukas said. Bankruptcy law also has provisions
that might prevent Lehman from clawing back money, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge James M. Peck yesterday agreed
to allow previously redacted portions of the report to be
unsealed to test the fairness of the auction process. CME had
sought to keep the documents confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.2 billion loss to New York-based Lehman came from
additional cash that Goldman, Barclays and Chicago-based DRW
Trading demanded to offset the risk of taking on the failed
firm&#8217;s trading positions, said Craig Pirrong, a finance
professor at the University of Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael O&#8217;Looney, a Barclays spokesman, and Michael
DuVally, a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment. DRW Trading
strategist Lou Brien declined to comment on the potential
lawsuit, referring to a statement on its Web site saying it was
&#8220;pleased that we were able to provide competitive pricing for
these very large, complex and risky portfolios.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CME spokesman Allan Schoenberg declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuomo Rejected Greenberg&#8217;s Settlement Offers, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo rejected attempts to
settle a lawsuit against Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg, said a
lawyer for the former American International Group Inc. chief
executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York officials haven&#8217;t been willing to rekindle
settlement talks after an initial proposal fell apart following
AIG&#8217;s 2008 near-collapse, said David Boies, chairman of Boies,
Schiller  Flexner LLP. Greenberg, 84, who ran AIG for 38 years
until he was forced to retire in 2005, is accused of using sham
transactions to hide losses and inflate reserves at the New
York-based insurer. He has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;

judge, to get a negotiated resolution,&#8221; Boies said yesterday in
a phone interview. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been unable to get the attorney
general&#8217;s office to be willing to do that. When you have a
situation where they won&#8217;t listen to anybody, they&#8217;ll simply
make a demand and sit on that demand, there&#8217;s no resolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard Bamberger, a spokesman for Cuomo&#8217;s office, called
the information provided by Boies &#8220;inaccurate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will not comment about this ongoing matter,&#8221;
Bamberger said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued
Greenberg in 2005, alleging he and former Chief Financial
Officer Howard Smith misled regulators and investors. Spitzer
dropped portions of the suit in 2006 and Greenberg asked a court
to dismiss the rest. Cuomo inherited the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg has settled or won most of his other legal
disputes. In August, Greenberg agreed to pay $15 million to
settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission allegations that
he manipulated AIG&#8217;s earnings. AIG agreed in November to settle
suits and reimburse as much as $150 million of his legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential settlement between Greenberg and New York was
derailed in September 2008 when losses on soured housing market
bets forced the firm into a federal rescue that eventually
swelled to $182.3 billion. Assistant New York Attorney General
David Ellenhorn told New York State Supreme Court Justice
Charles Ramos at a hearing that the parties had reached a deal
with Greenberg and Smith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We reached an oral agreement,&#8221; Ellenhorn told Ramos at a
November 2008 hearing. &#8220;Then AIG went from $20, $30&#8221; a share
to &#8220;$2, $1, and, unfortunately the deal didn&#8217;t happen.&#8221;
Ellenhorn declined to provide details of the proposed
settlement, or why AIG&#8217;s share-price drop scuttled it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boies said yesterday he and another Greenberg lawyer,
Robert Morvillo, intend to ask Ramos at a scheduled April 20
hearing to either dismiss the suit or grant Greenberg&#8217;s motion
for summary judgment, which is a ruling before trial. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca Must Face Toprol Lawsuit, Judge Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; AstraZeneca Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s second-largest drugmaker, must
face a lawsuit over allegations it wrongly monopolized the
market for Toprol XL blood-pressure medicine, a federal judge
ruled in refusing to dismiss the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case stems from lawsuits filed in 2006 by drug
wholesalers and health and welfare funds contending the company
used unfair trade practices to monopolize the market for Toprol
-- in part by bringing sham patent-infringement lawsuits against
makers of low-cost generics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AstraZeneca asked Chief U.S. District Judge Gregory M.
Sleet in Wilmington, Delaware, to dismiss the actions. Sleet
said in an opinion yesterday the case is &#8220;fact-intensive&#8221; and
the plaintiffs &#8220;have adequately stated a claim&#8221; so the case
must continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed in the ruling, believe the claims are
unfounded and will vigorously defend ourselves at trial,&#8221; said
Blair Hains, an AstraZeneca spokesman at U.S. headquarters in
Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Metroprolol Succinate Litigation, 06-52,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theflyonthewall.com Says Business at Risk, Seeks Ruling Delay &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theflyonthewall.com said it may go out of business unless a
court delays a ruling that barred the online financial news
service from posting immediate reports about changes to stock
ratings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customers are canceling subscriptions because
Theflyonthewall.com can no longer issue immediate reports,
company President Ron Etergino said in a court filing yesterday.
He asked that the judge&#8217;s ruling from March be postponed until
the company&#8217;s appeal is decided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theflyonthewall.com &#8220;is presented with the day-to-day
challenge to remain in business during the pendency of its
appeal,&#8221; lawyers for the company said in a legal brief. A
ruling in its favor by the appeals court &#8220;would be of little
real significance if defendant is &#8216;put out of business&#8217; during
the appeal process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York ruled on March
18 that the company couldn&#8217;t post immediate online reports about
stock upgrades and downgrades by Barclays Plc, Bank of America
Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Marks, a lawyer for the banks, didn&#8217;t return a
call yesterday. Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment, as did Merrill spokesman Bill Halldin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks argued at a March trial that Theflyonthewall.com,
a Summit, New Jersey-based firm with about 30 employees,
wrongfully obtains and sells reports on changes to the banks&#8217;
stock evaluations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks accused Theflyonthewall.com of &#8220;free riding&#8221; on
research reports by sending headlines on upgrades and
downgrades. Each bank spends &#8220;hundreds of millions of dollars
per year in creating the research,&#8221; the judge wrote in her
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Barclays v. Theflyonthewall.com, 06-cv-04908,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seven Charged in U.K. Insider-Trade Ring Case Sent to Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven people, including former workers at UBS AG and
JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Cazenove unit, face a London trial on
insider-trading charges, a U.K. magistrate said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The City of London magistrates&#8217; court sent the case to
Southwark Crown Court for trial and said the seven could remain
on bail. The next hearing will take place on April 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seven are charged with dealing in shares of 12
companies, including Misys Plc and Enodis Plc, between 2006 and
2008 after gleaning information that originated at the banks,
according to the Financial Services Authority. They made a
profit of about 2.5 million pounds ($3.9 million), the regulator
said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charges follow arrests last month in a separate case
that ensnared London-based employees from Deutsche Bank AG,
Exane BNP Paribas and Moore Capital Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ali Mustafa, Pardip Saini, Paresh Shah, Neten Shah, Bijal
Shah, Truptesh Patel and Mitesh Shah were charged with a total
of 12 counts of insider trading by the FSA. Each face as long as
seven years in jail if convicted. Mitesh Shah has also been
charged in relation to money laundering through spread bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Katzen, Mustafa&#8217;s lawyer, and Stephen Smith, Mitesh
Shah&#8217;s lawyer, both declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No formal pleas have been entered in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barrick Fends Off Bid for Temporary Mine Closing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Barrick Gold Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest gold producer,
fended off an effort by American Indian tribes to stop
production at a Nevada mine with a court order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Larry R. Hicks in Reno, Nevada, denied
on April 13 the tribes&#8217; request to halt production at Barrick&#8217;s
Cortez Hills deposit until a trial in an environmental lawsuit.
The company can continue to mine, with limited restrictions it
proposed to follow an appeals court&#8217;s directions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The decision of the Ninth Circuit provides the court with
little guidance,&#8221; Hicks wrote, referring to the U.S. Court of
Appeals in San Francisco. &#8220;A limited injunction can adequately
address the risk to the environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s order is a great relief to all of us at
Barrick, especially to the many people who are directly employed
at Cortez Hills,&#8221; Greg Lang, president of Barrick&#8217;s North
American operations, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides are still preparing for a trial for which a
date probably will be set near the end of May, Roger Flynn,
founding director of the Western Mining Action Project, who
represents the Shoshone tribes, said last month. Flynn didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to a request for comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court told Hicks to issue an injunction,
leaving its scope up to him. The Indian tribes sought a
shutdown. Barrick persuaded the court to impose the less-severe
restriction of halting truck shipments of ore that must be
processed at the offsite plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is South Fork Band Council of Western Shoshone
of Nevada v. U.S. Department of the Interior, 08-cv-00616, U.S.
District Court, District of Nevada (Reno). The appeals court
case is South Fork Band Council of Western Shoshone of Nevada v.
U.S. Department of the Interior, 09-15230, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Fedorcik Says He Shared VNU-Deal Information &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Fedorcik, Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s global head of leveraged-
debt capital markets, shared information about a 2006 bond issue
with potential investors in the normal course of figuring out
how to structure the deal, he testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its first insider-trading case over credit-default
swaps, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Jon-
Paul Rorech, 39, a bond and credit-default swap salesman at
Deutsche Bank Securities, of illegally feeding the information
on the bond sale by Dutch media company VNU Group BV to Renato
Negrin, 46, a former Millennium Partners LP portfolio manager. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was my custom and practice to share information about
potential changes back and forth with the market&#8221; to get
feedback, Fedorcik testified yesterday at the trial in federal
court in New York. He said he didn&#8217;t believe he disclosed any
confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negrin bought swaps to reap a $1.2 million profit when the
2006 deal was announced, the SEC said in a complaint in May.
U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan is hearing the
nonjury trial, which began April 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency didn&#8217;t accuse Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank or
New York-based hedge fund Millennium of wrongdoing. Rorech is on
paid administrative leave from Deutsche Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Rorech,
1:09-cv-04329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N.Y. Judge Rejects Plea Deal for Ex-Merrill Broker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York state judge rejected a proposed plea deal for
former Bank of America Corp. Merrill Lynch broker Steven
Mandala, who is charged with stealing $780,000 from the firm and
using a chunk to buy a Ferrari. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting state Supreme Court Justice Carol Berkman yesterday
nixed a defense offer that Mandala plead guilty to the top
count, grand larceny, with a promised sentence of one to three
years behind bars if he made upfront restitution of about
$400,000, including about $300,000 cash and the proceeds of
auctioning off the sports car, for which he paid $245,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan District Attorney&#8217;s office had recommended
two to six years in prison, though prosecutor Vimi Bhatia didn&#8217;t
oppose Mandala&#8217;s offer in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I thought three to nine (years) was appropriate,&#8221;
Berkman said in rejecting the proposed deal. &#8220;You steal money.
You give it back. You buy yourself out of state prison. I don&#8217;t
get it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge set June 2 as a trial date. Before then, she
said, &#8220;Maybe you could make a submission to persuade me your
recommendation isn&#8217;t totally off track.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside the lower Manhattan courtroom, defense attorney
Franklin Rothman said his client has a &#8220;serious medical
condition&#8221; involving his heart that he would document for the
judge. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiquita Faces New Claims by Families Over Colombia Terrorism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chiquita Brands International Inc., owner of the namesake
banana label, was sued by hundreds of families who claim
relatives were kidnapped and murdered after the company helped
Marxist rebels in Colombia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint filed yesterday in federal court in West Palm
Beach, Florida, represents more than 240 people who were victims
of violence. The plaintiffs, using a 1992 law allowing Americans
to sue U.S. firms over terrorism-related deaths abroad, claim
that the company aided and abetted in the murders and provided
material support and resources to terrorists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company was fined $25 million after pleading guilty in
March 2007 to engaging in transactions with a terrorist group
for paying Colombian paramilitary militias $1.7 million from
1997 to 2004. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chiquita has already admitted to engaging in criminal
conduct that violated federal law by making systematic financial
payments to a foreign terrorist organization,&#8221; Lee Wolosky, a
Boies Schiller  Flexner LLP attorney for the plaintiffs, said
in a statement. &#8220;Yet it has refused to provide compensation to
the victims of terrorist atrocities made possible by its
regular, repeated and knowing financial support.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A representative for Cincinnati-based Chiquita didn&#8217;t
return a call seeking comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least seven other lawsuits have been filed since the
guilty plea. The company reached a settlement with shareholders
in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Angela Maria Henao Montes v. Chiquita Brands
International Inc., 10-cv-60573, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of Florida (West Palm Beach). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece Sued by EU Over Illegal Aid to ThyssenKrupp Shipyard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece faces a European Union lawsuit over 230 million
euros ($313 million) in illegal aid to Hellenic Shipyards, a
unit of Germany&#8217;s largest steelmaker, ThyssenKrupp AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hellenic Shipyards has to reimburse the money, plus
interest, because the government didn&#8217;t abide by conditions laid
out by the European Commission, the Brussels-based regulator
said yesterday in a statement. The commission said it is taking
the case to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In those cases where the aid is found to be illegal it
must be recovered swiftly to restore the level playing field and
to preserve the credibility of the rules themselves,&#8221;
Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ThyssenKrupp, which is selling assets and reducing its
workforce in a bid to return to profit this year, is in talks
with the Greek government and shipbuilder Abu Dhabi MAR over the
possible sale of the shipyard. In a separate deal, the
Duesseldorf, Germany-based steelmaker agreed yesterday to sell
maritime operations, including ship-repair and yacht-building
businesses, to the Abu Dhabi company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosima Rauner, a ThyssenKrupp spokeswoman, said she
couldn&#8217;t comment on whether the company would have to pay back
the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Konstantinos Pappas, a spokesman for Greece&#8217;s
representation to the EU in Brussels, declined to comment.
George Petalotis, a government spokesman based in Greece, wasn&#8217;t
available to comment when called on his mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madoff Victim Seeks $1.17 Million From Standard Chartered &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Hong Kong investor is seeking $1.17 million from a local
unit of Standard Chartered Plc after he allegedly bought shares
in an equity fund operated by Bernard Madoff based on advice
from a private banker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Li Kwok-heem&#8217;s investment in Fairfield Greenwich
Group, one of the funds used by Madoff to defraud investors,
shrunk to $1,600 by December 2008, after U.S. authorities froze
Madoff&#8217;s assets and a receiver was appointed to oversee the
fund, according to a writ filed in Hong Kong&#8217;s High Court on
April 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li bought shares in the fund in August 2005 based on a
recommendation from Amy Chau of American Express Bank, which was
renamed Standard Chartered International (USA) after it was
taken over by the London-based lender, the writ said. The bank
employs more than one person named Amy Chau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 71, pleaded guilty last year to orchestrating a $65
billion fraud and was sentenced to 150 years in prison for
running a Ponzi scheme that used money from new clients to pay
earlier investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information given by the bank to Li was &#8220;false&#8221;
because the fund wasn&#8217;t an &#8220;authentic investment,&#8221; according
to the writ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gabriel Kwan, a spokeswoman for Standard Chartered in Hong
Kong, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-JJ Unit Executive Pleads Guilty to Bribery, Gets 12 Months &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former executive at Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s U.K. unit, DePuy
International, pleaded guilty to taking part in paying 4.5
million pounds ($7 million) of bribes to Greek doctors. He was
sentenced to 12 months in jail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert John Dougall, 44, the former director of marketing
at Leeds, England-based DePuy, admitted in a London court
yesterday to paying commissions in advance on sales made by
Medec SA, a Greek distributor of the health care company&#8217;s
orthopedic products. Some of the money was used to make
&#8220;incentive payments&#8221; in an effort to persuade Greek surgeons
to use DePuy&#8217;s products, the U.K. Serious Fraud Office said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incentives &#8220;were no more than euphemisms to make
corrupt payments,&#8221; the SFO said. The money for the payments was
sent to an Isle of Man-registered company called Madison
Management Ltd., owned by the parent of Medec. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougall&#8217;s lawyer, Shaul Brazil, declined to comment.
Representatives for New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson 
Johnson weren&#8217;t available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dougall, who cooperated with the probe, didn&#8217;t seek or gain
any personal benefit from the payments, the SFO said. He was
charged in December with conspiracy to corrupt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Judge in Sudden-Acceleration Lawsuits Sets First Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge overseeing lawsuits against Toyota Motor Corp.
related to sudden acceleration ordered lawyers in the cases to
an initial conference in his Santa Ana, California, courtroom on
May 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota, the world&#8217;s largest automaker, is facing at least
180 consumer and shareholder lawsuits seeking class-action
status and at least 57 individual suits claiming personal
injuries or deaths caused by sudden-acceleration incidents. The
federal lawsuits were combined April 9 in a multidistrict
litigation, or MDL, before U.S. District Judge James V. Selna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge will oversee the lawsuits, deciding issues such
as evidence-gathering and allowable legal arguments. The May 13
hearing is an initial organizing conference, Selna said in a
court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selna&#8217;s scheduling was &#8220;a little quicker than normal,&#8221; W.
Mark Lanier, a lawyer for plaintiffs, said in an e-mail. &#8220;This
is a good sign that this judge will get out in front of this
litigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Lyons, a spokesman for Toyota&#8217;s U.S. sales unit, said
yesterday the company didn&#8217;t immediately have a comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Toyota City, Japan-based company has recalled more than
8 million vehicles for fixes related to sudden, unintended
acceleration. The automaker announced in September that it was
recalling 3.8 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles because of a
defect that may cause floor mats to jam accelerator pedals. The
company later recalled vehicles over defects involving the
pedals themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are combined as In Re. Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chief
global economist Jim O&#8217;Neill said the Chinese government may let
its currency become free floating within five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China has made noises about the renminbi being part of
the SDR from 2015,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill said in a Bloomberg Television
interview today, referring to the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s
Special Drawing Rights. &#8220;You can&#8217;t really be part of the SDR
unless you have completely free-floating exchange rates and free
capital markets. That would imply that those who make those
noises, primarily&#8221; the People&#8217;s Bank of China, are &#8220;pushing
for the next five years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s current 21-month peg to
the dollar is building as Chinese President Hu Jintao this week
meets with the leaders of Brazil, Russia and India in Brasilia
to discuss boosting trade in local currency and reforming the
international financial system. President Barack Obama said this
week that the U.S. considers the yuan to be &#8220;undervalued.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economic growth quickened to the fastest pace in
almost three years in the first quarter, data released today
showed, highlighting overheating risks that may prompt the
government to scrap the peg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;China is increasingly the most important, not only
emerging economy, but economy, full stop, in the world,&#8221;
O&#8217;Neill said. &#8220;These first-quarter numbers take it to being the
same size as Japan. If you look at their share of world trade,
the renminbi should definitely be a wider-used currency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan last year said the IMF&#8217;s SDRs
offer &#8220;light in the tunnel for the reform of the international
monetary system.&#8221; SDRs are a unit of account, based on a basket
of currencies, used in IMF transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting this week in Brasilia is the second heads-of-
state summit of the largest emerging economies, which includes
Brazil, Russia, India and China, or so-called BRIC nations, a
term coined by O&#8217;Neill in 2001. The leaders will discuss
broadening the array of world currencies used in international
trade as the four developing nations seek to lessen their
dependence on the U.S. dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lebanon&#8217;s Finance Minister Raya
Haffar el-Hassan sent a draft 2010 budget to the Cabinet today,
calling for a 16 percent increase in expenditure and a wider
deficit than last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal spending will rise to 20.29 trillion Lebanese pounds
($13.5 billion), while revenue increases 8.6 percent to 13.8
trillion, according to the proposals. The subsequent deficit is
equivalent to 10.7 percent of gross domestic product, compared
with about 8.6 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very disappointing that the political class did not
get its act together and work to reduce spending as the problem
is not on the revenue side, it&#8217;s related to spending,&#8221; said
Nassib Ghobril, head of research at Byblos Bank SAL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once supported by the Cabinet, the proposals will be sent
to parliament for discussion. If approved, it would become the
first ratified budget since 2005 because of political
disagreements, a month-long war with Israel and internal civil
strife. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposals call for an increase in taxes on interest
earned on bank deposits to 7 percent from 5 percent. They also
raise real estate registration fees for transactions worth more
than 750 million pounds to 7 percent from 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way Forward &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the highest deficit on record both in nominal
terms and as a percentage of GDP,&#8221; Ghobril added. &#8220;The
structural problems remain and have not been addressed.&#8221; The
government needs to restructure the electricity industry and
sell telecommunications assets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government spent $1.5 billion on subsidies to the
state-owned power company, Electricite du Liban, last year.
Plans to sell two state-owned mobile phone operators, which
previous governments had hoped would raise as much as $7
billion, were put on hold because of an 18-month political
crisis that eased in May 2008 and later by the global credit
crisis and parliamentary elections in June of last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Saad Hariri&#8217;s government, which was formed
in November, has to finance a public debt that reached $52
billion at the end of February, or about 147 percent of GDP.
Lebanon accumulated the debt as it rebuilt the country after a
15-year civil war that ended in 1990 and the conflict with
Israel in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service upgraded Lebanon&#8217;s local and
foreign currency bond ratings this week to B1, four levels below
investment grade. Standard  Poor&#8217;s rates Lebanon at B, five
levels below investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s economy will grow 7
percent this year, the best performance since 1986, as
industrial production and retail sales climb, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The growth forecast is up from a previous estimate of 6.2
percent and compares with a consensus projection of 5.6 percent
in a central bank survey of economists, JPMorgan&#8217;s Julio

&lt;p&gt;Consensus estimates will &#8220;move up appreciably,&#8221; Callegari

&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks rose, driving the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index to a 20-month high, as signs of growth in the
world&#8217;s three biggest economies and U.S. earnings reports buoyed
confidence in the global recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. gained 2.6 percent in Hong
Kong after China&#8217;s gross domestic product jumped. Toshiba Corp.,
which gets 17 percent of its revenue in North America, rose 3
percent as JPMorgan Chase  Co. and United Parcel Service Inc.
reported better-than-estimated profit. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc. advanced 1.6 percent in Tokyo, where central bank
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa told his regional managers the risk
of a return to a recession had diminished. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed 0.7 percent to 129.21
as of 5:08 p.m. in Tokyo, headed for its highest close since Aug.
1, 2008. The gauge has climbed 13 percent from its 2010 low on
Feb. 8 as economic data around the world beat economist
estimates and concerns over Greece defaulting on its debt eased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a beautiful set of numbers out of the U.S.
overnight,&#8221; said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment
strategy at AMP Capital Investors, which oversees $90 billion.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got good economic data showing consumers are jumping
back on board fairly solidly, pointing to further gains. That
doesn&#8217;t rule out the risk of a short-term correction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.6 percent and Hong
Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng Index increased 0.2 percent. Australia&#8217;s
SP/ASX 200 Index gained 0.1 percent. New Zealand&#8217;s NZX 50 Index
lost 0.4 percent even as a report showed the nation&#8217;s
manufacturing industry expanded for a seventh month in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the U.S. Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index dropped 0.1
percent. The gauge climbed 1.1 percent yesterday to the highest
level since September 2008 as a Commerce Department report
showed U.S. retail sales increased 1.6 percent last month,
surpassing the 1.2 percent advance estimated by economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum Corp. of China, also called Chalco, the country&#8217;s
biggest maker of the lightweight metal, rose 2.6 percent to
HK$8.82 in Hong Kong. China Coal Energy Co., the nation&#8217;s
second-largest coal producer, climbed 2.2 percent to HK$13.04
after saying it posted a 53 percent increase in raw coal output
in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s GDP rose 11.9 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, the country&#8217;s statistics bureau reported. That was
more than the median 11.7 percent estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 24 economists. Inflation also climbed less than
estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This set of macro data should not trigger near-term
policy changes, particularly an interest-rate hike,&#8221; Wendy Liu,
head of China research at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said
in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading Revenue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Tokyo, Mitsubishi UFJ gained 1.6 percent to 517 yen and
Shinsei Bank Ltd. climbed 8.9 percent to 135 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Concerns that the Japanese economy would drastically
deteriorate again have pretty much gone, although the pace of
pickup will probably remain moderate for the time being,&#8221;
Shirakawa said at the quarterly branch meeting in Tokyo today.
He repeated that beating deflation remains a &#8220;critical
challenge&#8221; and pledged to keep an &#8220;accommodative&#8221; policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks led gains in South Korea after Meritz
Securities Co. and Hyundai Securities Co. said the industry will
benefit from Moody&#8217;s Investors Service&#8217;s upgrade of the nation&#8217;s
credit rating yesterday. Hana Financial Group Inc. climbed 2.8
percent to 37,200 won in Seoul, while KB Financial Group Inc.
rose 3.1 percent to 57,400 won. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer Shipments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toshiba, Japan&#8217;s biggest maker of memory chips, rose 3
percent to 513 yen on optimism demand will rise in the U.S. The
stock also climbed as a Gartner Inc. report on global personal-
computer shipments topped estimates in the first quarter, rising
27 percent to 84.3 million units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TDK Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest maker of magnetic heads for
disk drives, gained 2.9 percent to 6,420 yen after Mizuho
Securities Co. raised its share-price forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canon Inc., which got 28 percent of its revenue last year
in the Americas, added 0.9 percent to 4,410 yen in Tokyo as the
U.S. retail sales report raised optimism that demand in that
country will pick up. Separately, the U.S. Federal Reserve said
the economy expanded &#8220;somewhat&#8221; across most of the U.S. in
March as consumer spending and manufacturing improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported
a 55 percent jump in first-quarter net income, helped by record
fixed-income trading revenue. Shares of UPS, the world&#8217;s largest
package-delivery company, jumped 4.7 percent in after-hours
trading after boosting its full-year profit forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mazda Motor Corp., which gets 30 percent of its sales in
North America, rose 0.8 percent to 265 yen. HSBC Holdings Plc,
which got 20 percent of its 2009 revenue there, advanced 2.2
percent to HK$84.30 in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With corporate earnings and the global economy getting
better, there is potentially substantial demand for shares,&#8221;
said Mitsushige Akino, who oversees the equivalent of $450
million in assets in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
&#8220;There are still many investors who haven&#8217;t bought yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of material producers in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index, the second-best-performing industry group in the past 12
months, rose 0.5 percent after crude oil for May delivery
climbed 2.1 percent yesterday, breaking a five-day losing streak.
A gauge of six metals advanced 1.2 percent in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Japan&#8217;s biggest nickel producer,
increased 1.6 percent to 1,444 yen. Woodside Petroleum Ltd.,
Australia&#8217;s second-biggest oil and gas producer, jumped 1.4
percent to A$47.50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baltic Dry &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cnooc Ltd., China&#8217;s biggest offshore energy explorer,
gained 3.1 percent to HK$14.06 in Hong Kong. Cnooc and Sinochem
Group may separately bid as much as $3 billion for a 40 percent
stake in a Brazilian oil field owned by Norway&#8217;s Statoil ASA,
two people with knowledge of the companies&#8217; plans said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., Japan&#8217;s second-biggest shipping
line, advanced 5.1 percent to 699 yen after a gauge of shipping
fees climbed the most in a month. Korea Line Corp., South
Korea&#8217;s second-biggest bulk carrier, advanced 5.5 percent to
61,300 won. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of shipping costs for
commodities, rose 1.3 percent yesterday, the biggest gain since
March 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index has gained 7.3 percent this
year, compared with an 8.6 percent jump by the SP 500.
Companies in the MSCI gauge trade at 1.7 times book value, the
highest level since September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There have been concerns about the stretched nature of
valuations, but the stellar earnings season so far has
thoroughly justified the performance,&#8221; said Chris Weston, a
Melbourne-based research analyst at IG Markets. &#8220;Economic data
has been in line, if not better, and pointing to a clear V-
shaped recovery. The biggest risk I see right now is over-
confidence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Latin America Index jumped 1.5 percent to 4,311.88.
In Brazil, preferred shares usually are the most-traded class of
stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3 BS): Brazil&#8217;s third-
largest steelmaker plans to reach an agreement this month with
Asian steelmakers about an initial public offering in CSN&#8217;s
iron-ore business, said the unit&#8217;s managing director, Charles

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s stock-index futures begin
trading tomorrow, giving investors a tool to hedge against
potential risks from an overheating economy and asset bubbles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts are part of China&#8217;s push to make more
investment options available to local investors and ease market
fluctuations after the Shanghai Composite Index slumped the most
among global markets this year following an 80 percent rally in
2009. They will be based on the CSI 300 Index, tracking the 300
biggest stocks on the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They can be used obviously for speculation but
importantly, they can also be used for hedging,&#8221; Hugh Young,
who helps oversee $232 billion of assets as head of equities at
Aberdeen Asset Management Plc in Singapore, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview. &#8220;Like all these instruments it depends on
how well you use them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai index has fallen 3.4 percent in 2010, making
it the worst performer in Asia, on concern the government will
tighten monetary policy to slow record lending growth and
soaring property prices. The government has twice this year
required banks to set aside a larger proportion of deposits as
reserves this year. The CSI 300 Index has fallen 4.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economic growth accelerated to the fastest pace in
almost three years in the first quarter, highlighting
overheating risks that may prompt the government to scrap the
yuan&#8217;s peg to the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Bubbles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year&#8217;s rally in Chinese stocks and property prices
have prompted analysts including former Morgan Stanley economist
Andy Xie to call the nation&#8217;s asset markets a bubble that will
burst once the government curbs credit. China is &#8220;on a treadmill
to hell,&#8221; with growth driven by the &#8220;heroin of property
development,&#8221; hedge fund manager James Chanos said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They do come with higher risks and volatility but I think
it&#8217;s the way markets develop,&#8221; Aberdeen&#8217;s Young said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading of stock-index futures on the China Financial
Futures Exchange in Shanghai follows the introduction of margin
trading and short selling on March 31. Shanghai, which has plans
to develop into an international financial center by 2020, may
start a board for listings by overseas companies later this year,
the China Daily newspaper reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell the CSI
300 Index at a preset value on an agreed date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors need a minimum 500,000 yuan to open an account to
trade stock-index futures, according to rules by the securities
regulator and the China Financial Futures Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising Liquidity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They must pay cash deposits equivalent to 15 percent of the
contract value for May and June contracts and 18 percent for
contracts for September and December. The contract values are
points of the CSI 300 multiplied by 300 yuan and the minimum
contract price movement is 0.2 point, according to the futures
exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading will be at the &#8220;expensive side of fair value&#8221; as
volumes will be limited initially, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said
in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under close monitoring by authorities, we expect a
gradual increase in liquidity, but even then we do not expect a
significant direct impact on the stock market,&#8221; Christopher
Eoyang and Jason Lui, analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading volumes for China&#8217;s local-currency A shares should
increase with the introduction of stock index futures, Jing
Ulrich, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s chairwoman for China equities and
commodities, said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has the world&#8217;s third largest stock market by market
capitalization, briefly overtaking Japan in July 2009. The U.S.
is the biggest by market cap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Challenge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s increased trading in equities from index futures
will help the nation challenge the U.S. as the world&#8217;s busiest
stock market, according to Guotai Junan Securities Co. and HSBC
Jintrust Fund Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s possible for China to surpass the U.S. in terms of
trading volumes, and index futures trading is one positive
factor that&#8217;s bolstering transactions,&#8221; Liang Jing, a Shanghai-
based analyst at Guotai, the nation&#8217;s second-largest brokerage
in terms of broking revenue, said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China currently restricts overseas investors to buying B
shares that trade in U.S. dollars in Shanghai and Hong Kong
dollars in Shenzen. China&#8217;s yuan-denominated A shares, are
mostly limited to local investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Telecom Corp. (TEL NZ), New Zealand&#8217;s biggest telephone

&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, who in 2001 coined the term BRIC to highlight the
growth potential of Brazil, Russia, India and China, said in an
interview yesterday in London he was pushing up his forecast on
the move from year-end because the currency is undervalued.
China may avoid a one-time gain that might endanger exports,
while allowing gradual appreciation by June 30 to curb inflation,
a survey of economists this week by Bloomberg News showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has pegged its currency at about 6.8 to the dollar
since July 2008, which some U.S. lawmakers say gives the world&#8217;s
fastest-growing major economy an unfair trade advantage. The
currency will strengthen 3.1 percent to 6.62 per dollar by year-
end, according to the median estimate among the 19 economists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the U.S. Congress hadn&#8217;t been so noisy about this in
the past month, it probably would have already happened,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill, who has discussed the distortions caused by the dollar
peg with Chinese officials in visits to Beijing. &#8220;It just makes
an enormous amount of sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve-month non-deliverable yuan forwards strengthened 0.1
percent to 6.6161 per dollar as of 12:40 p.m. in Hong Kong. The
contracts reflect bets the currency will appreciate 3.2 percent
from the spot rate of 6.8257. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accelerating Economy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday
that a more flexible yuan would help the world&#8217;s third-largest
economy keep inflation under control. Bernanke, responding to
questions from Senator Charles Schumer, a Democrat from New York,
said Chinese authorities are also subject to pressure from
exporters who want to keep the yuan low against the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is seeking a &#8220;stable yuan&#8221; to control hot money
flows, Yao Jian, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, told
reporters today. Residential and commercial real-estate prices
in 70 cities climbed 11.7 percent in March from a year earlier,
the most since data began in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy grew 11.9 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, more than the median 11.7 percent estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists. The consumer-price index
gained 2.4 percent last month, compared with 2.7 percent in
February, the statistics bureau reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabinet Caution &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s cabinet said &#8220;rapid&#8221; first-quarter growth was
largely driven by stimulus policies and a comparison with a low
level a year earlier, suggesting officials may be cautious in
ending crisis policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The environment for economic development is extremely
complex,&#8221; the cabinet said in a statement on a government Web
site yesterday evening after a meeting chaired by Premier Wen
Jiabao. &#8220;The economic rebound still faces many difficulties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure on China to end the yuan&#8217;s peg is also building as
BRIC leaders get ready to meet this week in Brasilia to discuss
boosting trade in local currency and coordinating positions on
reforming the international financial system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Americans dare to speak about this,&#8221; said Stephen
Green, head of China research at Standard Chartered Bank Plc in
Shanghai. &#8220;Other countries take a quiet line on the renminbi but
obviously those countries have exporters who would like to grow
their business as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. revised
its estimate for U.S. second-quarter economic growth to 3
percent from 2 percent and dropped its forecast for the jobless
rate to climb past 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. unemployment will be in a range of 9.5 percent to 10
percent through the end of 2011, Ed McKelvey, the company&#8217;s
senior U.S. economist, wrote in an e-mail. The unemployment rate
was 9.7 percent in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable investment bank,
is sticking to its view that GDP growth will slow to a 1.5
percent pace during the second half of 2010, according to the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While our expectations for overall growth beyond mid-year
have not changed, we have modestly upgraded our forecast for
consumer spending, with offsets in housing activity, state and
local spending, trade improvement, and inventory accumulation,&#8221;
wrote McKelvey, who is based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, bouncing cats and a
needy Santa Claus are subjects of song parodies on Harry
Shearer&#8217;s scathing new album about Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Greed and Fear&#8221; contains nine tunes on the economic
meltdown, including &#8220;Mr. Goldman and Mr. Sachs,&#8221; &#8220;Bailout for
Santa&#8221; and &#8220;Dead Cat Bounce.&#8221; Musical styles range from the
Beach Boys harmony of &#8220;Little GM&#8221; to the Lady Gaga sound of
&#8220;Bonus Baby,&#8221; which is sung by Shearer&#8217;s wife, Judith Owen.
Along with financial terms like CDOs and swaps, the lyrics
mention everyone from President Barack Obama to actor David Schwimmer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently spoke on the phone with Shearer, 66, a
multimedia writer/performer whose regular gigs include a
nationally syndicated radio show and myriad voices on &#8220;The
Simpsons.&#8221;  The Spinal Tap bassist was in New Orleans (where he
has a home) working on a documentary about Hurricane Katrina
that will be released this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warner: There haven&#8217;t been many great songs about Wall
Street, so why do this album? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shearer: It came to my attention that we were going through
what one might politely call an economic hiccup. I thought the
personalities and the language that started coming to the fore
deserved some dose of ridicule. And my favorite method of
ridicule recently has been the comic song. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world&#8217;s
largest retailer, reclaimed the top spot from Exxon Mobil Corp.
in the Fortune 500 ranking of biggest companies, based on annual
revenue, the magazine announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest oil company, dropped to second
place on the list after the U.S. recession eroded demand for its
motor fuels and drove bargain-seeking consumers to Wal-Mart&#8217;s
discounts. Exxon was No. 1 a year ago after surrendering the
spot to Wal-Mart in 2007. Chevron Corp. remained in third place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two banks climbed in the rankings to join the top 10, while
homebuilders disappeared from the Fortune 500 and automaker
General Motors Co. dropped below the largest 2 percent of
companies for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the nation&#8217;s largest lender, which
acquired Merrill Lynch  Co., and JPMorgan Chase  Co. marked
the only two newcomers to the top 10 this year. Bank of America,
based in Charlotte, North Carolina, rose to 5th place from 11th.
JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, jumped to 9th
from 16th on fixed-income trading gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart pulled in $408.2 billion in revenue last year,
compared with $275.6 billion for Irving, Texas-based Exxon,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Exxon reported a profit
of $19.3 billion, topping Wal-Mart&#8217;s $14.3 billion in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, fell 4.7 percent
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading last year. Exxon
dropped 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM, the Detroit-based automaker that reorganized in a
government-aided bankruptcy last year, fell to 15th place from
6th, the first time since the list began in 1955 that the
company didn&#8217;t make the top 10, according to Fortune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart, Exxon and GM are the only three companies to have
topped the Fortune 500 list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co. engaged in the
same investor fraud that the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission accused Goldman Sachs Group Inc. of committing,
according to a bank that sued the firm in New York last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA, known
as Rabobank, claims Merrill, now a unit of Bank of America
Corp., failed to tell it a key fact in advising on a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation. Omitted was Merrill&#8217;s
relationship with another client betting against the investment,
which resulted in a loss of $45 million, Rabobank claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill&#8217;s handling of the CDO, a security tied to the
performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities,
mirrors Goldman Sachs conduct that the SEC details in the civil
complaint the agency filed yesterday. It claimed Goldman omitted
the same key fact about a financial product tied to subprime
mortgages as the U.S. housing market was starting to falter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the tip of the iceberg in regard to Goldman Sachs
and certain other banks who were stacking the deck against CDO
investors,&#8221; said Jon Pickhardt, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
Urquhart Oliver  Hedges, who is representing Netherlands-based
Rabobank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two matters are unrelated and the claims today are
not only unfounded but weren&#8217;t included in the Rabobank lawsuit
filed nearly a year ago,&#8221; Bill Halldin, a Merrill spokesman,
said yesterday of the Dutch bank&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Lench, head of the SEC&#8217;s Structured and New
Products unit, said yesterday that the agency &#8220;continues to
investigate the practices of investment banks and others
involved in the securitization of complex financial products
tied to the U.S. housing market as it was beginning to show
signs of distress.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failed to Disclose &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, the SEC said New York-based Goldman
Sachs, which had a record $13.4 billion profit last year, failed
to disclose to investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was
betting against the CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the
selection of securities for the portfolio. Paulson, which
oversees $32 billion and didn&#8217;t market the CDO, wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, created and sold CDOs tied to subprime mortgages
in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered, without
disclosing that Paulson helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against them, the SEC said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC allegations are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact, and we
will vigorously contest them,&#8221; Goldman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch&#8217;s arrangement involved Magnetar, a hedge fund
that bet against a CDO known as Norma, Rabobank claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Effort to Replicate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When one major firm becomes aware of the creative
instrument of others, there is historically an effort to
replicate them,&#8221; said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in
private practice in Potomac, Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on whether it
is investigating Merrill&#8217;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norma&#8217;s largest investor was investment bank Cohen  Co,
with more than $100 million in notes, according to Rabobank&#8217;s
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill loaded the Norma CDO with bad assets, Rabobank
claims. Rabobank seeks $45 million in damages, according to a
complaint filed in state court in June 2009. Rabobank initially
provided a secured loan of almost $60 million to Merrill,
according to its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risks Disclosed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill countered in court papers that Rabobank was aware
of the risks, which were disclosed in the transaction documents.
The bank should have been responsible for conducting its own due
diligence, and shouldn&#8217;t have relied on Merrill, it said in a
court filing last year seeking to dismiss the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Lipin, an outside spokesman for Magnetar, didn&#8217;t
immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-
Boerenleenbank, B.A. v. Merrill Lynch  Co, 09-601832, New York
State Supreme Court (New York County). &lt;/p&gt;

May Face Investor Lawsuits on Goldman Sachs CDO, Lawyers Say</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co. may be sued by
investors who lost more than $1 billion on a mortgage-linked
deal that regulators say was sold by Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
without disclosing the hedge-fund firm&#8217;s role, lawyers said.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Goldman Sachs yesterday was accused of fraud by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to tell clients
that Paulson, run by billionaire John Paulson, helped pick the
mortgage-backed securities that underpinned the investment,
known as a collateralized-debt obligation. Neither Paulson nor
his firm was accused of any wrongdoing in the SEC&#8217;s complaint.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Paulson  Co. shorted the CDO, a bet its value would fall,
meaning the New York-based firm stood to profit by choosing
securities it expected to default, the SEC said in its civil
complaint. Goldman Sachs told clients the securities included in
the deal were selected by ACA Management LLC, an independent
third party, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Paulson was intentionally putting dreck into the CDO,
and doing so for the purpose of shorting it, then that could
constitute fraud,&#8221; said Ross Intelisano, a lawyer at Rich 
Intelisano LLP in New York who has represented clients in fraud
lawsuits against hedge funds. While the case against Goldman is
stronger, he said, &#8220;if I were repping a Goldman client, I&#8217;d
likely include Paulson in a suit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that it didn&#8217;t sue Paulson  Co. because it
was Goldman Sachs&#8217;s job to disclose to investors how the CDO was
constructed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Opens the Door&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was Goldman that made the representation to investors,
Paulson did not,&#8221; Robert Khuzami, enforcement director at the
SEC, said yesterday in a conference call with reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There haven&#8217;t been many investor lawsuits on these kinds
of deals,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, a partner at New York-based
Paykin Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;This opens the door to civil claims
across a number of transactions,&#8221; including the Goldman CDO, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co. wasn&#8217;t involved in the marketing of the
investment, called Abacus 2007-ACI, and didn&#8217;t have authority
over selecting the portfolio of residential mortgage-backed
securities on which it was based, the firm said yesterday in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Paulson did not sponsor or initiate Goldman&#8217;s Abacus
program, which involved at least 20 transactions other than that
described in the SEC&#8217;s complaint,&#8221; the firm said. Thomas Walek,
a spokesman for Paulson, declined to comment beyond the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Entirely Typical&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co. provided input into the underlying securities
of the CDO, along with ACA and investor IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG, New York-based Goldman Sachs said yesterday in
a statement. Such discussions were &#8220;entirely typical of these
types of transactions,&#8221; and ACA, which also invested in the
CDO, chose the portfolio, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s accusations are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact,&#8221;
Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co. is the world&#8217;s third-biggest hedge fund, with
$32 billion in assets, thanks in large part to its bet that
subprime mortgages would tumble. The trade earned the firm
roughly $3 billion in fees in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s Advantage Plus fund, its largest, jumped 160
percent that year on the back of the subprime wager. The firm&#8217;s
Credit Opportunities funds, which held the biggest chunk of
Paulson&#8217;s bet, were up 600 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, 54, started the New York-based firm in 1994, after
stints at Bear Stearns  Co. and Gruss Partners. His initial
focus was betting on the shares of merging companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Paulson investor said he isn&#8217;t worried about the firm&#8217;s
involvement with the Goldman Sachs CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So far there&#8217;s no cause for concern for us with regards
to Paulson because he hasn&#8217;t been indicted or shown to have done
anything wrong,&#8221; said Jean Keller, chief executive officer of
3A SA, a Geneva-based firm that invests in hedge funds on behalf
of clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a jump
in the cost to protect bank bonds as U.S. regulators sued the
firm for fraud related to subprime-mortgage securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs rose the most in a
year after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the
bank misstated and omitted key facts about collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market started to falter in 2007. The SEC&#8217;s charges are
&#8220;completely unfounded,&#8221; New York-based Goldman Sachs said in a
statement distributed by Business Wire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on other banks, from Deutsche Bank AG to Citigroup
Inc. and Morgan Stanley, also rose on concerns the probe may
bolster efforts in Washington to crack down on the securities
industry.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It creates uncertainty,&#8221; said Ricardo Kleinbaum, a credit
analyst at BNP Paribas in New York. &#8220;The real point is how it
affects regulation and oversight of the securities industry. It
does give Washington more ammunition to tighten regulation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman climbed 35 basis points to
130.5 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank rose 9.5 basis
points to 93.5 basis points, the most in a year, CMA prices
show. Contracts on Morgan Stanley jumped 17.5 to 139, those on
Citigroup rose 14 to 137, and swaps on Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch unit increased 18.5 to 141. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ripple Effects &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s headline risk, and it&#8217;s not good for the whole
sector,&#8221; said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and economics
research at Stamford, Connecticut-based Aladdin Capital Holdings
LLC, which oversees $12.5 billion. &#8220;It&#8217;s like someone took a
giant stone and threw it into a pond, and it&#8217;s going to ripple
outward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk climbed
the most in 10 weeks. Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, jumped 5.3 basis points to a mid-price of 87.3
basis points, according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark yesterday reached the lowest since Jan. 14
after declining for the sixth straight day, CMA prices show. The
index typically rises as investor confidence deteriorates and
falls as it improves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by U.S. regulators for fraud tied to collateralized debt
obligations that contributed to the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. The firm&#8217;s shares tumbled 13 percent and
financial stocks slumped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles, the
Securities and Exchange Commission said today. Billionaire John
Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the trade and wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing. The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs
vice president who helped create the CDOs, known as Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was
betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which
mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while
telling other investors that the securities were selected by an
independent, objective third party.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs became emblematic of public outrage at the
banking industry after posting a record $13.4 billion
profit in 2009, a year after receiving $10 billion in
taxpayer aid during the financial crisis. It repaid the
funds in June. The company, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, has been criticized by lawmakers
and pundits for issues from its pay practices to its role in
helping Greece mask the size of its debts. It called the SEC&#8217;s
claims &#8220;unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Stocks Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Civil charges and the disgorgement are not the issue --
the threat to Goldman is reputational,&#8221; said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. The danger is
to &#8220;ultimately its market share with its prized institutional
and corporate clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs, based in New York, dropped $23.57,
or 13 percent, to $160.70 as of 4:02 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange trading. It marked the biggest one-day decline since
Jan. 20, 2009, and pushed the value of Warren Buffett&#8217;s options
to buy Goldman Sachs shares down by $950 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s &#8216;Integrity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s chief executive officer,
got the warrants on $5 billion of Goldman Sachs stock as part of
an agreement that extended financing to the bank during the
depths of the 2008 credit crisis. The deal reflected Buffett&#8217;s
belief in &#8220;not just the strength of Goldman but its
integrity,&#8221; Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director said this week
in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect against a default on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
debt jumped 30.5 basis points, or 0.305 percentage point, to
120.5 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s charges are completely unfounded in law and
fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and
its reputation,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm put together the Abacus deal in 2007, a year in
which Goldman Sachs earned a then-record $11.6 billion, a figure
it surpassed in 2009, when it earned $13.4 billion. Goldman
Sachs paid Blankfein $68.5 million for 2007 -- $600,000 in
salary, plus a $67.9 million bonus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the SEC&#8217;s complaint, Tourre, now 31, sent an
e-mail to a friend in January 2007 saying, &#8220;The whole building
is about to collapse&#8221; in reference to CDOs tied to subprime
mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fabulous Fab&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab standing in the
middle of all these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he
created without necessarily understanding all of the
implications of those monstrousities!!!&#8221; Tourre wrote in the e-
mail, according to the SEC. The agency didn&#8217;t identify the
recipient of the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached at his London office today, Tourre declined to
comment. &#8220;I need to jump, thank you, goodbye,&#8221; he told
Bloomberg News before hanging up. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a
lawyer for Tourre at Allen  Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. Tourre,
a graduate of Ecole Centrale Paris, one of France&#8217;s top
engineering schools, and Stanford University, joined Goldman
Sachs in July 2001, according to his LinkedIn profile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Tourre knew it would be difficult, if not
impossible, to sell the CDO if they disclosed to investors that
Paulson played a significant role in selecting the collateral
and was also betting against it, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Surreal&#8217; ACA Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also knew that at least one potential investor,
Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, wasn&#8217;t
likely to invest in a CDO that didn&#8217;t have a collateral manager
to analyze and select the portfolio, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2007, Goldman Sachs approached ACA Management
LLC, a firm that analyzes credit risk, to select the portfolio
for a CDO transaction sponsored by Paulson. In an internal memo
on March 12, 2007, Goldman said it would &#8220;leverage ACA&#8217;s
credibility and franchise&#8221; to help distribute the transaction,
the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, Tourre and a representative from ACA met in
February 2007 to discuss assets that would be included in the
residential-mortgage backed security, the SEC said. While
Paulson and Tourre knew Paulson intended to short the security,
ACA wasn&#8217;t in the loop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am at this ACA meeting,&#8221; Tourre wrote in an e-mail to
an unidentified Goldman Sachs employee during the meeting.
&#8220;This is surreal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s &#8216;Extensive Disclosure&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also said that it lost more than $90 million
because it had an investment in the deal, overwhelming the $15
million it made in fees. The firm said it provided &#8220;extensive
disclosure&#8221; to IKB and ACA about the risk of the underlying
mortgage securities. Goldman Sachs never told ACA that Paulson
was going to be a &#8220;long&#8221; investor in Abacus, and ACA selected
the underlying securities, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co., which oversees $32 billion, said in a
statement that the fund didn&#8217;t make any misrepresentations
connected to the Abacus deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While Paulson purchased credit protection from Goldman
Sachs on securities issued under the Abacus ABS CDO program we
were not involved in the marketing of any Abacus products to any
third parties,&#8221; the New York-based firm said. &#8220;ACA as
collateral manager had sole authority over the selection of all
collateral in the CDO.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson could be the target of investor lawsuits now that
the SEC is investigating how Abacus was put together, said
Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for two bond insurers
and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin Krieg  Adams LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There haven&#8217;t been many investor lawsuits on these kinds
of deals,&#8221; Adams said. &#8220;This opens the door to civil claims
across a number of transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost at
least 4 percent today as all 27 companies in the SP 500
Diversified Financial Index declined. In Europe, Deutsche Bank
AG dropped 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of Warren Buffett&#8217;s
options to buy Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shares dropped by $1.02
billion after regulators sued the bank for misleading clients on
the sale of securities tied to the subprime mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The warrants, which give Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
the right to buy New York-based Goldman Sachs common stock for
$115 a share, were worth about $1.99 billion at 4:01 p.m., down
34 percent from $3.01 billion yesterday. Goldman Sachs dropped
$23.57, or 13 percent, to $160.70 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chief executive officer, got the
warrants on $5 billion of Goldman Sachs stock as part of an
agreement that extended financing to the bank during the depths
of the 2008 credit crisis. The deal reflected Buffett&#8217;s belief
in &#8220;not just the strength of Goldman but its integrity,&#8221;
Ronald Olson, a Berkshire director said earlier this week in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Historically, Goldman has had distinguished leadership
and has played by the rules,&#8221; Olson said in an e-mailed
statement today. &#8220;Without prejudging the SEC lawsuit, if it
hasn&#8217;t played by the rules in this case, I would be
disappointed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire fell $1,350, or 1.1 percent, to $118,400. Buffett
didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail request for comment sent to his
assistant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misstated and Omitted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs misstated and omitted key facts about a
financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market was starting to falter, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s charges are completely unfounded in law and
fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and
its reputation,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. The
firm lost more than $90 million on the transaction, and is
&#8220;disappointed&#8221; the SEC would bring this action in the face of
an &#8220;extensive record which establishes that the accusations are
unfounded in law and fact,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a separate
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We did not structure a portfolio that was designed to
lose money,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, a longtime Wall Street critic, has praised Goldman
Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein for his stewardship during the
recession. Buffett, 79, served as interim chairman and CEO of
Salomon Inc. in 1991 and 1992 as the company sought to recover
from involvement in a Treasury debt-auction scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Reputation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s not pleased,&#8221; said Gerald Martin, a
finance professor at American University&#8217;s Kogod School of
Business in Washington. &#8220;He wants to make sure the managers do
the right thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett&#8217;s firm rose to first place this month in Harris
Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate reputations as the
financial crisis pushed the nation&#8217;s biggest banks toward the
bottom of the list. Goldman Sachs came in 56th out of 60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t look at Wall Street as &#8216;evil,&#8217;&#8221; Buffett said in
an interview last year conducted by the CEO of Business Wire,
the Berkshire subsidiary that posts corporate press releases.
&#8220;I look at Wall Street as given to huge excess sometimes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs turned to Buffett in September 2008, agreeing
to sell $5 billion in preferred shares paying 10 percent
interest, after the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy and
emergency takeover of Merrill Lynch  Co. by Bank of America
Corp. The investment amounted to an explicit endorsement of
Goldman Sachs from Buffett, the so-called Oracle of Omaha who is
celebrated for his investing savvy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s sales of
collateralized debt obligations are &#8220;an area of interest and
concern&#8221; for the U.S. commission investigating the financial
crisis, the panel&#8217;s chairman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will continue to look into these kinds of practices
and particularly with a view as to whether or not they were
pervasive or unique,&#8221; Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission
Chairman Phil Angelides said in an interview today. &#8220;Our job is
to raise significant issues and to investigate them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission for fraud tied to CDOs that contributed to the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression. The firm&#8217;s shares
tumbled as much as 16 percent today and financial stocks
slumped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs tied to subprime
mortgages in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against them, the SEC said in a
statement today. Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1
billion on the trade and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. The SEC
also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president who
helped create the CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s charges are completely unfounded in law and
fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and
its reputation,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelides, 56, declined to say whether he was informed
about the SEC suit beforehand. &#8220;We&#8217;re in constant discussions
with other entities,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;January Questioning &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a January hearing, Angelides questioned Goldman Sachs
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein on the firm&#8217;s sales of
mortgage-backed securities that it bet would eventually fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It sounds to me a little bit like selling a car with
faulty brakes and then buying an insurance policy on the buyer
of those cars,&#8221; Angelides told Blankfein. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t seem to
me that that&#8217;s a practice that inspires confidence in the
markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 55, said Goldman Sachs is a market-making firm
that acquired securities, including mortgages, that were
repackaged and sold to clients, and sometimes at a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We represent the other side of what people want to do,&#8221;
Blankfein said at the Jan. 13 hearing. &#8220;Because we had this
risk, because we were accumulating positions which, by the way,
we acquired from clients who want to sell them to us, we have to
go out ourselves and provide and source the other side of the
transactions so that we can manage our risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Says Hedge Fund Had No Authority Over Goldman's CDO Assets</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co., the New York-based
hedge-fund firm run by billionaire John Paulson, said it had no
authority over the selection of assets linked to a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. mortgage security from whose decline it later
profited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was sued today by U.S. regulators for fraud
tied to collateralized debt obligations that contributed to the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The bank,
based in New York, created and sold a CDO tied to subprime
mortgages in early 2007 together with Paulson, who bet against
some of the underlying securities, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman told investors that ACA Management LLC, a firm that
analyzes credit risk, selected the portfolio and didn&#8217;t disclose
that Paulson helped pick the underlying debt, according to the
SEC. Paulson&#8217;s $32 billion firm, which wasn&#8217;t accused of any
wrongdoing, earned about $1 billion on the trade, according to
the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said today in
a statement, adding that the securities were subsequently rated
AAA by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs considers the allegations by the SEC to be
&#8220;unfounded&#8221; and it plans to &#8220;vigorously contest them and
defend the firm and its reputation,&#8221; it said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hard to Sell &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs, based in New York, dropped $23.57,
or 13 percent, to $160.70 as of 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange trading, the biggest one-day decline since Jan. 20,
2009. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell 1.6 percent to
1,192.13, the most since Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Fabrice Pierre Tourre, the 31-year-old
Goldman trader accused alongside the bank, hired ACA because
they knew they probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to sell the liabilities
of the CDO if they disclosed that a short seller, such as
Paulson, played a role in selecting the collateral, the SEC
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs also knew that at least one significant
potential investor, IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, was unlikely
to invest in the liabilities of a CDO that did not utilize a
collateral manager to analyze and select the reference
portfolio,&#8221; the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;This Is Surreal&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late 2006 and early 2007, Paulson analyzed more than 100
bonds it considered likely to run into trouble, and told Goldman
Sachs that it wanted those or similar securities included in the
reference portfolio of the CDO. When representatives of Paulson
and ACA met in New York on Feb. 2, 2007, to discuss the
underlying securities, ACA was unaware that Paulson planned to
bet against them, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;During the meeting, Tourre sent an e-mail to another
Goldman Sachs employee stating, &#8216;I am at this ACA Paulson
meeting, this is surreal,&#8217;&#8221; according to the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, reached by phone in London today, declined to
comment. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at Allen
 Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A message left for Ray Brooks, the chief executive officer
of ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. in New York wasn&#8217;t immediately
returned. A group of former CDO counterparties to transactions
guaranteed by ACA now control the company as the result of a
restructuring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs parcel fixed-income assets such as bonds or loans and
slice them into new securities of varying risk intended to
provide higher returns than other investments with the same
rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Typical&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, whose bets against subprime mortgages helped
generate about $3 billion of profit for the firm in 2007,
rejected Wells Fargo  Co. subprime mortgage bonds for the CDO
because the quality of underlying loans was generally considered
high, according to the SEC complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo has since become the biggest U.S. home lender.
Wells Fargo spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson and ACA agreed on the underlying securities for the
CDO on Feb. 26. In an internal memo on March 12, 2007, Goldman
said it would &#8220;leverage ACA&#8217;s credibility and franchise&#8221; to
help distribute the transaction, the SEC said. None of the
marketing materials distributed to investors mentioned Paulson&#8217;s
role, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The portfolio of mortgage backed securities in this
investment was selected by an independent and experienced
portfolio selection agent after a series of discussions,
including with Paulson  Co., which were entirely typical of
these types of transactions,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said in a
statement. &#8220;ACA had the largest exposure to the transaction,
investing $951 million. It had an obligation and every incentive
to select appropriate securities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1 Billion Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction closed on April 26, 2007, and Paulson paid
Goldman Sachs about $15 million for structuring and marketing
the CDO, named ABACUS 2007-AC1. By Jan. 29, 2008, 99 percent of
the reference securities had been downgraded and investors in
the CDO lost about $1 billion, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson said it didn&#8217;t &#8220;sponsor or initiate Goldman&#8217;s
ABACUS program.&#8221; While the hedge fund purchased credit
protection from Goldman Sachs on securities tied to the program,
it wasn&#8217;t involved in marketing ABACUS products to third
parties, Paulson said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s efforts
to defend its reputation just became a lot harder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55,
spent the last year trying to defend the firm against criticism
from politicians, media and other commentators that Goldman
Sachs profited in the aftermath of the financial crisis and sold
investors securities that went sour. Now the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission says the company defrauded investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit filed today alleges that Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t
stick to its longstanding claim that &#8220;clients&#8217; interests always
come first,&#8221; and instead failed to tell investors that the
securities Goldman Sachs was selling them had been designed to
fail by another client, hedge fund Paulson  Co., which profited
from the losses. Goldman Sachs said it will contest the charges,
which it called &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk is long-term reputational,&#8221; said Benjamin
Wallace, an analyst at Grimes  Co. in Westborough,
Massachusetts, which manages $900 million and doesn&#8217;t own
Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;People are going to be more inclined to
look at Goldman Sachs and think, &#8216;Who&#8217;s on the other side of
this trade?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell as much as 16 percent in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading and the cost to protect against a
default on the firm&#8217;s debt jumped 30.5 basis points, or 0.305
percentage point, to 120.5 basis points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients&#8217; Interests &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a list of &#8220;Business Principles&#8221; posted on the
company&#8217;s Web site, the No. 1 item is &#8220;Our clients&#8217; interests
always come first.&#8221; In their annual letter to shareholders last
week, Blankfein and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn insisted
that most of the firm&#8217;s business is aimed at serving
sophisticated clients capable of making their own decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investors who transacted with Goldman Sachs in CDOs
in 2007, as in prior years, were primarily large, global
financial institutions, insurance companies and hedge funds,&#8221;
the letter said. The firm &#8220;did not know whether the value of
the instruments we sold would increase or decrease.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That contrasts with the SEC&#8217;s allegations. The suit says
Fabrice Tourre, a 31-year-old vice president at Goldman Sachs,
knew that Paulson&#8217;s firm had helped select the assets backing a
collateralized debt obligation called Abacus 2007-AC1, even as
Paulson planned to bet on it failing. The SEC says Tourre misled
a collateral manager, ACA Management LLC, and an investor, IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, about Paulson&#8217;s role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;False and Misleading&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marketing materials for Abacus 2007-AC1 were false and
misleading because they represented that ACA selected the
reference portfolio while omitting any mention that Paulson, a
party with economic interests adverse to CDO investors, played a
significant role in the selection of the reference portfolio,&#8221;
the SEC argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, reached today at his office in London, where he is
now an executive director, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once upon a time, Wall Street firms protected clients,&#8221;
Christopher Whalen, a bank analyst at Torrance, California-based
Institutional Risk Analytics, wrote in a note to investors
today. &#8220;This litigation exposes the cynical, savage culture of
Wall Street that allows a dealer to commit fraud on one customer
to benefit another.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Swimming With Sharks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s loyalty to clients has been questioned
before. E-mails released by congressional investigators earlier
this week show that Washington Mutual Inc.&#8217;s former CEO, Kerry
Killinger, didn&#8217;t want to hire a Goldman Sachs banker in 2007 to
help with the bank&#8217;s credit problems before it collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are smart, but this is swimming with sharks,&#8221;
Killinger wrote in an Oct. 12, 2007, e-mail to a deputy. &#8220;They
were shorting mortgages big time while they were giving CfC
advice,&#8221; he added, referring to Countrywide Financial Corp.,
the home lender that ran short of cash the same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs said they sold only to sophisticated
investors, but the damage they did was so pervasive that
unsophisticated investors got snared in their web too,&#8221; said
Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance Inc. in
Chicago. &#8220;They say they are men of integrity and competence,
and that makes what they do all the more craven.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Cohan, a former investment banker who is writing a
book about Goldman Sachs, said the accusations are surprising
because the firm generally is diligent when it comes to legal
disclosures. That the suit names none of Tourre&#8217;s superiors may
signal that senior management can escape blame, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Four Critical Points&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It just strikes me as being entirely out of the firm&#8217;s
character, as much as people like to hate them, because they are
much too careful on the whole legal front and disclosure
front,&#8221; Cohan said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has &#8220;only named a VP, it&#8217;s not going up the chain
here at the moment, so I think that&#8217;s an important distinction
to make,&#8221; Cohan said. &#8220;There are bad apples in any firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Goldman Sachs made what it called &#8220;four
critical points&#8221; in its defense against the SEC&#8217;s accusations.
The first was that Goldman Sachs itself lost more than $90
million because it had an investment in the deal that
overwhelmed the $15 million it made in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said it provided &#8220;extensive disclosure&#8221; to IKB
and ACA about the risk of the underlying mortgage securities. It
said that ACA, whose $951 million investment made it the most
exposed to risk, selected the portfolio. And the firm disputed
the SEC&#8217;s accusation that Goldman Sachs told ACA that Paulson 
Co. was going to be an investor in the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson Statement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s firm, which hasn&#8217;t been charged with any
wrongdoing, said in a statement that &#8220;ACA as collateral manager
had sole authority over the selection of all collateral in the
CDO&#8221; and that Paulson didn&#8217;t &#8220;sponsor or initiate&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s
Abacus program. The fund says that while it did purchase credit
protection from Goldman Sachs on some Abacus securities, it
wasn&#8217;t involved in the marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said the SEC&#8217;s focus on Goldman Sachs, which
set a new Wall Street profit record last year, shows that the
firm is under a political and regulatory spotlight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the moment, it looks as if the SEC is pursuing an
agenda aimed specifically at Goldman,&#8221; Chris Kotowski, a
managing director at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York, wrote in a
note to clients. &#8220;We believe that GS is probably vulnerable to
more charges and outsized fines, and we are for now downgrading
the stock to perform from outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, one investor said he saw today&#8217;s stock price
drop as a buying opportunity because he thinks Goldman Sachs is
likely to successfully defend itself against the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the cosmic scheme of things, it&#8217;s probably more of a
buying opportunity than anything else,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino,
a senior portfolio manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati, which manages about $13 billion, including Goldman
Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market reaction reflects &#8220;the grand fear that
somewhere down the line you end up with a RICO suit, and then
you might as well fold up,&#8221; he said, referring to the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. &#8220;I&#8217;m just happy that
it wasn&#8217;t the FBI kicking in the door.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;     April 16 (Bloomberg) --&#160;For bearish options traders, the
Securities and Exchange Commission couldn&#8217;t have picked a better
day to charge Goldman Sachs Group Inc. with fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puts giving the right to sell Goldman shares at $175 before
today&#8217;s close, which were worth 3 cents yesterday, soared to
$14.15 for the biggest gain among options on the stock. Goldman
shares fell 13 percent to $160.70 in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything moves in an exponential manner on expiration
day when you have unexpected news like this,&#8221; said Steve Quirk,
managing director of trading at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. in
Chicago. &#8220;This is a very good example of why you cover short
options even if they&#8217;re worthless and 10 or 20 percent away from
the current trading price near expiration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs plunged the most in almost three months after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the New York-
based firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations
that contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April $165 puts jumped to $4 from 1 cent yesterday.
Those contracts traded more than 29,000 times, almost double the
number of outstanding options before today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold and commodities including oil
and sugar tumbled the most since February after U.S. regulators
filed a fraud suit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of Wall
Street&#8217;s biggest traders and brokers of raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not good for commodities,&#8221; said Michael Pento,
the chief economist at Delta Global Advisors who correctly
predicted the 2008 price collapse in raw materials. &#8220;It could
be the case that traders stop making trades with Goldman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Goldman
created and sold securities linked to subprime mortgage-backed
securities. The firm failed to disclose to investors that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the instruments and
influenced the selections in the portfolio, the SEC said.
Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Feb. 28, Goldman was the largest commodity brokerage
by adjusted net capital, the minimum needed to meet the
requirements set by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
according to data from the agency. The investment bank&#8217;s shares
tumbled as much as 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 31, Paulson was the largest holder of the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund back by the metal,
and Goldman was the 11th biggest. Both are based in New York.
Paulson is also the top investor in AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.,
Africa&#8217;s largest producer of bullion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Big Bettor&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures slumped 2 percent, the most since Feb. 4, to
$1,136.90 an ounce in New York. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index
of 19 raw materials fell 1.2 percent to 276.29, the biggest
decline since Feb. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Paulson has been a big bettor on gold,&#8221; said Pento, who
also helps create investment vehicles, including agriculture
ETFs. &#8220;If this fetters the ability of the fund to keep adding
positions, or forces them to do some asset sales, it&#8217;s going to
be bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson wasn&#8217;t included in the fraud charges because it
didn&#8217;t make misrepresentations to investors about
collateralized-debt obligations, Robert Khuzami, an enforcement
director at the SEC, said on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan Prelog, a Paulson spokesman, said he couldn&#8217;t
comment. The company oversees $32 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said the claims by the SEC are &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;To the Sidelines&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you implicate the largest player on the Street,
nothing good can come of it,&#8221; said Dennis Gartman, an economist
and the editor of the Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a hedge- fund manager, and I have to manage the drama
taking place. The best place to go is to the sidelines.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver dropped 4.1 percent and crude oil fell 2.7 percent.
The declines were the most in 10 weeks. Sugar tumbled more than
5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anybody who has anything to do with, touches, feels,
smells Goldman, they&#8217;re getting out,&#8221; said Ron Lawson, a
managing director at Logic Advisors in Sonoma, California.
Commodities are falling &#8220;on the fear of the unknown,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks slumped, halting a six-day rally, and European
stocks plummeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The news has hit like a bomb on the financial and
commodity markets,&#8221; said Michael McDougall, a senior vice
president at Newedge USA, a broker in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said markets will rebound and the fraud case
will have a limited impact on Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not a Backbreaker&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a backbreaker for Goldman,&#8221; said Michael
Guido, the director of hedge-fund sales at Macquarie Capital USA
Inc. in New York. &#8220;They&#8217;re going to get fined and the markets
will move on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRB index has dropped 2.5 percent this year, while gold
has climbed 3.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any time things go legal and legislative, some people do
see it as the time to put the lid on things and get out of the
markets, but this will be short-lived,&#8221; said Pete Sorrentino,
who helps manage $12.8 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in
Cincinnati. &#8220;There are a lot of other trading houses that will
be able to step in and provide liquidity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dollar may weaken as fraud
charges against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. add to pressure on the
U.S. financial system, forcing the Federal Reserve to keep
interest rates at record lows longer than anticipated, according
to currency fund manager Axel Merk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed needs a healthy banking system so they&#8217;re
unlikely to tighten further,&#8221; Merk, president of Palo Alto,
California-based Merk Investments LLC, which oversees more than
$550 million in assets, said in an interview. &#8220;This should hurt
the dollar more than the others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greenback has rallied 6 percent versus the euro this
year on expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates
before the European Central Bank, as fiscal debt issues limit
European growth. The dollar fell 5.6 percent against the shared
currency in the second quarter of 2009 after the Fed began
purchasing debt securities as a way of lowering interest rates
and pumping cash into the financial system, a policy known as
quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seemed like the rest of the world had problems and the
U.S. was the least of the evils,&#8221; said Merk, who is based in
Palo Alto, California. &#8220;Now the rest of world is addressing its
challenges while the U.S. is deteriorating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable firm, was sued
today by U.S. regulators for fraud tied to collateralized debt
obligations that contributed to the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs called the SEC&#8217;s claims
&#8220;unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar rose 0.5 percent to $1.3509 per euro, from
$1.3573 yesterday. Futures trading on the CME Group exchange
showed a 44 percent chance that the Fed will raise its target
rate for overnight bank lending by at least a quarter-percentage
point by its November meeting, down from 50 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shares
posted the biggest loss since January 2009 after the Securities
and Exchange Commission charged the bank with fraud related to
packaging and selling collateralized debt obligations linked to
subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs tumbled 13 percent to $160.70, the lowest
price since March 3. The most profitable firm in Wall Street
history erased its gain for 2010 and drove Bank of America
Corp., Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase  Co. to losses
exceeding 4.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit comes as President Barack Obama is trying to
pass the most sweeping overhaul of financial regulations since
the 1930s. The proposed legislation would mean stronger
oversight of derivatives trading and hedge funds, a consumer
financial-protection authority and a system for unwinding large
systemically important firms when they fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Regulatory risk just got a lot bigger,&#8221; said Paul
Miller, a former bank examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia who&#8217;s now an analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp.
in Arlington, Virginia. &#8220;People are wondering whether Goldman
was the only company that had a senior vice president lying and
misrepresenting a security, and the market&#8217;s thinking, &#8216;Probably
not,&#8217;&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the market is selling off on:
the unknown.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Completely Unfounded&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said today that New York-based Goldman Sachs
created and sold CDOs tied to subprime mortgages in early 2007,
as the U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against them. Goldman Sachs said the claims are
&#8220;completely unfounded.&#8221; Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on New York-based Goldman Sachs rose
41.5 basis points, the most since November 2008, to 131.5 basis
points, according to CMA DataVision prices. Banks, brokerages
and insurers in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index collectively
sank 3.8 percent for its biggest decline since Feb. 4. Class B
shares of Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which paid
$5 billion for Goldman Sachs warrants in September 2008,
retreated 1.7 percent to $78.72. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank by assets, fell 5.5
percent to $18.41 even after posting its first profit in three
quarters amid gains from Merrill Lynch  Co.&#8217;s investment
banking. JPMorgan shares, which rallied earlier this week after
the bank beat analysts&#8217; first-quarter profit estimates, slumped
4.7 percent to $45.55. Morgan Stanley slid 5.6 percent to
$29.16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Old and Simple&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was
betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which
mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio, while
telling other investors that the securities were selected by an
independent, objective third party.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Germany&#8217;s largest lender, fell 7.3
percent to 55.99 euros for the biggest retreat in more than
eight months. UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank by assets,
slipped 2.8 percent to 17.93 Swiss francs. BNP Paribas SA,
France&#8217;s biggest bank, slumped 3.8 percent to 55.35 euros. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, said it completed the world&#8217;s longest well from a
fixed offshore platform, boosting production off California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The well from the Heritage platform in federal waters west
of Santa Barbara reaches 7,000 feet (2,134 meters) below sea
level and extends 6.3 miles (10 kilometers) horizontally,
Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output from the well in the Santa Inez field will be
equivalent to 5.8 million barrels of oil, enough for the annual
energy consumption of about 144,000 Californians, the company
said. Exxon Mobil and environmental groups in 1995 agreed on
measures to protect people and marine life during exploration
from its existing platforms in Santa Inez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said in a Feb. 1 conference call that the well
had been drilled a total of more than 37,000 feet, a North
American record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil fell 33 cents to $67.93 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares are little changed

&lt;p&gt;Cotton and orange juice tumbled as
equities halted a six-day rally after regulators accused Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. of fraud linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials fell,
heading for the biggest drop in seven weeks. The Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index slid after the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said Goldman Sachs sold a collateralized-debt
obligation using misleading statements that left out key facts.
The SEC claimed investors in the CDOs lost more than $1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs has shaken up virtually all markets,
including cotton,&#8221; Mike Stevens, an independent cotton analyst
and trader, said by e-mail. &#8220;Since buying in cotton this week
has been primarily speculative, it was quite vulnerable to
sympathetic selling, and sell stops were triggered.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotton for July delivery fell 0.53 cent, or 0.6 percent, to
81.59 cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. The most-
active contract climbed 4.5 percent this week, the biggest
weekly advance since Feb. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is one of Wall Street&#8217;s biggest traders and
brokers of raw materials. The CDOs involved in the SEC lawsuit
were constructed in 2007 using mortgage bonds tied to subprime
loans, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rejected the government&#8217;s claims as
&#8220;completely unfounded&#8221; in a statement. The New York-based
bank&#8217;s shares dropped as much as 16 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the week ended April 6, hedge-fund managers and other
large speculators increased their net-long position, or bets on
rising cotton futures, by 8.2 percent, government data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on ICE, orange-juice futures for July delivery dropped
0.8 cent, or 0.6 percent, to $1.3265 a pound. The commodity rose
2.2 percent for the week, the first gain in five weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sugar tumbled more than 5 percent,
leading commodities lower, after the U.S. filed a fraud suit
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc., one of Wall Street&#8217;s biggest
traders and brokers of raw materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index of 19 agricultural, energy
and metal prices headed for the biggest drop in seven weeks. The
Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman of defrauding
investors in financial products tied to subprime mortgages. U.S.
equities also slumped the most since February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sell-off is because of Goldman,&#8221; said Michael K.
Smith, the president of TK Futures  Options in Port St. Lucie,

&lt;p&gt;The following text is a selection
of excerpts from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
complaint filed today against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Fabrice Tourre, a vice president at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbreviations in the document include CDOs for
collateralized debt obligations; RMBS for residential mortgage-
backed securities; GS  Co for Goldman Sachs  Co., the
principal United States broker-dealer of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.; and ACA for ACA Management LLC, a firm that analyzes
credit risk. ABACUS 2007-AC1 is the name of a collateralized
debt obligation the SEC said Goldman Sachs helped create for
hedge fund client Paulson  Co. LLC to bet against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC on Tourre&#8217;s role: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tourre was principally responsible for ABACUS 2007-AC1.
Tourre devised the transaction, prepared the marketing materials
and communicated directly with investors. Tourre knew of
Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed short interest and its role in the
collateral selection process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, quoting from portions of an email in French and
English sent by Tourre to a friend on Jan. 23, 2007: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More and more leverage in the system, The whole building
is about to collapse anytime now &#8230; Only potential survivor, the
fabulous Fab[rice Tourre] . . . standing in the middle of all
these complex, highly leveraged, exotic trades he created
without necessarily understanding all of the implications of
those monstrosities!!!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC on the role of hedge fund Paulson  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After participating in the selection of the reference
portfolio, Paulson effectively shorted the RMBS portfolio it
helped select by entering into credit default swaps (&#8220;CDS&#8221;)
with GS  Co to buy protection on specific layers of the ABACUS
2007-AC1 capital structure. Given its financial short interest,
Paulson had an economic incentive to choose RMBS that it
expected to experience credit events in the near future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, quoting a Paulson employee it didn&#8217;t name: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is true that the market is not pricing the subprime
RMBS wipeout scenario. In my opinion this situation is due to
the fact that rating agencies, CDO managers and underwriters
have all the incentives to keep the game going, while &#8216;real
money&#8217; investors have neither the analytical tools nor the
institutional framework to take action before the losses that
one could anticipate based [on] the &#8216;news&#8217; available everywhere
are actually realized.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG fell the most
since July, leading European financial stocks lower, after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by U.S. regulators for fraud
tied to packaging and selling collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German bank slid 4.39 euros, or 7.3 percent, to 55.99
euros in Frankfurt trading, while Switzerland&#8217;s UBS AG declined
2.8 percent and BNP Paribas SA of France retreated 3.8 percent.
The 52-member Bloomberg Europe Banks and Financial Services
Index fell 2.6 percent, the biggest drop in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs misstated and omitted key facts about a
financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market was beginning to falter, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement today. The SEC also sued Fabrice
Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The entire financial sector dropped after the Goldman
news,&#8221; said Dirk Becker, an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets
in Frankfurt, said by telephone today. &#8220;This is bad for the
sentiment of banks if regulators start taking a closer look at
where banks made their money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market in 2007
sparked the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression,
leading to more than $1.7 trillion in writedowns at financial
firms and government bailouts worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC continues to investigate the practices of
investment banks and others involved in the securitization of
complex financial products tied to the U.S. housing market as it
was beginning to show signs of distress,&#8221; Kenneth Lench, head
of the SEC&#8217;s structured and new products unit, said in today&#8217;s
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Goldman Sachs said the &#8220;charges are
completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation,&#8221; according
to a statement from the company. Deutsche Bank spokesman Ronald
Weichert declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s Vedika
Bhandarkar will join Credit Suisse Group AG as vice chairman
and head of investment banking operations in India, the Wall
Street bank&#8217;s second senior departure in the country in a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse also hired JPMorgan&#8217;s Sandeep Pangal who will
report to Bhandarkar as a managing director, spokesman Adam
Harper said by phone today. Bhandarkar will report to Mihir
Doshi, Credit Suisse&#8217;s India head. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zurich-based Credit Suisse, which ranks 24th in advising
Indian stock sales, aims to grow the business tapping rising
investor demand for equities in the country. JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. lender by assets, lost the vice chairman of
its India business, Kaku Nakhate, last month after she left to
become country head for Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;India is central to our strategy and we are confident
that Vedika and Sandeep can build on our momentum to take the
business to the next level,&#8221; Vikram Malhotra, Credit Suisse&#8217;s
co-head of investment banking for Asia Pacific, said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhandarkar joined JPMorgan in India in 1998 and Pangal
joined the following year. While at JPMorgan the two worked
together advising on deals including NTT DoCoMo Inc.&#8217;s $2.7
billion stake in Tata Teleservices Ltd. in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far this year, JPMorgan is No. 8 in advising on stock
sales in India, behind firms including Citigroup Inc., UBS AG,
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bhandarkar will also report to Vikram Malhotra and Helman

&lt;p&gt;Bo Vavrusa was heaping dirt into
the path of a wildfire on a Texas ranch in October 2007 when his
tractor rammed an Exxon Mobil Corp. natural-gas pipe hidden in a
thicket. Flames engulfed the tractor, burning his face, arms and
hands as he fled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I thought I was fixing to die,&#8221; said Vavrusa, 28, who
was earning $10 an hour to groom the ranch for quail and dove
hunters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the biggest U.S. oil producer, has neglected this
stretch of Texas since its oil fields began drying up in the
1970s, said Jerry Patterson, the state&#8217;s General Land Office
Commissioner. Now Patterson and other state officials are urging
Texas lawmakers to follow the examples of California and
Pennsylvania in cracking down on oilfield practices that have
left leaking pipelines, wells and storage tanks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oozing chemical pits and Vavrusa&#8217;s scarred skin are
emblematic of a legacy Exxon has sought to keep buried in court,
even as it gears up for a return to active exploration within
miles of the ranch through its pending $29.3 billion acquisition
of Fort Worth, Texas-based XTO Energy Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s renewed focus on North America follows nationalist
energy policies in Venezuela and Russia that reduced
opportunities to profit abroad. It coincides with fresh scrutiny
in the U.S. that is leading Congress to examine whether stricter
drilling regulations are needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil&#8217;s &#8216;Ugly Side&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This isn&#8217;t something the states are proud to advertise,&#8221;
said Philip Dellinger, chief of the groundwater section in the
Austin, Texas, office of the Environmental Protection Agency.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the ugly side of the oil and gas business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA says it has no authority to force companies to
address contamination on active fields and must defer to Texas
regulators, who let oil companies determine if sites need
cleanup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pennsylvania, where the petroleum industry was born with
Edwin Drake&#8217;s 1859 discovery of crude, Governor Ed Rendell more
than doubled the number of well inspectors and has asked the
legislature to impose more than $400 million in new taxes on
companies pumping gas from the Marcellus Shale, a geologic
formation that extends from New York to Ohio and holds enough of
the fuel to supply the entire U.S. for 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think the whole future of oil and gas in this country
depends on the companies having to pick up the last mess,&#8221; said
Elizabeth Burns, 43, who lives with her family on the Encinitos
Ranch where Vavrusa was injured. &#8220;Places like Pennsylvania and
New York need strong laws or this is what they&#8217;re going to
get.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depression-Era Leases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatives of Burns and her husband, Stephen, own the ranch
and much of the Kelsey oilfield beneath it. They&#8217;ve filed a
lawsuit against Exxon and Chevron Corp., which pumps oil and gas
on a smaller section of the spread. The suit accuses the
companies of damaging tens of thousands of acres and failing to
abide by 1930s-era leases they say require operators to keep
equipment clear of vegetation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it spent $1.6 million last
year on remediation at the ranch and has conducted numerous soil
and water tests to mitigate environmental risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are a responsible operator and refute any accusations
that suggest otherwise,&#8221; said David Eglinton, an Exxon
spokesman. &#8220;We currently have crews working to remove unneeded
facilities and, where appropriate, remediate affected areas to
applicable regulatory standards.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the largest U.S. oil company after Exxon, &#8220;denies
these unsubstantiated allegations and intends to defend itself
in the litigation,&#8221; said Mickey Driver, a spokesman for the San
Ramon, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expensive Slog &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a judge finds Exxon and Chevron liable, they could be on
the hook for hundreds of millions of dollars, based on cleanup
costs incurred at other companies&#8217; oil fields in California. The
lawsuit is going to be an expensive slog, said Jeff Weems, a
Houston-based oil and gas lawyer who has represented BP PLC,
Europe&#8217;s second-biggest oil company, in Texas courts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The legal route is a very long and difficult row to hoe
for an individual landowner,&#8221; said Weems, a Democrat who&#8217;s
running in November for a seat on the commission that regulates
the Texas oil and natural-gas industry. &#8220;They generally don&#8217;t
have the resources to seriously take on the big oil companies
that have legal departments that rival the largest law firms in
size and quality.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Encinitos spread, located 40 miles from the Mexican
border, is dotted with scores of still-active gas pipes obscured
by brush and saplings that haven&#8217;t been cut. Beneath the dirt,
the Burns family has found leaks and dumps they blame for
undrinkable water and dead trees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defunct Equipment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pollution from decades-old wells and waste pits isn&#8217;t
isolated to their ranch or Exxon. There are more than 100,000
old wells in Texas that haven&#8217;t been capped and thousands of
defunct gas-processing plants, compressor stations and related
equipment that have never been dismantled, according to the
Texas Land and Minerals Owners Association, which represents
1,200 ranchers, farmers and individuals who own stakes in oil
and gas fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty common problem in Texas,&#8221; said John B.
McFarland, an oil and gas attorney at Graves Dougherty Hearon 
Moody in Austin who has represented landowners with claims to
300,000 acres around the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Benavides, a rural town 60 miles north of the Burns&#8217;s
homestead, local officials sent residents letters in late 2008
warning them their drinking water contains as much as four-and-
a-half times as much arsenic as is considered safe by the U.S.
EPA. Arsenic can cause skin damage, circulatory problems and
cancer, the letter warned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contamination Migrates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contamination may have migrated from a defunct oilfield
on the north end of town, where sludge and other waste from
wells was dumped in open dirt pits for decades, said J.T.
Garcia, president of the Duval County Conservation and
Reclamation District. He doesn&#8217;t know who operated the field,
which stopped pumping crude in the 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Burns&#8217;s ranch, which covers an area equal to the size
of Brooklyn, is just one example of the lingering environmental
damage across swaths of south, west and east Texas from what
were once regarded as acceptable oilfield practices, said
Patterson, the commissioner with the Texas General Land Office,
which oversees oil leases that help fund the state&#8217;s schools and
universities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;d just dig a pit and put the oil in it and then
they&#8217;d haul it off later, or maybe they wouldn&#8217;t haul it off
later, depending on the price of oil at the time,&#8221; said
Patterson. &#8220;That was the norm, and nobody said anything about
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy Metals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the 1950s and &#8216;60s, oil companies filtered out some
byproducts at the wellhead and dumped the refuse in dirt pits.
That meant contaminants later buried when bulldozers covered the
holes had higher concentrations of petroleum-laced substances
and heavy metals than they otherwise would have, according to
the Burnses and an environmental survey of the ranch carried out
by Amistad Environmental LLC at the behest of the family&#8217;s
lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which pumps more oil than every member of OPEC
except Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq, declined to discuss the
Burns lawsuit. The company has paid the family $19 million over
the past two decades in the form of royalties, Eglinton said.
Exxon has invested $190 million in development of the field
since the lease was signed in 1935, extracting 130 million
barrels of crude and 980 billion cubic feet of gas during that
time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s presence in south Texas has enriched ranchers
and their communities, Eglinton said. Exxon paid $890 million in
taxes and royalties to the state in 2008, and Brooks County,
where the largest chunk of the Encinitos Ranch sits, relies on
oil and other mineral taxes for 70 percent of its school and
local government budgets, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price of Pollution &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those benefits came with a price measured in pollution that
has languished, partly because state laws and regulatory
agencies aren&#8217;t designed or equipped to police environmental
performance in the oil patch, said Weems and other critics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas Railroad Commission that oversees the state&#8217;s oil
and natural-gas industry allows companies to hire their own
environmental consultants to check for contamination. Tests on
the Burns property conducted for Exxon by Netherlands-based
Arcadis NV gave the site a clean bill of health, said Ramona
Nye, a spokeswoman for the Austin-based commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Burns had a different assessment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They buried it, muck and all,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeanna Blatt, a Highlands Ranch, Colorado-based spokeswoman
for Arcadis, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC&#8217;s Predecessor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The railroad commission, created in 1891 to regulate
shipping rates, had its authority expanded to the nascent Texas
oil industry in the early 1900s, when rampant drilling glutted
world markets with crude and prices tumbled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission began restricting how much each well in the
state could produce, in a bid to prevent another free-fall in
prices. When the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
was formed in 1960, the railroad commission was its model,
according to the Texas State Historical Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a mistake to have an agency that was originally set
up to serve the industry now being asked to police the industry
as its environmental regulator,&#8221; said McFarland, the oil and
gas attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Texas legislature isn&#8217;t inclined to crack down on the
oil industry either, said Kelly Mcbeth, a legislative strategist
at Texas Energy Lobby, an Austin-based firm that represents
petroleum companies. Even wells that produce just a trickle of
oil or gas are revenue generators for the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;An Economic Driver&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Legislators do everything they can to keep those wells on
line,&#8221; Mcbeth said. &#8220;They&#8217;re an economic driver for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EPA doesn&#8217;t intervene in pollution cases on active
oilfields in Texas, said Dave Bary, a spokesman for EPA Region
6, which encompasses Texas, four other states and 65 American
Indian tribes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The railroad commission has primacy over active
oilfields,&#8221; Bary said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which had 2009 sales of $276 billion that dwarfed
the economic output of all but 33 of the world&#8217;s nations, wants
to seal the records in the Burns lawsuit, filed in December
2007. If Judge Richard C. Terrell of Texas&#8217;s 79th Judicial
District grants the company&#8217;s request, it would shield from
public view the details of how the company has operated on the
land. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The mindset of a major oil company is that they shouldn&#8217;t
have to compromise and you should be scared of them,&#8221; said
Roger S. Braugh Jr., the Sico, White, Hoelscher  Braugh LLC
attorney representing the Burns family. &#8220;To prove our case,
ultimately we&#8217;re looking at spending tens of millions of dollars
on environmental studies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the Land &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit demands unspecified cleanup costs and seeks to kick
the oil companies off the land for breaching leases signed in
the 1930s, said Braugh, who&#8217;s based in Corpus Christi, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vavrusa, the former ranch hand who now works for a company
that tests pipeline meters, sued Exxon and the ranch for
unspecified damages. Exxon failed to cut the vegetation that hid
the gas line from view, and the ranch family didn&#8217;t warn him the
line was there, he claimed in his suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Eglinton said it was premature for the company to
comment on that suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cleaning up a contaminated oil patch involves either
excavating the soil and trucking it away, or fencing off the
area to keep people out, said John Evans, chief civil engineer
for Cannon Associates, a San Luis Obispo, California-based
remediation firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Cleaning &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In California, the third-biggest oil-producing state after
Texas and Alaska, state agencies and regulators have been
pushing oil companies to clean up old fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unocal Corp. was forced to spend $100 million to dig up a
half-mile of oceanfront and to demolish and rebuild eight blocks
of Avila Beach, California, starting in 1995 after subterranean
pipelines leaked crude, gasoline and diesel, said Evans, who
worked on the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cleanup stemmed from a lawsuit filed by the California
Regional Water Quality Control Board, according to a Unocal
filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A yacht
club, retail stores and pier had to be rebuilt at the company&#8217;s
expense. Unocal is now part of Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At another former Unocal operation in California, the
state&#8217;s Department of Fish and Game, the water quality board and
the Department of Toxic Substances Control successfully sued the
company over contamination of the Guadalupe field 160 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, public filings showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerosene Leaks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cleanup so far has cost $200 million to $300 million
since digging began in 1994, Evans said. Before the field was
shut in the mid 1990s, Unocal used kerosene to loosen deposits
of thick crude. The kerosene pipes leaked, polluting the soil
and flowing into the ocean, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eglinton, the Exxon spokesman, said the Unocal cleanups in
California may have little in common with conditions in south
Texas. &#8220;These are two completely different places,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pennsylvania, the state has responded to a boom in gas
drilling by Exxon and others with stepped-up inspections of well
sites. The intent is to ensure the holes are properly lined with
steel pipe and concrete to protect local water supplies from
chemicals used to penetrate rock formations and saltwater that
gurgles to the surface with the gas, said John Hanger, secretary
of the state&#8217;s Department of Environmental Protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania Scars &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s had a long, long history with natural-
resources extraction, going back some 300 years with coal and an
oil industry that began in the 1800s,&#8221; said Hanger, who before
heading the agency was CEO of Citizens for Pennsylvania&#8217;s
Future, a non-profit group that promotes renewable energy and
conservation. &#8220;Those industries left some scars on the natural
landscape, and we&#8217;re still paying considerable sums of money to
repair some of that damage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the 1930s through the 1970s, the Kelsey field in south
Texas attracted hundreds of roughnecks, engineers and their
families. They lived in a work camp that had gardens, a school,
swim club and the Cactus Club snack bar that specialized in
wood-smoked barbecue, the Burnses said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humble Oil and Texaco, which were subsumed into Exxon and
Chevron, drilled 555 wells on the ranch and laid thousands of
miles of pipe to funnel crude to refineries in other parts of
Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poisonous Toads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today the Encinitos Ranch, which sprawls across parts of
three counties, is home to poisonous Marine toads and
rattlesnakes. The fat brown toads, when captured, are tossed
into a pond to prevent the household dogs from eating them and
dying; rattlesnakes are shot and hung over a fence for good
luck. The dogs have scars from fighting with coyotes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Burns, 39, wears a holstered handgun around the
ranch for protection against drug smugglers who avoid Border
Patrol agents prowling the highways by following pipeline routes
that crisscross the property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife, Elizabeth, estimates Exxon has damaged 12,000 to
14,000 acres of the 31,000 acres it holds under the 1935 lease
by burying wastes left by oil production and allowing byproducts
to leak into the soil. Chevron has damaged about 4,000 of the
7,100 acres it operates under a lease that dates to 1934, she
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her first clash with Exxon had nothing to do with oil. In
October 2006, police discovered that a Mexico-based drug cartel
was using the abandoned Cactus Club as a way-station for
couriers armed with machine guns. The authorities asked the
Burns to have Exxon tear it down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company declined the family&#8217;s requests, Burns said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon Mobil can&#8217;t comment on the alleged 2006 request as
we don&#8217;t have any information about it,&#8221; said Margaret Ross, a
spokeswoman. &#8220;There is no current request from the landowner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bubbling Road &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burns began to focus on the decaying oilfield
infrastructure after a second wildfire in March 2008 scorched
most of the landscape, exposing the rusty pipes and other aging
equipment spanning the ranch. That same month, an asphalt road
on the ranch that ran alongside a former oil-storage site began
to bubble with petroleum gases. Burns said she complained to
Exxon and to the railroad commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months later, she triggered a radiation sensor clipped
to the belt of a U.S. Border Patrol agent at McAllen Miller
International Airport before boarding a flight to Houston. The
agent determined the culprit was dirt on the soles of her boots
laced with old crude and chemicals tracked in from the ranch.
Since then, she said, she&#8217;s been calling and emailing the
railroad commission about twice a week with contamination
complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Commission staff is in regular contact with Elizabeth
Burns and has been working with her since November 2008 to
address her concerns,&#8221; Nye said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;majority&#8221; of Burns&#8217; complaints have been &#8220;addressed
and resolved,&#8221; Nye said. The five that remain open involve
storage tank and pipeline leaks that the commission is
monitoring &#8220;to assure that cleanups are completed within a
reasonable time frame,&#8221; the spokeswoman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the Burnses complained, Exxon dug up the road, which
crossed a network of 44 pipelines. In October, a 9-foot deep
hole about the size of a two-car garage remained, with a pool of
brown muck at the bottom that had the smell and tell-tale
rainbow sheen of petroleum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifty yards from where the road once ran, Stephen Burns
used a backhoe to dig a 6-foot trench in the soil. Within
seconds, a clear liquid that reeked of motor fuel trickled down
the sides of the hole. A clump of the dirt felt and smelled like
the boggy sand that is mined for oil in Alberta, Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon filled in the bubbling-road hole in December and
covered it with caliche, Burns said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzene Found &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey done in 2008 for the family found dangerously
high levels of petroleum derivatives such as benzene, as well as
mercury and lead, in soil and water samples from the surface to
at least 40 feet down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The family stopped using its tap water after seeing those
results. Now they get their water once a week in 5-gallon jugs
from a Farm and Ranch store in San Isidro, Texas, about 40 miles
away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although lighter-weight hydrocarbons can degrade naturally
in 40 or 50 years, the heavier molecules &#8220;are more persistent
and pretty toxic,&#8221; said Gregory Miller, project manager at Icon
Environmental Services Inc., a Port Allen, Louisiana-based
company that cleans up old oilfields. &#8220;You have no idea how bad
some of these sites are.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daunting Task &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patterson said cleaning up a tract as large as the
Encinitos Ranch is impossible. Instead, the best solution may be
to fence it off and monitor the pollution to ensure it doesn&#8217;t
migrate underground to other ranches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to somehow encapsulate it, monitor it, clean up
the obvious hazards, whether they&#8217;re fire hazards, whether
they&#8217;re leakage hazards,&#8221; Patterson said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you
can totally remediate that many acres. It&#8217;s not doable. It&#8217;s
just too big.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has installed water-monitoring stations at the ranch,
said Eglinton, the company spokesman. He declined to release the
results of the tests performed thus far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil companies would be better off cleaning up their old
operations in south Texas, Patterson said, rather than waiting
for regulators or the state legislature to impose a solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon&#8217;s walked away from a lot of this stuff they built
here, but the evil lurks,&#8221; said Burns, who had planned to raise
organic vegetables when she and her husband moved to the ranch
with their sons five years ago. &#8220;You&#8217;d hope your kids can do
something with this land, but now it&#8217;s worthless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s efforts
to burnish its reputation just got a lot tougher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55,
spent the last year defending the firm against criticism from
politicians and pundits, who decried Goldman Sachs&#8217;s profit in
the aftermath of the financial crisis and its sale of mortgage
securities that went sour. Now the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is charging the company with fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Goldman Sachs&#8217;s list of business principles, &#8220;clients&#8217;
interests always come first&#8221; ranks highest. The SEC paints a
different picture. The firm failed to tell investors when
selling them a so-called collateralized debt obligation tied to
mortgages that the package had been designed to fail by hedge
fund Paulson  Co., which profited from the losses, the agency
alleged. Goldman Sachs said it will contest the case, calling it
&#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; Shareholders weren&#8217;t
comforted: The stock plunged the most in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk is long-term reputational,&#8221; said Benjamin
Wallace, an analyst at Grimes  Co. in Westborough,
Massachusetts, which manages $900 million and doesn&#8217;t own
Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;People are going to be more inclined to
look at Goldman Sachs and think, &#8216;Who&#8217;s on the other side of
this trade?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sank 13 percent to $160.70 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, the biggest one-day percentage
decline since January 2009. The cost to buy insurance against a
default on Goldman Sachs debt jumped 35 basis points, or 0.35
percentage point, to 130.5 basis points in the biggest increase
in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Worst-Case Liability&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit&#8217;s financial cost to Goldman Sachs, whose $13.4
billion profit last year set a record for a Wall Street
securities firm, is likely to be manageable and a settlement is
unlikely before 2011, according to Brad Hintz, an analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;worst-case liability&#8221; if the SEC case succeeds would
be $706.5 million hit to net income, or $1.20 in earnings per
share, Hintz estimated in a note to investors yesterday. Follow-
on claims from investors will &#8220;face a challenging hurdle&#8221;
because the securities were sold in a private placement only
available to sophisticated investors, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said that a more important problem is that
the SEC&#8217;s focus on Goldman Sachs shows the firm is under a
harsher political and regulatory spotlight than competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Agenda &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the SEC warned Goldman Sachs last year that it was
investigating this transaction and might eventually file
charges, the regulator didn&#8217;t notify the firm that it planned to
file the suit yesterday, according to a person close to the
firm. People within the company interpreted it as a sign the SEC
has become unusually adversarial, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the moment, it looks as if the SEC is pursuing an
agenda aimed specifically at Goldman,&#8221; Chris Kotowski, a
managing director at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York, wrote in a
note to clients. &#8220;We believe that GS is probably vulnerable to
more charges and outsized fines, and we are for now downgrading
the stock to perform from outperform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reactions to the SEC suit on Capitol Hill underscored
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role as a lightning rod for political outrage.
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, a
Connecticut Democrat, said the case demonstrates the need for
Wall Street reform. House Minority Leader John Boehner, an Ohio
Republican, said the SEC suit provides further reason to oppose
the Democrats&#8217; legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein&#8217;s Prospects &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are very serious charges against a key supporter of
President Obama&#8217;s bill to create a permanent Wall Street bailout
fund,&#8221; Boehner said in a statement after the SEC case was
announced. The bill &#8220;gives Goldman Sachs and other big Wall
Street banks a perpetual, taxpayer-funded safety net by
designating them &#8216;too big to fail.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate customers and institutional investors will
continue to rely on Goldman Sachs and the company&#8217;s business is
likely to survive and thrive, said Richard Bove, an analyst at
Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida. Still, he said Blankfein
and Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, 54, may need to step
down &#8220;for the devastating decline in this company&#8217;s persona.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These men are brilliant and capable but this situation is
now out of hand,&#8221; Bove, who recommends buying Goldman Sachs
shares, said in a note to investors. &#8220;There is a deep bench at
Goldman and these executives, despite their capabilities, can be
replaced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions for Viniar &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who has worked at Goldman Sachs since joining
its commodities division, J. Aron  Co., in 1982, succeeded
Henry Paulson as chairman and CEO in 2006 when Paulson left to
become Treasury Secretary in the Bush administration. The next
year, Goldman Sachs set a Wall Street profit record helped by
bearish bets on subprime mortgage investments. Blankfein
received a $67.9 million bonus, an all-time high for the CEO of
a securities firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer since 1999, is
one of the most public faces of Goldman Sachs. He fields
questions from analysts and investors on the firm&#8217;s results
every quarter. He&#8217;s slated to face their questions again next
week, when Goldman reports first-quarter figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their annual letter to shareholders last week, Blankfein
and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn said most of the firm&#8217;s
business is aimed at serving sophisticated clients capable of
making their own decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre and Paulson &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investors who transacted with Goldman Sachs in CDOs
in 2007, as in prior years, were primarily large, global
financial institutions, insurance companies and hedge funds,&#8221;
the letter said. The firm &#8220;did not know whether the value of
the instruments we sold would increase or decrease.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That contrasts with the SEC&#8217;s allegations. The suit says
Fabrice Tourre, a 31-year-old vice president at Goldman Sachs,
knew that the Paulson hedge fund firm had helped select the
assets backing a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus
2007-AC1, even as Paulson planned to bet on it failing. The SEC
says Tourre misled a collateral manager, ACA Management LLC, and
an investor, IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, about Paulson&#8217;s
role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Marketing materials for Abacus 2007-AC1 were false and
misleading because they represented that ACA selected the
reference portfolio while omitting any mention that Paulson, a
party with economic interests adverse to CDO investors, played a
significant role in the selection of the reference portfolio,&#8221;
the SEC argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cynical, Savage&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, reached yesterday at his office in London, where he
is now an executive director, declined to comment. Annette
Littmann, a spokeswoman for Duesseldorf-based IKB, said &#8220;IKB is
aware of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit and supported the SEC upon request.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s accusations may fuel critics&#8217; claims that the
firm put its own interests ahead of clients&#8217; and profited from
practices that led to the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs said they sold only to sophisticated
investors, but the damage they did was so pervasive that
unsophisticated investors got snared in their web too,&#8221; said
Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance Inc. in
Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Whalen, a bank analyst at Torrance, California-
based Institutional Risk Analytics, told investors yesterday
that &#8220;this litigation exposes the cynical, savage culture of
Wall Street that allows a dealer to commit fraud on one customer
to benefit another.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Out of Character&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Cohan, a former investment banker who is writing a
book about Goldman Sachs, said the accusations are surprising
because the firm generally is diligent when it comes to legal
disclosures. That the suit names none of Tourre&#8217;s superiors may
signal that senior management can escape blame, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It just strikes me as being entirely out of the firm&#8217;s
character, as much as people like to hate them, because they are
much too careful on the whole legal front and disclosure
front,&#8221; Cohan said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has &#8220;only named a VP, it&#8217;s not going up the chain
here at the moment, so I think that&#8217;s an important distinction
to make,&#8221; Cohan said. &#8220;There are bad apples in any firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Goldman Sachs made what it called &#8220;four
critical points&#8221; in its defense against the SEC&#8217;s accusations.
The first was that Goldman Sachs itself lost more than $90
million because it had an investment in the deal that
overwhelmed the $15 million it made in fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson Statement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said it provided &#8220;extensive disclosure&#8221; to IKB
and ACA about the risk of the underlying mortgage securities. It
said that ACA, whose $951 million investment made it the most
exposed to risk, selected the portfolio. And the firm disputed
the SEC&#8217;s accusation that Goldman Sachs told ACA that Paulson 
Co. was going to be an investor in the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s firm, which hasn&#8217;t been charged with any
wrongdoing, said in a statement that &#8220;ACA as collateral manager
had sole authority over the selection of all collateral in the
CDO&#8221; and that Paulson didn&#8217;t &#8220;sponsor or initiate&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s
Abacus program. The fund says that while it did purchase credit
protection from Goldman Sachs on some Abacus securities, it
wasn&#8217;t involved in the marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s loyalty to clients has been questioned
before. E-mails released by congressional investigators earlier
this week show that Washington Mutual Inc.&#8217;s former CEO, Kerry
Killinger, didn&#8217;t want to hire a Goldman Sachs banker in 2007 to
help with the bank&#8217;s credit problems before it collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Models, Brightest Minds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are smart, but this is swimming with sharks,&#8221;
Killinger wrote in an Oct. 12, 2007, e-mail to a deputy. &#8220;They
were shorting mortgages big time while they were giving CfC
advice,&#8221; he added, referring to Countrywide Financial Corp.,
the home lender that ran short of cash the same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One investor said that perception hasn&#8217;t prevented Goldman
Sachs from winning client business before and he doesn&#8217;t think
it will now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s that cachet that they&#8217;ve had that not only are
they the smartest guys in the room, but they might be playing
you,&#8221; said Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio manager at
Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, which manages about $13
billion, including Goldman Sachs stock. Still, &#8220;the people at
Goldman really do have the best models, they do have the
brightest minds&#8221; and they will keep winning clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the market reaction to the SEC&#8217;s suit probably
reflects fear that wider criminal charges could follow, and
represents a good opportunity to buy the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m just happy that it wasn&#8217;t the FBI kicking in the
door,&#8221; Sorrentino said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union investigation
into Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s role in providing swaps to the
Greek government to help reduce its budget deficit will be
&#8220;profound and thorough,&#8221; EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli
Rehn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation relates to &#8220;our relationship with
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Rehn said at a press conference in Madrid today
after a meeting of EU finance chiefs and central bankers. &#8220;I
have asked the Ecofin and Eurostat to conduct a profound and
thorough investigation in which the Greek authorities are very
well cooperating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank arranged the swap deal for Greece in 2002.
It helped reduce the Greek government&#8217;s reported debt ratio. 
Greece&#8217;s excessive borrowing subsequently engulfed the country
in a debt crisis that Morgan Stanley this week said may lead 
to the breakup of the euro region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s spokeswoman Fiona Laffan declined to
comment. Gerald Corrigan, chairman of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s regulated
bank subsidiary, last week told the European Parliament that
while the bank would be prepared to repeat such a deal, it would
likely execute it differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We probably would do it again today,&#8221; Corrigan said, &#8220;but
we would do it in a somewhat different manner.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the deal, Greece entered a cross-
currency swap agreement with Goldman Sachs on about $10 billion
of debt issued in dollars and yen. That was swapped into euros
using a historical exchange rate, a mechanism that generated
about $1 billion in an up-front payment from Goldman to Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greek government is scheduled to meet officials from
the International Monetary Fund and the euro region on April 19
to discuss the terms and procedures of a proposed 45 billion-
euro ($61 billion) bailout loan as it struggles to finance the
region&#8217;s largest budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday said
it is suing Goldman Sachs for fraud tied to collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages in 2007. The bank sold
the securities without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co.
helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicles, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet
declined to comment on the SEC&#8217;s allegations against Goldman at
the press conference with Rehn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s shares tumbled 13 percent yesterday and
financial stocks slumped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, halting the
longest rally in a year, after allegations of fraud at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. heightened concern the government will crack
down on Wall Street and wiped out the week&#8217;s advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sank 10 percent this week, the most since
March 2009, after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued
the bank and one of its vice presidents for misstating and
omitting key facts about a collateralized debt obligation. The
1.6 percent retreat in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index yesterday
erased gains earlier in the week spurred by better-than-
estimated results at companies from Intel Corp. to CSX Corp. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slipped 0.2 percent to 1,192.13. Before
yesterday, the index was headed for a seventh straight weekly
advance, the longest since May 2007. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average rose 21.31 points, or 0.2 percent, to 11,018.66. The
Russell 2000 Index of small companies jumped 1.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was very impressed with the earnings we got and the
market was doing so well, but then you get a punch in the gut
with these Goldman Sachs issues,&#8221; said Don Wordell, who
oversees the RidgeWorth Mid-Cap Value Equity Fund, which has
beaten 97 percent of its peers during the past five years. &#8220;It
brings investors back to reality. There&#8217;s a tremendous amount of
skepticism.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failure to Disclose &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, erased its advance for 2010 and ended the week at
$160.70, the lowest price since March 3. The SEC said the bank
created and sold CDOs tied to subprime mortgages in early 2007,
as the U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against them. Goldman Sachs said the claims are
&#8220;completely unfounded.&#8221; Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. fell 2.8 percent to $550.15. The owner of the
world&#8217;s most popular Internet search engine reported profit that
missed some analysts&#8217; estimates, underscoring the rising cost of
pursuing growth in new markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw-material producers in the SP 500 collectively dropped
1.9 percent for the biggest retreat among 10 groups. Alcoa Inc.,
the largest U.S. aluminum producer, fell 3.3 percent to $13.91
on first-quarter sales that missed the average analyst estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key question is: Is this the peak quarter in terms of
earnings growth as the comparisons get more difficult as the
year proceeds?&#8221; said Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment
Counsel, which manages $2.8 billion in Charlottesville,
Virginia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Johnson  Johnson and Coca-
Cola Co. are among the 129 companies in the SP 500 scheduled to
report quarterly results next week. Total profit for the stock
index rose 35 percent during the first three months of the year,
according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Energy Co., which runs a West Virginia coal mine
where 29 people were killed in an April 5 explosion, tumbled 9.5
percent to $42.27 after President Barack Obama ordered a
crackdown on safety violations nationwide. The decline was the
biggest in the SP 500 after Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel rallied 6.1 percent, the most since December, to
$23.92. The world&#8217;s largest chipmaker predicted rising sales
this quarter and record profit margins for the year, fueling
optimism of a strengthening rebound in technology spending. A
measure of computer companies in the SP 500 climbed 1.4 percent
for the biggest gain among 10 main groups in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX Rallies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CSX rose 2.8 percent to $54.44. The third-largest U.S.
railroad posted first-quarter profit above the average analyst
estimates on increased shipping volumes and more revenue from
each carload. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A lot is already baked in,&#8221; said Noman Ali, who manages
$3 billion of U.S. stocks at MFC Global Investment Management in
Toronto. &#8220;Unless companies can beat estimates meaningfully and
then raise guidance for the rest of the year, I see the market
correcting down because of the strong rally we&#8217;ve had year-to-
date.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan ended the down 0.9 percent for the week at $45.55.
The bank rallied 4.1 percent on April 14 after beating first-
quarter profit forecasts and reporting record fixed-income
trading revenue. The gains were erased as concern stemming from
the SEC lawsuit against Goldman Sachs dragged bank shares lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The allegations against Goldman Sachs were announced as
Obama tries to pass the most sweeping overhaul of financial
regulations since the 1930s. The proposed legislation would mean
stronger oversight of derivatives trading and hedge funds, a
consumer financial-protection authority and a system for
unwinding large systemically important firms when they fail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group founder Raj
Rajaratnam, who faces federal insider trading charges, sought to
acquire secret information about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s 2008
purchase of preferred shares in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
federal prosecutors said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter from federal prosecutors to Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers
detailing new allegations of insider trading was made public
yesterday in a filing in federal court in Manhattan. In it,
prosecutors elaborated on an earlier claim that Rajaratnam tried
to use confidential information to trade on Goldman Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam &#8220;conspired to obtain material, nonpublic
information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman Sachs&#8221;
before its public announcement of earnings in June 2008 and
December 2008, according to the letter. &#8220;In addition,
Rajaratnam conspired to obtain material, nonpublic information
about the purchase by Berkshire Hathaway of preferred stock in
Goldman prior to Goldman&#8217;s public announcement&#8221; on Sept. 3,
2008, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Rajaratnam are asking a judge to exclude
evidence of additional allegations of insider trading, saying
prosecutors waited too long to disclose it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing doesn&#8217;t identify Rajaratnam&#8217;s source for
information about Goldman Sachs. It does provide details about
other alleged efforts to obtain inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Allegation Is False&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegation is false,&#8221; said Jim McCarthy, a spokesman
for Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam asked U.S. District Judge Rich Holwell yesterday
to exclude from the case evidence that he and his coconspirators
engaged in newly identified transactions involving the stock of
23 companies, including Goldman Sachs, Cisco Systems Inc. and
ATT Inc. Those companies were listed by prosecutors in letters
dated March 22 and April 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The new allegations effectively triple the size of this
case some six months after its inception and just two months
after the government represented to the court that the parties
could be ready for trial in June,&#8221; lawyers for Rajaratnam said
in papers filed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is the central figure
in a probe in which 21 people have been charged criminally. He
claimed prosecutors are &#8220;sandbagging the defense&#8221; in violation
of his constitutional rights, including the right to defend
himself at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are probing whether Rajaratnam received
confidential tips from Goldman Sachs director Rajat Gupta, the
Wall Street Journal reported. Gupta is a former worldwide
managing director at McKinsey  Co. Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ed Canaday, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t
immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alleged Tipsters &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s filing identifies some of the alleged sources
of Rajaratnam&#8217;s tips, including Anil Kumar, a former McKinsey 
Co. director, ex-Intel Corp. managing director Rajiv Goel, and
former hedge fund manager Ali Far. They have pleaded guilty.
Many other alleged sources aren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam sought advance tips on the 2008 closing of the
acquisition of Clear Channel Communications Inc. by Bain Capital
LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP, according to the filing. He
got the information from Zvi Goffer, a hedge fund trader who is
also charged in the case. Prosecutors said Goffer got the
information from two lawyers working at the Ropes  Gray LLP law
firm. Goffer has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tipped by Goffer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said Rajaratnam was also tipped by Goffer about
the potential acquisition in February 2008 of PF Chang&#8217;s China
Bistro Inc. &#8220;There was never any public announcement relating
to this potential acquisition,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said in the letter that Rajaratnam and other
Galleon employees are heard on recordings discussing efforts to
get information about Broadcom Corp., Cavium Networks Inc.,
Garmin Ltd., Maxim Integrated Products, MEMC Electronic
Materials Inc., NVIDIA Corp. and Synaptics Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also yesterday, Rajaratnam asked Holwell to require
prosecutors to provide additional information about the charges
against him, including the specific trades, inside information
and sources, and co-conspirators alleged in each criminal count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam codefendant Danielle Chiesi also requested
through her lawyer that Holwell require prosecutors to give
additional information about the criminal charges. And she asked
Holwell to suppress statements she said she made to federal
agents in her apartment the morning of her arrest before she was
given Miranda warnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara in
New York, declined to comment on the court papers filed by
Rajaratnam and Chiesi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. faces a
regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from the German
government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
sued the firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the suit.
Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for details
on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians that were forced to bail out their banks during
the financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped cause the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will see politicians throughout the world piling on
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Scott Moeller, a former investment banker
now teaching at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;Now they have
vulnerability. Everyone and anyone, especially politicians, are
going to be trying to make hay with this one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;People Were Misled&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm denies any wrongdoing. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs, and Heidi Ashley, a spokeswoman for the FSA,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks as if people were misled about what happened,&#8221;
Brown, who faces a national election on May 6, said on the BBC&#8217;s
Andrew Marr program yesterday. &#8220;The banks are still an issue.
They are a risk to the economy.&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc paid $841 million to
Goldman Sachs to unwind its position in Abacus, which it
inherited when it bought parts of ABN Amro in 2007, according to
the SEC. The Edinburgh-based lender is now controlled by the
British government after receiving a 45.5 billion-pound ($70
billion) taxpayer rescue, the world&#8217;s biggest banking bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Goldman Sachs misled investor IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG about Paulson&#8217;s role in the trade. Dusseldorf-
based IKB lost about $150 million in the Abacus CDO, most of
which went to Paulson, which reaped a $1 billion profit in total
from betting against the vehicle, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal Steps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB became Germany&#8217;s first casualty of the U.S. subprime-
mortgage crisis in 2007 after its investments in asset-backed
securities soured. KfW, Germany&#8217;s state-owned development bank,
pumped almost 10 billion euros ($13.5 billion) into IKB in 2008
to shore up the country&#8217;s banking system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German government &#8216;&#8216;will ask the SEC for information,&#8221;
said Ulrich Wilhelm, a spokesman for Merkel. &#8220;Then we will look
at the records and consider possible legal steps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a statement it had provided
&#8220;extensive disclosure&#8221; to IKB about the risk of the underlying
mortgage securities. Paulson, which hasn&#8217;t been charged with any
wrongdoing, said in a statement that it didn&#8217;t &#8220;sponsor or
initiate&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s Abacus program. The fund said that while it
did purchase credit protection from Goldman on some Abacus
securities, it wasn&#8217;t involved in the marketing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Profound and Thorough&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU is investigating Goldman Sachs over swaps it
arranged for Greece in 2002. The country entered a cross-
currency swap with Goldman Sachs on about $10 billion of debt
issued in dollars and yen. That was swapped into euros using a
historical exchange rate, a mechanism that generated about $1
billion in an up-front payment from Goldman to Greece. Goldman
has said it did nothing wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probe will be &#8220;profound and thorough,&#8221; EU Monetary
Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said at a press conference in
Madrid on April 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Soo Mi, a spokeswoman for South Korea&#8217;s Financial
Supervisory Service, said the regulator &#8220;is monitoring market
developments overseas as well as in South Korea, and we plan to
review the status of South Korean financial institutions&#8217;
exposure to that CDO product of Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based firm is already under attack for its
role as a trading partner to American International Group Inc.,
the insurer bailed out by the U.S. government. Goldman Sachs
said April 7 that AIG&#8217;s bailout in 2008 helped the bank and
every other financial firm because the insurer&#8217;s collapse would
have been &#8220;extremely&#8221; disruptive to financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $182.3 billion bailout ensured that Goldman Sachs and
other counterparties were repaid in full. Much of the $12.9
billion Goldman Sachs received from AIG&#8217;s rescue was paid out to
meet AIG-linked &#8220;obligations,&#8221; the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese and Australian stock
futures fell after U.S. securities regulators accused Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. of fraud, commodity prices fell and the yen
strengthened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial
Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s second-biggest bank by market value, closed
3.7 percent lower than the Tokyo close on April 16. Those of
Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 28 percent of its
revenue in the Americas, fell 2 percent. ADRs of BHP Billiton
Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest mining company, sank 1.4 percent from
the close in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman shock is discouraging investors from taking
on risk in stocks, currencies and commodities,&#8221; said Tomochika
Kitaoka, a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yen-denominated futures on Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
expiring in June closed at 10,915 in Chicago on April 16, 1.7
percent lower than 11,105 in Singapore. They were bid in the
pre-market at 10,800 as of 8:39 a.m. today in Osaka, Japan. The
Nikkei 225 closed at 11,102.18 on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on Australia&#8217;s SP/ASX 200 Index fell 1 percent
today. New Zealand&#8217;s NZX 50 Index lost 0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen rose against the dollar to as much as 91.82 today,
its strongest level since March 25, from 92.74 at the close of
stock trading in Tokyo on April 16. The currency appreciated to
as much as 123.70 against the euro from 125.48. A stronger yen
reduces the value of overseas income at Japanese companies when
converted into their home currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Accusation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell 0.4 percent
after the U.K. and Germany signaled inquiries into Goldman Sachs.
The index dropped 1.6 percent in New York on April 16, the most
since Feb. 4, after the Securities and Exchange Commission
accused the New York-based investment bank of fraud related to
packaging and selling collateralized-debt obligations linked to
subprime mortgages. Goldman Sachs tumbled 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.2 percent last week,
gaining for a third consecutive week. China reported an 11.9
percent increase in first-quarter economic growth, overshadowing
an unexpected rise in U.S. jobless claims. Stocks in the gauge
trade at 16.4 times estimated earnings, compared with 15.2 times
for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for May delivery lost 2.7 percent in New York on
April 16. The London Metal Exchange Index of six industrial
metals, including copper and zinc, fell 2.1 percent, its biggest
drop since Feb. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Southern Airlines Co., the nation&#8217;s biggest carrier
by fleet size, said first-quarter profit probably jumped about
400 percent from a year earlier as an economic recovery boosted
demand and the carrier booked a gain from an asset sale. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. is near an
agreement to sell its Miramax film unit in a deal that would put
brothers Bob and Harvey Weinstein back in charge of the studio
they founded, said a person with knowledge of the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weinsteins, who are working with billionaire Ron
Burkle&#8217;s Yucaipa Cos., entered into exclusive negotiations with
Disney on April 16 as the sides work on a restructured proposal,
said the person, who asked not to be identified because the
talks are private. Their offer was increased to $625 million
from $600 million, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A deal would reunite the Weinsteins, the executives behind
&#8220;Pulp Fiction&#8221; and Oscar winner &#8220;The English Patient,&#8221; with
the studio they named after their parents and left in 2005 to
start Weinstein Co. Disney would replenish its coffers after
paying more than $4 billion for comic-book publisher Marvel
Entertainment. Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger is focusing
the movie division on family oriented movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exclusivity lasts for less than a week, the person said.
Burbank, California-based Disney acquired Miramax in 1993 and
had sought $700 million for the studio and its 700-film library.
The Weinsteins earned 220 Academy Award nominations for Disney
during their tenure, for films including &#8220;Shakespeare in
Love,&#8221; &#8220;The Aviator&#8221; and &#8220;Life Is Beautiful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colbeck Capital Management and Fortress Investment Group
are providing funding for the Miramax offer, The New York Times
reported on April 16. The exclusive talks were reported earlier
by TheWrap.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gores Brothers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dani Weinstein, a spokeswoman for New York-based Weinstein
Co., declined to comment. Frank Quintero, a spokesman for
Burkle&#8217;s Los Angeles-based Yucaipa, didn&#8217;t return messages
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, said in January
that it closed Miramax offices, and that it would distribute the
six remaining pictures. The Weinsteins founded the company in
1979 and named it after their parents, Miriam and Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alec Gores and Tom Gores, billionaires who each run Los
Angeles-based private equity companies, have raised their bid
above the $550 million originally offered, said one person. They
are being advised by their brother Sam Gores, owner of Paradigm
Talent Agency in Beverly Hills, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Gores, Michael Sitrick, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hollywood film producer David Bergstein has also offered
about $650 million, according to two people with knowledge of
the bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bergstein is advising a &#8220;well-capitalized offshore
entity&#8221; on a Miramax bid, his Pangea Media Group said in on
April 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 57 cents to
$35.83 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading on April 16.
Its shares have climbed 11 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British Prime Minister Gordon Brown
called for a &#8220;special investigation&#8221; of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. after U.S. authorities charged the New York-based
investment bank with fraud on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the BBC&#8217;s Andrew Marr show today, Brown said he
was shocked at what he called the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; of
investment banks and advocated tighter regulation and a global
levy on the financial industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has denied any wrongdoing.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An &#8220;unexpectedly large&#8221; slump in
Chinese stocks yesterday offers investors a chance to add to
their positions, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage reiterated its end-2010 target of 4,300 for
the CSI 300 Index, which yesterday plunged 5.4 percent to
3,176.42 after a government crackdown on the property market.
The Shanghai Composite Index lost 4.8 percent, taking its
decline this year to 9.1 percent, the world&#8217;s third-worst

&lt;p&gt;Japanese and Australian stock
futures rose as the yen weakened and two people with knowledge
of the matter said regulators were split on suing Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial
Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s biggest bank by market value, closed 0.4
percent higher than the Tokyo close yesterday after Bloomberg
News reported that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
officials voted 3-2 to pursue a fraud case against Goldman Sachs,
the New York-based investment bank. ADRs of National Australia
Bank Ltd., the nation&#8217;s fourth-largest bank, advanced 1 percent.
Those of Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 28 percent
of its revenue in the Americas, climbed 0.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The divided vote on Goldman suggests excessive regulation
that would reduce bank earnings will be avoided,&#8221; said Fumiyuki
Nakanishi, a senior strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in
Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yen-denominated futures on Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
expiring in June closed at 10,955 in Chicago yesterday, 0.6
percent more than 10,895 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-
market at 10,980 as of 8:01 a.m. today in Osaka, Japan. The
Nikkei 225 lost 1.7 percent to 10,908.77 yesterday, its biggest
drop since Feb. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on Australia&#8217;s SP/ASX 200 Index rose 0.7 percent
today. New Zealand&#8217;s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped 2.1 percent yesterday,
the most since Feb. 19, after the Securities and Exchange
Commission said April 16 after Asian trading closed that it sued
Goldman Sachs for fraud related to collateralized-debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index were little
changed today. The gauge rose 0.5 percent yesterday in New York
and Goldman Sachs shares reversed declines after the two people
with knowledge of the vote told Bloomberg News that the SEC
voted 3-2 to sue the investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., the recipient of the biggest U.S. bank
bailout, said yesterday first-quarter profit more than doubled
as the global economic rebound trimmed costs for bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI benchmark has risen 4.3 percent this year,
compared with an increase of 7.4 percent for the SP 500 and 4.8
percent for the Dow Jones Europe Stoxx 600 Index. Companies in
the Asian gauge trade at 16 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 15 times for the SP 500 and 13 times for the
Stoxx 600. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen weakened to as low as 92.54 against the dollar
today from 92.01 at the 3 p.m. close of stock trading in Tokyo
yesterday, boosting the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency. The yen
depreciated to as low as 124.84 against the euro from 123.95. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. said service contract signings fell last quarter,
suggesting corporate customers are still delaying some
technology spending following the economic slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services signings, which account for more than half of
revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said today in a statement. Application-management
signings declined 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM shares have lagged behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index this year. The company, the world&#8217;s largest computer-
services provider, has yet to signal that its profit can rise
based on revenue growth rather than by measures like cost cuts
and stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a lackluster quarter,&#8221; said Marshall, who has a
&#8220;neutral&#8221; rating on the stock and doesn&#8217;t own it. &#8220;IBM is simply
not that attractive of a growth story right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell 2.2 percent to $129.35 in after-hours trading
after rising $1.60 to $132.23 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock
Exchange. It has gained 1 percent this year, compared with a 7.4
percent gain in the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding the decline in application-management signings,
total services signings would have been up 4 percent from a year
earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s slower growth than the 9
percent increase in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Buybacks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since 2002, IBM has repurchased $68.5 billion of stock to
help buoy profit. The buyback program shows &#8220;really good
financial management from an earnings perspective,&#8221; Marshall
said. &#8220;At the end of the day -- not much upside from a revenue
perspective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221;
and doesn&#8217;t own any. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has cut about 2,900 jobs this year, according to
advocacy group Alliance@IBM, which represents some employees.
That&#8217;s on top on the more than 10,400 let go in the U.S. and
Canada last year, the group said, as the company coped with a
drop in sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company should benefit as technology spending climbs
1.7 percent this year, after a 3.1 percent last year, according
to a projection from Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest
chipmaker, lent support to that prediction last week by
forecasting second-quarter sales that topped estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-year profit at IBM will be $11.20 a share, up from a
previous forecast of at least $11 a share, the company said.
Analysts on average estimated $11.13 based on estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past
decade selling off hardware businesses and investing in higher-
margin software and services. That&#8217;s helped it boost gross
profit margins, the percentage of revenue left after production
costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software and services now make up more than 80 percent of
total revenue, which was $95.8 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five
acquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and
National Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related
programs. The U.S. government&#8217;s plan to put patient health
records online may spur more than $20 billion in spending,
Framingham, Massachusetts-based researcher IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg
will say today that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
suit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. demonstrates the need for
&#8220;a complete overhaul&#8221; of the financial industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegations about Goldman Sachs are yet another
reminder of how reckless and greedy the global banking industry
had become,&#8221; Clegg will tell a news conference in London today,
his party said in a statement. &#8220;The great tragedy is that none
of that recklessness or greed has yet been stamped out of the
City of London, and it is costing jobs and businesses day by
day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clegg&#8217;s party pledged to separate retail and investment
banking, introduce a 10 percent levy on bank profits and
restrict bonuses if it wins a share of power at the May 6
election. Support for the Liberal Democrats has jumped in polls
to rival that of David Cameron&#8217;s Conservatives and Prime
Minister Gordon Brown&#8217;s Labour Party, indicating no party will
have a majority in the new House of Commons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a collateralized debt
obligation linked to subprime mortgages without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing and said it would fight
the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown said in an interview yesterday with Bloomberg
Television that &#8220;what I have seen shows moral bankruptcy on the
part of employees&#8221; at Goldman. The premier called April 18 for
the Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not just the profits that pile
up at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. So do the scandals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, the bank has been beaten up in the
court of public opinion. Last week&#8217;s fraud charges from the
Securities and Exchange Commission merely added to the battering
its reputation has already taken. Most of us would rather own up
to working for a tobacco company, with subsidiaries in landmine
manufacturing, than have anything to do with Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is well on the way to becoming the world&#8217;s most hated
company. And yet, there is an interesting twist to this tale.
Among the people who probably matter to it most, Goldman Sachs
is doing better than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smart, ambitious graduates are still sending in their CVs
as enthusiastically as ever. The big corporations still want the
New York-based firm on their side. And it posted record earnings
in 2009 while its stock price doubled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a lesson in that for Wall Street investment banks.
While spending millions on an army of public-relations officers,
reputation consultants and sponsorship managers, financial
institutions shouldn&#8217;t forget that people prefer their bankers
to be greedy and mean. Being known for having sharp teeth, along
with a nasty bark, won&#8217;t do you any harm. None of the scandals
has hurt its business. This latest one won&#8217;t be any different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public Beating &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one can have failed to notice the beating that bankers
have taken in public opinion in the past two years. Real-estate
agents have a better reputation for honesty, and parking
inspectors have a higher rating for fairness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No surprises there. The banks took huge and crazy risks,
got ordinary taxpayers to bail them out, then went straight back
to paying themselves massive bonuses as if nothing had happened.
If that doesn&#8217;t send your reputation straight into the gutter,
it is hard to know what will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is plenty of statistical evidence to show banks have
plummeted in public esteem. In Harris Interactive&#8217;s latest
survey of corporate reputations in the U.S., the banks took a
hammering. Out of 60 companies, Goldman Sachs ranked 56th.
Citigroup Inc. was at 57th, while Bank of America Corp. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. were also in the bottom 10. Only the
tobacco industry fared worse than finance. You can&#8217;t sink much
lower than that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That, however, is what Joe Public thinks. Among the
corporate and political elite the story is rather different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Top of Polls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A British survey, conducted by the graduate-recruitment Web
site TargetJobs, asked 100,000 students which companies they
would like to work for when they graduate. Goldman Sachs topped
the poll for investment banks. All that terrible press, it
seems, hasn&#8217;t stopped young people wanting to get their feet
under a desk in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Fortune magazine recently published its annual
survey of the most-admired companies. Who topped the megabank
category? That&#8217;s right. Goldman Sachs. It was up from 15th to
eighth place in the all-industries ranking, ahead of Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. and Coca-Cola Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortune canvasses the views of more than 4,000 executives,
directors and analysts to compile its list. It is a measure of
elite, not mass opinion. And in that narrow world, it appears
that the big banks haven&#8217;t suffered at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message couldn&#8217;t be clearer. An avalanche of bad
publicity hasn&#8217;t really dented Goldman&#8217;s reputation, or that of
any other major bank, either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasty and Tough &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two conclusions to be drawn from that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we like our banks to be aggressive and mean. Imagine
you were hiring a bodyguard or a divorce lawyer. Do you want one
who promises to be conciliatory, kind and consensual? Or one who
takes no prisoners? In reality, you want your team to be as
nasty and tough as possible. The same is true of investment
banking. As gangster rappers say, it pays to be bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, although there is a lot of waffling about
reputation and corporate social responsibility, all that matters
is the ability to get the job done. The firm of Nero, Khan (as
in Genghis)  Capone would probably win a fair bit of business
as long as it got that Greek bond issue sold, or found someone
to unwind a position in Florida mortgage derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a moral in that for the investment banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will all spend fortunes in the next couple of years
getting their images back in shape. If you happen to have an
orchestra you want sponsored, an orphanage that needs a new
wing, or a rare species that needs saving from extinction, this
is the right moment to send in a polite letter asking for a
donation. Don&#8217;t forget to mention how their generosity will
improve their public image. They will write out a check faster
than you can say &#8220;giant vampire squid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Audiences &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But actually, for keeping the business going, there are
only two audiences that really count. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the banks can still attract the smartest, most
ambitious young talent out of the universities, and so long as
the people running big corporations still rate them, what the
general public thinks doesn&#8217;t matter much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And while the banks are repairing their images, it would
also be worth remembering that they don&#8217;t want to go too far in
the other direction. It won&#8217;t really do them any harm to be
known as nasty and greedy -- that is what bankers are there for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks fell the
most in more than two months as a probe of Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. widened and China announced measures to cool the real-
estate market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost 2 percent to 1,011.29
by 5 p.m. in New York, its biggest drop since Feb. 5. The
Shanghai Composite Index tumbled 4.8 percent, the most since
August. Developing-nation currencies weakened against the
dollar, led by a 0.9 percent fall in the Indian rupee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese shares led losses in global equity indexes today
after the government told banks to stop loans for third-home
purchases. A gauge of financial shares in the MSCI index sank
2.6 percent as Britain and Germany signaled probes of Goldman
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s April 16
fraud charges related to collateralized debt obligations. Stock
indexes in Poland, Russia, Hungary, South Korea, Taiwan and the
Philippines sank at least 1.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs probe &#8220;came at a time when markets were
vulnerable after two months of strong gains,&#8221; said Shane
Oliver, Sydney-based head of investment strategy at AMP Capital
Investors, which oversees $90 billion. China&#8217;s latest property
curbs &#8220;probably will weigh on sentiment for a while,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldwide retreat in equities today pared a more than
yearlong rally that drove the MSCI emerging gauge to as much as
120 percent higher than its 2009 low in March. The increase in
regulatory scrutiny of U.S. banks &#8220;provides a window for risk
re-pricing&#8221; after the surge in developing-nation asset values,
Luis Costa, a London-based emerging-market strategist at
Citigroup Inc., wrote in a report e-mailed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Selloff &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own emerging-market
debt over U.S. Treasuries declined four basis points to 2.37
percentage points, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMBI+
Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazilian stocks fell for a third day, led by steel
producers, as metals prices slid and economists boosted
projections for interest rate increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gerdau SA led a drop in Brazilian steelmakers as raw-
materials prices retreated after calls for regulatory probes on
Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street&#8217;s biggest commodity traders,
widened to Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders and developers led Chinese shares lower after the
government told banks to stop loans for third-home purchases in
cities with excessive property price gains and suspend lending
to non-residents without tax returns or proof of social security
contributions in that city. Local governments may also limit the
number of units that can be bought, according to a statement by
the State Council on April 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Vanke Co., the nation&#8217;s largest listed developer,
lost 8.2 percent. Agile Property Holdings Ltd. tumbled 7.3
percent in Hong Kong. The latest measures are the &#8220;most
draconian&#8221; on the property market in history, Deutsche Bank
AG&#8217;s Greater China chief economist Ma Jun wrote in a note to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines retreated on concern losses are mounting following
the closing of European airspace from last week&#8217;s volcanic
eruption in Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Airways International Pcl, which said it&#8217;s losing 100
million baht ($3.1 million) a day from the closure, dropped for
a third day. Korean Air Lines Co. lost 3.4 percent, while Air
China Ltd. declined 8.1 percent. Tam SA, which operates about 85
percent of Brazil&#8217;s international flights, dropped 2.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico&#8217;s peso rose after U.S.
markets rebounded on speculation a fraud suit against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. may not hamper the global economic rebound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency rose 0.3 percent to 12.2388 per U.S. dollar at
5 p.m. New York time, from 12.2756 on April 16. The peso has
risen 7 percent this year, the best performer against the U.S.
dollar of the 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman situation isn&#8217;t as bad as people thought,&#8221;
said Ramon Cordova, a currency strategist at Base Internacional
Casa de Bolsa SA in Monterrey, Mexico. &#8220;People are turning back

11,092.05. The U.S. buys about 80 percent of Mexico&#8217;s exports.
Earlier, global equities dropped as the probe of Goldman Sachs
widened to Europe. Goldman Sachs may face European
investigations after U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown talked
about &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; at the firm following the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s lawsuit alleging fraud in
the mortgage-securities business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Mexico&#8217;s 10 percent peso bond due in 2024 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.829 percent,
according to Banco Santander SA. The price of the security rose
0.13 centavo to 118.83 centavos per peso. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders did not trigger any dollar options today, Mexico&#8217;s
central bank said on its Web site. The bank has been auctioning
$600 million monthly, allowing holders of the options to sell
the bank dollars as Mexico seeks to increase foreign reserves. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose, halting the
biggest global slump since February, and Treasuries extended
losses after two people with knowledge of the matter said
regulators were split on suing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 0.5 percent to
1,197.52 at 4 p.m. in New York and Goldman Sachs shares reversed
declines after the people told Bloomberg News that officials at
the Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 to sue the bank
for fraud. The yield on the 10-year note rose four basis points
to 3.80 percent. The Dollar Index climbed 0.1 percent after
rallying 0.6 percent earlier. European airline shares and Greek
bonds slid as volcanic ash halted flights and postponed talks
about a rescue package for Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro sided with Democrats Luis
Aguilar and Elisse Walter to approve the case against Goldman
Sachs, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the vote wasn&#8217;t public. Republican commissioners Kathleen Casey
and Troy Paredes voted against, the people said. Equities also
rallied after Daimler AG said it returned to profit in the first
quarter, helped by sales of Mercedes-Benz cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A split vote suggests that the SEC may be on soft legal
ground, maybe on stronger political ground,&#8221; said Keith Wirtz,
who oversees $18 billion as chief investment officer at Fifth
Third Asset Management Inc. in Cincinnati. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think the
Goldman situation would have major implications. In addition to
that, Daimler&#8217;s better-than-expected number not only reinforces
an earnings recovery but a consumer recovery. That&#8217;s good news.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congressman Mark Kirk said he plans
to return campaign contributions given by employees of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. to his campaign for a U.S. Senate seat once
held by President Barack Obama in Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to set an example on ethics for others to
follow,&#8221; Kirk said during a news conference in Chicago. &#8220;I
will err on the side of caution and watch this case unfold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk, 50, made the announcement after his Democratic
opponent, Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, criticized him
today for taking money from the bank&#8217;s employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are calling on Congressman Kirk to explain why he
voted against Wall Street reform,&#8221; said Matt McGrath, a
spokesman for Giannoulias. &#8220;And we are challenging him to give
back his tainted Goldman Sachs campaign contributions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk &#8220;blew off&#8221; four votes in January because he was
attending a Wall Street fundraiser and has taken $54,010 from
Goldman employees, including $21,600 for his Senate bid, McGrath
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congressman said his campaign is still determining how
much Goldman employees donated to him, and that he has not
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk said he made his decision over the weekend after
reading about a civil suit filed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission that targeted Goldman Sachs, alleging the bank
created and sold collateralized debt obligations linked to
subprime mortgages in early 2007 without disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Other Candidates&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously, this hits a number of other candidates as
well,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk, a five-term Republican congressman from Chicago&#8217;s
northern suburbs, raised $2.2 million during the first quarter
of 2010 and ended the period with more than $3 million in the
bank, his campaign said in an earlier statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias, 34, raised $1.2 million during the first
quarter and ended the period with that same amount in the bank,
his campaign said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk criticized Giannoulias for not releasing his 2009 tax
return, as he has done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I knew that I had to finish my taxes on time because I
was running for a very high-profile office at a time when
transparency is everything,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk pointed to financial troubles experienced by a
community bank run by Giannoulias&#8217;s family as one possible
reason why his opponent filed for an extension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Coming Implosion&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I worry that the coming implosion of his family bank may
have tax implications for him and therefore he&#8217;s not willing to
release his taxes,&#8221; Kirk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias routinely files for an extension on his taxes
as he awaits documents from the family business, said Kathleen
Strand, a spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Alexi, as he has for all of the years he has been in
public office, will release his tax returns in full as soon as
they are filed,&#8221; she said, adding they will be released &#8220;as
soon as possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadway Bank in Chicago, whose wealth helped finance
Giannoulias&#8217;s successful 2006 bid for state treasurer, has been
operating since January under a consent agreement with the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. because of commercial real-
estate loan losses. The family must raise at least $75 million
by later this month to meet regulatory demands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk has suggested that Giannoulias exercised bad judgment
while working from 2002 through 2006 as a senior loan officer
and bank vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias has responded by saying the bank was healthy
when he left and that just 9 percent of about $240 million in
nonperforming assets on the bank&#8217;s books originated while he was
there. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders are collapsing nationwide amid losses on
residential and commercial real estate loans. U.S. banks with
problems climbed to the highest level since 1992 in the fourth
quarter of 2009, according to FDIC data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk said he is opposed to legislation to overhaul U.S.
financial regulations being pushed by Obama and Democrats in
Congress. He said that proposal would &#8220;continue the &#8216;too big to
fail rule&#8217;&#8221; with &#8220;even more taxpayer dollars&#8221; on the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate seat in Illinois is held by Democrat Roland
Burris, who isn&#8217;t seeking a full term. Republicans are trying to
take advantage of ethical problems experienced by Illinois
Democrats, including a public corruption trial set to begin June
3 for former Governor Rod Blagojevich, who appointed Burris to
complete Obama&#8217;s term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption Tax &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The topic of Kirk&#8217;s news conference, held inside a federal
courtroom and managed by his congressional staff, was to make
the case that Illinois taxpayers and businesses are hurt by what
he called a &#8220;corruption tax&#8221; they face through rigged
contracts, kickback scenes and other fraud. He called for added
funding for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A poll by Public Policy Polling released April 6 showed
Kirk leading Giannoulias by 37 percent to 33 percent, with 30
percent undecided. The survey of Illinois voters was conducted
April 1 to April 5 and has a margin of error of 4 percentage
points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crude oil fell for a third day
after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., causing investors to move away from risky assets
such as commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil dropped 2.2 percent as the SEC accused Goldman of fraud
tied to collateralized debt obligations that contributed to the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Crude also
fell as air-traffic disruptions caused by Iceland&#8217;s
Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull volcano cut demand for jet fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The news about Goldman Sachs is weighing on the market,&#8221;
said Chris Dillman, an analyst with Tradition Energy in
Stamford, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for May delivery dropped $1.79 to settle at
$81.45 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil lost
2.7 percent on April 16 to $83.24 a barrel, the biggest decline
since Feb. 5, on the Goldman suit. Prices have retreated 6.2
percent from a 17-month high on April 6. They are up 62 percent
in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the U.K.
Financial Services Authority to start its own probe of Goldman,
saying he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated
in the SEC lawsuit, which was announced April 16. Germany&#8217;s
financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for details on the
suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is more about fragility of confidence than the
specifics of oil,&#8221; said Michael Fitzpatrick, vice president of
energy at MF Global in New York. &#8220;The market was overdue for a
rundown, and it&#8217;s an acknowledgement of the fundamentals.
Goldman probably exacerbated it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excess Output &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC violating production quotas at the same time as demand
from industrialized nations stagnates is spurring bets in the
oil market that the 13-month rally in crude is coming to an end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Options that profit if prices fall in the next month are 26
percent higher than wagers oil will rise. Open interest in June
$50 and $60 puts to sell at those levels exceeded 129,000
contracts on April 16, dwarfing the 50,000 bets on $100 a
barrel. Puts account for about 56 percent of all June options
contracts compared with 51 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be
creating a glut after output jumped 5.6 percent to 29.2 million
barrels a day in March from a year earlier, according to
Bloomberg estimates. Shipments will rise 0.9 percent in the four
weeks ending May 1, according to tanker-tracker Oil Movements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines and oil companies have canceled orders for jet
fuel as a result of the European flight disruption, according to
German barge operator Maintank Schiffahrtsgesellschaft mbH. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flight Cancellations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 81,000 flights have been canceled after the
April 14 eruption of Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull spewed dust across
Europe&#8217;s airspace, causing airports from Dublin to Moscow to
shutter. Jet fuel&#8217;s premium to ICE gasoil futures declined to a
three-week low of $35 a metric ton today, according to Bloomberg
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This sudden no-fly situation in Europe is really
impacting things,&#8221; said John Kilduff, a partner at Round Earth
Capital, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on food and
energy. &#8220;When you have that coupled with the new uncertainty
with the Goldman Sachs situation, a lot of what this market was
focusing on when it was rising is out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis told the BBC today
that it may be possible to open U.K. airspace tomorrow, as
reports show there has been a &#8220;dramatic reduction&#8221; in volcanic
activity in Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Advances &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also weakening prices, the euro fell to a one-week low
against the dollar on concern that the Goldman investigation
will widen and Greece&#8217;s aid package may falter. European Union
finance ministers told Greece to brace itself for the
International Monetary Fund&#8217;s conditions on a bailout package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. currency gained 0.2 percent to $1.3477 per euro at
3:28 p.m. in New York compared with $1.3503 on April 16. A
stronger dollar reduces the appeal of commodities as an
alternative investment. The dollar has advanced for the past
three trading sessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative net-long positions, or the difference between
orders to buy and sell the commodity on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, decreased 12 percent to 113,364 contracts on April 13,
the commission said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. inventories of crude oil probably declined for a
second week as imports slipped, a Bloomberg News survey showed.
Supplies fell 300,000 barrels in the seven days ended April 16
from 354 million the prior week, according to the median of 10
analyst estimates before an Energy Department report this week.
Five forecast a drop, four a gain and one estimated no change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude oil for June settlement lost $1.76, or 2
percent, to $84.23 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures
Europe exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 612,361
contracts as of 3:27 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 952,237
contracts April 16, 45 percent above the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.38 million contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s stock
price may fall and the board could come under pressure to change
managers after European politicians followed a U.S. fraud suit
with plans to scrutinize the firm, investors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the U.K.
Financial Services Authority to start a probe, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Goldman Sachs.
Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for details
on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalating rhetoric adds urgency to efforts by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and the rest of his
board to stem negative publicity. Although Goldman Sachs vowed
to fight the SEC case, calling it &#8220;unfounded in law and fact,&#8221;
the stock plunged 13 percent on April 16. The shares rose 1.6
percent to $163.32 at 4:50 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lynch-mob mentality that is prevailing right now
against Goldman is such that you don&#8217;t know where this thing
could go, so I think the stock is going to be under continuing
pressure,&#8221; said Michael Holland, who oversees more than $4
billion as chairman of New York-based Holland  Co. &#8220;The board
actually has to pay attention not only to the legal niceties of
this thing but also to the franchise viability as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, said he sold his Goldman Sachs
stock on April 16 because the SEC suit brought the controversy
over Wall Street&#8217;s dealings in collateralized debt obligations
and credit-default swaps to a new level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Investors Understand Fraud&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors understand that something complicated and
errant happened with CDOs and CDSs but they&#8217;re not sure entirely
what, because these collateralized debt obligations and credit-
default swaps are complicated and somewhat arcane,&#8221; said Farr,
whose firm manages more than $700 million in assets. &#8220;But
investors understand fraud. They get fraud really clearly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuel Robinson, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wheat fell the most in three months
on speculation that a U.S. government fraud lawsuit against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will curb investment demand for riskier
assets including commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat posted the biggest decline among the 19 commodities
tracked by the Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index, which slipped for a
third session. Corn, aluminum and energy products also dropped.
Investors may be selling commodity futures on speculation that
Goldman, one of the biggest traders, may have to unload some of
its holdings, said Jason Britt, the president of Central States
Commodities Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The biggest thing right now is the Goldman Sachs news and
what kind of impact it&#8217;s going to have on commodities,&#8221; Britt
said from Kansas City, Missouri. &#8220;Goldman is so actively
involved in commodity markets that you can&#8217;t think commodities
are going to come through this unscathed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat futures for July delivery fell 23 cents, or 4.6
percent, to $4.795 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, the
biggest decline since Jan. 12. The most-active contract is down
11 percent this year because of reduced demand for U.S. grain
and rising global stockpiles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price also dropped as rainfall boosts prospects for
U.S. crops. As much as 0.5 inch (1.2 centimeter) will fall
tomorrow from Kansas through Oklahoma and into Texas, the most-
productive growing area for hard-red winter wheat,
Accuweather.com said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weather&#8217;s been good,&#8221; Britt said. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to
come up with anything that&#8217;s bullish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat is the fourth-biggest U.S. crop, valued at $10.6
billion in 2009, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data
show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dollar rose against most of its
major counterparts as concern an investigation of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. will widen and Greece&#8217;s aid package may falter
boosted demand for the U.S. currency as a refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We saw a spike in risk aversion,&#8221; said Camilla Sutton, a
Bank of Nova Scotia currency strategist in Toronto. &#8220;The
combination of the escalating concerns about Greece and worries
that Goldman isn&#8217;t the only one caused fear in the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell against the dollar for a third day on
speculation debt-strapped Greece may need more than the European
Union pledged last week. The yen erased its gain versus the euro
as two people with knowledge of the situation said the
Securities and Exchange Commission didn&#8217;t unanimously approve
pursuing a case against New York-based Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16-nation euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.3486 at 4:03 p.m.
in New York, from $1.3503 on April 16, after reaching $1.3416,
the lowest level since April 9. The yen slid 0.1 percent to
124.59 per euro, from 124.44, after reaching 123.16, the
strongest level since March 26. The yen declined 0.2 percent to
92.38 against the dollar, from 92.17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s rand lost 0.8 percent to 7.4474 versus the
dollar and Norway&#8217;s krone declined 0.4 percent to 5.9212 on
speculation investors will reduce carry trades, in which they
buy higher-yielding assets with amounts borrowed in nations with
low interest rates. The fed funds target of zero to 0.25 percent
has made the dollar popular for funding such transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dollar Versus Yen &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. currency dropped 0.9 percent versus the yen on
April 16, the most since February, as stocks fell on the Goldman
Sachs fraud investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar may fall to near 88 yen, a level last reached in
December, if it breaks below support as weakness in other yen
pairs adds to selling pressure on the greenback, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Friday&#8217;s deep decline raises the risk of a deeper
corrective phase,&#8221; Niall O&#8217;Connor, a technical analyst at
JPMorgan Chase in New York, wrote in a note to clients. &#8220;The
action in the crosses implies additional yen strength is likely,
and the 91.10 area will act as key support.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A break of that level may mean a decreaseto 88.14,
O&#8217;Connor wrote. Support is a level where orders to buy the
dollar may be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Prime Minister Gordon Brown said yesterday he
was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
suit against Goldman Sachs. The German government &#8220;will ask the
SEC for information,&#8221; said Ulrich Wilhelm, a spokesman for
Chancellor Angela Merkel. &#8220;Then we will look at the records and
consider possible legal steps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Complete Unfounded&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has said the claims are &#8220;completely
unfounded,&#8221; while Paulson hasn&#8217;t been accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s commissioners split 3-2 along party lines to
approve an enforcement case against Goldman Sachs, according to
two people familiar with the situation who declined to be
identified because the vote wasn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index advanced 0.5 percent after
earlier dropping 0.7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield offered by Greek 10-year bonds over
similar-maturity German bunds, Europe&#8217;s benchmark debt
securities, widened 0.32 percentage point to 4.62 percentage
points, the most since October 1998. A wider gap between yields
indicates perceptions of higher risk for Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The spread is as good as any indicator of the level of
concern,&#8221; said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at Bank
of New York Mellon Corp. in London. &#8220;We are moving slowly
toward the point where the button is hit to call in the aid. All
those things continue to weigh on the euro.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weber on Greece &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bundesbank President Axel Weber told German lawmakers that
Greece may need more assistance than the 30 billion euros ($40
billion) promised by the European Union as the government in
Athens struggles to push through planned spending cuts, said two
people present at a briefing to lawmakers. They spoke on
condition of anonymity because the presentation in Berlin today
was private. The International Monetary Fund has promised
another 15 billion euros in help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks on Greece involving the European Commission, the IMF
and the European Central Bank were delayed until April 21 from
today because of a volcanic ash cloud disrupting air travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s currency depreciated as much as 0.9 percent to
C$1.0216 per U.S. dollar, the weakest level since March 30,
before tomorrow&#8217;s Bank of Canada meeting. China&#8217;s government
told banks to stop loans for third-home purchases, sending oil
lower and reducing the appeal of commodity-linked currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for May delivery slid 2 percent to $81.60 barrel.
Canada depends on raw materials for about half of its export
revenue, and oil is its biggest export. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s dollar advanced 0.4 percent to 65.57 yen
before a report forecast to show the nation&#8217;s consumer prices
rose during the first three months of 2010. The kiwi appreciated
0.2 percent to 70.98 U.S. cents. The report from Statistics New
Zealand is due at 6:45 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Richard
Kinder and the private-equity firms that bought Kinder Morgan
Inc. in 2007 have gained at least 126 percent return on a pretax
basis from their $7.8 billion equity investment, according to
CreditSights Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsidiaries of Goldman Sachs, Carlyle Group, American
International Group Inc., Riverstone Holdings LLC and Kinder co-
founder Richard Kinder, agreed to pay $14.4 billion for the
operator of North American oil and natural-gas pipelines in
August 2006. While the deal was struck at the height of the
leveraged takeover boom, it stands out as bondholders haven&#8217;t
taken losses, said Andy DeVries, a CreditSights analyst in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This LBO remains one of the most unique of the 2005-07
LBO boom,&#8221; DeVries wrote in an April 18 report. In August, he
calculated the buyout equity investment had gained 69 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinder Morgan is the general partner of Kinder Morgan
Energy Partners, a publicly traded limited partnership that
operates or owns an interest in more than 35,000 miles of
pipelines. Chief Executive Officer Kinder and other managers at
the firm contributed $2.9 billion of the $7.8 billion equity
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Pierce, a Kinder Morgan Energy Partners spokesman,
and Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Andrea Raphael, didn&#8217;t immediately
return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Jody Shenn and Joshua Gallu" date="Apr 19, 2010  2:33 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-19/goldman-sachs-fraud-suit-hinges-on-meaning-of-selected-in-paulson-abacus.html"><headline>Goldman SEC Case May Hinge on Meaning of &#8216;Selected&#8217;</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The case against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may turn on the meaning of the word &#8220;selected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission must prove that the
most profitable company in Wall Street history defrauded
investors by failing to disclose that a hedge-fund firm betting
against them played a role in creating what they bought. It must
also counter Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assertion that an independent asset
manager, which the SEC said rejected more than half of the
securities initially proposed by Paulson  Co. for a
collateralized debt obligation, signed off on the selections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is whether Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed role in
portfolio selection was material,&#8221; said Larry Ribstein, a law
professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign who has
written about 140 articles and 10 books on topics including
securities law and professional ethics. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear and
well-defined definition of what you have to disclose in this
type of transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC case signals the regulator could eventually target
other banks over how much they told investors about at least $40
billion of CDOs that turned toxic as mortgage defaults soared to
the highest level since the 1930s. Robert Khuzami, the SEC
enforcement chief, said last week that the agency will
aggressively pursue deals &#8220;that share similar profiles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG are among banks that underwrote CDOs involving two
other hedge-fund firms that could have profited as homeowners
stopped paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, WaMu &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO market is separate from the $2 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities created from 2005 through 2007 out of
risky subprime and Alt-A loans, and then often packaged into
CDOs, including the more than $200 billion issued in 2007. The
SEC hasn&#8217;t announced any suits over MBS disclosures by
underwriters or issuers. This month, former Citigroup and
Washington Mutual Inc. officials told government panels that
their companies knew that their vetting of home loans they sold
off was shoddy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clayton Holdings LLC, the largest provider of due diligence
on mortgages that Wall Street banks bought to package into
securities, in response to subpoenas and document requests has
provided information to the SEC and state attorneys general in
addition to New York&#8217;s Andrew Cuomo, who collected reports from
it in 2007, Marc Rothenberg, a lawyer for the company in New
York at Blank Rome LLP, said in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Full Investigation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let&#8217;s see a full investigation of all the banks that made
material misstatements and omissions in mortgage-securities
issues during the lead-up to the crisis, because many of them
did,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, managing director of New York-based
advisory firm Graham Fisher  Co. &#8220;Hopefully this is the
beginning of the SEC looking at dealer practices of putting
their own returns ahead of their customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, which filed its complaint against New York-based
Goldman Sachs on April 16, is seeking to prove only that the
CDO&#8217;s investors, including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN
Amro Bank NV, may have reasonably wanted more information than
they got about Paulson&#8217;s involvement, said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Materially Misleading&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tactic reduces the case to whether there was &#8220;a false
statement or a material omission that made statements materially
misleading,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;That frees the SEC of the need to
prove there was intent to defraud, which changes the balance
considerably in favor of the SEC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, headed by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, said in a statement on April 16 that the SEC
allegations were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a marketing document for the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-
AC1, Goldman Sachs said it might have access to &#8220;non-publicly
available information&#8221; about the collateral and, because of
that, &#8220;this presentation may not contain all information that
would be material to the evaluation of the merits and risks of
purchasing the notes.&#8221; The flip book prepared for potential
investors said the CDO would be linked to securities
&#8220;selected&#8221; by asset manager ACA Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s Subprime Bets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson, the hedge-fund firm managed by John Paulson, 54, which became the world&#8217;s third-largest after
betting against subprime mortgages and reaping about $1 billion
on the Abacus deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC complaint said that ACA rejected 68 of 123
positions Paulson initially suggested. After a back-and-forth
between the asset manager and the hedge fund intermediated by
Goldman Sachs resulted in ACA and Paulson agreeing on 90
securities, one ACA employee said in an e-mail to another that
the portfolio &#8220;looks good to me,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t necessarily required to describe the
selection process to sophisticated buyers of the CDO, said James Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham,
North Carolina. Instead, he said, the bank may have crossed the
line by telling investors half-truths -- touting the role of
ACA, while omitting Paulson&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re creating a dangerous product, you can&#8217;t
insulate yourself by bringing in an innocent party that dilutes
the danger of that product, if you know it&#8217;s still dangerous,&#8221;
Cox said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Notorious Bear&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the SEC&#8217;s case will be to prove that investors
may have balked if they knew that &#8220;a notorious bear&#8221; was on
the other side of the trade and had a hand in designing the
product, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. The SEC will need to show that the deal was designed
to lose and that Goldman Sachs knowingly withheld information
because it knew investors wouldn&#8217;t like it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once you start pulling on this thread, there&#8217;s
potentially a lot of other people who might have done similar
things,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for
two bond insurers and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin
Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;These practices were relatively
widespread.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half a dozen of the world&#8217;s biggest banks
underwrote CDOs involving hedge-fund firms with bets against
mortgage bonds, including Citigroup, UBS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Corp. unit, Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Agricole SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The hedge funds, Evanston, Illinois-based
Magnetar Capital LLC and Tricadia Capital Management LLC in New
York, were involved in at least $42 billion of CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar helped create more than 20 mortgage-bond CDOs
named after constellations by agreeing to buy the riskiest
slices and paired the purchases with larger bets that pieces of
those and other CDOs would fail. That reflected a view that if
any low-rated subprime mortgage bonds defaulted, most would. The
CDOs totaled at least $32 billion, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many CDO managers &#8220;played along with&#8221; the interests of
hedge funds when constructing their deals, said Jon Pickhardt,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His firm, which is representing Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank in a suit against Merrill Lynch over a Magnetar CDO,
said in an April 16 letter to the judge in that case that
documents filed confidentially to the court show collateral
manager NIR Capital Management LLC let Magnetar select assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other plaintiffs in CDO suits have included MT Bank Corp.
and bond insurer MBIA Inc. Investors including the Plumbers&#8217;
Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund, City of Ann Arbor Employees&#8217;
Retirement System and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh,
Seattle and San Francisco have sued banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Nomura Holdings Inc. over disclosures on mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Insisting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar sometimes told CDO managers and banks that it
wanted to bet against certain securities, said a person close to
the company. The firm stopped short of insisting that the
credit-default swaps used to make those bets be included in its
CDOs, and they didn&#8217;t make up the majority of a CDO&#8217;s holdings,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Magnetar avoided ordering managers to buy specific
securities, it often pushed them to select ones with higher
yields, according to a person who participated in some of the
transactions and declined to be identified because the deals
were private. The firm told banks and asset managers what its
strategy was, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar, in an e-mailed statement, said it didn&#8217;t select
the assets going into its CDOs, that it didn&#8217;t have a particular
view on the housing market and that both underwriters and
collateral managers understood its strategy of betting against
&#8220;particular tranches.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricadia told investors in prospectuses for the almost $10
billion of CDOs for which it served as asset manager that it
might or would bet against the collateral it selected. In April
2007, the firm took it one step further by disclosing in a 399-
page prospectus that it took the opposite side of trades that
the CDO entered into through UBS, the underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;General statements with respect to the possibility of
conflicts of interest are not going to inoculate banks or asset
managers or hedge funds,&#8221; said Pickhardt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricadia, which also said it would buy some of the CDOs&#8217;
most junior slices, was created in April 2003 as an affiliate of
Marnier Investment Group, a hedge-fund firm whose management
included Lee Sachs, now a counselor to Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner. Tricadia co-founder Michael Barnes didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO at the center of the SEC case is one of at least 23
Abacus deals created by Goldman Sachs, and one of the only ones
for which the firm hired an outside asset manager, according to
prospectuses. The others were managed by Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic CDOs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. The vehicles
come in three varieties: synthetic, meaning filled with credit-
default swaps instead of actual securities; cash, which are
filled with actual bonds; and hybrids, with a mix of both of
debt and default swaps, which are derivatives that offer
payments if the securities they reference don&#8217;t perform as
expected, in return for regular premiums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abacus deals were synthetic CDOs tied to mostly
subprime home loans and commercial mortgages. UBS, in a series
called North Street from at least 2000 through at least 2005,
and Deutsche Bank, through its Start program in at least 2005
and 2006, also issued synthetic CDOs tied to mortgages,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummings, DeFazio &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Representatives Elijah Cummings and Peter DeFazio said today they would ask SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro to
review whether Goldman Sachs CDOs insured by American
International Group Inc. were improperly created. AIG, rescued
by the U.S. in 2008, covered $6 billion of assets through Abacus
deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs brought in an outside firm to manage the
assets in Abacus 2007-AC1 to reassure investors about the
portfolio&#8217;s quality as the market began to show signs of
distress, according to the SEC complaint. One buyer, Dusseldorf,
Germany-based IKB, was no longer purchasing CDOs without
independent managers, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO and other late 2006 and 2007 Abacus transactions
were also unusual because other banks had stopped doing
synthetic CDOs, since hybrid CDOs could be used to off-load risk
in the same ways, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid mortgage-bond CDOs boomed as banks sought to balance
the bets against home-loan securities they were selling to hedge
funds such as Paulson, Hayman Advisors LP in Dallas and Lahde
Capital Management LLC in Santa Monica, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hybrid CDO was ACA Aquarius 2006-1 Ltd., a $2 billion
deal created in September 2006 with ACA as the manager. It was
part of the series of CDOs involving Magnetar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Further to Fall&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC suit says that Goldman Sachs misled ACA into
believing that Paulson planned to buy the CDO&#8217;s lowest-ranked
slices, while in fact the bank knew that the fund planned bets
against more senior pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that ACA knew Paulson was involved in
the selection process and wasn&#8217;t sued for aiding and abetting,&#8221;
Ribstein, the Illinois law professor said. &#8220;It seems to have
been common knowledge that Paulson was betting against the
market through credit-default swaps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early March 2007, Paulson said in an investor letter
that subprime-mortgage defaults would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that,
&#8220;while the bonds have fallen significantly, we think they have
much further to fall,&#8221; according to a March 15, 2007, Bloomberg
News story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Response &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA completed the portfolio on Feb. 26, 2007, the SEC said.
The deal closed on April 26, 2007, according to the complaint,
which didn&#8217;t say whether ACA, which sold protection against the
default of part of the CDO through a sister bond insurance unit
that was the first debt guarantor to collapse, had any ability
to change the make-up in March or April of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said in a
statement on April 16, adding that the securities were rated AAA
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a statement the securities were
&#8220;selected by an independent and experienced portfolio selection
agent after a series of discussions, including with Paulson 
Co., which were entirely typical of these types of
transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyer Beware &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers of deals involving default swaps are foolish if they
don&#8217;t realize someone had picked securities to bet against them,
said David Castillo, a senior managing director at San
Francisco-based broker Further Lane Securities, a trader of
structured securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a synthetic transaction involving any asset, the
participants know upfront that there is someone who believes the
opposite side of the trade,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable
to participate in this type of transaction and expect any other
scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, what Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t tell investors included
the fact that Paulson was betting against the Abacus CDO&#8217;s
senior pieces, the SEC said, meaning the firm only stood to
profit if many of the securities it helped pick went bad and not
just a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the regular sales of synthetic and hybrid CDO
notes to other CDOs and into $400 billion market for structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, such as Axon Financial Funding
Ltd. that funded themselves with commercial paper means that not
all debt buyers were aware they were taking the opposite side of
some investor&#8217;s bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The involvement of default swaps in the Goldman Sachs case
may make it harder for the SEC to win, said Todd Henderson, a
law professor at the University of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Facial Fishiness&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One possible defense for Goldman is that the disclosure
would have been irrelevant because everybody knew,&#8221; said
Henderson. &#8220;They could argue that these weren&#8217;t widows and
orphans investing in these products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in its statement that IKB and ACA
Capital Management, two investors in Abacus 2007-AC1 identified
in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk associated with the
securities and were &#8220;among the most sophisticated mortgage
investors in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB lost about $150 million and Edinburgh-based Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position after taking over ABN Amro, according to the SEC. The
insurance provided by ACA to ABN Amro was worth little after the
insurer collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Far More Sophisticated&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Materiality is a lot like a continuum,&#8221; said Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman
Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;The amount
of information that needs to be disclosed to institutional
investors at the highest level, where they&#8217;re doing their own
research and analysis, is less. Their criteria for the
investment decisions tend to be far more sophisticated than the
individual investor&#8217;s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even on that continuum, Goldman Sachs has a lot of
explaining to do, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like the SEC is hoping that the facial fishiness
of the transaction is going to be enough here to sink Goldman
Sachs&#8221; in this case, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold dropped to the lowest price in
almost two weeks after a government suit against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. spurred investors to hold cash, boosting the dollar
and eroding demand for the metal as an alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar rose as much as 0.6 percent against a basket of
major currencies. Yields on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury
touched the lowest level in three weeks before rebounding as
investigations into Goldman spread to Europe. Global equities
fell. On April 16, gold tumbled 2.6 percent after the U.S.
announced the Goldman lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dollar strength is moving capital out of gold,&#8221; said
Frank Lesh, a trader at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t know where the Goldman pieces are going to fall, so people
are moving into cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures for June delivery fell $1.10, or 0.1 percent,
to $1,135.80 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Earlier, the
price touched $1,124.30, the lowest level for a most-active
contract since April 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for regulators to
investigate Goldman, and Germany signaled it may begin its own
probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any return of risk aversion that this prompts is going to
be bad news for the gold price, at least in the short term,&#8221;
Philip Klapwijk, the executive chairman of London-based research
company GFMS Ltd., said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials fell as
much as 1.3 percent after declining 1.2 percent on April 16.
Goldman is the biggest U.S. commodity brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The initial reaction is to liquidate everything because
we don&#8217;t know how much Goldman has in commodity funds and if
they will be liquidating those funds,&#8221; Lesh of FuturePath said.
&#8220;We also don&#8217;t know what type of commodities regulation is
coming.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses were limited on demand for some commodities after
the decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver futures for May delivery rose 5.6 cents, or 0.3
percent, to $17.731 an ounce on the Comex. The metal fell 4.1
percent on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Platinum futures for July delivery rose $1.30, or 0.1
percent, to $1,696.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Palladium for June delivery climbed $1.85, or 0.3
percent, to $533.70 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulator suing Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. for fraud should widen its probe to determine whether
securities backed by bailed-out insurer American International
Group Inc. were improperly created, said two lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is &#8220;not beyond the realm of comprehension&#8221; that
Goldman Sachs misled investors on collateralized debt
obligations apart from the one cited last week by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, Democratic Representatives Elijah
Cummings and Peter DeFazio said in a letter to be sent to SEC
Chairman Mary Schapiro. AIG, rescued by the U.S. in 2008,
insured about $6 billion of Goldman Sachs CDOs named Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Should any of these transactions be found to include
fraudulent conduct, any resulting contractual payments from AIG-
issued credit-default swaps could be viewed as ill-gotten
gains,&#8221; Cummings and DeFazio wrote. &#8220;It is imperative that the
SEC pursue the recovery from Goldman Sachs of any fraudulently
obtained AIG payments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers&#8217; demand adds pressure on New York-based
Goldman Sachs as European politicians increase scrutiny of the
bank. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for a probe
by the U.K. Financial Services Authority and Germany&#8217;s financial
regulator asked the SEC for details of its suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs failed to disclose to investors of a CDO
called Abacus 2007-AC1 that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick
the underlying assets and bet against the security, according to
the SEC suit. The SEC charges are &#8220;completely unfounded in law
and fact,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Nester, a spokesman for the SEC, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call seeking comment. Mark Herr, a spokesman for New
York-based AIG, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking Signatures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummings, from Maryland, and DeFazio, of Oregon, are
circulating the letter, which is dated today and hasn&#8217;t been
mailed yet, among lawmakers to add more signatures, according to
a statement from Cummings&#8217;s office. The New York Times reported
on the letter earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds into a series of new securities with
varying risks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasury 10-year notes fell for the
first time in three days as stocks swung between gains and
losses after Citigroup Inc. reported better-than-forecast
results, reducing the refuge appeal of U.S. government debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year note yields slid seven basis points on April 16,
the most on a closing basis in over a week, after the Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for fraud
tied to collateralized debt obligations. The index of U.S.
leading indicators rose in March by the most in 10 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in a wait-and-see type atmosphere where rates are
being driven by stocks, earnings and how the Goldman story plays
out,&#8221; said Paul Horrmann, a broker in New York at Tradition
Asiel Securities, an interdealer broker. &#8220;The market seems to
be taking a bit of a breather.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the benchmark 10-year note rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 3.78 percent at 1:29 p.m.
in New York, according to BGCantor Market Data. The yield
earlier touched 3.74 percent, the lowest since March 24. The
3.625 percent security due February 2020 fell 5/32, or $1.56 per
$1,000 face amount, to 98 22/32. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Overbought Territory&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Treasuries have rallied into thick bands of resistance
while momentum indicators have edged into overbought
territory,&#8221; William O&#8217;Donnell, U.S. government bond strategist
at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc in Stamford, Connecticut,
one of 18 primary dealers that trade with the Federal Reserve,
wrote in a note to clients. Resistance refers to areas on charts
where sell orders are clustered. Such a band is between 3.745
percent and 3.56 percent on the 10-year note, O&#8217;Donnell wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index gained 0.2 percent after
sliding 1.6 percent on April 16, the most since Feb 4. Citigroup
jumped 4.8 percent after profit more than doubled as costs for
bad loans decreased. Goldman Sachs lost 1.7 percent as Germany
and the U.K. signaled probes of the most profitable firm in Wall
Street history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for the
Financial Services Authority to start an investigation into
Goldman Sachs. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the
SEC for details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela
Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is also probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role in
arranging swaps for Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s
budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery Concern &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concern the global recovery is facing headwinds has helped
send 10-year yields down from the 4.01 percent they reached on
April 5, the highest level since October 2008. Fed Chairman Ben
S. Bernanke told Congress on April 14 that high unemployment and
weak construction are among the &#8220;significant restraints&#8221; on
the pace of growth and repeated the Fed&#8217;s view that borrowing
costs are likely to stay low for an &#8220;extended period.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, fell to 2.32 percentage points today from
this year&#8217;s high of 2.49 percentage points set in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs inflation is contained will encourage investors to
buy longer-maturity bonds, flattening the so-called yield curve,
according to Mizuho Asset Management. The difference in yield
between two- and 10-year notes, which was at 2.81 percentage
points today, is likely to narrow to 2.22 percentage points by
year-end, a weighted Bloomberg survey of economists showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German Bunds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wholesale prices excluding food and energy costs rose 0.1
percent in March, the same as the prior month, according to a
Bloomberg survey before the Labor Department report on April 22.
The cost of living in the U.S. rose 0.1 percent in March, while
prices excluding food and energy were unchanged, the Labor
Department said April 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index of leading indicators rose 1.4 percent last
month, more than the 1.1 percent median forecast in a Bloomberg
survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors remained the least bearish this year on U.S.
government debt, according to a survey of money managers by Ried
Thunberg ICAP Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s index measuring the outlook for Treasuries
through the end of June was 46, matching the highest this year.
A figure less than 50 shows investors expect prices to decline.
The company, based in Jersey City, New Jersey, interviewed 21
fund managers controlling $1.32 trillion of assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on 10-year German bunds rose as much as 0.24
percentage point relative to similar-maturity Treasuries from
April 5 through last week and BlackRock Inc., the world&#8217;s
largest money manager, said it no longer pays to own the debt
amid Europe&#8217;s fiscal crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After returning three times more than Treasuries since
Sept. 15, 2008, as investors favored the debt of nations with
the lowest budget deficits, sentiment toward bunds is turning on
speculation the aid package may be the first step in a unified
fiscal policy. Europe&#8217;s &#8220;game of fiscal chicken&#8221; promises to
make governments less determined to cut deficits, according to
BNP Paribas SA, France&#8217;s biggest bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cattle and hog futures were little
changed as investors sold riskier assets including commodities
after U.S. regulators sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. and German regulators are investigating whether they
can take action against Goldman, one of Wall Street&#8217;s biggest
traders and brokers of commodities. The U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a suit last week, alleging fraud tied
to collateralized-debt obligations. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB
Index of 19 raw materials dropped as much as 1.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All these markets could suffer the fallout of the risk-
aversion trade,&#8221; said Don Roose, the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cattle futures for June delivery were little changed at
94.575 cents a pound at 11:53 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Futures were up 11 percent in the past year, before
today. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.6
cent, or 0.5 percent, to $1.15875 a pound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hog futures for June settlement were steady at 86.2 cents a
pound. Earlier, the price fell as much as 0.9 percent. On April
16, the most-active contract reached 86.85 cents, matching the
highest price since May 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prospect of decreasing meat supplies underpinned
livestock futures, and demand may climb as the weather warms in
North America and more people grill outdoors, Roose said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meatpackers processed 32.3 million hogs this year through
April 17, or 4.5 percent less a year earlier. Wholesale pork
prices have climbed for 12 straight sessions, reaching 85.34
cents a pound last week, the highest level since August 2008,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grilling Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Numbers are down, weights are down and consumers are
willing to pay higher prices while the retailer is going into
grilling season,&#8221; Roose said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wholesale choice beef climbed to $1.6711 a pound at midday,
the highest level since July 2008. Steer carcasses weighed an
average 833 pounds (378 kilograms) at slaughter last week, 15
pounds less than a week earlier. High prices increased
meatpacker demand and spurred feedlots to sell animals early.
Lighter cattle yield less beef. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar fell to the
lowest level in more than two weeks as the U.S. lawsuit against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. began prompting inquiries in Europe,
damping investor appetite for higher-yielding assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency, nicknamed the Aussie, also dropped as China,
Australia&#8217;s biggest trading partner, took steps to rein in
credit and before a meeting this week of Greek, European and
International Monetary Fund officials to discuss aid for Greece.
New Zealand&#8217;s currency fluctuated before a report forecast to
show consumer prices rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s status as a leader among U.S. investment banks
makes the probe more significant than scrutiny of a smaller
firm, and with the prospects of further probes, that may be
damping risk appetite,&#8221; said Imre Speizer, a market strategist
in Wellington at Westpac Banking Corp. The market also &#8220;will be
looking to see whether Greece is going to formally seek
funding,&#8221; Speizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s currency dropped 0.6 percent to 91.84 U.S.
cents at 12:37 p.m. in New York, from 92.43 cents on April 16.
The currency earlier touched 91.58 U.S. cents, the lowest level
since April 1. The Aussie weakened 0.5 percent to 84.74 yen
after touching 83.94 yen, the lowest level since March 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s dollar fell 0.3 percent to 70.66 U.S. cents,
from 70.85 cents on April 16, after strengthening earlier as
much as 0.4 percent. It declined 0.1 percent to 65.23 yen,
compared with 65.31 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Moral Bankruptcy&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the
Financial Services Authority to start an investigation into
Goldman Sachs, saying he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral
bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in a suit filed against the bank last
week by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Germany&#8217;s
financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for details on the
suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China told its banks to stop loans for third-home purchases
in cities with excessive property price gains. The nation&#8217;s
latest move to cool its property market came after prices gained
a record 11.7 percent in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s consumer prices climbed 0.6 percent in the
first quarter after a 0.2 percent decline in the last quarter of
2009, according to the median estimate of 14 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey before Statistics New Zealand reports the
data at 6:45 p.m. New York time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks on Greece involving the European Commission, the IMF
and the European Central Bank were delayed to April 21 from
today because of the volcanic ash cloud disrupting European air
travel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European shares declined for a
second day as the U.K. and Germany signaled probes into Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and volcanic ash from Iceland kept much of
Europe&#8217;s airspace closed for a fifth day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG slid 2 percent as last week&#8217;s Securities and
Exchange Commission suit spurred concern that the fallout from
the financial crisis isn&#8217;t over. Greece&#8217;s ASE Index dropped 2.6
percent and credit-default swaps on the nation&#8217;s government
bonds rose to a record after talks on its debt crisis were
delayed. Air France-KLM Group sank 2.9 percent as the eruption
of the Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull volcano forced planes to stay grounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.7 percent to 266.13, the
lowest close this month. The gauge has climbed 4.8 percent in
2010 as the European Union agreed a $61 billion aid package to
help Greece tackle the region&#8217;s biggest budget deficit and the
U.S. Federal Reserve pledged to maintain record-low interest
rates to foster the recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s news clearly isn&#8217;t positive and does cast a
cloud over investment banking,&#8221; said London-based Kevin Lilley,
who helps oversee about $2 billion at Royal London Asset
Management. &#8220;The market was looking a little overbought so it
doesn&#8217;t take a lot&#8221; for investors to find an excuse to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx 600 tumbled the most since February on April 16
as the SEC sued Goldman Sachs for misstating and omitting facts
about a collateralized debt obligation. The bank said the case
is &#8220;unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Deutsche Bank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, the biggest lender in Switzerland, declined 2 percent
to 17.57 Swiss francs. Deutsche Bank AG, Germany&#8217;s largest bank,
fell 2.6 percent to 54.56 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for U.K.
regulators to start their own inquiry into Goldman Sachs, saying
he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
suit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for
details, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks pared their losses as Citigroup Inc. posted
better-than-estimated earnings and the index of U.S. leading
indicators rose in March by the most in 10 months. The 1.4
percent increase in the New York-based Conference Board&#8217;s
measure of the economic outlook was more than anticipated and
followed a revised 0.4 percent gain in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National benchmark indexes fell in all 18 western European
markets today, except Iceland. Germany&#8217;s DAX and the U.K.&#8217;s FTSE
100 both lost 0.3 percent, while France&#8217;s CAC 40 slipped 0.4
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek Stocks Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s ASE Index sank 2.6 percent as talks on the
country&#8217;s debt crisis involving the European Central Bank,
European Commission and International Monetary Fund were delayed
after ash closed airspace across most of northern Europe.
Credit-default swaps on Greece&#8217;s government bonds rose 34 basis
points to a record 472, according to CMA DataVision prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EFG Eurobank Ergasias SA slumped 4 percent to 6.05 euros
and Alpha Bank SA retreated 1.7 percent to 6.24 euros. Greece&#8217;s
second- and third-largest lenders were downgraded by Nomura
Holdings Inc. because of liquidity concerns amid the country&#8217;s
economic crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air France, Europe&#8217;s largest airline, plummeted 2.9 percent
to 12.08 euros, while Deutsche Lufthansa AG retreated 2.6
percent to 12.40 euros. Ryanair Holdings Plc, the region&#8217;s
biggest budget carrier, slid 3.1 percent to 3.77 euros.
Ferrovial SA, the owner of U.K. airport operator BAA Ltd.,
dropped 4.2 percent to 7.38 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 81,000 services have been canceled since the volcano
erupted on April 14, spewing dust that could cause jet engines
to fail by melting and then congealing in the turbines. The
closure of European airspace may cost the airline industry $2
billion, the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eurotunnel Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupe Eurotunnel SA, which operates the undersea rail link
between England and France, rallied 3.5 percent to 7.74 euros,
the most since January, as the lack of flights boosted demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Philips Electronics NV surged 3.3 percent to 24.90
euros. The world&#8217;s biggest lighting company posted a first-
quarter net income of 200 million euros ($270 million) compared
with a loss of 59 million euros year earlier, helped by cost
cuts and growing demand in emerging markets. That beat the
average analyst estimate of 102.4 million euros, according to a
Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The results season has kicked off very well,&#8221; said Royal
London&#8217;s Lilley. &#8220;Results have pretty much been positive and
we&#8217;ve also had a continuation of economic numbers that are
steadily improving.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per-share earnings have topped analysts&#8217; estimates for 92
percent of the 26 companies in the U.S. Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index to have reported quarterly results since April 12,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriva Plc advanced 3.3 percent to 760.5 pence. The U.K.
transport operator confirmed it is in advanced talks with
Deutsche Bahn AG, Germany&#8217;s state railway, about the terms of a
possible cash offer that would give its holders 775 pence a
share and dividend entitlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc gained 4.4 percent to 50.4
pence, the biggest increase in the Stoxx 600. The bank is
weighing whether to sue Goldman Sachs for an $800 million loss
tied to a structured debt product, the Financial Times reported,
without citing anyone for the information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Swiss stocks fell, led by financial
shares, as the U.K. and Germany signaled probes into Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG, the country&#8217;s biggest bank, slid 2 percent. Nestle
SA dragged the benchmark Swiss Market Index lower as the shares
traded without the right to a dividend. Flughafen Zuerich AG and
Kuoni Reisen Holding AG fell more than 1 percent as parts of
Europe&#8217;s airspace remained closed for a fifth day following a
volcanic eruption in Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss Market Index of the largest and most actively
traded companies fell 90.01, or 1.3 percent, to 6,803.68. The
gauge has still rallied 3.9 percent this year as central banks
maintained record low interest rates and the European Union
agreed a contingency rescue plan to help prevent Greece from
defaulting on its debt. The broader Swiss Performance Index
declined 0.7 percent to 6,023.48 today. &lt;/p&gt;

Securities and Exchange Commission suit announced on April 16.
The SEC sued Goldman for misstating and omitting facts about a
collateralized debt obligation. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator,
Bafin, asked the SEC for details, a spokesman for Chancellor
Angela Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Credit Suisse &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank by client assets, declined
2 percent to 17.57 Swiss francs. The SEC is investigating
transactions by Deutsche Bank AG, UBS and the former Merrill
Lynch in the mortgage-securities market, the New York Post
reported, without saying where it got the information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse, the second-largest Swiss lender, dropped 0.5
percent to 55.05 francs. Julius Baer Group Ltd., a 120-year-old
private bank, retreated 0.7 percent to 36.87 francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nestle declined 3.4 percent to 51.25 francs. The world&#8217;s
largest food company traded without the right to a dividend of
1.6 francs a share. Adjusted for the dividend, the shares lost
0.4 percent. The company accounts for more than 22 percent of
the SMI by weighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flughafen Zuerich fell 1.5 percent to 360 francs. Flights
at Switzerland&#8217;s busiest airport have been canceled since April
17 because of safety concerns over the cloud of ash from a
volcano in Iceland. The Swiss aviation agency extended the
partial closure of its airspace until 8 a.m. tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuoni, Gategroup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kuoni fell 4.9 percent to 393 francs. The largest Swiss
travel company offered full refunds to holidaymakers with
departures scheduled for April 17 and 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gategroup Holding AG, the company specializing in catering
and hospitality services for airlines, slid 3 percent to 37.15
francs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobel Biocare Holding AG declined 2 percent to 30.92
francs. The world&#8217;s biggest maker of dental implants was cut to
&#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at Jefferies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burkhalter Holding AG gained 5.1 percent to 145.1 francs.
Switzerland&#8217;s biggest electrical installations company&#8217;s full-
year earnings before interest and taxes rose to 21.3 million
francs ($20 million) from 20.5 million francs the year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. and German financial
regulators are investigating whether they can take action
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in relation to a lawsuit filed
last week by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority is investigating &#8220;whether
there are any implications for the U.K.-regulated entities of
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Leigh Calder, an FSA spokesman, said in an
interview. &#8220;If there are, we will take appropriate action. We
work closely with overseas regulators and will cooperate fully
with the SEC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA&#8217;s preliminary investigation follows comments from
Prime Minister Gordon Brown today that the regulator would probe
the bank because there were &#8220;individuals that had questions to
answer.&#8221; He repeated that employees of the bank exhibited
&#8220;moral bankruptcy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed a suit against the New York-based bank on
April 16, citing fraud and misrepresentation in the marketing of
a collateralized debt obligation linked to subprime mortgages.
Goldman Sachs fell 13 percent that day and the shares fell 1.5
percent to $159.16 at 11:21 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange
trading today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleges that in early 2007, as U.S. home prices
were falling, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO without
disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against the vehicle, known as
Abacus 2007-AC1. The hedge fund wasn&#8217;t named in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs pledged it would fight the case and denies
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent Discovery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s BaFin will request information from the SEC and
review the facts before deciding on what steps to take, the
regulator&#8217;s spokeswoman Sabine Reimer said in an interview
today. The German securities regulator only learned about the
suit when the SEC disclosed it on April 16, Reimer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA will need to show that either individuals or
companies based in the U.K. were involved in wrongdoing to take
action, lawyers said. The regulator can ban individuals or fine
companies, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC named Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice
president, in the suit. While Tourre works in the bank&#8217;s London
office, he moved to London in November 2008, FSA records show.
The SEC is examining conduct before that date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we&#8217;re talking about is a possible conflict of
interest. That&#8217;s what it boils down to,&#8221; said Ben Blackett-Ord,
the chief executive officer or London-based Bovill Ltd., which
advises companies on regulation. &#8220;The FSA would be looking at
whether the firm has appropriate procedures in place to prevent
conflicts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False and Misleading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA can also criminally prosecute individuals for
making false and misleading statements, which carries a maximum
penalty of seven years in jail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the FSA could show that Goldman Sachs had made a
misleading statement about an investment and it took place in
the U.K., then the FSA could be the prosecuting authority,&#8221;
said Simon Morris, a regulatory lawyer at London-based CMS
Cameron McKenna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another U.K. prosecutor, the Serious Fraud Office, hasn&#8217;t
opened a formal investigation into the case. It typically
prosecutes complex and cross-border frauds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We routinely monitor situations of reported concern to
see if the circumstances might warrant a more formal SFO
involvement,&#8221; David Jones, an SFO spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB, RBS Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German and British banks both lost money because of the
fraud, according to the SEC suit. The Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc unwound a position in Abacus bought by its ABN Amro
unit by paying Goldman $840.9 million, the SEC said. Germany&#8217;s
IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost nearly all of its $150
million investment in Abacus, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS, which is majority-owned by the U.K., may consider
taking legal action against Goldman Sachs, Brown said in a
Bloomberg Television interview today. RBS declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The FSA is very prudent about using its powers and it
isn&#8217;t very likely to be bounced into this by the prime minister
seeking to score political points,&#8221; said CMS&#8217;s Morris. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t prosecute cases that it isn&#8217;t reasonably certain it can
win.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA was created by Brown in 1997. He now faces an
election on May 6. Opposition Conservatives say they will carve
up the FSA&#8217;s powers if they are successful in ousting Brown&#8217;s
Labour government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB is examining all options including legal action,
Patrick von der Ehe, a spokesman for the Dusseldorf-based bank,
said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Bafin can investigate and issue fines in some cases,
it can&#8217;t bring a criminal case without assistance from
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andreas Tilp, a German attorney who represents an IKB
shareholder in a case over the lender&#8217;s subprime losses, said
the bank should file its own civil suit against Goldman. The
U.S. would be the best jurisdiction to file a suit because IKB
could initiate a class action, or group, case, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IKB could just take the SEC&#8217;s complaint as a boiler plate
and file its own suit; it would be pretty simple,&#8221; he said.
Chancellor Angela Merkel should &#8220;use her political influence to
make IKB sue Goldman in the U.S. instead of setting her hopes on
some action by BaFin,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s securities regulator, the Autorite des Marches
Financiers, said it was examining whether any French investors
lost money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The investigations concerns foremost the United States,
and we have no evidence at this stage that would lead us to
think that this possibly fraudulent activity could have been
committed under French jurisdiction,&#8221; an AMF official said
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 31, joined Goldman Sachs in 2001 after receiving a
bachelor&#8217;s degree in mathematics from the Ecole Centrale Paris,
one of France&#8217;s top engineering schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rand slumped to a three-week
low, posting the worst performance among emerging-market
currencies, as widening probes into Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
prompted investors to sell higher-risk assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s currency declined for a third straight day,
losing as much as 1.4 percent to 7.4896, the weakest level since
March 26. The rand traded 1.2 percent down at 7.4777 by 5:40
p.m. in Johannesburg, from a close of 7.3900 on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for an
inquiry into Goldman&#8217;s activities saying he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at
the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in a suit filed against the
investment bank by the Securities and Exchange Commission on
April 16. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator has asked the SEC for
details on the suit, according to a spokesman for Chancellor
Angela Merkel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a big bout of risk aversion caused by the Goldman
investigations that&#8217;s affecting all high-risk assets, from
commodities to the rand, to equities,&#8221; said John Cairns, head
of foreign-exchange research at Rand Merchant Bank in
Johannesburg. &#8220;Investors have taken fright by the allegations
against Goldman because it shows there are still some skeletons
in the closet from the financial crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s claim against Goldman Sachs centers on
allegations that it created and sold a collateralized debt
obligation linked to subprime mortgages without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the vehicle. The European Union is also probing
Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for Greece that may have
helped mask the country&#8217;s budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government bonds fell in South Africa, raising the yield on
the benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 by less
than 1 basis point to 7.78 percent. The bond&#8217;s price fell 7
cents to 124.77 rand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s currency was also the worst performer among
the world&#8217;s 16 most-actively traded currencies monitored by
Bloomberg. The rand lost 0.9 percent against the euro to
10.0681. &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington, Kate Haywood and John Detrixhe" date="Apr 19, 2010 11:10 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-19/goldman-sachs-credit-swaps-rise-a-second-day-after-fraud-related-sec-suit.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Leads Jump in Prices to Insure Against Defaults on Bank Debt</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect against losses
on bank bonds jumped for the second day amid speculation that
U.S. fraud charges against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may trigger
similar probes or lawsuits and embolden lawmakers&#8217; efforts to
crack down on financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman reached the highest in two
months as U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for
the Financial Services Authority to follow the U.S. Securities
Exchange Commission and start a probe, and German Chancellor
Angela Merkel said her nation&#8217;s financial regulator asked the
SEC for details on its Goldman suit. Swaps on banks including
Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG jumped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If these charges are damning enough to actually cause
some instability in the markets, nobody really believes Goldman
is the only one that might be guilty here,&#8221; said Brian
Yelvington, head of fixed-income strategy at broker-dealer
Knight Libertas LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC last week said New York-based Goldman sold
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing that a hedge fund that was betting against
the debt had helped select underlying securities. Goldman said
in a statement last week that the charges are &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; CDOs pool bonds, loans and other fixed-income
assets into securities of varying risk and return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps protecting Goldman debt for five years jumped
7 basis points to 134 basis points after earlier trading as high
as 140 basis points, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group.
It&#8217;s the biggest two-day increase in a year, CMA DataVision
prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Citigroup jumped 16 basis points to 138,
Deutsche Bank rose 4.5 to 98, Morgan Stanley climbed 17 to 153
and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit rose 18 to 159,
CMA prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fear is that this will make regulations even tighter,
increase the potential for fines and other judgments and push
down bank profits in the near term,&#8221; said Jeffrey Burch, co-
head of global credit at Investec Asset Management in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk climbed
to the highest in four weeks. Credit-default swaps on the Markit
CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, jumped 1.8 basis point to a mid-price of 89.13
basis points as of 11:03 a.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislative Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 investment-grade
companies rose 3 basis points to 82.9, Markit prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs suit may embolden lawmakers who want to
hold Wall Street firms accountable for the financial crisis that
sparked the worst recession since the Great Depression, said
John Anderson, head of credit at Gartmore Investment Management
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Blanche Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, released a
bill last week that would limit derivatives trading by
commercial banks, barring dealers in swaps from taking advantage
of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount lending window, emergency
liquidity functions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&#8217;s
insurance and guarantee functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Red Meat&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama said in his weekly address on radio
and the Internet that his plan to overhaul U.S. financial
regulation is the only way to prevent the &#8220;turmoil that ripped
through our economy over the past two years.&#8221;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The perception was that banks were returning to
profitability and that everything in the garden was rosy,&#8221;
Anderson said. &#8220;But Obama has set his sights on the banking
community, and the regulators want some red meat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s 5.375 percent bonds due in 2020 are the most-
traded U.S. corporate notes today, falling 1.03 cents on the
dollar to 98.56 cents to yield 178 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries as of 10:51 a.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup said first-quarter profit more than doubled,
beating analysts&#8217; estimates as the global economic rebound
trimmed costs for bad loans and boosted revenue from consumer
banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s 6.01 percent bonds due in 2015 fell 0.3 cent on
the dollar to 106 cents, a spread of 209.2 basis points, Trace
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 5.5 percent notes due in 2020 declined 1.4
cent to 97.42 cents, a spread of 206.9 basis points, Trace data
show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hog futures fell from a 13-year
high and cattle declined as investors sold risky assets
including commodities after U.S. regulators sued Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. and German regulators also are investigating whether
they can take action against Goldman, one of Wall Street&#8217;s
biggest traders and brokers of commodities. The U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission filed a suit last week, alleging fraud
tied to collateralized-debt obligations. The Reuters/Jefferies
CRB Index of 19 commodities dropped as much as 1 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All these markets could suffer the fallout of risk-
aversion trade,&#8221; said Don Roose, the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in West Des Moines, Iowa. Hog futures are more
than 8 cents more expensive than the spot market, increasing
risk, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.35 cent, or 0.4
percent, to 85.8 cents a pound at 9:47 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. On April 16, the most-active contract
reached 86.85 cents, matching the highest price since May 1996.
Before today, futures climbed 18 percent in the past year as
U.S. pork supplies shrank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cattle futures for June delivery dropped 0.3 cent, or 0.3
percent, to 94.35 cents a pound. Feeder-cattle futures for
August settlement fell 0.075 cent to $1.152 a pound. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The case against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may turn on the meaning of the word &#8220;selected.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission must prove that the
most profitable company in Wall Street history defrauded
investors by failing to disclose that a hedge-fund firm betting
against them played a role in creating what they bought. It must
also counter Goldman Sachs&#8217;s assertion that an independent asset
manager, which the SEC said rejected more than half of the
securities initially proposed by Paulson  Co. for a
collateralized debt obligation, signed off on the selections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is whether Paulson&#8217;s undisclosed role in
portfolio selection was material,&#8221; said Larry Ribstein, a law
professor at the University of Illinois in Champaign who has
written about 140 articles and 10 books on topics including
securities law and professional ethics. &#8220;There&#8217;s no clear and
well-defined definition of what you have to disclose in this
type of transaction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC case signals the regulator could eventually target
other banks over how much they told investors about at least $40
billion of CDOs that turned toxic as mortgage defaults soared to
the highest level since the 1930s. Robert Khuzami, the SEC
enforcement chief, said last week that the agency will
aggressively pursue deals &#8220;that share similar profiles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, Citigroup Inc.
and UBS AG are among banks that underwrote CDOs involving two
other hedge-fund firms that could have profited as homeowners
stopped paying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, WaMu &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO market is separate from the $2 trillion of
mortgage-backed securities created from 2005 through 2007 out of
risky subprime and Alt-A loans, and then often packaged into
CDOs, including the more than $200 billion issued in 2007. The
SEC hasn&#8217;t announced any suits over MBS disclosures by
underwriters or issuers. This month, former Citigroup and
Washington Mutual Inc. officials told government panels that
their companies knew that their vetting of home loans they sold
off was shoddy before the market crashed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clayton Holdings LLC, the largest provider of due diligence
on mortgages that Wall Street banks bought to package into
securities, has provided information to the SEC and state
attorneys general in addition to New York&#8217;s Andrew Cuomo, who
collected reports from it in 2007, Marc Rothenberg, a lawyer for
the company in New York at Blank Rome LLP, said in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Full Investigation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let&#8217;s see a full investigation of all the banks that made
material misstatements and omissions in mortgage-securities
issues during the lead-up to the crisis, because many of them
did,&#8221; said Josh Rosner, managing director of New York-based
advisory firm Graham Fisher  Co. &#8220;Hopefully this is the
beginning of the SEC looking at dealer practices of putting
their own returns ahead of their customers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, which filed its complaint against New York-based
Goldman Sachs on April 16, is seeking to prove only that the
CDO&#8217;s investors, including IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and ABN
Amro Bank NV, may have reasonably wanted more information than
they got about Paulson&#8217;s involvement, said John Coffee, a
securities law professor at Columbia University in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Materially Misleading&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tactic reduces the case to whether there was &#8220;a false
statement or a material omission that made statements materially
misleading,&#8221; Coffee said. &#8220;That frees the SEC of the need to
prove there was intent to defraud, which changes the balance
considerably in favor of the SEC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, headed by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein, said in a statement on April 16 that the SEC
allegations were &#8220;unfounded&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a marketing document for the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-
AC1, Goldman Sachs said it might have access to &#8220;non-publicly
available information&#8221; about the collateral and, because of
that, &#8220;this presentation may not contain all information that
would be material to the evaluation of the merits and risks of
purchasing the notes.&#8221; The flip book prepared for potential
investors said the CDO would be linked to securities
&#8220;selected&#8221; by asset manager ACA Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s Subprime Bets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson, the hedge-fund firm managed by
John Paulson, 54, which became the world&#8217;s third-largest after
betting against subprime mortgages and reaping about $1 billion
on the Abacus deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC complaint said that ACA rejected 68 of 123
positions Paulson initially suggested. After a back-and-forth
between the asset manager and the hedge fund intermediated by
Goldman Sachs resulted in ACA and Paulson agreeing on 90
securities, one ACA employee said in an e-mail to another that
the portfolio &#8220;looks good to me,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs wasn&#8217;t necessarily required to describe the
selection process to sophisticated buyers of the CDO, said James
Cox, a securities law professor at Duke University in Durham,
North Carolina. Instead, he said, the bank may have crossed the
line by telling investors half-truths -- touting the role of
ACA, while omitting Paulson&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you&#8217;re creating a dangerous product, you can&#8217;t
insulate yourself by bringing in an innocent party that dilutes
the danger of that product, if you know it&#8217;s still dangerous,&#8221;
Cox said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Notorious Bear&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key to the SEC&#8217;s case will be to prove that investors
may have balked if they knew that &#8220;a notorious bear&#8221; was on
the other side of the trade and had a hand in designing the
product, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. The SEC will need to show that the deal was designed
to lose and that Goldman Sachs knowingly withheld information
because it knew investors wouldn&#8217;t like it, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Once you start pulling on this thread, there&#8217;s
potentially a lot of other people who might have done similar
things,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, who worked in the CDO groups for
two bond insurers and is now a partner at New York-based Paykin
Krieg  Adams LLP. &#8220;These practices were relatively
widespread.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than half a dozen of the world&#8217;s biggest banks
underwrote CDOs involving hedge-fund firms with bets against
mortgage bonds, including Citigroup, UBS, Bank of America,
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s Wachovia Corp. unit,
Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Agricole SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The hedge funds, Evanston, Illinois-based
Magnetar Capital LLC and Tricadia Capital Management LLC in New
York, were involved in at least $42 billion of CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar helped create more than 20 mortgage-bond CDOs
named after constellations by agreeing to buy the riskiest
slices and paired the purchases with larger bets that pieces of
those and other CDOs would fail. That reflected a view that if
any low-rated subprime mortgage bonds defaulted, most would. The
CDOs totaled at least $32 billion, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many CDO managers &#8220;played along with&#8221; the interests of
hedge funds when constructing their deals, said Jon Pickhardt,
an attorney with Quinn Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges in New
York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His firm, which is representing Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank in a suit against Merrill Lynch over a Magnetar CDO,
said in an April 16 letter to the judge in that case that
documents filed confidentially to the court show collateral
manager NIR Capital Management LLC let Magnetar select assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other plaintiffs in CDO suits have included MT Bank Corp.
and bond insurer MBIA Inc. Investors including the Plumbers&#8217;
Union Local No. 12 Pension Fund, City of Ann Arbor Employees&#8217;
Retirement System and the Federal Home Loan Banks of Pittsburgh,
Seattle and San Francisco have sued banks including Bank of
America, JPMorgan, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG and
Nomura Holdings Inc. over disclosures on mortgage-backed
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Insisting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar sometimes told CDO managers and banks that it
wanted to bet against certain securities, said a person close to
the company. The firm stopped short of insisting that the
credit-default swaps used to make those bets be included in its
CDOs, and they didn&#8217;t make up the majority of a CDO&#8217;s holdings,
the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Magnetar avoided ordering managers to buy specific
securities, it often pushed them to select ones with higher
yields, according to a person who participated in some of the
transactions and declined to be identified because the deals
were private. The firm told banks and asset managers what its
strategy was, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar, in an e-mailed statement, said it didn&#8217;t select
the assets going into its CDOs, that it didn&#8217;t have a particular
view on the housing market and that both underwriters and
collateral managers understood its strategy of betting against
&#8220;particular tranches.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricadia told investors in prospectuses for the almost $10
billion of CDOs for which it served as asset manager that it
might or would bet against the collateral it selected. In April
2007, the firm took it one step further by disclosing in a 399-
page prospectus that it took the opposite side of trades that
the CDO entered into through UBS, the underwriter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;General statements with respect to the possibility of
conflicts of interest are not going to inoculate banks or asset
managers or hedge funds,&#8221; said Pickhardt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tricadia, which also said it would buy some of the CDOs&#8217;
most junior slices, was created in April 2003 as an affiliate of
Marnier Investment Group, a hedge-fund firm whose management
included Lee Sachs, now a counselor to Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner. Tricadia co-founder Michael Barnes didn&#8217;t
respond to messages seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO at the center of the SEC case is one of at least 23
Abacus deals created by Goldman Sachs, and one of the only ones
for which the firm hired an outside asset manager, according to
prospectuses. The others were managed by Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic CDOs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs are investment vehicles that repackage pools of assets
such as home-loan bonds, buyout loans and bank capital notes
into a series of new securities with varying risks. The vehicles
come in three varieties: synthetic, meaning filled with credit-
default swaps instead of actual securities; cash, which are
filled with actual bonds; and hybrids, with a mix of both of
debt and default swaps, which are derivatives that offer
payments if the securities they reference don&#8217;t perform as
expected, in return for regular premiums. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abacus deals were synthetic CDOs tied to mostly
subprime home loans and commercial mortgages. UBS, in a series
called North Street from at least 2000 through at least 2005,
and Deutsche Bank, through its Start program in at least 2005
and 2006, also issued synthetic CDOs tied to mortgages,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aquarius 2006-1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs brought in an outside firm to manage the
assets in Abacus 2007-AC1 to reassure investors about the
portfolio&#8217;s quality as the market began to show signs of
distress, according to the SEC complaint. One buyer, Dusseldorf,
Germany-based IKB, was no longer purchasing CDOs without
independent managers, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO and other late 2006 and 2007 Abacus transactions
were also unusual because other banks had stopped doing
synthetic CDOs, since hybrid CDOs could be used to off-load risk
in the same ways, according to the people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid mortgage-bond CDOs boomed as banks sought to balance
the bets against home-loan securities they were selling to hedge
funds such as Paulson, Hayman Advisors LP in Dallas and Lahde
Capital Management LLC in Santa Monica, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One hybrid CDO was ACA Aquarius 2006-1 Ltd., a $2 billion
deal created in September 2006 with ACA as the manager. It was
part of the series of CDOs involving Magnetar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Further to Fall&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC suit says that Goldman Sachs misled ACA into
believing that Paulson planned to buy the CDO&#8217;s lowest-ranked
slices, while in fact the bank knew that the fund planned bets
against more senior pieces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s interesting that ACA knew Paulson was involved in
the selection process and wasn&#8217;t sued for aiding and abetting,&#8221;
Ribstein, the Illinois law professor said. &#8220;It seems to have
been common knowledge that Paulson was betting against the
market through credit-default swaps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early March 2007, Paulson said in an investor letter
that subprime-mortgage defaults would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that,
&#8220;while the bonds have fallen significantly, we think they have
much further to fall,&#8221; according to a March 15, 2007, Bloomberg
News story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACA completed the portfolio on Feb. 26, 2007, the SEC said.
The deal closed on April 26, 2007, according to the complaint,
which didn&#8217;t say whether ACA, which sold protection against the
default of part of the CDO through a sister bond insurance unit
that was the first debt guarantor to collapse, had any ability
to change the make-up in March or April of that year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ACA as collateral manager had sole authority over the
selection of all collateral in the CDO,&#8221; Paulson said in a
statement on April 16, adding that the securities were rated AAA
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Response &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a statement the securities were
&#8220;selected by an independent and experienced portfolio selection
agent after a series of discussions, including with Paulson 
Co., which were entirely typical of these types of
transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers of deals involving default swaps are foolish if they
don&#8217;t realize someone had picked securities to bet against them,
said David Castillo, a senior managing director at San
Francisco-based broker Further Lane Securities, a trader of
structured securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a synthetic transaction involving any asset, the
participants know upfront that there is someone who believes the
opposite side of the trade,&#8221; Castillo said. &#8220;It&#8217;s unreasonable
to participate in this type of transaction and expect any other
scenario.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Swaps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, what Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t tell investors included
the fact that Paulson was betting against the Abacus CDO&#8217;s
senior pieces, the SEC said, meaning the firm only stood to
profit if many of the securities it helped pick went bad and not
just a few.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, the regular sales of synthetic and hybrid CDO
notes to other CDOs and into $400 billion market for structured
investment vehicles, or SIVs, such as Axon Financial Funding
Ltd. that funded themselves with commercial paper means that not
all debt buyers were aware they were taking the opposite side of
some investor&#8217;s bets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The involvement of default swaps in the Goldman Sachs case
may make it harder for the SEC to win, said Todd Henderson, a
law professor at the University of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Facial Fishiness&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One possible defense for Goldman is that the disclosure
would have been irrelevant because everybody knew,&#8221; said
Henderson. &#8220;They could argue that these weren&#8217;t widows and
orphans investing in these products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in its statement that IKB and ACA
Capital Management, two investors in Abacus 2007-AC1 identified
in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk associated with the
securities and were &#8220;among the most sophisticated mortgage
investors in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB lost about $150 million and Edinburgh-based Royal Bank
of Scotland Plc paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position after taking over ABN Amro, according to the SEC. The
insurance provided by ACA to ABN Amro was worth little after the
insurer collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Materiality is a lot like a continuum,&#8221; said Jacob
Frenkel, a former SEC lawyer now in private practice at Shulman
Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker in Potomac, Maryland. &#8220;The amount
of information that needs to be disclosed to institutional
investors at the highest level, where they&#8217;re doing their own
research and analysis, is less. Their criteria for the
investment decisions tend to be far more sophisticated than the
individual investor&#8217;s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even on that continuum, Goldman Sachs has a lot of
explaining to do, said Ribstein, the University of Illinois law
professor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It looks like the SEC is hoping that the facial fishiness
of the transaction is going to be enough here to sink Goldman
Sachs&#8221; in this case, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s fraud suit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may
trigger additional probes of collateralized debt obligations and
lead to stricter regulation, analysts and academics said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
bank created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages without
disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick
the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle. Investors
including Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Germany&#8217;s IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG lost about $1 billion from the trade.
Goldman Sachs denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; said
Chizu Nakajima, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation
and Crime at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;As far as other
financial institutions are concerned, they are obviously very
worried. If the SEC&#8217;s action is actually successful, it could
well open up the gates to other litigation worldwide.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for
the Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry. Regulators
may probe other CDOs that lost money for investors and could
probe other investment banks involved in the business, Raul
Sinha, a London-based analyst at Nomura Holdings Inc., wrote in
a report published today. The suit may also strengthen political
pressure for more regulation of derivatives and similar complex
financial structures, threatening earnings, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown
said he has &#8220;no doubt&#8221; Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, the
U.K&#8217;s biggest government-controlled lender, may sue Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. after losing $841 million from a collateralized
debt obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The question is whether RBS has an action they could take
against Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Brown said in a Bloomberg television
interview today. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got no doubt that RBS would be
investigating that at the moment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging
that the bank created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson  Co.
helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle. Investors including RBS and Germany&#8217;s IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG lost about $1 billion from the trade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown, who faces a national election on May 6, called
yesterday for the U.K. Financial Services Authority to start a
probe, saying he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221;
indicated in the Securities and Exchange Commission suit against
Goldman Sachs. U.K. and German financial regulators said today
they will examine whether they can take action against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. in relation to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS paid $841 million to Goldman Sachs to unwind its
position in Abacus, which it inherited when it bought parts of
ABN Amro in 2007, according to the SEC. The Edinburgh-based
lender is 84 percent-owned by the British government after
receiving a 45.5 billion-pound ($70 billion) taxpayer rescue,
the world&#8217;s biggest banking bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has denied wrongdoing. A spokeswoman for the
bank in London declined to comment today. Michael Strachan, an
RBS spokesman, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB Weighs Options &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB said today the bank is examining all options, including
legal action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are keeping all options open,&#8221; company spokesman
Patrick von der Ehe said by telephone today. The lender has
received the lawsuit and is examining it &#8220;closely,&#8221; it said in
an e-mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA &#8220;is investigating the circumstances of this case
and whether there are any implications for the U.K.-regulated
entities of Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Leigh Calder, an FSA spokesman,
said in an interview. &#8220;If there are, we will take appropriate
action. We work closely with overseas regulators and will
cooperate fully with the SEC investigation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BaFin, Germany&#8217;s financial-services regulator, will request
information from the SEC and then review the facts before
deciding on what steps to take, spokeswoman Sabine Reimer said
in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks drifted between gains
and losses as better-than-estimated results at Citigroup Inc.
overshadowed concern that widening calls for probes of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. will hurt bank earnings.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup jumped 4.8 percent after profit more than doubled
as costs for bad loans decreased. Goldman Sachs lost 1.7 percent
as Germany and the U.K. signalled probes of the most profitable
firm in Wall Street history after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the company for fraud.        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index slipped less than 0.1 
percent  to 1,191.67 at 9:38 a.m. in New York after tumbling 
1.6 percent on April 16, its biggest drop in more than two
months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 7.26 points, or 
0.1 percent, to 11,025.92. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corn, soybeans and wheat fell in
Chicago as investors shied away from risky assets after U.S.
regulators sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for alleged fraud and
as a stronger dollar made U.S. crops less attractive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn for July delivery dropped 1.7 percent to $3.6775 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade at 2:14 a.m. Paris time.
Soybeans for July delivery slid 0.8 percent to $9.875 a bushel
after six advances in a row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The grains and oilseed market cannot be free from the
Goldman Sachs case,&#8221; said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, general manager of
research at Tokyo-based IDO Securities Co. &#8220;The case will damp
investment sentiment in most financial products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs misled investors about a financial product
tied to subprime mortgages, leading to more than $1 billion in
losses, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on
April 16 in a statement describing its civil case. Goldman Sachs
called the SEC&#8217;s claims &#8220;unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Dollar Index, a six-currency gauge of the
greenback&#8217;s strength, rose for a third day, advancing as much as
0.6 percent. Gains by the dollar make U.S. crops less attractive
for importers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The strong dollar is weighing heavily upon export
trade,&#8221; economist Dennis Gartman said in his daily newsletter.
&#8220;Exports must increase rather materially if the corn market is
to sustain even modest strength. The dollar&#8217;s strength since
Friday shall make that all the more difficult.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn Advances &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corn rose 4.7 percent last week on speculation cooling
Pacific Ocean waters will boost the odds of a drought in the
U.S. Midwest, reducing yields. Soybeans climbed 4.5 percent for
the week, the biggest weekly increase for the oilseed since
November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheat for July delivery fell 0.7 percent to $4.9925 a
bushel, rebounding from a drop of as much as 1.6 percent. The
grain rose 4.9 percent last week, the third straight increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe in
Paris fell 0.4 percent to 129 euros ($173.33) a metric ton,
while the November contract fell by the same percentage to 136
euros a ton. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just how out-of-touch can Lloyd Blankfein be? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief executive officer
vigorously denied the Securities and Exchange Commission fraud
suit filed Friday against his firm, calling the complaint
&#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; The company promised
to &#8220;defend the firm and its reputation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But head-in-the-sand denials will no longer work. If
Blankfein wants to save what is left of Goldman&#8217;s reputation,
and possibly his job, he should admit that the deal described in
the SEC complaint was wrong. Then, he should draw a very firm
line so that Goldman doesn&#8217;t deceive its customers again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As only someone from Mars doesn&#8217;t know by now, Goldman
allegedly sold collateralized debt obligations, or bonds backed
by mortgage securities, to institutional investors without
disclosing that the specific securities were handpicked by
hedge-fund manager John Paulson. Paulson was betting on the
securities to fall and, for that reason, structured the
securities to include losers -- not winners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, he ordered that no bonds backed by Wells
Fargo  Co. mortgages be included in the pool because Wells
Fargo was one of the few mortgage lenders that stuck to sound
lending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman says it had no idea whether the mortgage securities
would go up or down. Maybe. But the SEC complaint quotes a
Goldman employee, also named as a defendant, gleefully
chortling, &#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime
now.&#8221; By the time the deal closed, in April 2007, the subprime
market was already in trouble. Defaults were skyrocketing. And
by the following January, no fewer than 99 percent of the
mortgages in the CDO had been downgraded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Paulson Portfolio&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman says it lost $90 million on the deal. If true, that
might be its strongest defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Goldman&#8217;s investment forecast matters less than
its allegedly faulty disclosure. Internally, it referred to the
bonds at issue as &#8220;the Paulson portfolio.&#8221; But outside
investors weren&#8217;t told that this much-respected -- and much-
feared -- short-seller had selected the bonds, or even that he
was involved. Instead, Goldman recruited a neutral third party
to bless the deal, and investors were told that this party, ACA
Management LLC, had selected the mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might be that every fact in the SEC complaint is untrue,
in which case Blankfein is right to defend and I am dead wrong.
But the complaint is rich in detail, and builds on a book,
Gregory Zuckerman&#8217;s &#8220;The Greatest Trade Ever,&#8221; and on
exclusive reporting in the New York Times that laid out a
similar story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking Ugly &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the SEC&#8217;s facts are true, the case is ugly for Goldman.
In capsule form: At Paulson&#8217;s urging, Goldman structured a
security so Paulson could short the mortgage market. Goldman
found patsies to take the other side, and Paulson paid the firm
a $15 million fee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s behavior reminds me of NBC television, which in
1992 aired a video of a pickup truck explosion that turned out
to have been staged. After a lawsuit by General Motors Co., NBC
apologized on air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the present case, Goldman staged a CDO to explode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example: in 1991, a Salomon Brothers trader lied to
the government. Though no investor fraud was involved, the CEO,
John Gutfreund, was forced to resign merely because he had
waited a few months before reporting the incident. The new
interim CEO, Warren Buffett, publicly apologized. He insisted
then that in the future Salomon Brothers would be &#8220;way, way
away from the line.&#8221; He wanted it to steer clear of any
behavior that was even remotely questionable, much less illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Word From Buffett &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should Goldman aspire to any less? The same Buffett&#8217;s
Berkshire Hathaway is an investor in Goldman. It would be nice
to hear Buffett endorse his principles with respect to Goldman
now. (Disclosure: I am an investor in Berkshire.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, Blankfein should deliver a public apology.
Stonewalling, dissembling or parsing the facts won&#8217;t restore
Goldman&#8217;s name. Goldman may also have to settle with investors
who lost money on this and any similar deals. It will cost
Goldman money but it will be worth it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Goldman needs to look in the mirror and ask how a
firm long known for its stellar reputation and ethics could have
gone so wrong. My own theory is that three steps in the firm&#8217;s
evolution eroded the class that Goldman once stood for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going Public &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, when the firm was sold, ending its days as a
partnership, in 1999, managers gradually began to think of
Goldman as a public stock rather than their private firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Goldman became more of a trader, less an investment
banker. Bankers think long-term, traders short-term. Last year,
76 percent of its revenue was from trading and for investing for
its own account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the shift toward trading was duplicated in
Goldman&#8217;s upper management, which formerly was divided between
both camps. Since Blankfein took over in 2006, traders have
dominated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, of course, will say it still cares about
reputation. Tell that to IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG. In 2006,
the German bank specifically told Goldman it was no longer
comfortable investing in CDOs that didn&#8217;t &#8220;utilize a collateral
manager, meaning an independent third-party,&#8221; according to the
SEC&#8217;s complaint. Goldman told IKB it had such a manager -- ACA.
It didn&#8217;t mention Paulson. IKB lost almost all of its $150
million investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s exploded CDO already may have changed the future
of Wall Street. The case seems certain to speed financial
overhaul legislation through Congress. The question is whether
that CDO will change -- or threaten -- the future of Goldman as
well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s real fell for a third
straight day, its longest losing streak in two months, as a
widening probe of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. spurred aversion to
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real weakened 0.4 percent to 1.7655 per dollar at 8:32
a.m. New York time, from 1.7582 on April 16. It&#8217;s the longest
losing streak since the three-day period ended Feb. 5. The
currency has dropped 1.2 percent in 2010. The MSCI Emerging
Market Index lost 2.2 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for an
investigation of Goldman Sachs after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s allegations of fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may see risk aversion for a while on Goldman,&#8221; said
Leonardo Kestelman, Brazil head at Dinosaur Securities Inc.
&#8220;People fear the European Union may take the same kind of
action the U.S. took against Goldman. That story may stretch,&#8221;
he said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the overnight interest-rate futures market, the yield on
the contract due January 2011 rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 10.72 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown
said he&#8217;s not considering blacklisting Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
&#8220;at the moment&#8221; after U.S. authorities sued the firm for
fraud, seeking instead to put the focus on individuals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would like to be clear that it was employees within the
bank,&#8221; Brown said in an interview today in London with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;What I have seen shows moral bankruptcy
on the part of employees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown&#8217;s comments suggest the impact on Goldman&#8217;s business
with European governments of the suit by the Securities and
Exchange Commission may be limited. A spokesman for the German
Finance Ministry, Jeanette Schwamberger, said the government in
Berlin would await an investigation by the financial regulator
before excluding New York-based Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown increased the pressure on the firm&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer, Lloyd Blankfein, by calling for a
&#8220;fuller statement from Goldman Sachs.&#8221; He went on to say the
bank should make it clear any fraud was committed by employees
without the knowledge of the institution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British prime minister called yesterday for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the suit.
The German regulator, Bafin, sought details on the suit from the
SEC, Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s spokesman said the previous day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs vowed to fight the SEC case, calling it
&#8220;unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; The stock fell 13 percent on
April 16. The shares rose 0.3 percent to $161.19 in European
trading today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps linked to
European banks surged on concerns that the U.S. fraud lawsuit
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will lead to similar probes in
Europe, crimping financial companies&#8217; profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on UBS AG jumped 12 basis points to 93, the
highest in more than a week, while swaps on Deutsche Bank AG,
Credit Suisse Group AG and Barclays Plc swaps also rose,
according to CMA DataVision. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index
of banks and insurers climbed 4.5 basis points to 100.75. An
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of credit quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs could face investigations in Europe after
U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for an inquiry following
the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud suit on April 16.
Bafin, Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, asked the SEC for details
of the case, igniting investor concerns that similar
investigations will spread to Europe&#8217;s banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fear is that this will make regulations even tighter,
increase the potential for fines and other judgements and push
down bank profits in the near term,&#8221; said Jeffrey Burch, co-
head of global credit at Investec Asset Management in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged that Goldman Sachs created and sold
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped select
the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle. CDOs pool
bonds, loans and other fixed-income assets into securities of
varying risk and return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank, Barclays &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps tied to Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse both
rose 6 basis points to 97 and 80 respectively, while contracts
on Barclays increased 4.5 basis points to 90, according to CMA
prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring against a default on corporate bonds
also rose, with the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125
investment-grade companies rising 2.5 basis points to 82.25,
according to Markit Group Ltd. The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index
of 50 mostly high-yield European companies jumped 9 basis points
to 422, Markit Group prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. A basis point on
a contract protecting 10 million euros ($13.4 million) of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s economy would be hurt by a
sustained disruption to air travel caused by last week&#8217;s
Icelandic volcanic eruption, said economists at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and IHS Global Insight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If this were to continue for a longer time, then it would
surely start to have a significant effect,&#8221; said Erik Nielsen,
chief European economist at Goldman in an e-mailed note. For
now, &#8220;if the disruption to air traffic is contained to a week
or less, then I think the total effect will be minimal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unprecedented closing of the region&#8217;s airspace led to
the cancellation of as many as 63,000 flights, stranding
tourists and business travelers and costing carriers $200
million a day, according to the International Air Transport
Association. The Icelandic meteorological office predicts little
change in the ash pattern in Europe at least through April 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund canceled a trip to Greece today to discuss the
country&#8217;s fiscal crisis, delaying the visit until April 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long-term disruptions would hinder the transport and
production of goods such as drugs and perishable foodstuffs,
said Nielsen. Howard Archer, chief European economist at IHS
Global Insight in London, estimates that transport disruptions
could spark a jump in the prices of some products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Extreme Situation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the extreme scenario&#8221; where planes are still grounded
at the end of June, &#8220;I suspect that we would see a very serious
knock to our second-quarter GDP forecast,&#8221; said Nielsen. He
currently projects growth of 0.8 percent, which would be the
fastest expansion since the first three months of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Obviously, the longer the problem goes on, the greater
the potential hit to the economy will be,&#8221; said Archer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas said
today he expects the first report &#8220;hopefully&#8221; next week on the
impact that the cloud of volcanic ash has caused to the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc in London, says that consumer confidence
could be hurt even though he doesn&#8217;t see any negative impact in
the medium term as workers return to their workplace and
companies use other means of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the moment, we&#8217;re still more in a strike situation
than in a 9/11 situation regarding confidence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The
main threats are linked to possible health concerns or the
bankruptcy of some airline, which could spark ripple effects.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limited Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volcanic ash can cause jet engines to fail by melting and
then congealing in the turbines. Volcanic eruptions may continue
for months and curtail European air traffic, said Sigrun
Hreinsdottir, a geophysicist at the University of Iceland in
Reykjavik. The last eruption of the 1,666-meter (5,466-foot)
Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull in December 1821 continued until January 1823. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, economists say that that the short-term impact on
the economy is limited. Nielsen estimates that air transport
accounts for no more than 0.1 percent of European GDP and &#8220;one
would assume that a lot of what&#8217;s been lost in the air will be
made up in coming weeks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ground transportation such as train companies and car
rental services are probably also benefiting from the
disruption, he said. Archer said that stranded commuters or
holidaymakers are likely to spend wherever they are and business
meetings can be conducted by teleconference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are also some positive counter-effects with hotels,
train operators and car rentals benefiting,&#8221; said Joerg
Kraemer, chief economist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think that the economy will suffer as a result.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The yen rose for a third day
against the euro as concern that probes into Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. will widen and Greece&#8217;s aid package may falter boosted
demand for Japan&#8217;s currency as a refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen strengthened versus all 16 of its main counterparts
after U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for an
investigation of Goldman Sachs following the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s allegations of fraud. The euro fell to a
one-week low against the dollar as International Monetary Fund
and European Union officials prepared to lay down conditions on
a bailout package for Greece. The pound slid the most in more
than three weeks as polls indicated the U.K. election won&#8217;t
produce a clear winner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s obviously a correction for the yen that&#8217;s been
triggered by Goldman Sachs being accused of fraud,&#8221; said Lee
Hardman, a currency strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ
Ltd. in London. &#8220;It has prompted a sell-off in risk assets
across the board and the yen strengthens on the back of that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen appreciated to 123.42 per euro as of 6:26 a.m. in
New York, from 124.44 last week, after reaching 123.16, the
strongest since March 26. Japan&#8217;s currency advanced to 91.92 per
dollar, from 92.17. The euro fell to $1.3435, from $1.3503,
after reaching $1.3421, the weakest since April 9. The Dollar
Index climbed for the third day, rising 0.5 percent to 81.264. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities fell after the SEC said last week that Goldman
Sachs in early 2007 created and sold a collateralized debt
obligation linked to subprime mortgages without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the vehicle. The firm denies any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Moral Bankruptcy&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown said he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221;
indicated in the suit. The German government &#8220;will ask the SEC
for information,&#8221; said Ulrich Wilhelm, a spokesman for
Chancellor Angela Merkel. &#8220;Then we will look at the records and
consider possible legal steps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell for a third day against the dollar as concern
Greece will activate the EU-led 45 billion-euro ($60 billion)
emergency-loan package damped demand for the European currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talks on Greece involving the European Commission, the IMF
and the European Central Bank have been delayed until April 21
from today because of a volcanic ash cloud disrupting air
travel. Initial discussions will be held by phone today, a
commission spokesman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek &#8216;Rage&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister George Papandreou&#8217;s decision to call for the
talks prompted a reaction of &#8220;rage&#8221; among 48 percent of Greeks
surveyed in a poll in the Eleftheros Typos newspaper yesterday.
Nine of 10 people surveyed said they expected the IMF to insist
on more belt-tightening. Labor unions have threatened new
strikes over the prospect of more budget cuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield offered by Greek 10-year bonds over
similar-maturity German bunds, Europe&#8217;s benchmark debt
securities, widened to 32 basis points to 462 basis points, the
most since October 1998. Greece needs to raise 11.6 billion
euros by the end of May. A wider gap between the yields
indicates perceptions of higher risk for Greece. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro slid 5.7 percent against the dollar in the first
quarter amid concern Greece&#8217;s debt crisis could threaten the
economic recovery across the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The spread is as good as any indicator of the level of
concern,&#8221; said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at Bank
of New York Mellon Corp. in London. &#8220;We are moving slowly
toward the point where the button is hit to call in the aid. All
those things continue to weigh on the euro.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short Positions Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen move may have been exaggerated as investors trimmed
bets that the yen will decline against the dollar, after futures
traders increased wagers on a drop last week to the most since
July 2007, Hardman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in the number of wagers by hedge funds and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 55,746 on April
13, compared with net shorts of 42,305 a week earlier, figures
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
showed on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Speculative yen net-short positions have been built up in
recent weeks,&#8221; Hardman said. &#8220;That creates scope for a greater
short squeeze.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound slid after a survey showed an increase in support
for the Liberal Democrats, boosting concern the U.K. will elect
a government too weak to tackle the country&#8217;s record budget
deficit. The Liberal Democrats overtook the ruling Labour Party
and Conservatives, according to a YouGov poll for today&#8217;s Sun
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hung Parliament &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chances of the May 6 vote producing a so-called hung
parliament are 78.9 percent, according to Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc estimates based on opinion polls data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pound lost 1 percent to $1.5204, after earlier slipping
1.1 percent, the most since March 24. It depreciated by 0.6
percent to 88.34 pence per euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar&#8217;s push to parity with the U.S. dollar
is in jeopardy as central bankers signal they may slow the pace
of interest-rate increases and China moves closer to revaluing
the yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After rallying 28 percent the past 12 months, more than any
other currency tracked by Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley predicts the
Aussie may tumble 16 percent by year-end because higher
borrowing costs will curb growth. Barclays Capital, which in
December forecast a peak of $1 in 2010, now expects the
Australian dollar to be the biggest loser from what it calls a
&#8220;significant&#8221; yuan revaluation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency is &#8220;fully priced,&#8221; said Scott Ainsbury, a
New York-based money manager who helps invest about $9 billion
at FX Concepts Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest foreign-exchange hedge
fund. &#8220;It&#8217;s probably time to lighten up,&#8221; he said. The Aussie
may weaken about 3 percent before rising by year-end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia&#8217;s dollar declined 0.7 percent to 91.79 U.S.
cents, and slipped 0.9 percent to 84.43 yen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s stocks fell to a one-month

lost 190.50, or 1.1 percent, to 17,400.68, extending last week&#8217;s
1.9 percent retreat. The gauge slid for a fifth day, its longest
losing streak since Jan. 27, after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs for fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations and Britain and Germany said
they will study the firm&#8217;s transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;India&#8217;s &#8220;stock markets will be impacted through risk
aversion,&#8221; said Aneesh Srivastava, the Mumbai-based chief
investment officer who manages $247 million at IDBI Fortis Life
Insurance Co. &#8220;If global investors start withdrawing money and
become risk averse, then that would be a concern.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange lost
1.1 percent to 5,203.65. The BSE 200 Index retreated 1 percent
to 2,190.57. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DLF, Tata Steel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DLF slid 4.1 percent to 316.65 rupees. Tata Steel declined
3.7 percent to 669.8 rupees, its biggest drop since Feb. 8.
Jaiprakash Associates Ltd., a builder of dams, roads and
bridges, decreased 1.2 percent to 146.35 rupees. Reliance
Industries Ltd., India&#8217;s most valuable company, lost 2.1 percent
to 1,061.8 rupees. Reliance Infrastructure Ltd., the builder of
a mass rapid transit system in Mumbai, slipped 2.5 percent to
1,088.75 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India will probably increase the
reverse repurchase rate to 3.75 percent from 3.5 percent and the
repurchase rate to 5.25 percent from 5 percent, according to the
median forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News Survey. The
announcement is due at 11:15 a.m. in Mumbai tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Duvvuri Subbarao on March 19 raised interest rates
by a quarter percentage point for the first time in almost two
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices paid by industrial workers in India rose
14.9 percent in February from a year earlier. The nation&#8217;s
wholesale-price inflation rate held at a 17-month high of 9.9
percent in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Correction Mode&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages in early 2007 as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles, the SEC said
April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market was already in a correction mode last week on
Reserve Bank of India policy,&#8221; said Alex Mathews, head of
research at Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services Ltd. in Kochi.
&#8220;The Goldman Sachs issue will further dampen investor
sentiment. Real estate and banking stocks are likely to be most
impacted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the largest copper and
zinc producer, plunged 3.1 percent to 811.9 rupees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for delivery in three months fell 1.3 percent on the
London Metal Exchange. All of the six main metals traded on the
LME declined, led by zinc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Lending Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China told banks to stop loans for third-home purchases in
cities with excessive property price gains and suspend lending
to buyers who can&#8217;t provide tax returns or proof of social
security contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas investors bought a net 3.43 billion rupees ($77.3
million) of Indian stocks on April 15, taking their total
purchases of the equities this year to 257.1 billion rupees,
according to the nation&#8217;s market regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign funds have been net buyers of stocks for 29
straight trading days, the longest streak of inflows since
August 2005, after Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee on Feb. 26
pledged to trim the fiscal deficit from a 16-year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflows from overseas reached a record 834.2 billion rupees
in 2009, exceeding the high set two years earlier in domestic
currency terms, as the biggest rally in 18 years lured foreign
funds. They sold a record 529.9 billion rupees of shares in
2008, triggering a record annual decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following were among the most active on the exchange: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development Credit Bank Ltd. (DEVB IN) rose 3.7 percent to
36.85 rupees. The lender cut its fourth-quarter loss to 81.6
million rupees from 913.1 million rupees a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KPR Mill Ltd. (KPR IN) jumped 3.4 percent to 135.55 rupees.
The Indian cloth maker rose to the highest in more than two
years after it reported fourth-quarter profit surged sevenfold.
Its net income soared to 162.1 million rupees in the fourth
quarter ended March 31, from 22.6 million rupees a year earlier,
the company said in a release to the exchange on April 17. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. faces a
regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from the German
government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
sued the firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown called April 17 for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
lawsuit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for
details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians who were forced to bail out banks during the
financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped caused the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will see politicians throughout the world piling on
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Scott Moeller, a former investment banker
now teaching at Cass Business School in London. &#8220;Now they have
vulnerability. Everyone and anyone, especially politicians, are
going to be trying to make hay with this one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm denies any wrongdoing. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman
for Goldman Sachs, and Heidi Ashley, a spokeswoman for the FSA,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Sued by SEC for Fraud Tied to CDOs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued by U.S. regulators for
fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations that contributed
to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The
firm&#8217;s shares tumbled as much as 16 percent and financial stocks
slumped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs misstated and omitted key facts about a
financial product tied to subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing
market was starting to falter, the Securities and Exchange
Commission said in a statement April 16. The SEC also sued Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The product was new and complex but the deception and
conflicts are old and simple,&#8221; SEC Enforcement Director Robert
Khuzami said in the statement. &#8220;Goldman wrongly permitted a
client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily
influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment
portfolio, while telling other investors that the securities
were selected by an independent, objective third party.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged that Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, structured and marketed CDOs that
hinged on the performance of subprime mortgage-backed
securities. The New York-based firm failed to disclose to
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the
CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the selection of securities
for the portfolio, the SEC said. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas Van Praag didn&#8217;t return a
call and an e-mail seeking comment. A call to Richard Klapper,
an attorney for Goldman Sachs at Sullivan  Cromwell LLP, wasn&#8217;t
returned. Tourre, reached by phone in London April 16, declined
to comment. A call to Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at
Allen  Overy LLP, wasn&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stefan Prelog, a spokesman for New York-based Paulson 
Co., said he couldn&#8217;t comment. The company oversees $32 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Blackwater President Indicted on Weapons Charges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former president of Blackwater Worldwide Inc., the
military contractor now called Xe Services LLC, was charged with
illegal possession of machine guns and falsifying documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gary Jackson, 52, and four other former Blackwater
officials were indicted April 16 in federal court in Raleigh,
North Carolina. They are accused of using sheriff department
stationery to buy AK 47s and other guns for Blackwater&#8217;s
training facility to get around restrictions on the number of
fully automatic weapons permitted in their inventory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment also charges the five with falsifying
documents to make it appear that weapons Blackwater gave the
king of Jordan and his entourage in 2005, during a visit to the
Moyock, North Carolina, training facility, were purchased by the
defendants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also accused of putting short barrels on rifles
for use in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Blackwater provided
security services for the U.S., without registering them as such
and obstructing an investigation into the altered weapons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Bell, a lawyer for Jackson, and Stacy DeLuke, a
spokeswoman for Xe, didn&#8217;t return calls for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Gary Jackson, 10-8, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of North Carolina (Raleigh.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Credit Agricole Banker Sues on Bonus Exchange Rate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Credit Agricole SA banker responsible for
derivatives is suing over the exchange rate the bank used to
convert his bonus from euros to pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Ollila, formerly an executive director in sales
covering derivatives and securitized products for Nordic
countries and Poland, is seeking at least $96,000, plus
interest, from the Paris-based bank, according to a London
lawsuit made public this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ollila, who worked for the bank from Feb. 1, 2008, until
Nov. 21, 2008, said he is owed 33,000 pounds ($51,000) because
Credit Agricole converted his 327,500-euro ($443,000) bonus
using 2007 exchange rates rather than 2008 rates. He is also
seeking a 33,865 euro deferred payment, which he said he never
received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was an implied term&#8221; of the contract that Credit
Agricole would determine the exchange rate &#8220;reasonably and in
good faith and that the defendant&#8217;s exercise of its discretion
would not be irrational or perverse,&#8221; Ollila said in the
lawsuit that was originally filed in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Credit Agricole spokeswoman in Paris didn&#8217;t respond to a
request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Peter Ollila v. Credit Agricole Corporate 
Investment Bank, claim no. 2010/893, High Court of Justice,
Queens Bench Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miami Beach Hotel Developers Charged With Hiding Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pair of Miami Beach hotel developers were arrested and
charged with conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service
by hiding more than $45 million in offshore accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mauricio Cohen Assor and his son Leon Cohen Levy, who built
residential hotels under the Flatotel name, never told the IRS
about proceeds of the $33 million sale in 2000 of a New York
hotel, according to a complaint in federal court in Miami. Cohen
Assor also used offshore nominee accounts to hide the ownership
of a Swiss account at an international bank that held $45.6
million in 2004, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The men were arrested in New York April 15, the deadline
for filing federal tax returns for 2009, as the Justice
Department also charged seven former UBS AG clients with tax
crimes for hiding funds abroad. The developers were detained
after an initial appearance in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two also used bank accounts in the name of their
business, American Leisure Resorts, to fund a &#8220;luxury
lifestyle&#8221; for themselves and family members, according to the
complaint. They paid for &#8220;lavish personal residences, living
expenses, and car expenses relating to luxury automobiles,
including a $67,000 Dodge Viper, a $188,000 Bentley, and
$700,000 of other vehicles,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attorney for the men, Sharon McCarthy of Kostelanetz 
Fink LLP in New York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment April
15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Mauricio Cohen Assor, 10-cr-06159, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;DynCorp Sued by Holder Over $1.5 Billion Cerberus Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DynCorp International Inc., the defense contractor that has
helped train Iraqi police, was sued by a stockholder claiming
his shares are undervalued in a $1.5 billion takeover bid by
Cerberus Capital Management LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DynCorp, based in Falls Church, Virginia, said in a
statement on April 12 it would be bought by the New York-based
investment fund for $17.55 a share in cash -- a 49 percent
premium at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The proposed transaction is unfair and grossly
inadequate&#8221; and &#8220;Cerberus may be taking advantage of a
temporarily depressed stock price,&#8221; shareholder Shawn K. Naito
said in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed April 16.
Lawyers for Naito ask a judge to stop the deal and award damages
and legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig R. Reed, a DynCorp senior vice president, didn&#8217;t
return a call seeking comment on the lawsuit after business
hours on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Naito v. Dyncorp International Inc., CA5419,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merrill Used Same Alleged Fraud as Goldman, Bank Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co. engaged in the same investor fraud that
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. of committing, according to a bank that sued
the firm in New York last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA, known
as Rabobank, claims Merrill, now a unit of Bank of America
Corp., failed to tell it a key fact in advising on a synthetic
collateralized debt obligation. Omitted was Merrill&#8217;s
relationship with another client betting against the investment,
which resulted in a loss of $45 million, Rabobank claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill&#8217;s handling of the CDO, a security tied to the
performance of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities,
allegedly mirrored Goldman Sachs&#8217;s conduct that the SEC detailed
in a civil complaint filed April 16. The SEC claims Goldman
omitted the same key fact about a financial product tied to
subprime mortgages as the U.S. housing market was starting to
falter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the tip of the iceberg in regard to Goldman Sachs
and certain other banks who were stacking the deck against CDO
investors,&#8221; said Jon Pickhardt, an attorney with Quinn Emanuel
Urquhart Oliver  Hedges, who is representing Netherlands-based
Rabobank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two matters are unrelated and the claims today are
not only unfounded but weren&#8217;t included in the Rabobank lawsuit
filed nearly a year ago,&#8221; Bill Halldin, a Merrill spokesman,
said April 16 of the Dutch bank&#8217;s claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Lench, head of the SEC&#8217;s Structured and New
Products unit, said that the agency &#8220;continues to investigate
the practices of investment banks and others involved in the
securitization of complex financial products tied to the U.S.
housing market as it was beginning to show signs of distress.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, the SEC said New York-based Goldman
Sachs, which had a record $13.4 billion profit last year, failed
to disclose to investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was
betting against the CDO, known as Abacus, and influenced the
selection of securities for the portfolio. Paulson, which
oversees $32 billion and didn&#8217;t market the CDO, wasn&#8217;t accused
of wrongdoing by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC allegations are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact, and we
will vigorously contest them,&#8221; Goldman said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment on whether it
is investigating Merrill&#8217;s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank
BA v. Merrill Lynch  Co, 09-601832, New York State Supreme
Court (New York County). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Sought Tips on Berkshire&#8217;s Goldman Buys, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam, who faces federal
insider trading charges, sought to acquire secret information
about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s 2008 purchase of preferred
shares in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., federal prosecutors said in
a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter from federal prosecutors to Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers
detailing new allegations of insider trading was made public
April 16 in a filing in federal court in Manhattan. In it,
prosecutors elaborated on an earlier claim that Rajaratnam tried
to use confidential information to trade on Goldman Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam &#8220;conspired to obtain material, nonpublic
information about the quarterly earnings of Goldman Sachs&#8221;
before its public announcement of earnings in June 2008 and
December 2008, according to the letter. &#8220;In addition,
Rajaratnam conspired to obtain material, nonpublic information
about the purchase by Berkshire Hathaway of preferred stock in
Goldman prior to Goldman&#8217;s public announcement&#8221; on Sept. 3,
2008, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Rajaratnam are asking a judge to exclude
evidence of additional allegations of insider trading, saying
prosecutors waited too long to disclose it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The filing doesn&#8217;t identify Rajaratnam&#8217;s source for
information about Goldman Sachs. It does provide details about
other alleged efforts to obtain inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegation is false,&#8221; said Jim McCarthy, a spokesman
for Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is the central figure
in a probe in which 21 people have been charged criminally. He
claimed prosecutors are &#8220;sandbagging the defense&#8221; in violation
of his constitutional rights, including the right to defend
himself at trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank Class-Actions Bid in U.K. Not Dead, BBA Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. consumers are likely to get another chance to file
class-action lawsuits against banks after a clause allowing such
cases was dropped from legislation written to respond to the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The provision will probably be taken up by a new government
following the May 6 general election, according to Eric
Leenders, a director at the London-based British Bankers&#8217;
Association, which didn&#8217;t object to the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This isn&#8217;t going away,&#8221; Leenders said in a phone
interview April 16. &#8220;Whichever party comes into power will be
looking at some kind of collective proceedings. We have another
opportunity to think about how they could be constructed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Bill became law on April 8, after a
clause allowing groups to sue financial services firms was
abandoned when lawmakers ran out of time to debate it before
parliament was dissolved ahead of the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clause was considered amid increasing complaints about
bank fees, which U.K. antitrust regulators were barred from
examining for fairness. The language would have allowed lead
plaintiffs in a case to file claims on behalf of unspecified
customers who would have then needed to opt out of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael Mulheron, a Queen Mary University of London law
professor who helped draft court rules for the dropped
provision, also said the class-action law has a chance with the
new government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Tobacco Makers and Retailers Fined $346 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, Gallaher Group Ltd. and 10
retailers were fined 225 million pounds ($346 million) for
coordinating cigarette prices between 2001 and 2003, a U.K.
antitrust regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial, the maker of the West, Davidoff and JPS brands,
received the largest penalty of 112.3 million pounds, the U.K.
Office of Fair Trade said April 16 in a statement. Gallaher, a
unit of Japan Tobacco Inc., was fined 50.4 million pounds. The
fine is the largest of its kind by the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Wal-Mart Stores Inc.&#8217;s Asda unit was fined 14.2 million
pounds and The Co-operative Group was fined 14.1 million pounds
for their roles in a price-fixing scheme that the OFT says
barred retailers from setting their own prices. The affected
markets are worth about 13 billion pounds, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The OFT said it dropped allegations made in 2008 about the
relationship between the tobacco companies and Tesco Plc,
because it didn&#8217;t have enough evidence. The regulator also said
it abandoned claims relating to indirect exchanges of proposed
future retail prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial denied breaking any laws and said in a statement
it would appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. Japan
Tobacco views the fine as a &#8220;positive&#8221; development since the
fine has been formally decided, spokeswoman Yuka Sugimoto said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Morrison Supermarkets Plc said it would challenge
the fines, saying the OFT&#8217;s stance was &#8220;illogical and without
foundation.&#8221; Morrison was fined 2.45 million pounds and Safeway
stores, which it acquired, were fined 10.9 million pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; J Sainsbury Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest supermarket
owner, alerted the OFT to the price-fixing arrangement and was
the first to apply to the watchdog for leniency. The company
received full immunity from fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imperial hasn&#8217;t taken any provisions for the fine, and
&#8220;any appeal to the tribunal will lead to the suspension of the
fine,&#8221; Imperial Tobacco spokesman Simon Evans said April 16 in
a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallaher, Asda, First Quench, One Stop, Somerfield and TM
Retail were given reductions to their fines because they
admitted liability when they received the OFT&#8217;s so-called
statement of objections in April 2008. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dewey  LeBoeuf Issues Bonds as Law Firms Search for Capital &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP said it raised money in a bond
offering, a rare action by a U.S. law firm. The New York-based
firm sold about $125 million in an offering, according to two
people familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1,200-attorney firm used the private placement to
refinance existing bank debt, partner Richard Shutran said. He
declined to disclose the interest rate for the bonds, saying it
was more favorable than the firm&#8217;s bank loans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oboe-Playing Judicial Artist Diane Wood Eyed for High Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diane Wood and her colleagues on the 7th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Chicago have philosophical differences. That
didn&#8217;t stop Judge Richard Posner, the court&#8217;s most outspoken
conservative, from officiating at her wedding when she married
for the third time in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood has demonstrated a willingness to challenge her fellow
jurists without offending, say lawyers and clerks who have
observed her in court. Those attributes may be an asset as
President Barack Obama considers her to replace retiring Justice
John Paul Stevens on an often-divided U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1995, Wood persuaded Posner and other jurists to rethink
the case of an Indiana inmate fighting his death sentence when
she asked whether anyone warned him about repeated federal
challenges. &#8220;Silence can mislead,&#8221; Posner later wrote,
reversing an earlier opinion joined by fellow judge Frank
Easterbrook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That was an example of the art of judging,&#8221; said Tom
Brown, a former clerk for Wood who is a San Francisco lawyer.
&#8220;She asked the question in a way not to embarrass Judge
Easterbrook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Wood&#8217;s opinions supported abortion rights and
separation of church and state, her rulings on business matters
aren&#8217;t easy to pigeonhole. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2000 decision favored Ameritech Corp. in a lawsuit filed
by consumers. Just days later, she upheld a Federal Trade
Commission finding that Toys &#8216;R&#8217; Us Inc. improperly tried to use
its market power to keep the most popular toys out of warehouse-
style discount stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She may lean toward the liberal side on social issues,&#8221;
said Jeffrey Sarles, a partner at Chicago-based Mayer Brown LLP
who appeared before Wood on her first day on the bench. &#8220;On
business issues, she doesn&#8217;t seem ideological.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wood, 59, who plays oboe in the Chicago Bar Association
Symphony Orchestra, said through her staff that she isn&#8217;t
commenting on her reported candidacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tribune Bankruptcy Most Popular Docket on Bloomberg System &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy docket of the Tribune Co. was the most-read
litigation docket on the Bloomberg Law system last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tribune filed bankruptcy in December 2008, one year after
real estate billionaire Sam Zell used more than $8 billion in
loans to take control of the publishing and television company.
The company&#8217;s newspapers include the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Tribune filed a reorganization plan that would
reduce debt taken on during a 2007 buyout in exchange for giving
its lenders 91 percent of the bankrupt publisher. The plan,
filed April 12, in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, reflects
the settlement Tribune reached with its main creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To read more about the reorganization plan, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Tribune Co., 08-13141, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks fell, dragging the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index down by the most in two months, on
concern a U.S. suit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. signals
increasing regulatory scrutiny on financial companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. fell 3.1 percent in
Tokyo after U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday
for the Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry into
Goldman Sachs. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest mining
company, declined 1.6 percent in Sydney on lower commodity
prices. China Vanke Co., the nation&#8217;s biggest publicly traded
developer, sank 8.2 percent in Shenzhen, China, after the
government took more steps to curb gains in real-estate prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman news, in isolation, undermines credibility in
the financial system,&#8221; said Tim Schroeders, who helps manage
about $1.1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. &#8220;It
also creates uncertainty as to whether this is a one-off action,
or the first of many that results in greater scrutiny regarding
the integrity of U.S. financial institutions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index slumped 2 percent to 125.71 as
of 7:34 p.m. in Tokyo, with about 11 stocks declining for each
one that advanced. The measure dropped the most since Feb. 19.
The gauge posted its third straight weekly advance last week as
better-than-estimated economic and U.S. earnings reports fueled
confidence in the global economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Shanghai Composite Index slumped 4.8 percent, its
biggest decline since August 2009, while Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng
Index lost 2.1 percent. Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average sank
1.7 percent. Canon Inc., the world&#8217;s No. 1 camera maker, sank
2.3 percent after the yen strengthened against the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks, Mining Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s Kospi index dropped 1.7 percent and Taiwan&#8217;s
Taiex Index declined 3.2 percent. Thailand&#8217;s SET Index fell 1.3
percent after anti-government demonstrators called for another
major rally in Bangkok tomorrow, risking clashes with securities
officials similar to those that killed two dozen people earlier
this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index lost 0.5 percent.
The gauge slumped 1.6 percent on April 16 after the Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs for misstating and
omitting facts about collateralized debt obligations. Germany&#8217;s
financial regulator has asked the SEC for details on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSBC Holdings Plc, which made 20 percent of its 2009
revenue in North America, fell 3.2 percent to HK$81.85 in Hong
Kong. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s largest bank
by market value, dropped 3.1 percent to 498 yen in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Declines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s second-
biggest bank by market value, sank 3.5 percent to 3,175 yen. In
Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp. fell 1.5 percent to A$27.76. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index tumbled 39 percent from Sept.
15, 2008 to March 9, 2009 as the credit crisis caused the
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and dragged the global
economy into its worst slowdown since World War II. The MSCI
gauge has since surged 78 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and commodity-related companies posted the biggest
declines among the MSCI Asia Pacific Index&#8217;s 10 industry groups.
Companies in the gauge are priced at an average 1.6 times book
value, down from April 15&#8217;s 1.7 times, which was the highest
level since August 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The timing of the accusations against Goldman was perfect
for investors seeking to sell shares, since markets worldwide
had been overheating,&#8221; Kiyoshi Ishigane, a strategist in Tokyo
at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees about $66
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Producers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton retreated 1.6 percent to A$42.84. Newcrest
Mining Ltd., Australia&#8217;s biggest gold producer, slid 1.8 percent
to A$34.00. Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia&#8217;s second-biggest
oil and gas producer, declined 1.6 percent to A$45.97. In
Wellington, New Zealand Oil  Gas Ltd. fell 3.2 percent to
NZ$1.51. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures for June delivery fell 2 percent in New York
on April 16, the most since February, as the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit
against Goldman Sachs, one of Wall Street&#8217;s biggest traders and
brokers of raw materials, spurred investors to seek a haven in
the dollar and eroded the metal&#8217;s appeal as an alternative asset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures slumped 2.7 percent in New York on April
16, while the London Metals Index, a measure of six metals
including copper and zinc, declined 2.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman shock is discouraging investors from taking
on risk in stocks, currencies and commodities,&#8221; said Tomochika
Kitaoka, a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Developers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s property-related equities fell after the nation
said banks should stop loans for third-home purchases in cities
with excessive property price gains and suspend lending to
buyers who cannot provide tax returns or proof of social
security contributions in that city, the State Council said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is worried about the impact of government
measures to tame property price increases,&#8221; Xu Lirong, who
oversees the equivalent of about $2.6 billion at Franklin
Templeton Sealand Fund Management Co. in Shanghai. &#8220;I think
more measures will be introduced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Vanke tumbled 8.2 percent to 8.30 yuan in Shenzhen.
Poly Real Estate Group Co. sank 9.3 percent to 16.92 yuan in
Shanghai. Agile Property Holdings Ltd., a Chinese condominium
developer, slid 7.3 percent to HK$8.87 in Hong Kong. Guangzhou
RF Properties Co., the biggest real-estate company in the
southern Chinese city, slumped 8 percent to HK$10.98, the
biggest decline on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese exporters declined as the yen strengthened to as
much as 91.60 to the dollar after trading at 92.74 at the close
of the Tokyo stock market on April 16. A stronger yen reduces
companies&#8217; revenue from overseas sales when converted into the
local currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volcanic Ash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canon Inc. slid 2.3 percent to 4,250 yen. Panasonic Corp.,
the world&#8217;s biggest maker of plasma televisions, retreated 1.7
percent to 1,368 yen. Sharp Corp., the nation&#8217;s largest maker of
liquid-crystal displays, declined 2.5 percent to 1,196 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airline stocks slumped after a volcanic eruption in Iceland
prompted airlines to cancel flights. Airlines worldwide are
losing at least $200 million a day in revenue as an ash cloud
over Europe grounded planes, the International Air Transport
Association said on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Nippon Airways Co., Asia&#8217;s No. 2 carrier, declined 2.4
percent to 283 yen. Australia&#8217;s Virgin Blue Holdings Ltd.
tumbled 4.6 percent to 62.5 Australian cents in Sydney.
Singapore Airlines Ltd., the world&#8217;s second-largest carrier by
market value, lost 3.7 percent to S$14.96. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-Government Protestors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airports of Thailand Pcl, the nation&#8217;s biggest airfield
operator, sank 7.4 percent to 31.25 baht, on concern that anti-
government protests will deter overseas tourists. Central
Pattana Pcl, Thailand&#8217;s biggest shopping mall operator, declined
2.7 percent to 18 baht. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Thai soldiers cordoned off Bangkok&#8217;s main
financial district today, risking clashes with anti-government
protesters camped across the street. Overseas investors sold a
net 6.7 billion baht ($207 million) of Thai stocks in the past
four trading days, the most in five months, exchange data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outlook for the political situation isn&#8217;t bright,&#8221;
said Tetsuo Yoshikoshi, a senior economist at Sumitomo Mitsui
Bankin Corp. in Singapore. &#8220;We can&#8217;t see how this will be
solved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s stock
may drop and the board could come under pressure to change
managers after European politicians followed a U.S. fraud suit
with their own plans to scrutinize the firm, investors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the U.K.
Financial Services Authority to start a probe, saying he was
&#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated in the
Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Goldman Sachs.
Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC for details
on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The escalating rhetoric adds urgency to efforts by Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and the rest of his
board to stem the negative publicity. Although Goldman Sachs
vowed to fight the SEC case, calling it &#8220;unfounded in law and
fact,&#8221; the stock fell 13 percent on April 16. The shares rose
0.6 percent to $162.42 in European trading today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lynch-mob mentality that is prevailing right now
against Goldman is such that you don&#8217;t know where this thing
could go, so I think the stock is going to be under continuing
pressure,&#8221; said Michael Holland, who oversees more than $4
billion as chairman of New York-based Holland  Co. &#8220;The board
actually has to pay attention not only to the legal niceties of
this thing but also to the franchise viability as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Farr, president and founder of Washington-based
Farr, Miller  Washington LLC, said he sold his Goldman Sachs
stock on April 16 because the SEC suit brought the controversy
over Wall Street&#8217;s dealings in collateralized debt obligations
and credit-default swaps to a new level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Investors Understand Fraud&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors understand that something complicated and
errant happened with CDOs and CDSs but they&#8217;re not sure entirely
what, because these collateralized debt obligations and credit-
default swaps are complicated and somewhat arcane,&#8221; said Farr,
whose firm manages more than $700 million in assets. &#8220;But
investors understand fraud, they get fraud really clearly.&#8221;
Samuel Robinson, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, whose $13.4 billion profit last year was the
highest ever for a Wall Street securities firm, is facing an
unprecedented level of public opprobrium because of the
perception that it profited from practices that led to the
biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is probably just the tip of the iceberg,&#8221; said
Chizu Nakajima, director of the Centre for Financial Regulation
and Crime at the Cass Business School in London. &#8220;As far as
other financial institutions are concerned, they are obviously
very worried. If the SEC&#8217;s action is actually successful, it
could well open up the gates to other litigation worldwide.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;The Bogey Man&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians that were forced to bail out their nations&#8217;
banks are turning on Goldman Sachs. The firm, which paid its
employees $16.2 billion last year, has become a target for
politicians like the U.K.&#8217;s Brown who are running in elections
or who, in the U.S., are battling over new financial regulation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs will now become the bogey man for all
financial ills and I think it&#8217;s a story that&#8217;s not going away,
it is only likely to increase,&#8221; said Matt McCormick, an analyst
at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in Cincinnati, which manages about $2.8
billion. &#8220;If you buy it at these levels you are hoping that
this is the worst of the bad news and I don&#8217;t believe that&#8217;s the
case.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union is probing Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role in
arranging swaps for Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s
budget deficit. Congress has also examined the company&#8217;s
relationship with American International Group Inc., which got a
$182.3 billion U.S. rescue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Case Assigned &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC case against Goldman Sachs was assigned to U.S.
District Judge Barbara Jones in New York who presided over the
case of former WorldCom Inc. CEO Bernard Ebbers. Ebbers, who was
convicted in 2005 of overseeing one of the biggest frauds in
U.S. history, is serving a 25-year prison term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s first-quarter profit, due out tomorrow,
probably won&#8217;t help even though analysts expect earnings to rise
41 percent from a year earlier, McCormick said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re going to probably come out with great earnings,
at least that&#8217;s the expectation, but that is going to be quickly
discounted and drowned out,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board of directors should do its own
investigation to ensure that it understands what senior
management knew about the issues raised by the SEC&#8217;s complaint,
said James Post, a professor of corporate governance and ethics
at the Boston University School of Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;How Long?&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board has got to be insisting on a much deeper level
of internal investigation that reports only to them, not to
Blankfein,&#8221; Post. &#8220;They&#8217;ve got to be asking the question &#8216;how
long can we continue going with Blankfein before we&#8217;ve got to
clean house and put a new group of people in there?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William W. George, a Harvard Business School professor who
has served on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board since 2002, referred a
request for an interview to the company&#8217;s press office. His
Twitter account, which lauded JPMorgan Chase  Co. CEO Jamie
Dimon for his firm&#8217;s better-than-expected earnings on April 14,
remained silent on the controversy surrounding Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston University&#8217;s Post said he wouldn&#8217;t expect the board
to take any immediate action to change the firm&#8217;s management
because it would seem to contradict the defiant position the
company took on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;A Bad Weekend&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m pretty sure that the board at Goldman is having a bad
weekend,&#8221; Post said on April 18. &#8220;They may be praying for some
news out of the Vatican or a new volcano to get them off the
front pages.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bahl  Gaynor&#8217;s McCormick said changing senior management
could add fuel to critics&#8217; complaints instead of mollifying
them. A better course, he said, would be to bring in a well-
respected Wall Street veteran, even someone like billionaire
Warren Buffett, to serve as a chairman or adviser to Blankfein.
Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is already one of the largest
investors in Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I could see them bringing in an outside person, somebody
who is viewed by the Street as a wise sage that could come in
and give an outsider&#8217;s perspective&#8221; to advise Blankfein,
McCormick said. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;s going to believe Goldman is going to
take care of this on their own.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Widening probes of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may prompt a drop of as much as 10 percent in global
stock markets, according to AMP Capital Investors Ltd., a unit
of Australia&#8217;s biggest provider of pension plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI World Index, as well as U.S. and Asian equity
gauges, are ripe for a &#8220;multi-month&#8221; correction after
valuations soared, said Nader Naeimi, a strategist who helps
oversee $90 billion for the Sydney-based mutual-funds manager.
AMP Capital last week began moving to cash assets from equities,
anticipating a decline in stocks, Naeimi said. The MSCI World,
which measures 23 developed markets, has rallied 43 percent in
the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman inquiries have triggered a fresh wave of
anxiety for investors,&#8221; Naeimi said in an interview today.
&#8220;Not only is the market worried who might be next, it&#8217;s
anticipating tighter regulation of the banking sector. Given how
over-bought stocks had become, this may be enough to trigger the
sharp correction in the overall market that we&#8217;ve been
expecting.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most-profitable Wall Street firm in
history, faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from
the German government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued the firm for alleged fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI World Index&#8217;s rally in the past 12 months has
driven the average valuation for companies in the gauge to 14.8
times estimated earnings, compared with 11.2 times at the
gauge&#8217;s March 9, 2009 low. The measure dropped 0.6 percent as
of 4:57 p.m. in Tokyo, while the MSCI Asia Pacific Index sank
1.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any correction is likely to hurt financial stocks in
particular, and could last for as long as six months, at which
point shares in Asian banks, which are generally less leveraged
than their U.S. and European counterparts, will look especially
attractive, AMP Capital&#8217;s Naeimi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whenever the global financial sector is hit, there tends
to be guilt by association,&#8221; said Naeimi. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking at
buying into Asian financials when we think the correction is
close to having run its course. Depending on relative valuations
at the time, you might well see us rotating out of developed-
world financial stocks into Asian ones.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategist told a Bloomberg Television on April 14,
2009 that the &#8220;bear market&#8221; in global equities had ended. The
MSCI World Index finished the year with a 27 percent advance.
Naeimi also called a &#8220;correction&#8221; for the U.S. Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index on Oct. 16, 2009. The gauge dropped 5.6 percent
between Oct. 19 and Oct. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for the
Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry into Goldman,
saying he was &#8220;shocked&#8221; at the &#8220;moral bankruptcy&#8221; indicated
in the suit. Germany&#8217;s financial regulator, Bafin, asked the SEC
for details on the suit, a spokesman for Chancellor Angela
Merkel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politicians who were forced to bail out their banks during
the financial crisis are turning on Goldman, which critics say
helped caused the turmoil and profited from it. The European
Union is also probing Goldman&#8217;s role in arranging swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The timing of the accusations against Goldman was perfect

had been overheating,&#8221; said Kiyoshi Ishigane, a strategist in
Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $66 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palm oil tumbled to the lowest
level in about 11 weeks, following declines in commodities and
stocks after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. for fraud and China curbed property loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures for July delivery dropped as much as 2.5 percent to
2,455 ringgit ($763) a metric ton, the lowest price for the most
active contract on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange since Feb.
2, and traded at 2,473 ringgit at 4 p.m. Singapore time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 1.9 percent to 125.83
as of 5 p.m. in Tokyo, the most since Feb. 19. Commodities
including copper, crude oil, corn and soybeans dropped today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The weakness is coming from the external markets,&#8221; said
Ryan Long, a futures trader at OSK Investment Bank Sdn. in Kuala
Lumpur. &#8220;The market has been struggling to hold above 2,500
ringgit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares plummeted 13 percent on April 16 after
the SEC said the most-profitable Wall Street firm in history
misstated key facts about collateralized debt obligations tied
to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China told banks to stop loans for third-home purchases in
cities with excessive property gains and to suspend lending to
buyers who can&#8217;t provide tax returns or proof of social security
contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In China, the largest consumer of edible oils, palm oil for
September delivery lost 1.4 percent to 6,888 yuan ($1,009) a ton
on the Dalian Commodity Exchange. Soybean oil lost 0.7 percent
to 3,872 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should Malaysian palm oil, the industry benchmark, fail to
stay above 2,500 ringgit a ton, technical charts suggest it
could drop to 2,403 ringgit and &#8220;possibly towards the 2,200
support level,&#8221; said a RHB Research Institute Sdn. report today,
referring to a price where buy orders cluster. The price hasn&#8217;t
been that low since Nov. 3. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rubber slumped by the most in seven
months after U.S. securities regulators accused Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. of fraud, sapping investor demand for assets ranging
from stocks to metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures in Tokyo lost 6.3 percent today, the biggest one-
day drop since Sept. 14. The price declined to the lowest level
since April 1 after reaching a 21-month high of 338.5 yen per
kilogram ($3,673 a metric ton) on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold and other commodities including oil tumbled after the
regulators filed the suit against Goldman Sachs, one of Wall
Street&#8217;s biggest traders and brokers of raw materials. The
Japanese currency rose to the highest level since March against
the dollar, cutting the appeal of yen-based contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rubber tracked losses in other commodities as the news
about Goldman caused risk-aversion,&#8221; Takaki Shigemoto, an
analyst at research and investment company JSC Corp. in Tokyo,
said today by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubber for September delivery lost 21.1 yen to settle at
313.1 yen per kilogram on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. The
price decreased for a second day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Goldman
created and sold securities linked to subprime mortgage-backed
securities. The firm failed to disclose to investors that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the instruments and
influenced the selections in the portfolio, the SEC said.
Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largest Brokerage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Feb. 28, Goldman was the largest commodity brokerage
by adjusted net capital, the minimum needed to meet the
requirements set by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission,
according to data from the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman shock is discouraging investors from taking
on risk in stocks, currencies and commodities,&#8221; said Tomochika
Kitaoka, a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rubber futures have gained 13 percent this year as China
led a recovery in global economies from the worst postwar
recession, boosting sales of cars and tires. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s gross domestic product expanded 11.9 percent in the
first quarter from a year earlier, the statistics bureau said on
April 15. That was the fastest pace in almost three years. The
nation is the largest consumer of natural rubber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A seasonal decline in rubber output in Thailand, the
largest producer, also helped increase rubber prices by 4.5
percent so far this month, Shigemoto at JSC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand is in a low-production period from February to
April, known as wintering, when rubber trees shed their leaves
and latex output slows. Shipments from the country will remain
slow until early June, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding demand and declining supply drove China&#8217;s rubber
stockpiles to the lowest level since July 2009 last week,
Shigemoto said. Natural rubber inventories monitored by the
Shanghai Futures Exchange plunged 9,802 tons to 48,979 tons, the
bourse said on April 16, based on a survey of 10 warehouses in
Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;September-delivery rubber on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
lost 3.2 percent to settle at 24,535 yuan ($3,594) a ton.
Earlier it fell to 24,200 yuan, the lowest level since March 25. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market stocks slumped the
most in more than two months as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. faces
probes in the U.S. and Europe and China stepped up measures to
cool property speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost 2 percent to 1,011.27
as of 8:17 a.m. in London, poised for its biggest one-day drop
since Feb. 5. Benchmark indexes in China, Taiwan and Russia
retreated more than 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KB Financial Group Inc. led banking shares lower. Chinese
developers were the four biggest decliners on the MSCI index
after the State Council ordered banks to stop lending to third-
home buyers. The Bombay Stock Exchange&#8217;s Sensitive Index fell to
a one-month low on speculation the central bank will tighten
monetary policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs probe is &#8220;having an impact&#8221; and &#8220;came
at a time when markets were vulnerable after two months of
strong gains,&#8221; said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Investors, which oversees $90
billion. China&#8217;s latest property curbs &#8220;probably will weigh on
sentiment for a while,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures fell after the U.K. and Germany signaled
inquiries into Goldman Sachs, which is being sued by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. U.S. stocks declined on April
16 by the most since February after the suit spurred concern
fallout from the financial crisis isn&#8217;t over. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks, Developers Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KB Financial, owner of South Korea&#8217;s largest bank, dropped
2.3 percent to 56,200 won. ICICI Bank Ltd., India&#8217;s second-
biggest lender, retreated 1.2 percent to 911 rupees. The Reserve
Bank of India may raise interest rates tomorrow for the second
time in a month, according to the median forecast of 25
economists in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders and developers led Chinese shares lower after China
told banks to stop loans for third-home purchases in cities with
excessive property price gains and suspend lending to non-
residents without tax returns or proof of social security
contributions in that city. Local governments may also limit the
number of units that can be bought, according to a statement by
the State Council on April 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Vanke Co., the nation&#8217;s largest listed developer,
lost 4.8 percent to 8.61 yuan. Agile Property Holdings Ltd.
tumbled 7.6 percent to HK$8.84. The latest measures are the
&#8220;most draconian&#8221; on the property market in history, Deutsche
Bank AG&#8217;s Greater China chief economist Ma Jun said in a note to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airlines also retreated on concern losses are mounting
following the closing of European airspace from last week&#8217;s
volcanic eruption in Iceland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Airways International Plc, which said it&#8217;s losing 100
million baht ($3.1 million) a day from the closure, dropped 3.1
percent to 22.2 baht. Korean Air Lines Co. lost 3 percent to
65,500 won. Air China Ltd. declined 3.5 percent to 13.64 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese stocks fell the most since
February after U.S. securities regulators accused Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. of fraud, commodity prices slid and the yen climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost 10 times as many shares declined as advanced.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s second-biggest
bank by market value, sank 3.5 percent. Canon Inc., a camera
maker that gets about 28 percent of its sales in the Americas,
lost 2.3 percent. Mitsui  Co., a trading company that counts
commodities as its biggest source of profit, slid 3.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The timing of the accusations against Goldman was perfect
for investors seeking to sell shares, since markets worldwide
had been overheating,&#8221; said Kiyoshi Ishigane, a strategist in
Tokyo at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of about $66 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 1.7 percent to 10,908.77
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index lost 1.8
percent to 970.84, its biggest drop since Feb. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 25-day Toraku index, a measure of daily stock winners
and losers in Tokyo, has held above 120 since March 17. Some
traders consider a level of more than 120 as a signal the market
is overheating. A surge in Dai-ichi Life Insurance Co.&#8217;s shares
on their first day of trading and a weaker yen had encouraged
investors to buy Japanese stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s drop cut the price of stocks in the Topix to 19.6
times estimated earnings on average, compared with 14.8 times
for the MSCI World Index of 23 developed countries. The Japanese
gauge has risen 7 percent this year, the biggest increase among
benchmarks for the world&#8217;s 15 largest equity markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Goldman Shock&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell 0.5 percent
after the U.K. and Germany signaled inquiries into Goldman Sachs.
The index dropped 1.6 percent in New York on April 16, the most
since Feb. 4, after the Securities and Exchange Commission
accused the New York-based investment bank of fraud related to
packaging and selling collateralized-debt obligations linked to
subprime mortgages. Goldman Sachs tumbled 13 percent on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman shock is discouraging investors from taking
on risk in stocks, currencies and commodities,&#8221; said Tomochika
Kitaoka, a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui fell 3.5 percent to 3,175 yen. Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s biggest bank by market value,
lost 3.1 percent to 498 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc., the nation&#8217;s
largest brokerage, slid 2.8 percent to 669 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Stocks may continue to slump if the allegations against
Goldman prompt financial regulators globally to tighten rules,&#8221;
said Yoshinori Nagano, a senior strategist in Tokyo at Daiwa
Asset Management Co., which manages about $94 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign Exchange, Commodities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canon, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of digital cameras, fell
2.3 percent to 4,250 yen. Toyota Motor Corp., a carmaker that
gets 43 percent of its revenue in North America and Europe,
slipped 1.9 percent to 3,625 yen. Mitsubishi UFJ, Toyota,
Sumitomo Mitsui, Canon and Mitsui  Co. were the biggest drags
on the Topix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising yen further weighed on stocks, reducing the
value of overseas income at Japanese companies when converted
into their home currency. The yen rose to as much as 91.82
against the dollar, its strongest level since March 25, from
92.74 at the close of stock trading in Tokyo on April 16. It
appreciated to as much as 123.70 against the euro from 125.48. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Japan doesn&#8217;t have any power to boost the economy by
itself,&#8221; said Ishigane. &#8220;The U.S. market has a big impact on
the stock market in Japan, whose economy depends on exports.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsui  Co., Japan&#8217;s second-biggest trading company by
market value, declined 3.6 percent to 1,560 yen. Inpex Corp.,
the nation&#8217;s largest oil and gas explorer, sank 3.1 percent to
688,000 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for May delivery lost 1.8 percent today, adding
to a 2.7 percent decline on April 16. The London Metal Exchange
Index of six industrial metals, including copper and zinc, fell
2.1 percent on April 16, its biggest drop since Feb. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Komatsu Ltd., a maker of construction machinery that counts
China as its fastest-growing market, fell 2.2 percent to 1,876
yen. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. declined 2.8 percent to
2,140 yen. They dropped after China told banks to stop loans on
purchases of third homes to cool its economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nomura Holdings Inc. led securities
firms lower in Tokyo on concern the fraud lawsuit filed against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in the U.S. may hurt brokerages in
Japan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura fell 2.8 percent, its biggest decline since Feb. 5,
to 669 yen at the 3 p.m. close of trading. The Topix Securities
Index was the fifth-worst performer among 33 industry groups on
the benchmark Topix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares had their biggest loss since January
2009 after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the bank
with fraud related to packaging and selling collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nomura is the only Japanese brokerage that operates
globally,&#8221; said Fumiyuki Nakanishi, a strategist at Tokyo-based
SMBC Friend Securities Co. &#8220;Investors were surprised to hear
Goldman Sachs is being sued, and they are selling the stocks by
association; people learned a lesson from the subprime crisis
when they initially believed Japan wouldn&#8217;t be seriously hurt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daiwa Securities Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s second largest
brokerage, fell 2.6 percent to 487 yen, its biggest decline
since Feb. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs faces a regulatory probe in Britain and
scrutiny from the German government after the SEC sued the firm
for fraud tied to collateralized debt obligations. The firm
denies any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuji Takahashi, a spokesman for Japan&#8217;s Securities and
Exchange Surveillance Commission, declined to comment on Goldman
Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper dropped for a third day to a
three-week low amid a slump in industrial metals as China moved
to cool its real-estate market and U.S. regulators filed a suit
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange shed as much as 1.4 percent to $7,653 a metric ton, the
lowest price since March 29, before trading at $7,663 at 2:26
p.m. in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The big rally we saw last year was a result of strong
demand from China, especially from the property and car
industries,&#8221; said Pan Jinghua, an analyst at Shanghai Jinpeng
International Futures Co. &#8220;A slowdown in China&#8217;s real-estate
market will have an impact on metals demand.&#8221; China is the
world&#8217;s largest user of industrial metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for July delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
fell as much as 3.7 percent to 60,020 yuan ($8,793) a ton, the
lowest price since March 26, after China told banks to stop
loans for third-home purchases in cities with excessive property
price gains and suspend lending to buyers who can&#8217;t provide tax
returns or proof of social security contributions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local governments can limit the number of units that can be
bought, while senior officials will be held responsible for
failing to stabilize property prices, according to a State
Council statement on April 17. The country may soon start trials
of a tax on property transactions, the China Times reported,
citing an unidentified person close to the Ministry of Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sued &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal prices also dropped after the dollar gained for a
third day against a six-currency basket as Goldman faced
inquiries by the U.K. and Germany following the U.S. suit.
Goldman, one of Wall Street&#8217;s largest raw-materials traders and
brokers, faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny from
the German government after the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission sued the firm for fraud tied to collateralized debt
obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs created and sold CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages in early 2007 as the U.S. housing market faltered,
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles, the SEC said
April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The news on Goldman is hitting sentiment in all markets
as it once again brings to the fore the fragility of the U.S.
banking system,&#8221; said Pan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising Inventories &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An expansion in Chinese stockpiles of metals is also
weighing on prices, Pan said. Inventories of copper and aluminum
at Shanghai warehouses are at their highest since at least 2003,
while zinc stockpiles are at the highest since April 2007, when
the contract was launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum supply is still outpacing demand and probably will
&#8220;for the next couple of years,&#8221; signaling declining prices,
Standard Chartered Bank said in a report, forecasting an average
price of $2,100 a ton this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum fell 1.6 percent to $2,395 a ton, zinc declined
2.7 percent to $2,357 a ton, and lead dropped 2.7 percent to
$2,200 a ton. Nickel lost 2.3 percent to $26,080 a ton and tin
fell 2.3 percent to $18,750 a ton at 2:39 p.m. in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks declined the most in
two months, while commodities and currencies slumped, after the
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
for fraud and China curbed property loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dived 2 percent to 125.73 at
3:15 p.m. in Tokyo, the most since Feb. 19. Futures for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and the Euro Stoxx 50 decreased 0.4
percent. China&#8217;s Shanghai Composite Index slid 3.7 percent after
the government told banks to stop loans for third-home purchases.
Oil prices dropped 1.6 percent in New York, while copper slumped
2.7 percent in Shanghai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares plummeted 13 percent on April 16 after
the SEC claimed the most-profitable Wall Street firm in history
misstated key facts about collateralized debt obligations tied
to subprime mortgages. China&#8217;s latest move to cool its property
market comes after prices gained a record 11.7 percent in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman news, in isolation, undermines credibility in
the financial system,&#8221; said Tim Schroeders, who helps manage
about $1.1 billion at Pengana Capital Ltd. in Melbourne. &#8220;It
also creates uncertainty as to whether this is a one-off action,
or the first of many that results in greater scrutiny regarding
the integrity of U.S. financial institutions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average sank 1.7 percent, Taiwan&#8217;s
Taiex index dropped 3.2 percent, South Korea&#8217;s Kospi index
dropped 1.8 percent and Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng Index lost 1.6
percent. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called yesterday for
the Financial Services Authority to start an inquiry into
Goldman Sachs, while Germany&#8217;s financial regulator has asked the
SEC for details on the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Drop &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s largest bank
by market value, fell 2.7 percent to 500 yen in Tokyo. Sumitomo
Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s second-biggest bank by
market value, sank 3.5 percent to 3,175 yen. In Sydney, Westpac
Banking Corp. slid 1.8 percent to A$27.68. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific corporate and sovereign
bonds from default increased, according to traders of credit-
default swaps. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-
grade borrowers outside Japan climbed 5 basis points to 95 basis
points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks and commodities companies posted the biggest declines
among the MSCI Asia Pacific Index&#8217;s 10 industry groups as 14
shares fell for every one that gained. Companies in the gauge
trade at an average 16.2 times estimated earnings, compared with
15.5 times for the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodity Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s biggest mining company,
retreated 1.5 percent to A$42.87. Newcrest Mining Ltd.,
Australia&#8217;s biggest gold producer, slid 1.7 percent to A$34.02.
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., Australia&#8217;s second-biggest oil and gas
producer, declined 2.2 percent to A$45.70. In Wellington, New
Zealand Oil  Gas Ltd. fell 3.2 percent to NZ$1.51. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman shock is discouraging investors from taking
on risk in stocks, currencies and commodities,&#8221; said Tomochika
Kitaoka, a senior strategist at Mizuho Securities Co. in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil dropped to $81.97 a barrel in New York after Qatar&#8217;s
Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah said yesterday there
is no need for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
to review output before the group meets in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper in Shanghai for July delivery tumbled 2.7 percent to
60,760 yuan ($8,901) per ton and nickel for three-month delivery
in London fell 2 percent to $26,160 a ton after reaching $27,595
a ton on Friday, the highest level for 23 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Property &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China Vanke Co. and Poly Real Estate Group Co., the
nation&#8217;s two-largest developers by market value, dropped more
than 6.5 percent. Deutsche Bank AG said the latest move is the
&#8220;most draconian measures on the property market in history,&#8221;
and Goldman Sachs said the nation&#8217;s real estate stocks now face
&#8220;high policy risk.&#8217;
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The latest measures are going to weigh on sentiment for
the market as property is an important pillar of the economy,&#8221;
said Zhou Xi, a strategist at Bohai Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand&#8217;s SET stock index fell 1.7 percent after anti-
government demonstrators called for another major rally in
Bangkok tomorrow, risking clashes with securities officials
similar to those that killed two dozen people earlier this month.
Foreign investors sold 6.7 billion baht ($207 million) of Thai
shares in the past four trading days, the most in five months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s won declined 0.8 percent to 1,118.95 per
dollar, retreating from near a 19-month high. Malaysia&#8217;s ringgit
weakened 0.8 percent to 3.2166. The Dollar Index, which gauges
the currency against those of six major U.S. trading partners,
rose 0.2 percent, while 10-year Treasury yields were near the
lowest level in more than three weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just risk aversion,&#8221; said Gerrard Katz, head of
currency trading for Asia at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong.
&#8220;It creates a bit of uncertainty in the market around banking
and regulation again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in yield to own bonds in developing nations
instead of Treasuries widened to 2.41 percentage points up from
2.31 percentage points on April 16, the least since December
2007, according to the EMBI Plus Index compiled by JPMorgan
Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro fell against the dollar and the yen after European
Union finance ministers told Greece to brace itself for the
International Monetary Fund&#8217;s conditions on a bailout package.
Talks on Greece involving the European Commission, the IMF and
the European Central Bank are due April 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors remain wary the country can roll over its debts
without external assistance,&#8221; Mansoor Mohi-uddin, chief
currency strategist in Singapore at UBS AG, wrote in an e-mail
yesterday. &#8220;We continue to see the euro falling back to $1.30
over the next three months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro weakened to $1.3468 from $1.3503 after touching
$1.3457, the weakest since April 9. It fell to 123.89 against
the yen from 124.44. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A fraud suit by U.S. regulators
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is unlikely to send hedge funds
scrambling to reduce gold holdings, according to Superfund
Financial Singapore Pte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any retreat in prices will present investors, especially
central banks, with a buying opportunity, Aaron Smith, managing
director of Superfund, said in an interview today. Gold for
immediate delivery was little changed at $1,136.57 an ounce at
11:57 a.m. in Singapore after slumping by the most in more than
two months on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t expect hedge funds to unwind their
positions,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Even if they do, I think central
banks, especially in the East, whether it&#8217;s India or China or
any central bank that is smart, will use it as an opportunity to
acquire gold at a cheaper level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman faces a regulatory probe in Britain and scrutiny
from the German government after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud tied to
collateralized debt obligations. The firm failed to disclose to
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. was betting against the
instruments and influenced the selections in the portfolio, the
SEC said. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of Dec. 31, Paulson was the largest holder in the SPDR
Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund back by the metal,
and Goldman was the 11th biggest. Both are based in New York.
Paulson is also the top investor in AngloGold Ashanti Ltd.,
Africa&#8217;s largest producer of bullion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Good Opportunity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long positions in New York gold futures in the week
ended April 13, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 220,742 contracts on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Washington-
based commission said in its Commitments of Traders report. Net-
long positions rose by 17,296 contracts, or 9 percent, from a
week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the short term, there&#8217;s a possibility of a pullback
and we would recommend to any investor that&#8217;s a good
opportunity&#8221; to enter the market, Smith said. &#8220;In the long run,
the hard assets will have sustainable value and sustainable
purchasing power.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold rallied 24 percent last year as central banks and
governments maintained low interest rates and spent trillions of
dollars to stimulate economies, sending the dollar 4.2 percent
lower against six major currencies. Bullion has gained 3.6
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the upward trend in equity markets continues and
interest rates continue to stay low, we won&#8217;t certainly see a
large pullback in commodity markets,&#8221; Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks in Russia, China, India, Sri Lanka and
Mauritius have all increased their gold reserves. China has
expanded reserves by 76 percent to 1,054 metric tons since 2003,
the central bank said last year. India bought 200 tons from the
International Monetary Fund last year as gold prices soared and
the dollar weakened. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s rupee weakened for the
first time in three days, mirroring declines in global stocks
and commodities, after the Securities and Exchange Commission
sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The local currency declined the most in more than two
months after the SEC last week claimed Goldman, the most-
profitable Wall Street firm in history, misstated key facts
about collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages.
The rupee also slid on speculation importers bought dollars,
betting the currency will extend its losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Risk aversion has increased because the bad news is
regarding Goldman, which is a market maker,&#8221; said Vikas Babu, a
currency trader at Andhra Bank in Mumbai. &#8220;Importers are also
speculating the rupee has more reasons to decline than rise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rupee declined 0.6 percent to 44.59 per dollar as of
9:22 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The rupee may drop to 44.75 this week, Babu predicts. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index declined 2 percent to 125.74, the most since
Feb. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offshore contracts indicate bets the rupee will decline to
44.65 to the dollar in a month, compared with expectations of
44.37 at the end of last week. Forwards are agreements in which
assets are bought and sold at current prices for future delivery.
Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars rather than the
local currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian currencies slumped, led by
Malaysia&#8217;s ringgit and Korea&#8217;s won, on concern that a probe by
U.S. regulators into Goldman Sachs Group Inc. could widen and
hamper the global economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index dropped for a
third day, and the MSCI Asia Pacific Index slid the most in two
months. Appetite for higher-yielding assets was also curbed by
speculation that Greece&#8217;s bailout by the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund will be opposed. Goldman Sachs may
face investigations in Britain and Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asian currencies are slightly weaker on the Greece issue,
while U.S. equities closed lower on Friday on concern over the
implications that the Goldman Sachs issue will have on the
banking system,&#8221; said Perry Kojodjojo, a currency strategist at
HSBC Holdings Plc in Hong Kong. &#8220;There is a paring back of risk
appetite as a result.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Malaysian ringgit lost 0.8 percent to 3.2180 per dollar,
and the South Korean won fell 0.6 percent to 1,117.20 as of
12:02 p.m. in Singapore, according to Bloomberg data.
Indonesia&#8217;s rupiah weakened 0.4 percent to 9,043 and the Thai
baht declined 0.3 percent to 32.33 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on April
16 it was suing Goldman Sachs for fraud tied to collateralized
debt obligations. The bank created and sold obligations linked
to subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson
 Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, the commission said. Goldman Sachs has denied any
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulatory Uncertainty &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ringgit retreated the most since March 15 as the FTSE
Bursa Malaysia KLCI Index dropped 0.6 percent. U.K. Prime
Minister Gordon Brown yesterday called for an investigation into
the investment bank, while German regulators asked the SEC for
details of its suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The case affected risk sentiment and flattened currencies
in the region,&#8221; said Sim Moh Siong, a foreign-exchange
strategist at Bank of Singapore Ltd. &#8220;It opened up issues about
conflict of interest and created some regulatory uncertainty in
the financial industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won retreated from near a 19-month high as overseas
investors trimmed their holdings of Korean shares for only the
second day in the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s just risk aversion,&#8221; said Gerrard Katz, head of
currency trading for Asia at Standard Chartered Plc in Hong Kong.
&#8220;It creates a bit of uncertainty in the market around banking
and regulation again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The won won&#8217;t weaken beyond 1,125 and may trade in a range
of 1,110 through 1,120, Standard Chartered&#8217;s Katz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bailout Package &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia&#8217;s rupiah fell the most in 10 weeks after reaching
its strongest level since July 2007 last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union finance ministers told Greece to brace
itself for the IMF&#8217;s conditions on the bailout package. The
Greek government&#8217;s talks with the European Central Bank, the IMF
and the European Commission about an EU-led the emergency loan
package will be delayed until April 21, the country&#8217;s Finance
Ministry said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference in yield to own bonds in developing nations
instead of Treasuries widened to 2.41 percentage points from
2.31 percentage points on April 16, according to the EMBI Plus
Index compiled by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand&#8217;s baht dropped the most in a week after anti-
government demonstrators called for another major rally in
Bangkok tomorrow, risking clashes with securities officials
similar to those that killed two dozen people earlier this month.
Foreign investors sold 6.7 billion baht ($207 million) of Thai
shares in the past four trading days, the most in five months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, the Philippine peso and the Singapore dollar
declined 0.5 percent each to 44.610 and S$1.3794 respectively.
Taiwan&#8217;s dollar slipped 0.2 percent to NT$31.445, while China&#8217;s
yuan was little changed at 6.8258. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co., the world&#8217;s third-
largest manager of hedge funds, may face civil litigation for
its role in the collateralized debt obligations that led to the
fraud charges against Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to
Christopher Whalen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s hedge fund made $1 billion on
the CDOs that contributed to the worst financial crisis since
the Great Depression. Whalen, a banking analyst at Institutional
Risk Analytics in Torrance, California, said that allegations 
the firm helped shop a package of debt they were actively 
betting against opened it up to litigation in the wake of the 
suit by the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure they will escape civil litigation arising
from this,&#8221; Whalen said in a Bloomberg Radio interview with Tom
Keene on April 16. &#8220;You can bet the parties who lost money here
are going to be seeking redress.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While buy-side firms don&#8217;t often sue their dealers or
advisers, the SEC suit will have done most of the legwork and
attracted publicity, opening the door for other parties to claim
damages, Whalen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co. said April 16 it had no authority over the
selection of assets linked to the Goldman Sachs mortgage
security from whose decline it later profited. Paulson oversees
about $32 billion in hedge funds, third in the world behind
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bridgewater Associates LP. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Apr 19, 2010 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-19/goldman-sachs-results-may-show-whether-debt-trading-dominance-is-at-risk.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Results May Show Whether Debt-Trading Dominance Is at Risk</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., accused
by regulators last week of fraud in its mortgage-securities
business, may show investors tomorrow whether its dominance of
Wall Street&#8217;s debt trading is being eroded by competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts including Howard Chen at Credit Suisse Group AG
expect New York-based Goldman Sachs, which reports first-quarter
earnings tomorrow, to say revenue from fixed-income trading
dropped from $6.56 billion in last year&#8217;s first quarter.
Earnings last week from Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co., the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, surged on record
first-quarter revenue from the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief
executive officer, relied on fixed-income trading for more than
half of revenue last year, helping the firm post record profit.
Competitors that lagged behind Goldman Sachs a year ago are
trying to catch up. Morgan Stanley, which reports earnings on
April 21, hired more than 350 people last year to rebuild its
sales and trading business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Competition appears to be returning, but it&#8217;s not
necessarily a zero-sum game as the overall market is growing,&#8221;
said New York-based Chen, who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on
both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. &#8220;Global GDP is positive,
fixed-income issuance levels have been robust and client
liquidity levels seem healthy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s competitors may see the Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s suit against the firm as an opportunity to
grab market share. The SEC sued the firm for fraud on April 16,
saying Goldman Sachs misled investors in its marketing of
collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages.
Goldman Sachs said the allegations were &#8220;completely unfounded in
law and fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon told analysts last week that he
didn&#8217;t expect his bank to be alone in reporting gains in trading
revenue because overall demand from clients has picked up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a lot of client flow, so we&#8217;re not the only ones
who saw that,&#8221; Dimon said. &#8220;I think you&#8217;re going to see other
people report similarly good numbers driven by client flow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the six-biggest U.S. banks by assets, only Goldman Sachs
and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. are expected by
analysts to show a decline in profit in 2010 compared with last
year, when they both generated record earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter adjusted earnings at Goldman Sachs will
probably rise 54 percent from a year earlier to $2.55 billion,
or $4.14 per share, according to the average estimate of 23
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gorman&#8217;s Goal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Gorman, Morgan Stanley&#8217;s new CEO, is expected to
report $1.1 billion in adjusted first-quarter earnings, or 57
cents a share, compared with a loss a year earlier, a Bloomberg
survey shows. Credit Suisse&#8217;s Chen expects Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
fixed-income trading revenue to rise to $1.95 billion from last
year&#8217;s $1.29 billion, which was damped by writedowns and
accounting adjustments related to the firm&#8217;s credit costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You listen to James Gorman on the call last quarter and
he&#8217;s very clear that we want to be top three in all of our
businesses,&#8221; Chen said. &#8220;That would mean closing the gap in
fixed-income and equities trading.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake declined to comment
about trading revenue. Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag
also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs gained 4.7 percentage points of market share
in fixed-income trading since the first half of 2007, more than
double the next-biggest climb of any of the top 14 banks, Keith
Horowitz, an analyst at Citigroup Inc., said in an April 6 note
to investors. Morgan Stanley&#8217;s market share in fixed-income
trading fell 2.4 percentage points in that time, Horowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Ability to regain trading market share is the key to the
stock,&#8221; Horowitz wrote of Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts&#8217; Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will probably report $6.09 billion in fixed-
income trading revenue in the first quarter, down 7 percent from
a year earlier, Barclays Capital analyst Roger Freeman said in a
March 30 note. Morgan Stanley may report $1.94 billion in fixed-
income trading revenue, up 50 percent, Freeman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s first-quarter earnings surpassed estimates last
week in part because of $5.5 billion in fixed-income revenue
that set a record for the New York-based bank. Bank of America
said April 16 that revenue from fixed-income, currency and
commodity trading climbed 16 percent to $5.52 billion in the
first quarter, the most since the largest U.S. bank acquired
Merrill Lynch last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG generated about $2.3 billion of revenue at its
fixed-income division in the first quarter, people with
knowledge of the situation said last month. The bank said that
figure was &#8220;slightly higher&#8221; than its forecast. Writedowns in
the first quarter of 2009 forced the Zurich-based company to
report negative revenue of 1.97 billion Swiss francs ($1.86
billion) for the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Normal Level&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Revenues you&#8217;re seeing now are probably more broadly
based,&#8221; said Richard Staite, a London-based analyst at Atlantic
Equities LLP. &#8220;Bid-offer spreads have come down to a more normal
level, but you&#8217;ve seen a pickup in client activity across a
number of different sectors, so I think we&#8217;re getting more
toward a normal environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs generated $23.3 billion in revenue from sales
and trading in fixed-income, currencies and commodities, more
than half of the firm&#8217;s total revenue last year. That
performance helped drive the firm to the largest profit in Wall
Street history just one year after reporting its first quarterly
loss as a public company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley generated $5.02 billion of fixed-income
sales and trading revenue as it ramped up risk at a slower pace
than Goldman. The firm replaced its sales and trading chief,
Mitch Petrick, and its head of interest-rate trading, Roberto
Hoornweg, and has been hiring to revive the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt Spreads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charges related to the firm&#8217;s debt spreads that reduced
fixed-income trading revenue by $3.3 billion in 2009 &#8220;are
largely behind&#8221; it, Gorman said this month in a letter to
shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, 12 analysts have cut their estimate for Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s first-quarter earnings in the past four weeks,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The average adjusted
earnings per-share estimate fell 13.8 cents in that period, the
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Morgan Stanley is trying to become more diversified by
expanding its retail brokerage, but trading revenues remain the
key factor driving their results,&#8221; Staite said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares have dropped 4.8 percent this year,
including a 13 percent decline on April 16 when the fraud
allegations were announced. Morgan Stanley has dropped 1.5
percent in 2010, after gaining gained 85 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the
U.S. fraud case against the firm hinges on the actions of the
employee it placed on paid leave this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about a
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will also be de-registered
from the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm
in London said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By characterizing the case as a dispute involving a single
employee, Goldman Sachs may be taking its first steps to
publically distance itself from Tourre in the case, some lawyers
said. That could reduce bad publicity and ultimately make it
easier for the company to settle the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs may also want to separate itself from Tourre
if it&#8217;s concerned he will cooperate with the SEC or implicate
more senior employees, said Onnig Dombalagian, a professor at
Tulane University Law School in New Orleans and former attorney
fellow at the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank shares in countries such as
China and India, which have outperformed global rivals by about
30 percentage points since the &#8220;Lehman shock,&#8221; may extend
their advantage amid fraud probes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CHART OF THE DAY shows MSCI&#8217;s financials indexes for
emerging-markets in Asia and worldwide starting from Sept. 15,
2008, when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for bankruptcy.
The bottom panel compares the gauges&#8217; weighted estimated
earnings, based on data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman was sued
by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16.
Asia&#8217;s emerging markets as defined by Morgan Stanley for its
indexes include China, India, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Cambodia, Pakistan and Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asian emerging-market financial stocks will continue to
outperform,&#8221; said Khiem Do, Hong Kong-based head of multi-asset
strategy at Baring Asset Management (Asia) Ltd., which oversees
$11 billion. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot less volcanic eruption in Asian
financials compared with Western financials, which face
increasing regulation and sovereign-debt issues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financial crisis in 1997 caused Asian banks to be
&#8220;more prudent,&#8221; allowing them to strengthen balance sheets,
said Do. That crisis, triggered by plunging currencies, forced
Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea to seek International
Monetary Fund aid. Asia&#8217;s emerging-market countries have about
$3.7 trillion in reserves, almost half the global total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Asian banks in general have more healthy balance sheets,
and their loan growth so far has been recovering quite well
versus still-negative loan growth in U.S. and European banks,&#8221;
said Grace Tam, Hong Kong-based vice president of investment
services at JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd., which manages about
$102 billion in Asia-Pacific assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC suit against Goldman linked to collateralized debt
obligations may also trigger stricter scrutiny from European
regulators. The U.K. Financial Services Authority said it will
investigate Goldman Sachs International. The European Union is
also probing the bank&#8217;s role in arranging credit swaps for
Greece that may have masked the country&#8217;s budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;American International Group Inc.,
the financial firm rescued by the U.S., is the lead insurer of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s board against shareholder lawsuits,
said a person with knowledge of the policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG is among firms that sold so-called Side A directors and
officers&#8217; coverage to the New York-based bank, said the person,
who declined to be identified because details of the policy are
private. Goldman Sachs was sued last week by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, which claimed it misled investors in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG, along with insurers including Chubb Corp. and XL
Capital Ltd., sell so-called Side A policies. The coverage kicks
in when shareholders accuse directors of wasting a company&#8217;s
money through failing to perform oversight duties or if the
company becomes insolvent. Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
bank in Wall Street history, said today that first-quarter
earnings almost doubled to $3.46 billion from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Herr, a spokesman for New York-based AIG, declined to
comment. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t
immediately comment. Business Insurance reported that AIG
insured Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. and former News
Corp. President Peter Chernin have discussed creating a
television channel for users of the Xbox video-game console,
said two people with knowledge of the proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel would be exclusive to subscribers of
Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live video-game network, said the people, who
sought anonymity because the talks are private. At an April 12
meeting in Redmond, Washington, Chernin suggested raising Xbox
Live&#8217;s monthly fee by $1 or $2 to add programming aimed at the
online service&#8217;s young, male target audience, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel would be owned jointly by Chernin and
Microsoft, said one of the people, and would offer reruns and
original shows. Chernin&#8217;s proposal underscores Hollywood&#8217;s
efforts to find new ways to convince viewers to pay for films
and TV shows delivered on the Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Peter is talking to lots of people about lots of ideas in
the digital space,&#8221; said Allan Mayer, his publicist. Mayer
wouldn&#8217;t comment on talks with Microsoft. Wayne Hickey, a
spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, hasn&#8217;t
responded to the proposal, both people said. The Redmond-based
company rose 32 cents to $31.36 at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. The shares have gained 2.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chernin also broached the idea for the channel with Conan
O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s representatives before the late-night comedian opted
for a show with Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s TBS, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, PS3 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox, Sony Corp.&#8217;s PlayStation3 and Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii now
provide access to programming including movie rentals from Los
Gatos, California-based Netflix Inc. Microsoft charges $7.99 a
month for multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live. A separate Netflix
subscription with online access to movies costs $8.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PlayStation3, which offers free access to online gaming,
and Microsoft allow users to buy and rent TV shows and film
releases that include &#8220;Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; from Warner Bros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chernin stepped down as New York-based News Corp.&#8217;s second-
in-command on June 30, 2009, taking a film and television
production deal at Fox. He agreed to give the company&#8217;s
Twentieth Television and Twentieth Century Fox movie studio the
first option to buy any projects, according to regulatory
filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senate candidate Alexi
Giannoulias pushed his Republican opponent in Illinois to give
back donations from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. without saying
whether President Barack Obama should return almost $1 million
that bank employees contributed to his White House bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama, a political mentor and basketball buddy to
Giannoulias, received the money from employees and their family
members, making Goldman Sachs second only to the University of
California as his biggest single source for donors in 2007 and
2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Kirk, the congressman competing against Giannoulias
for the seat once held by Obama, ranks sixth for donations from
Goldman employees, the center&#8217;s data shows. The top five are
Democratic Congressman Michael McMahon of New York, Republican
Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, and three other New York
Democrats: Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, Representative Scott
Murphy and Senator Charles Schumer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would be a lot more interesting if Wall Street
banks, joined by Mark Kirk, weren&#8217;t fighting tooth and nail

&lt;p&gt;Two mortgage-linked investments
tied to hedge-fund firm Magnetar Capital LLC had better
disclosures about conflicts of interest than a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. transaction, Securities and Exchange Commission staff
told the bank&#8217;s lawyers in a meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs for fraud on April 16, saying it
improperly failed to disclose that Paulson  Co., a hedge-fund
firm betting that subprime-mortgage defaults would climb, helped
choose securities for a so-called synthetic collateralized debt
obligation with a plan to wager it would collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency told Goldman Sachs at the Sept. 15 meeting that
other deals providing better disclosure than the firm&#8217;s Abacus
2007-AC1 included two CDOs, Auriga and Norma, that were created
for Magnetar, according to a statement to the SEC staff from the
bank&#8217;s lawyers. The Evanston, Illinois-based firm profited in
2007 as defaults on subprime-housing debt soared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At our meeting, the staff suggested that at least some
market participants disclosed the involvement in the portfolio
selection process of third parties that took short positions
with respect to the CDO&#8217;s portfolio and referenced as examples
the Auriga, Norma and Sorrento transactions,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
attorneys wrote in the Sept. 25, 2009, statement obtained by
Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; John Nester, an SEC spokesman in Washington, declined to
comment on the submission, which didn&#8217;t discuss any other
Magnetar deals or say whether the regulatory agency found the
information provided on the CDOs, underwritten by Bank of
America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit, to be sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;No Evidence&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t agree with the SEC&#8217;s assessment of the
disclosures, which it said may not have mentioned Magnetar by
name, according to the statement from the firm&#8217;s attorneys at
New York-based Sullivan  Cromwell LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have indentified no evidence of any such general
market practice,&#8221; the lawyers wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar, which manages $7 billion in assets, told
investors yesterday it didn&#8217;t help banks create CDOs that were
&#8220;built to fail&#8221; on a bet that homeowners with bad credit would
default on their loans. The firm offered limited input on the
creation of CDOs, and made bets that would pay off if they
soured as part of a &#8220;market neutral&#8221; portfolio designed to
profit no matter what happened, Magnetar said in a letter to
clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was no embedded view regarding the direction of
housing prices, the rate of mortgage defaults or the subprime
mortgage market generally,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groups of Stars &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc. and UBS AG are among at least nine banks
that underwrote more than 20 CDOs whose riskiest slices were
bought by Magnetar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Those CDOs, named for constellations including Aquarius and
Carina, totaled at least $32 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Lipin, a spokesman for Magnetar, Alex Samuelson, a
spokesman for Citigroup, and Doug Morris, a spokesman for UBS
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims made last year by Utrecht, Netherlands-based
Rabobank Nederland in a lawsuit against Merrill Lynch over the
Norma CDO, involving actions similar to those in the Goldman
Sachs case, are &#8220;unfounded,&#8221; Bill Halldin, a Merrill Lynch
spokesman, said today in a telephone interview. The suit is
filed in New York State Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Built to Fail&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar&#8217;s 11-page letter came in response to an April 9
article on the Web site of ProPublica, an independent, nonprofit
investigative journalism project based in New York. The article
suggested Magnetar&#8217;s CDOs were &#8220;built to fail,&#8221; according to
the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The facts in our story should allow readers to reach
their own conclusions,&#8221; ProPublica said in a statement to
Bloomberg News. &#8220;We see nothing in the story to correct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, who wasn&#8217;t accused by the SEC of any wrongdoing,
said in a statement that ACA Management LLC chose the assets for
Abacus 2007-AC1, as Goldman Sachs disclosed to investors.
Paulson suggested some individual holdings, according to the
SEC&#8217;s complaint. Goldman Sachs has said the SEC&#8217;s allegations
are unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar said in its letter that it didn&#8217;t select specific
securities to be included in its CDOs. Collateral managers for
the firm&#8217;s CDOs included State Street Corp., Marsh  McLennan
Cos.&#8217;s Putnam Investment Management LLC, GSC Partners and
Harding Advisory LLC, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collateral Selection &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its September statement to the SEC, Goldman Sachs said
it wasn&#8217;t sure which Auriga and Norma disclosures the agency was
referring to, adding that none that it found said anyone other
than the managers of the CDOs played a role in selecting their
collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC &#8220;may have had in mind&#8221; disclosures made in
offering documents for the deals that said buyers of the junior-
most slices &#8220;may enter&#8221; into bets against the holdings of the
CDOs or a &#8220;short&#8221; position that &#8220;hedges certain of the risks
to which&#8221; the security is exposed, the bank said. As a result,
the interests of that buyer &#8220;may not be consistent with those
of&#8221; other investors, according to language quoted in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar bought the riskiest pieces of a series of CDOs,
known as the equity, which it expected to return 20 percent
annually over six to eight years if mortgage defaults remained
low, according to the letter. It also hedged those positions
with bets against its CDOs and others at a cost of less than 6
percent annually, the firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Expression of Confidence&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase of a CDO&#8217;s equity class is usually taken as
&#8220;an expression of confidence in the structure,&#8221; said Thomas Adams, a partner at New York-based law firm Paykin Krieg  Adams
LLP who worked in the CDO groups for two bond insurers. &#8220;It
would definitively have been relevant&#8221; to other investors that
Magnetar wasn&#8217;t simply making a bullish bet, Adams said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Magnetar said its portfolio was designed to make
money no matter what happened to the value of subprime
mortgages, its executives have expressed negative views on the
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Magnetar has been concerned about the excesses in the
subprime-housing market since early 2006,&#8221; David Snyderman,
Magnetar&#8217;s head of global fixed income, said in an interview
with Bloomberg News in March 2007. &#8220;As a result, we have
positioned our structured-credit portfolio such that we are
profiting from the recent volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar was started in late 2005 by Alec Litowitz, who
previously worked at Ken Griffin&#8217;s Citadel Investment Group LLC.
He specialized in trading the stocks of merging companies.
Snyderman also worked at Citadel before joining Magnetar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks rose for a second day
as companies from Harley-Davidson Inc. to Marshall  Ilsley
Corp. posted better-than-estimated results and energy producers
rallied with crude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson and Marshall  Ilsley climbed at least 7.3
percent, while Exxon Mobil Corp. led energy companies to the
biggest gain among 10 industries as oil rebounded from a three-
week low. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell 2.1 percent as concern
surrounding fraud accusations against the bank overshadowed a 91
percent jump in earnings. International Business Machines Corp.
declined 1.9 percent, limiting gains in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, following a drop in service contract signings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 0.8 percent to
1,207.17 at 4 p.m. in New York. The gauge&#8217;s 1.3 percent rally
over the past two days recouped three-quarters of its April 16
when the Securities and Exchange Commission announced its case
against Goldman. The Dow gained 25.01 points, or 0.2 percent, to
11,117.06. Four stocks rose for each falling on U.S. exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Earnings are looking pretty darn good,&#8221; said Jeffrey
Saut, the chief investment strategist at Raymond James 
Associates, which manages $230 billion in St. Petersburg,
Florida. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important to see banks beating
expectations. As financial companies rebuild their balance
sheets, eventually that&#8217;s going to boost lending. Stocks are the
investment vehicle of choice.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 82 percent of SP 500 companies that have reported
first-quarter results beat the average analyst earnings
estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When 79.5
percent topped projections in the fourth quarter of 2009, it was
the biggest proportion in Bloomberg data going back to 1993. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit for companies in the SP 500 increased 35 percent in
the first quarter, according to analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marshall  Ilsley surged 11 percent to $9.31 for the top
gain in the SP 500. Wisconsin&#8217;s largest bank said first-quarter
lending margins improved and overdue loans eased. The first-
quarter net loss of $115.4 million, or 27 cents a share,
compared with analysts&#8217; average estimate for a loss of 40 cents
in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson surged 7.3 percent to $35.17. The biggest
U.S. motorcycle maker reported income from continuing operations
was $68.7 million, or 29 cents a share. Analysts expected
earnings of 24 cents a share, based on estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson led the SP 500 Automobiles  Components
Index to a 3.4 percent gain, the biggest among 24 industry
groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Slips &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 2.1 percent to $159.98 even after net
income almost doubled to $3.46 billion, or $5.59 a share, in the
three months through March as fixed-income trading revenue
climbed to a record. The average estimate of 23 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for $4.14 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s shares plunged 13 percent, the most since January
2009, on April 16 after the SEC sued the bank and one of its
vice presidents for selling collateralized debt obligations tied
to subprime mortgages in early 2007 without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against them. Britain&#8217;s financial regulator also said it
will formally investigate the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said the SEC&#8217;s claims are &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Reputation is an important rating consideration,&#8221; SP
analyst Scott Sprinzen wrote in a report today. &#8220;As a result,
we cannot rule out the possibility that potential reputational
damage ultimately could adversely affect the rating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Buy&#8217; Ratings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegations that the firm deceived its customers have done
little to hurt Wall Street&#8217;s stock recommendations, which are
the most bullish since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. reiterated &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-based
company since April 16. Twenty-two firms advise that clients
purchase Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy shares in the SP 500 rose 1.9 percent as a group,
with 39 of 40 companies advancing. Oil advanced $2 to settle at
$83.45 a barrel, the biggest increase since March 29. European
airspace began to reopen, restoring some demand for jet fuel six
days after a volcanic eruption in Iceland stymied air travel
across the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raised to &#8216;Overweight&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley advised trimming stock holdings of basic-
materials companies and adding to energy shares, citing the
relative value between the two industries and the outlook for
earnings. Global energy stocks were raised to &#8220;overweight&#8221;
while basic-resources shares were downgraded to &#8220;neutral&#8221;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Chevron Corp. each advanced at least 0.9 percent.
Schlumberger Ltd. surged 4 percent to $67.85.  Halliburton Co.
rose 5.5 percent to $33.31. The world&#8217;s second-largest oilfield
contractor had its share-price target raised to $44 from $42 at
FBR Capital Markets Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. rose 1.8 percent to $4.97. UBS AG raised its
share-price forecast for the bank that required a $45 billion
bailout in 2008 to $5 from $3.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zions Bancorporation jumped 7.8 percent to $27.42. The Salt
Lake City-based lender reported a smaller loss as loan write-
offs fell for the third straight period and profit margins
expanded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Snap-On Inc. had the second-biggest gain in the SP 500,
surging 8.5 percent to $48.59. The toolmaker&#8217;s earnings
excluding some items topped analysts&#8217; estimates by 26 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Compelling&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The stock market is entirely focused on corporate
earnings,&#8221; said Art Hogan, chief market analyst at New York-
based Jefferies  Co. &#8220;Each story we get is better than the
last. For people who thought that the good news was already
priced in, it&#8217;s not. The fundamentals and valuations really look
compelling here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the market close, Yahoo! Inc., owner of the second-
most popular U.S. search engine, reported profit that topped
analysts&#8217; estimates, bolstered by a rebounding online
advertising market and the sale of its Zimbra business.
Excluding revenue passed on to partner sites, sales totaled
$1.13 billion last quarter. Analysts had projected $1.17 billion
on average. Yahoo fell 0.6 percent to $18.27 in late trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc. surged 7 percent to $261.73 in extended trading
after reporting a 90 percent gain in second-quarter profit as
demand increased for the iPhone and Macintosh personal computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the SP 500 expiring in June rose 0.2 percent to
1,207.7 at 4:59 p.m. in New York after Apple and Yahoo reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monster Worldwide Inc. jumped 6.4 percent to $16.50. The
online-recruiting company was raised to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral&#8221; at Credit Suisse Group AG, which said improving
labor conditions should lead to strong growth in 2011 and 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, Coca-Cola &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM sank 1.9 percent to $129.69, reducing the Dow average&#8217;s
gain by about 19 points, according to Bloomberg data. The drop
in first-quarter service-contract signings at the world&#8217;s
largest computer-services company suggests that corporate
customers are delaying some technology spending following the
economic slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. dropped 1.5 percent to $54.47. The world&#8217;s
largest soft-drink maker said first-quarter sales by drink
volume in North America declined 2 percent even as profit rose
20 percent, bolstered by sales in Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AK Steel Holding Corp. had the biggest decline in the SP
500, falling 7.1 percent to $19.35. The company said there is
&#8220;substantial uncertainty&#8221; in global iron-ore pricing in 2010
that may negatively affect earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Evening Star&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Northern Trust Corp. fell 5.1 percent to $55.37. The third-
largest independent custody bank reported first-quarter profit
excluding some items of 64 cents a share, 11 percent less than
the average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGIC Investment Corp. plunged 12 percent to $11.06 for its
biggest drop since October. The biggest U.S. mortgage insurer
posted an 11th straight quarterly loss and said it will sell $1
billion in stock and notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yearlong rally in U.S. stocks may pause after the SP
500 generated an &#8220;evening star&#8221; pattern that signals a bearish
trend, according to Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s technical analyst
Mary Ann Bartels. The New York-based analyst used a Japanese
charting technique known as candlestick and found that the U.S.
benchmark formed the bearish reversal pattern toward the end of
last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 14, the SP 500 rose to the highest level since
September 2008 with the closing price 11.96 points above the
opening, the biggest gap since March 5. On the next day, the
index opened above the previous close, then fell and closed less
than 0.1 percent higher. The bearish trend continued into the
third day, when the SP 500 opened below the previous close and
ended the day down 1.6 percent, the biggest loss since Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a potential evening star top pattern,&#8221; Bartels,
ranked second among analysts who study price charts in
Institutional Investor magazine&#8217;s most recent survey, wrote in a
note to clients yesterday. &#8220;The uptrend line on the SP 500
from the February low is under pressure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allegations that Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. deceived its customers have done little to hurt Wall
Street&#8217;s stock recommendation, the most bullish since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, UBS AG, Citigroup Inc. and Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co. reiterated &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings on the New York-based
company since April 16, when the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed a fraud suit that has sent the shares down 11
percent. Twenty-two firms advise that clients purchase Goldman
Sachs, which today reported first-quarter profit excluding some
items that beat the average analyst estimate by 35 percent. One,
Oppenheimer  Co., downgraded the stock since the claims were
announced, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts are speculating Goldman Sachs will preserve its
reputation and benefit from an expanding economy that helped
lift its shares 208 percent since November 2008. The stock
climbed 1.6 percent yesterday after two people with knowledge of
the vote said the SEC split 3-2 along party lines to approve the
enforcement action, before falling 2.1 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sell any,&#8221; said Stephen Lieber, chief
investment officer of Alpine Woods Capital Investors LLC, which
manages more than $7 billion, including Goldman Sachs shares,
from Purchase, New York. &#8220;Do we have sufficient information to
provide an overall take at this point? No. The underlying
business of Goldman Sachs remains a suitable investment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Illinois, New Jersey and Texas are
among municipal-bond issuers sticking with Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to underwrite pending debt sales after the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission charged the firm with fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re innocent until proven guilty,&#8221; said James Fuller,
chief financial officer of Georgia&#8217;s Municipal Electric
Authority in Atlanta, which borrowed $2.5 billion in early March
using banks led by Goldman. &#8220;People have to have their day in
court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the fifth-largest senior underwriter of
municipal debt last year, handling about $34 billion, according
to data compiled by Thomson Reuters. It was accused by the SEC
on April 16 of creating and selling collateralized debt
obligations tied to subprime mortgages in 2007 without
disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities. It also didn&#8217;t say that Paulson bet
against the securities, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman will remain a co-senior manager on an $851 million
fixed-rate issue for New Jersey&#8217;s Economic Development Authority
scheduled for as soon as this week, said Andrew Pratt, a
spokesman in Trenton, New Jersey, for Treasurer Andrew Eristoff,
a Republican. Goldman is co-senior manager with New York-based
JPMorgan Chase  Co., Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch  Co. will manage the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until it actually is fined or loses its lawsuit, it would
be very, very premature to eliminate them from a bond
transaction,&#8221; Pratt said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois Sale Coming &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Illinois plans to keep Goldman as an underwriter for coming
bond sales, John Sinsheimer, director of capital markets, said
in an interview from Chicago. So will the North Texas Tollway
Authority on a deal coming in May, Sherita Coffelt, a
spokeswoman based in Plano, Texas, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. The firm said in
a statement that the SEC&#8217;s allegations were &#8220;completely
unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs today reiterated its denial that it misled
investors and reported that net income rose 91 percent in the
first quarter to $3.46 billion, beating analyst estimates. The
shares slid $3.34, or 2.1 percent, to $159.98 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. They have declined 5.2
percent since Dec. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgia&#8217;s Fuller was among officials saying they would take
a closer look at Goldman Sachs if it were to lose the SEC case
or be found to have committed wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unacceptable&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the allegations &#8220;are substantiated, they&#8217;re
unacceptable,&#8221; and could prompt the state to review its
relationship with the firm, said Washington State Treasurer
James McIntire. Goldman was lead underwriter on $503.4 million
of Build America Bonds for the state in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have concerns about the lawsuit,&#8221; McIntire, a
Democrat, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Transparency is an
important issue. It affects the whole marketplace. We expect our
underwriter to be a partner, not an adversary.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, has made $55.7 million of fees from $36.4
billion of Build America Bonds sales, about a third of what it
earned from its municipal business, the company said in a March
1 response to queries from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an
Iowa Republican. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Review &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said his
office has begun a preliminary review for a possible state
investigation of Goldman related to the SEC&#8217;s action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC&#8217;s allegations read like a Sopranos episode,&#8221;
Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in an April 16 statement, referring
to a crime family at the center of a U.S. television series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Treasurer Bill Lockyer, a Democrat, is also
looking into whether Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street
underwriters promoted derivative trades to clients that would
have enabled them to bet against the state. The state is
reviewing the responses to questions sent to the firm last
month, said spokesman Tom Dresslar, based in Sacramento. He
declined say what steps California may take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have questions about how Goldman Sachs and other big
banks have been treating their clients -- the taxpayers of the
state of California,&#8221; said Dresslar. &#8220;The basic question is:
The taxpayers of this state are paying you guys hundreds of
millions of dollars to sell their bonds; to what extent are you
either betting against those bonds or facilitating bets against
those bonds?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stocks rose, snapping a two-day
drop for the MSCI World Index, and oil rebounded as improving
corporate earnings boosted confidence in the global recovery.
Canada&#8217;s dollar rallied as policy makers said faster-than-
estimated economic growth with spur interest-rate increases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index climbed for the eighth time
in nine days, rising 0.8 percent at 4 p.m. in New York. The
Stoxx Europe 600 Index surged 1.4 percent, the most in almost
three weeks. Canada&#8217;s dollar rose against all 16 major
counterparts, strengthening beyond parity against the dollar.
Oil advanced from a three-week low as European airspace began to
reopen after volcanic ash halted flights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies from Harley-Davidson Inc. to Marshall  Ilsley
Corp. surged today after reporting higher-than-estimated
earnings, joining 82 percent of the SP 500 companies that
topped forecasts after releasing results so far in the first-
quarter reporting season. In Germany, the ZEW Center for
European Economic Research said its index of investor and
analyst expectations increased to 53 from 44.5 in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tide of rising earnings and improving economy is just
more important than some of the late distractions,&#8221; said David
Kelly, who helps oversee $445 billion as chief market strategist
for JPMorgan Funds in New York. &#8220;Germany is the most important
player within Europe. If you see a rebound in German confidence,
that makes you feel better about the European recovery and that
is positive for U.S. companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500&#8217;s 1.3 percent rally so far this week has
recovered about three-fourths of its 1.6 percent slide on April
16 when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. for fraud related to collateralized debt
obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs slumped 13 percent on April 16, and fell 2.1
percent today even after earnings almost doubled on record
fixed-income trading revenue. Britain&#8217;s financial regulator said
it will formally investigate the firm and SP said Goldman&#8217;s
credit rating may be lowered because of &#8220;reputational damage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has denied the SEC&#8217;s accusations and Co-
General Counsel Greg Palm told analysts on a conference call
today that the firm didn&#8217;t intentionally mislead anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harley-Davidson jumped 7.3 percent on better-than-estimated
profit as the motorcycle maker&#8217;s financial-services unit
returned to profitability. Marshall  Ilsley, Wisconsin&#8217;s
largest bank, rallied 11 percent for the top gain in the SP 500
after first-quarter lending margins improved and overdue loans
eased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Automakers Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI World Index of 23 developed nations&#8217; stocks rose
0.9 percent. Auto-related shares were the biggest gainers in
Europe, led by Daimler AG, the world&#8217;s second-biggest maker of
luxury vehicles, which surged 7.4 percent in Frankfurt after
lifting its profit forecasts. SABMiller Plc rose 4.5 percent in
London after reporting an unexpected increase in lager sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Lufthansa AG rose 1.8 percent in Frankfurt and
British Airways Plc climbed 1 percent in London as European
airspace that had been closed by the volcanic eruption in
Iceland started to reopen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.3 percent to rebound
from yesterday&#8217;s 2.1 percent drop, its biggest slump since Feb.
19. Financial shares were the biggest contributors to the
gauge&#8217;s advance as Morgan Stanley upgraded Japan&#8217;s banks. Isuzu
Motors Ltd. rose 4.6 percent in Tokyo after reporting better-
than-expected full-year profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging Markets, Commodities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Emerging Markets Index rebounded from its biggest
decline in more than two months, climbing 1.2 percent after
yesterday&#8217;s 2 percent slide. Thailand&#8217;s SET Index surged 5.4
percent, the most since January 2009, as anti-government
protesters canceled a planned march after failing to attract
large crowds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil for May delivery advanced 2.5 percent to $83.45 a
barrel in New York trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for delivery in July rose 0.5 percent to $3.5355 a
pound in New York. Lead, tin, zinc and nickel climbed at least
2.1 percent in London. Gold futures snapped a two-day slump,
with contracts on the precious metal for June delivery advancing
0.3 percent to $1,139.20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada led gains against the dollar, rising 1.5 percent to
just over $1. Australia&#8217;s dollar and the South Africa rand
strengthened 0.8 percent against the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two-year Treasury note&#8217;s yield rose 2 basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 1.01 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen dropped 0.8 percent against the dollar and lost 0.4
percent versus the euro on demand for higher-yielding assets.
The Australian dollar appreciated against 15 of 16 of its most-
traded peers after minutes of the central bank&#8217;s April 6 meeting
showed policy makers expressed concern that a mining boom will
stoke inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek-German Spread &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Declines in Greek bonds drove the yield premium that
investors demand to hold the nation&#8217;s 10-year debt instead of
benchmark German bunds to 478 basis points, the most since
Bloomberg began calculating the data in 1998, amid concern the
nation will have to tap a European Union-brokered bailout
package to avoid a default. Germany is Europe&#8217;s largest economy
and a wider yield spread compared with its bonds signifies
decreasing confidence in Greek debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on Greece&#8217;s 10-year debt surged 27 basis points to
7.88 percent. Greece sold 1.95 billion euros ($2.6 billion) of
3.65 percent three-month bills today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K bonds fell as a report showed inflation accelerated
last month to above the Bank of England&#8217;s 3 percent limit,
pushing 10-year yields up 3 basis points to 4.01 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps tied to MGIC Investment Corp. led a
decline among mortgage insurers after the company posted a
narrower quarterly loss and said it will sell $1 billion in
stock and notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps tied to Milwaukee-based MGIC, the largest U.S.
mortgage insurer, fell 6.1 percentage points to 4.4 percent
upfront, according to CMA DataVision. The Markit CDX North
America High Yield Index, which rises as the cost of protection
falls, gained 0.6 percentage point to 100.9 percent of face
value as of 11:02 a.m. in New York, according to Markit Group
Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ford Motor Co., National
Semiconductor Corp. and Macy&#8217;s Inc. are among companies planning
to maintain relationships with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. after
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged the firm
with fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have had a long relationship with Goldman Sachs and
expect it to continue,&#8221; said Ford spokesman Mark Truby,
declining to comment further. Goldman Sachs took Ford public in
1956 and John Thornton, a former Goldman Sachs executive, sits
on Ford&#8217;s board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused the New-York based firm on April 16 of
creating and selling collateralized debt obligations tied to
subprime mortgages in 2007 without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped choose the underlying securities. It also
didn&#8217;t say that Paulson bet against the securities, the SEC
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have spent an enormous amount of time talking to our
clients,&#8221; David Viniar, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s chief financial
officer, told reporters on a conference call today. &#8220;We found
that largely our clients are supportive of us and the most
important thing is to perform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rite Aid Corp., based in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, also
doesn&#8217;t plan to amend its relationship with Goldman Sachs,
spokeswoman Karen Rugen said in an e-mail. Goldman Sachs is a
participant in the company&#8217;s senior credit facility, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Business as Usual&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything&#8217;s business as usual with Goldman,&#8221; said LuAnn
Jenkins, a spokeswoman for National Semiconductor, based in
Santa Clara, California. She declined to comment on past and
future relationships with Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s is happy with the advisory services Goldman provides
the Cincinnati-based department-store chain and doesn&#8217;t plan any
changes, Jim Sluzewski, a spokesman for Macy&#8217;s Inc., said in an
e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The argument that Goldman takes positions in opposition
to its clients has always been there, yet people continue to do
business with Goldman Sachs,&#8221; said Richard Bove, an analyst at
Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida, in an interview today with
Bloomberg Television. &#8220;The reason is they aren&#8217;t playing the
clients, they are benefiting the clients. There is no firm that
can step in and replace them.&#8221; Bove recommends buying shares of
Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Government &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. companies were joined today by the U.K. government,
which said that it would keep employing the company two days
after Prime Minister Gordon Brown decried the &#8220;moral
bankruptcy&#8221; evident in the SEC&#8217;s suit against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can stop doing business with a firm
because an individual is accused of doing something,&#8221;
Chancellor of the Exchequer Alistair Darling said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s Financial Services Authority said in a statement
today that it will begin a formal probe into Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, said first-quarter earnings jumped 91 percent to
$3.46 billion, or $5.59 a share, surpassing analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s stock, which dropped 13 percent on April 16 after
the SEC filed its case, fell $3.34, or 2.1 percent, to $159.98
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. fell the most since February in New York trading after
reporting a drop in service signings, signaling corporate
spending on larger technology projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services signings, which account for more than half of
total sales, fell about 2 percent to $12.3 billion in the first
quarter, IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider,
said yesterday. New contracts for application-management, which
help clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM still hasn&#8217;t signaled to shareholders that profit can
rise based on sales growth rather than steps like costs cutting
and stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at
Broadpoint AmTech in San Francisco. Investors are seeking faster
revenue growth as the economy begins to recover, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM is simply not that attractive of a growth story right
now,&#8221; said Marshall, who rates the shares &#8220;neutral&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own them. &#8220;Really good financial management from an
earnings perspective. At the end of the day, not much from a
revenue perspective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said in
its earnings statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, fell $2.54, or 1.9 percent,
to $129.69 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading, its steepest drop since Feb. 4. It is little changed
this year, compared with an 8.3 percent advance in the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate Spending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology
projects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent
gain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could
pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting
contracts are a leading indicator for other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow thing to turn IT services,&#8221; said Miedler,
who recommends buying IBM shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;Those
transformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are
more open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after
dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from
Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support
to that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales
that topped estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last
quarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in
application-management signings, services contracts would have
risen 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s
slower growth than the fourth quarter&#8217;s 9 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-Quarter Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency
basis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth
in services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second
quarter of last year declined 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said profit this year will be at least $11.20 a share,
up from a previous forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts
predicted $11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, once the largest computer maker, spent the past decade
selling off hardware businesses and investing in its higher-
margin software and services units, which now make up more than
80 percent of total revenue. That&#8217;s helped it boost gross profit
margins, the percentage of sales left after production costs,
for 10 quarters on a year-over-year basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates IBM &#8220;outperform&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own shares. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators, reported that net income
almost doubled in the first quarter and said it didn&#8217;t mislead
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This all seems to be at root about whether someone
intentionally misled someone, and that&#8217;s not something we would
approve of or sanction,&#8221; Goldman Sachs Co-General Counsel Greg
Palm told analysts on a conference call today. He spoke after
the firm said earnings jumped 91 percent to $3.46 billion, or
$5.59 a share, surpassing analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein, is fending off regulatory claims while cementing its
position as the most profitable investment bank in Wall Street
history. The Securities and Exchange Commission accused the firm
of failing to tell investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet
against the CDO, helped select the underlying assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had &#8220;no incentive&#8221; for the deal to fail,
and lost more than $100 million on the transaction, Palm said.
The firm was &#8220;somewhat surprised&#8221; when the SEC filed its suit
on April 16, as &#8220;no one had told us in advance,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 55, didn&#8217;t refer specifically to the suit today,
saying in a statement announcing earnings that &#8220;in light of
recent events involving the firm, we appreciate the support of
our clients and shareholders, and the dedication and commitment
of our people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc. failed to ensure proper
monitoring of patients and their side effects in a clinical
trial, U.S. regulators said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration posted a warning letter on
its Web site today outlining &#8220;significant violations&#8221;
discovered during an inspection of a Pfizer clinical trial site
from May 4 to June 3. The letter, dated April 9, was redacted to
remove the name of the medicine and the study. Pfizer
spokeswoman Kristen Neese said the study involved tests of the
company&#8217;s bipolar disorder treatment Geodon for use in children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Pfizer was warned by the agency in 2005 over lack of
study monitoring that led to widespread overdoses, follow-up
inspections in 2006 and 2007 also found dosing errors, the FDA
said in the documents. The agency ordered the New York-based
drugmaker to respond within 15 days with a plan to ensure that
its studies comply with federal regulations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer has communicated with the FDA about our conduct of
clinical trials and, over the next two weeks, will provide an
outline of new and existing processes for preventing similar
issues with Pfizer clinical trials in the future,&#8221; Neese said
in an e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer fell 3 cents to $16.76 at 4:05 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have declined 7.9
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geodon&#8217;s Heart Impact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geodon prolongs the heart&#8217;s electrical cycle. Short-term
studies suggest children are sensitive to these changes in the
heart and may be more susceptible to potentially deadly
arrhythmias, according to an FDA staff review. Outside advisers
to the agency backed pediatric use in June, with most members
calling for more testing to evaluate the risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&#8217;s Abilify and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s
Risperdal, now generic, were cleared for pediatric use in 2007.
Doctors treating children sometimes prescribe other
antipsychotics that aren&#8217;t approved for pediatric use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children ages 7 to 17 accounted for 11 percent of Geodon
use in 2008, according to data posted on the FDA&#8217;s Web site
before the advisory panel meeting. While doctors are free to
prescribe the drug for this unapproved use, Pfizer isn&#8217;t
permitted by the FDA to promote the medicine to treat children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geodon is approved for adults with schizophrenia and manic
episodes of bipolar disorder. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, said first-quarter profit rose 20 percent,
bolstered by sales in Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income increased to $1.61 billion, or 69 cents share,
in the quarter ended April 2 from $1.35 billion, or 58 cents, a
year earlier, the company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 5 percent to $7.53 billion, the company said.
Eight analysts predicted $7.72 billion, on average. Global sales
by drink volume grew 3 percent, helped by a 4 percent increase
in Latin America. Sales by drink volume in North America
declined 2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola is seeking to boost revenue and volume as
consumers recover from a global recession. Sales have bounced
back faster in emerging markets than in larger markets including
the U.S., Coca-Cola said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the Atlanta-based company fell 85 cents to $54.47
at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock has dropped 4.4 percent this year, while Purchase, New
York-based PepsiCo Inc. gained 8.4 percent and the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index rose 8.3 percent. PepsiCo plans to announce
first-quarter earnings April 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings excluding some items totaled 80 cents a share,
Coca-Cola said. Analysts predicted 74 cents, the average of 12
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also named Steve Cahillane, president of Coca-
Cola Enterprises Inc.&#8217;s North America unit, to run a new
bottling and foodservice division when it combines with Coca-
Cola later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cahillane, who joined Coca-Cola Enterprises in 2007, will
become president and chief executive officer of Coca-Cola
Refreshments Inc. The bottling unit will include Minute Maid
juices and supply chain operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola expects to complete the purchase of CCE in the
fourth quarter. Coca-Cola North America President Sandy Douglas
will retain that role. Both will report to Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Muhtar Kent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary
is among at least three companies being investigated as part of
a U.S. Justice Department antitrust probe of bidding at
municipal tax-lien auctions in New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Xspand unit and Vienna, Virginia-based Mooring
Tax Asset Group received grand jury subpoenas last year,
according to an August prospectus for New York City tax-lien
bonds that are serviced by the firms. Two units of Royal Bank
America were subpoenaed, its parent, Royal Bancshares of
Pennsylvania Inc. said in a March 2009 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey municipalities auction about $100 million a year
in tax debts on commercial and residential property to
investors, said Vincent Belluscio, executive director of the
state tax collectors and treasurers association. Antitrust
officials are probing whether investors colluded to limit
competition on sales to win a higher return, he said. In New
Jersey, the liens can carry annual interest of as much as 18
percent. The auctions are designed so that investors bid down
the interest rate they&#8217;re willing to accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The problem is these investors have a tendency to meet in
the hallway before a sale and divvy up the list,&#8221; Belluscio
said. &#8220;They say, &#8216;We&#8217;ll buy these properties, and you buy
those.&#8217; And the interest rate holds at 18 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belluscio said his information comes from a tax collector
who was visited by a federal investigator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lien Buyers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities and towns in New Jersey and 27 other states sell tax
debts to investors to raise cash and help plug budget deficits.
Some of the debts are packaged into bonds and sold. Tax-lien
buyers also get the right to collect penalties imposed on
delinquent taxpayers by governments, and have first priority to
take possession of properties when the owners don&#8217;t pay their
taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About $5 billion of property-tax delinquencies are sold
each year, Xspand officials told the Unified Government
Commission of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas,
according to a transcript of the Nov. 25 meeting on the
municipality&#8217;s Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Florida, $1.8 billion of the liens were sold last year,
making it the largest property-debt auction market in the U.S.,
according to Plantation, Florida-based RealAuction.com, which
conducts online tax sales in counties throughout the state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expensive Cost &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s concerned,&#8221; said Adam D. Greenberg, managing
partner of law firm Honig  Greenberg in Cherry Hill, New
Jersey, whose clients include tax-lien investors. &#8220;Even if
you&#8217;re innocent, just responding to an investigation is
expensive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg said he knows of other investors who received
subpoenas, though he declined to identify them or say if they
are clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justin G. Perras, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to
comment, as did Mark Sanders, a spokesman for Narbeth,
Pennsylvania-based Royal Bank, whose Crusader Servicing Corp.
and Royal Tax Lien Services LLC units are subjects of the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Anybody who is a significant buyer in New Jersey has been
subpoenaed,&#8221; said John M. Jacquemin, president and founder of
Mooring Financial Corp., which has managed and serviced more
than $1 billion in delinquent tax liens since starting Mooring
Tax Asset Group in 1997. &#8220;We certainly were not involved with
any collusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Training to Prevent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mooring for at least eight years has trained its bidders on
the company policy against anti-competitive behavior and
requires them to sign statements confirming that they understand
the expectations, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alisa Finelli, a spokeswoman for the Justice Department in
Washington, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xspand, which was founded by former New Jersey Governor
James Florio in 2000, was acquired by Bear Stearns Cos. six
years later. Also known as Plymouth Park Tax Services, it became
part of JPMorgan when the New York-based bank took over Bear
Stearns in 2008 to prevent a collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xspand, based in Whippany, New Jersey, effectively stopped
participating in open-outcry auctions about nine months ago, a
person familiar with the decision said. It had become the
largest tax-lien investor in the U.S., buying $2 billion of
public debt across the country since 2008, The New York Times
reported Aug. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company continues to service tax liens and bid on them
in Internet auctions and bulk sales by municipalities, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because of the
investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florio Unaware &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florio, who sold his Xspand interest in 2006, said he
wasn&#8217;t aware of the Justice Department investigation. Tax-lien
sales were heated when he ran the company, he said in an April
16 telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was very, very competitive,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul V. Scura, who founded Xspand with Florio and left when
Bear Stearns took it over, said Xspand employees got thorough
training on avoiding anticompetitive behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine any of the employees of Xspand doing that
given how they&#8217;ve been sensitized to the importance of this
issue,&#8221; Scura said in an April 19 telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last June, Harvey M. Nusbaum and Jack W. Stollof were
indicted in federal court in Maryland for conspiring to rig tax-
lien bids at auctions in the state. Nusbaum and Stollof and
others &#8220;agreed among themselves which of them would bid on
specific tax liens or groups of tax liens, and agreed upon
specific prices to be bid in certain auctions,&#8221; according to a
June 16 statement by the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plea Agreement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nusbaum entered a plea agreement and Stollof pleaded guilty
early this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With so many homeowners struggling these days, it is more
important than ever that all aspects of real estate
transactions, including tax-lien auctions, remain competitive
and free from collusion,&#8221; Scott D. Hammond, deputy assistant
U.S. attorney general for criminal enforcement of the
department&#8217;s antitrust division, said in a prepared statement
last June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Target Corp., the second-largest
U.S. discount chain, will stop issuing Visa Inc. credit cards to
new applicants and spur use of its own plastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Guests tend to spend more at Target when issued a Target
Credit Card instead of a Target Visa,&#8221; the Minneapolis-based
company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision may pull revenue from San Francisco-based
Visa, the world&#8217;s biggest payments network. Last month, Macy&#8217;s
Inc. said American Express Co., based in New York, would replace
Visa as the processor for Macy&#8217;s and Bloomingdale&#8217;s credit
cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New qualified applicants will receive the proprietary
Target Credit Card, a product that may be used only at Target
stores and Target.com, the retailer said. Existing Target Visa
cardholders will not be affected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Target is the third-biggest issuer of Visa credit cards,
with 23.9 million cards outstanding, and the 15th-biggest issuer
overall by purchases, according to the Nilson Report, an
industry newsletter based in Carpinteria, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any drag on Visa&#8217;s profit will be limited as Target credit
cards accounted for about 1 percent of payments Visa processed
in the U.S. last year, according to analysts, including Tien-
tsin Huang at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. probably
had more than just one junior executive handling the transaction
that triggered a federal fraud lawsuit, said Byron Georgiou, a
member of the U.S. panel investigating the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s hard to imagine that there wasn&#8217;t some supervision
of a 27-year-old, at that time, trader structuring a billion-
dollar transaction on which Goldman made a $15 million fee,&#8221;
Georgiou, who serves on the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission,
said in a Bloomberg Television interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
April 16, alleging that the firm deceived investors in the 2007
creation and sale of a collateralized debt obligation known as
Abacus. Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick weak securities for the CDO and then bet against
the vehicle, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, a French trader who worked on the deal for
Goldman Sachs, was the only individual named in the lawsuit.
He&#8217;s been placed on paid leave, according to the firm, which
denied wrongdoing and vowed to fight the SEC case, which it
called &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; The New York-
based firm is the most profitable in Wall Street history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s lawsuit raises questions about whether other
banks that sold CDOs engaged in similar practices and how much
detail executives knew about the deals, Georgiou said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured Products &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, now 31, was a vice president on the structured
product correlation trading desk in New York when he packaged
mortgage bonds he knew were toxic into securities and then sold
them to unwitting clients, the SEC claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Goldman Sachs &#8220;had evidence that someone here was
trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s not something we&#8217;d condone at
all and we&#8217;d be the first to take action,&#8221; Greg Palm, the
firm&#8217;s co-general counsel, told reporters today on a conference
call with reporters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre has been placed on paid leave until an unspecified
date, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said today. Pamela Chepiga,
Tourre&#8217;s lawyer at Allen  Overy LLP in New York, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-ranking executives are accountable for their firms&#8217;
risk management, Georgiou said. The FCIC earlier this month
questioned former top Citigroup Inc. officials about guarantees
used by their subordinates to spur sales of mortgage-backed debt
that ended up costing the bank $14 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Chief Executive Officer Charles O. &#8220;Chuck&#8221; Prince
and Executive Committee Chairman Robert Rubin testified before
the commission that they didn&#8217;t know about the risks posed by
the instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nobody really expects the heads of these institutions to
know about each and every trade, but they&#8217;re responsible for the
risk-taking practices of their institutions,&#8221; Georgiou said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCIC, led by former California Treasurer Phil
Angelides, has six members appointed by Democrats and four by
Republicans and has power to subpoena witnesses and documents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The London units of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., the most profitable firm in Wall Street history,
will be formally investigated by Britain&#8217;s financial regulator
after U.S. authorities sued the bank for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority said in a statement today
that it will begin a formal probe after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. The FSA said
yesterday it was reviewing whether a full investigation into the
New York-based bank was warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on the agency, which he
created in 1997, to investigate Goldman Sachs, accusing
employees of the bank of &#8220;moral bankruptcy.&#8221; The bank may be
fined or individuals banned if the FSA finds a breach of its
rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president named in the SEC case,
Fabrice Tourre, works at the bank&#8217;s London office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.K. entity, Goldman Sachs International, is not
mentioned in the SEC complaint, but the FSA&#8217;s latest move means
that this part of Goldman Sachs is now under the spotlight
too,&#8221; said Clive Cunningham, a regulatory lawyer at Taylor
Wessing LLP who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &#8220;The question is
whether Goldman Sachs International was involved and, if so, did
it breach any U.K. regulatory rules.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s key stock index
advanced, snapping two days of declines, as metal and oil prices
rallied and JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its recommendation on
the country&#8217;s stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SABMiller Plc led gains after saying fourth-quarter lager
volumes unexpectedly rose. Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. and
Anglo American Plc climbed as platinum and copper increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index rose 281.44, or 1
percent, to 29,012.46, the biggest gain in almost a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rise is being driven by the outlook for commodity
prices and growth,&#8221; said David Shapiro, who heads Sasfin
Holdings Ltd.&#8217;s securities unit in Johannesburg. &#8220;The All Share
may climb to 33,000 within the next month.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African equities were raised to &#8220;overweight&#8221; from
&#8220;neutral&#8221; by JPMorgan, which cited a strong 2010 earnings
recovery, &#8220;attractive valuations&#8221; and an unexpected 50 basis-
point reduction in the country&#8217;s interest rate on March 25,
emerging-market strategists led by Adrian Mowat wrote in a
report to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SABMiller, the maker of the Grolsch and Peroni beer brands,
rallied 4 percent to 225.60 rand, the biggest intraday gain in
five months. The brewer said sales rose as Colombia&#8217;s economic
recovery spurred consumption and a marketing push lifted sales
in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd., the world&#8217;s second-largest
platinum producer, gained 3.6 percent to 213.50 rand, paring
yesterday&#8217;s 2.7 percent retreat. Anglo American increased 0.9
percent, to 327.40 rand. Platinum rallied as much as 1.7 percent
to $1,722.75 an ounce, while copper advanced from a three-week
low in London as concern about increased scrutiny on banks eased
after people familiar with the matter said regulators were split
on suing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit markets in Europe rallied
the most this year after German investor confidence rose and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s profit beat estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index
of 50 companies with mostly junk ratings fell 19 basis points to
409 as of 5:10 p.m. in London, according to Markit Group Ltd.
The drop was the biggest since Dec. 31, according to CMA
DataVision, and signalled improving perceptions of credit
quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, said net income rose 91 percent to $3.46
billion, or $5.59 per share, in the first quarter, beating the
average estimate of $4.14 for 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
German investor confidence jumped for the first time in seven
months in April as falling unemployment and a weaker euro
improved the economic outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German confidence figure was a &#8220;strong number,&#8221; said
Lucette Yvernault, who helps oversee the equivalent of about 7
billion euros as a fixed-income fund manager at Schroders
Investment Management Ltd. in London. &#8220;It&#8217;s very encouraging
for the upcoming performance of European companies and credit
investment as confidence is picking up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ZEW Center for European Economic Research in Mannheim,
Germany said its index of investor and analyst expectations
increased to 53 in April from 44.5 in March. Economists
predicted a gain to 45.1, according to the median of 36
forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. The report aims to predict
developments six months ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings declined 3.6 basis points to 80.5,
Markit prices show. A basis point on a credit-default swap
contract protecting 10 million euros ($13.5 million) of debt
from default for five years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value in exchange
for the underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a
company fail to adhere to its debt agreements. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rand gained the most in three
weeks as a split among U.S. regulators on a Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. lawsuit and signs of economic recovery boosted purchases of
riskier assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa&#8217;s currency strengthened for the first time in
four days, appreciating as much as 1.1 percent to 7.3986 per
dollar and trading 0.8 percent stronger at 7.4204 by 4:46 p.m.
in Johannesburg, from a close of 7.4810 yesterday. The rand was
today&#8217;s best performer among emerging-market currencies versus
the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Bloomberg News report said the Securities and Exchange
Commission voted 3-2 to sue Goldman Sachs for fraud. The SEC on
April 16 accused Goldman Sachs of creating and selling
collateralized debt obligations in 2007 tied to subprime
mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co.
helped pick the underlying securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After it was reported that the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s decision to charge Goldman Sachs hadn&#8217;t been
unanimous, the market rebounded swiftly,&#8221; Michael Keenan, a
currency strategist at Johannesburg-based Standard Bank Group
Ltd., wrote in a client note today. &#8220;The gradual normalization
of risk appetite could see the rand remain at the lower end of
the 7.40 to 7.50 per dollar trading range.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans
said in a televised interview late yesterday that while the U.S.
recession is &#8220;definitely over&#8221; a low interest-rate policy is
&#8220;very important&#8221; for now. The comments followed a report that
the index of U.S. leading indicators rose 1.4 percent in March,
the most in 10 months, a sign the world&#8217;s biggest economy will
grow in the second half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government bonds rose, reducing the yield on South Africa&#8217;s
benchmark 13.5 percent security due September 2015 by five basis
points to 7.75 percent. The bond&#8217;s price advanced 23 cents to
124.93 rand, the highest close since Sept. 22, 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Market participants are still pricing in the probability
of another cut in rates, or at least that rates will remain
lower for longer,&#8221; said Victor Mphaphuli, a portfolio manager
at Stanlib Asset Management in Johannesburg. &#8220;The rand&#8217;s
strength combined with some relatively weak real economic data
makes for a more benign inflation outlook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rand has rallied 27 percent since the start of last
year, helping to ease price growth by reducing the cost of
imports such as oil. Inflation in South Africa eased to a three-
year low of 5.7 percent in February, falling into the central
bank&#8217;s 3 to 6 percent target range for the first time in three
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forward-rate agreements showed that contracts for three-
month cash due one month from now rose 2.5 basis points to 6.44
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is
facing a fraud suit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission over its sale of a mortgage-linked security in 2007,
tried to get rid of its portion of the deal, a lawyer for the
firm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I believe we did attempt to see if there was any other
interest on the other side of the transaction,&#8221; Greg Palm,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said today on a conference
call with reporters when asked if the New York-based firm had
tried to sell its stake in the &#8220;super-senior&#8221; debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it lost more than $100 million on the
Abacus 2007-AC1 collateralized debt obligation that is at the
center of the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit, including $83 million related to
its piece of the super-senior debt. The regulator says the firm
failed to explain to buyers of the CDO that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., which planned to bet on the CDO failing, had helped select
the assets underlying the security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, on a conference call with analysts, Palm
said the company&#8217;s decision to own some of the CDO showed it had
confidence in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have taken on this risk if we believed there
was something wrong in this transaction, we wouldn&#8217;t have put
our skin in the game in that way,&#8221; Palm said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also on today&#8217;s call with reporters, Palm said the firm and
its representatives haven&#8217;t had discussions with the Department
of Justice on the case involved in the SEC matter or on any
similar issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had no discussions with the DOJ,&#8221; Palm said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., being
sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over claims
that it deceived investors about one of its financial products,
tried to fend off regulators last fall by arguing it had a duty
to keep the information confidential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company failed to disclose that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., run by billionaire John Paulson, helped pick the underlying
securities in a collateralized debt obligation and then bet
against them, the SEC said in a lawsuit filed April 16. After
being told in July 2009 that the SEC planned to bring a
complaint, New York-based Goldman Sachs argued it had been
compelled to keep Paulson&#8217;s role secret. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s &#8220;proposed theory ignores the fact that, as a
broker-dealer acting as an intermediary on behalf of a client,
Goldman Sachs had a duty to keep information concerning its
client&#8217;s (Paulson&#8217;s) trades, positions and trading strategy
confidential,&#8221; the company said in a Sept. 10, 2009, document
addressed to the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable company in Wall Street
history, created and sold CDOs linked to subprime mortgages in
2007, using ACA Management LLC, a firm that analyzes credit
risk, to select underlying securities. Goldman Sachs knew that
at least one prospective investor, Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, wasn&#8217;t likely to invest in a CDO that
didn&#8217;t have a collateral manager to analyze and select the
portfolio, according to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. Goldman Sachs misled
investors by not disclosing that Paulson had a hand in picking
the portfolio, according to the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s Bovespa stock index
climbed after a split within U.S. regulators on a suit against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. eased concern that tighter financial
regulation will curb global economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil&#8217;s state-controlled oil
company, gained as oil prices rose. Banco Bradesco SA climbed,
recovering with global banks after two people with knowledge of
the matter said Securities and Exchange Commission officials
voted 3-2 to pursue the case against Goldman Sachs. Tim
Participacoes SA jumped more than 3 percent after a report that
controller Telefonica SA is seeking integration of its units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa index advanced 0.6 percent to 69,500.59 at 9:29
a.m. New York time. Forty-four stocks rose on the index while 19
dropped. The measure is now up 1.4 percent for the year. The
real strengthened for a second day, rising 0.3 percent to 1.7497
per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude rose from a three-week low on speculation a report
tomorrow will show stockpiles declined for a second week in the
U.S., the world&#8217;s biggest energy consumer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras gained 1.3 percent to 33.99 reais. OGX Petroleo 
Gas Participacoes SA, the oil producer controlled by Brazilian
billionaire Eike Batista, rose 0.7 percent to 18.58 reais and
traded as high as 18.65 reais, the highest intraday level since
Feb. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC on April 16 accused Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable company in Wall Street history, of creating and
selling collateralized debt obligations in 2007 tied to subprime
mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co.
helped pick the underlying securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global banks rose, with Deutsche Bank AG, Germany&#8217;s
biggest, rising 2.2 percent. Bradesco, Brazil&#8217;s second-biggest
non-government bank, rose 0.4 percent to 31.83 reais, while
bigger rival Itau Unibanco Holding SA added 0.3 percent to 38.03
reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tim, the Brazilian unit of Telecom Italia SpA, jumped 2.1
percent, the first gain in 12 days, to 6.37 reais. Telefonica
wants closer integration between its Telecomunicacoes de Sao
Paulo SA unit, known as Telesp, and Vivo Participacoes SA, which
it jointly owns with Portugal Telecom SGPS SA, the Financial
Times reported, without attribution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bovespa&#8217;s Valuation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Portuguese and Spanish companies can&#8217;t come to an
agreement, another option would be for Telefonica to take over
Telecom Italia, the newspaper said. Telefonica is the largest
shareholder in Telco SpA, a holding company which owns a
controlling stake in Telecom Italia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivo rose 1.3 percent to 45.49 reais. Telesp jumped 2.2
percent to 35 reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa index trades for 13.3 times analysts&#8217; 2010
earnings estimates, compared with 13 times for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index of 22 developing nations&#8217; stocks and 16.2 times
for Mexico&#8217;s Bolsa index, according to weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg. The Bovespa trades at 17.3 times the reported profits
of its companies after fetching 25.5 times in November, the most
in almost six years, weekly data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa has gained 1.2 percent in 2010, boosted by
higher commodity prices and expectations gross domestic product
will grow more than 5 percent this year, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Signs that the
global recovery is strengthening helped the measure erase a drop
of 11 percent from a 19-month high in January. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co.&#8217;s suit seeking
$9.4 million from Indonesian businessman Prem Harjani has no
legal basis, a lawyer for the bank&#8217;s former private-banking
client told a Singapore court today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence they&#8217;ve presented is not sufficient to
fulfill the ingredients of fraud,&#8221; Denis Tan, Harjani&#8217;s lawyer,
said. The businessman has &#8220;no case to answer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of America Corp. unit&#8217;s lawyers told Justice
Andrew Ang of the Singapore High Court yesterday that Harjani
conspired with Renaissance Capital Management Co. to deceive the
bank in 2008 over shares in PT Triwira Insanlestari which he
instructed Merrill to purchase for him. The trial, scheduled to
run till April 23, ended today. The lawyers must make their
final written submissions by April 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harjani, 51, has denied Merrill&#8217;s claims and said the New
York-based bank sold the shares without his knowledge and
violated its policy of getting prior approval from management
before allowing a significant transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christopher Majeski, Merrill&#8217;s head of compliance for its
wealth management unit in Asia and its main witness in the case,
told the court he didn&#8217;t know if pre-approval was given for
Harjani&#8217;s $14.3 million purchase of Triwira shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rob Stewart, a Hong Kong-based spokesman for Merrill,
declined to comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Merrill Lynch Pierce, Fenner  Smith Inc. v.

&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Goes to Trial Over Sentinel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of New York Mellon Corp. is defending itself at trial
against allegations it knew cash management firm Sentinel
Management Group Inc. was using investors&#8217; assets as collateral
for a $312 million credit line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Sentinel liquidation trustee Frederick Grede
told the court yesterday the bank extended the firm credit
knowing it lacked enough capital to cover the debt, helping its
principals finance a heavily leveraged trading portfolio. Grede,
claiming the bank enabled Sentinel to deceive its clients, seeks
the recovery of about $600 million for its creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Sentinel did crash,&#8221; trustee lawyer Chris Gair told
U.S. District Judge James B. Zagel in Chicago in his opening
statement, &#8220;it was Sentinel&#8217;s customers who took the hit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sentinel, based in Northbrook, Illinois, filed for
bankruptcy in 2007, four days after it froze client accounts
citing credit market instability. Customer claims have totaled
about $1.2 billion. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John H. Squires in
December 2008 approved a liquidation plan under which investors
could be repaid 35 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon is seeking enforce its collateralized claim for
the $312 million in outstanding credit extended to the firm when
it failed, plus accrued interest and attorney fees. Grede wants
the Zagel to subordinate that lien to the claims of other
Sentinel creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bankers at the Bank of New York didn&#8217;t believe that
Sentinel or its insiders were engaged in any misconduct,&#8221; the
lender&#8217;s lawyer, Matthew Ingber, told Zagel during his more than
two hours of opening remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based lender said in a court filing last month
there is no evidence that the bank knew Sentinel was in
violation of the federal commodity exchange act or that insiders
were &#8220;misappropriating customer assets for their own benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was no misconduct -- much less the required
egregious misconduct -- by the bank justifying the extraordinary
remedy&#8221; of subordination, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Grede v. The Bank of New York, 08cv2582, in the
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockman to Pay $7.2 Million to Settle SEC Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Stockman, a former budget director in the Reagan
administration, will pay $7.2 million to settle a U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit claiming he misled
investors while running auto-parts maker Collins  Aikman Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockman, who was chief executive officer of the company,
neither admitted nor denied liability in the settlement, which
was made public yesterday in a filing in Manhattan federal
court. The $7.2 million payment will be partly offset by $4.4
million that Stockman previously paid to settle investor
lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement of the SEC&#8217;s allegations against Stockman
and four other ex-Collins and Aikman executives ends a case that
began with a criminal indictment claiming the defendants
intentionally defrauded investors. Federal prosecutors later
dismissed the indictment, and the SEC has dropped its claim that
Stockman knowingly misled investors. The settlement involves
lesser claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The criminal indictment has been dropped, the knowing
fraud claims have been dropped,&#8221; Stockman&#8217;s lawyer, Andrew
Weissman, said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;What is left is an
effort by Mr. Stockman to get on with his life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $7.2 million payment is made up of $6.8 million in
disgorgement and interest, and a $400,000 civil penalty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged in its lawsuit that Stockman, the company
and others inflated earnings between the fourth quarter of 2001
and early 2005. Collins  Aikman said in March 2007 that it
settled the SEC claims by agreeing not to violate securities
laws. The company paid no fine and admitted no wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stockman, 07-cv-2419, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Homestore Chief Executive Sentenced to 4 1/2 Years &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Homestore Inc. Chief Executive Officer Stuart Wolff
was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison after pleading guilty in
January to conspiracy to commit securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Gary Feess at a hearing yesterday in
Los Angeles rejected arguments by Wolff&#8217;s lawyer for a three-
year term, the low end under his plea deal with prosecutors. The
judge said Wolff, 46, with a doctorate in electrical engineering
from Princeton University, must have known that what he did was
inappropriate and morally wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was a very calculated deception of the public,&#8221;
Feess said. &#8220;He knew what was going on, and he knew it was
wrong when it was happening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolff&#8217;s lawyer, John Gibbons, said his client knew what he
did was wrong and that it was out of character. At the time of
the 2001 fraud, Wolff was part of the &#8220;go-go-go&#8221; generation of
young entrepreneurs swept up in the Internet bubble, the lawyer
told the judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Wolff, 2:05-cr-00398, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westport National Bank, a federally chartered bank, is
being sued for $16.2 million by Connecticut and accused of
aiding Bernard L. Madoff in his Ponzi scheme, authorities said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state also targeted PSCC Services Inc., a Westport,
Connecticut-based company, and its president, Robert L.
Silverman, state Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said in a
statement. A complaint was served yesterday on the defendants in
Hartford, Blumenthal said. The state seeks restitution and
$100,000 for each violation of state banking laws, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank and Mr. Silverman effectively aided and abetted
Madoff&#8217;s massive fraud, ignoring clear and compelling signals
that his investments were bogus,&#8221; Blumenthal said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state accused the three defendants of ignoring obvious
fraud, failing to verify Madoff investments, miscalculating fees
and acting as investment advisers without state licenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to Westport National Bank wasn&#8217;t returned. PSCC
Services and Silverman couldn&#8217;t be reached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading
guilty to running a $65 billion Ponzi scheme, the largest in
history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Societe Generale Trader Accused of Stealing Code &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Societe Generale trader Samarth Agrawal was charged
by the U.S. with stealing the company&#8217;s computer code for high-
frequency trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agrawal, 26, charged with one count of theft of trade
secrets, is accused of making copies last June of one part of
the code he&#8217;d been given access to and another part that he
hadn&#8217;t. He was arrested yesterday, according to federal
prosecutors in New York. In August and September, he also
printed portions of the code from a Microsoft Word file he
created, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the past several years, the financial institution
has spent millions of dollars to develop and maintain a computer
system that allows the financial institution to engage in
sophisticated, high-speed trading on various securities
markets,&#8221; according to a criminal complaint unsealed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agrawal was hired by Societe Generale in New York in March
2007 to work as a quantitative analyst in the high-frequency
trading group, according to the complaint. He was promoted to
trader last April and resigned in November, prosecutors said.
Before resigning he deleted a computer folder on his personal
network drive that contained the code, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agrawal&#8217;s lawyer, Steven M. Statsinger, didn&#8217;t return a
call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Paris-based bank discovered the misappropriation after
conducting an internal probe, informed law enforcement and has
been cooperating with the investigation, according to a company
statement e-mailed by spokesman James Galvin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No client information or funds were involved in the
incident,&#8221; according to the statement. &#8220;SG vigorously protects
its propriety information and intellectual property.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Agrawal, 10-mag-00779, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC, Finra Sued in Luxembourg Over Madoff Investment Losses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority were accused of being
liable for losses in a Luxembourg fund tied to New York money
manager Bernard Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg suit, which says the SEC and Finra failed to
stop Madoff&#8217;s fraud after repeated warnings, seeks an order
holding the U.S. regulators liable for losses in Access
International Advisors LLC&#8217;s defunct LuxAlpha Sicav-American
Selection Fund. Irving Picard was also sued for damages, in his
role as the trustee tasked with liquidating Madoff&#8217;s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC and Finra are liable for their extreme misconduct
and failures&#8221; to prevent Madoff&#8217;s &#8220;monumental fraud with
disastrous effect on the global investment community,
particularly on investors within Luxembourg,&#8221; according to the
suit filed April 13 by lawyers for Access. &#8220;Thanks to their
poor functioning they enabled a fraud that lasted many years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has been faulted by U.S. lawmakers for failing to
detect that Madoff was operating a $65 billion Ponzi scheme. The
SEC said last year it would conduct a &#8220;top-to-bottom&#8221; review
of its regulation. Employees at Finra, the U.S. brokerage
industry&#8217;s main regulator, failed to fully probe transactions at
Madoff&#8217;s firm, a report found in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Heine and Finra spokesman Brendan
Intindola declined to comment. Picard&#8217;s spokesman Kevin McCue
said in an e-mail the trustee won&#8217;t comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fernand Entringer, the Luxembourg lawyer for Access,
Patrick Littaye, co-founder of Access, and Pierre Delandmeter, a
board member of LuxAlpha, said in the court filing that the SEC
and Finra &#8220;should be held accountable&#8221; for investor losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access, Littaye and Delandmeter made the claims as part of
their defense to a lawsuit by the Luxembourg fund&#8217;s liquidators
that claims they are jointly liable for losses with UBS AG, the
fund&#8217;s custodian, and auditor Ernst  Young LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 71, last year pleaded guilty to running a Ponzi
scheme in federal court in Manhattan and was sentenced to 150
years in prison. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legal Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Faces U.K., German Regulatory Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. and German financial regulators are investigating
whether they can take action against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in
relation to a lawsuit filed last week by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority is investigating &#8220;whether
there are any implications for the U.K.-regulated entities of
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Leigh Calder, an FSA spokesman, said in an
interview. &#8220;If there are, we will take appropriate action. We
work closely with overseas regulators and will cooperate fully
with the SEC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA&#8217;s preliminary investigation follows comments from
Prime Minister Gordon Brown yesterday that the regulator would
probe the bank because there were &#8220;individuals that had
questions to answer.&#8221; He repeated that employees of the bank
exhibited &#8220;moral bankruptcy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed a suit against the New York-based bank on
April 16, citing fraud and misrepresentation in the marketing of
a collateralized debt obligation linked to subprime &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s BaFin will request information from the SEC and
review the facts before deciding on what steps to take, the
regulator&#8217;s spokeswoman Sabine Reimer said in an interview
yesterday. The German securities regulator only learned about
the suit when the SEC disclosed it on April 16, Reimer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA will need to show that either individuals or
companies based in the U.K. were involved in wrongdoing to take
action, lawyers said. The regulator can ban individuals or fine
companies, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more, click here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French Regulator Reviewing SEC&#8217;s Goldman Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s financial-markets regulator is reviewing the
lawsuit filed against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last week by the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to see if local action
is warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Autorite des Marches Financiers is verifying whether
French investors were exposed to financial products that are the
subject of the U.S. lawsuit to determine if the regulator should
open its own probe, a spokeswoman for the Paris-based agency
said yesterday in a telephone interview. She declined to be
cited by name, citing agency policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued the New York-based bank April 16, citing fraud
and misrepresentation in the marketing of a collateralized debt
obligation tied to subprime mortgages. Goldman Sachs said it
would fight the suit and denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The AMF has no evidence so far that French companies or
investors have been affected, the agency spokeswoman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC named Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs vice
president, in the suit as &#8220;principally responsible&#8221; for
creating and marketing the CDO known as Abacus 2007-AC1,
according to a statement from the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 31, is a French citizen. He joined Goldman Sachs in
July 2001, and worked for the bank in New York and London. He
isn&#8217;t under the AMF&#8217;s jurisdiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When reached at his London office the day the suit was
announced, Tourre declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Asks Court to Enforce Moody&#8217;s Subpoena &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California asked a court to enforce a subpoena against
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service Inc. that demands documents in an
investigation of the company&#8217;s evaluations of asset-backed
securities linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Attorney General Jerry Brown filed the original
subpoena in September seeking the documents from the Moody&#8217;s
Corp. unit and yesterday filed a petition for enforcement, Brown
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The need for court action to enforce a state subpoena is
highly unusual,&#8221; Brown said in the statement, &#8220;because
companies almost always comply without such a drastic step being
necessary.&#8221; Moody&#8217;s, which played a central role in the run-up
to the collapse of housing prices, has refused to explain its
ratings practices to the state and said it would be a &#8220;waste of
time&#8221; to respond to the subpoena, Brown said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brown has said the investigation will determine whether
Moody&#8217;s violated state law when it gave the highest ratings to
securities that fell so much in value that they jeopardized
investors&#8217; savings and put homeowners into foreclosure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s has been working with Brown&#8217;s office for months to
provide documents for the investigation, Moody&#8217;s spokesman
Michael Adler said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In fact, we&#8217;ve already provided the attorney general with
tens of thousands of pages of documents in response to his
request and are continuing to provide additional material,&#8221;
Adler said. &#8220;We will maintain our ongoing dialogue with the
attorney general to resolve the concerns he raised today.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Court News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garland&#8217;s Openness to &#8216;Learn My Craft&#8217; May Lead to High Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrick Garland is a lawyer who knows what he doesn&#8217;t know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1988, the man who might become the newest Supreme Court
justice was working part-time for the independent counsel
investigating an ex-White House aide. Lawrence Barcella, the
defense lawyer, was impressed as he watched Garland question two
witnesses and offered some advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am glad you didn&#8217;t have more witnesses,&#8221; Barcella
recalls saying. &#8220;Just one suggestion: Slow down a bit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, Garland left private practice to try cases
as a federal prosecutor in Washington. &#8220;I think I have to learn
my craft better,&#8221; he told Barcella. &#8220;You can count the number
of people that would do something like that on very few
digits,&#8221; Barcella said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Garland&#8217;s drive to become a better trial lawyer put him on
a path that may make him the most easily confirmable candidate
on President Barack Obama&#8217;s short list. Garland, 57, later
supervised the prosecution of Oklahoma City bomber Timothy
McVeigh and became a federal appeals court judge known for
sticking to precedent during 13 years on the bench. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said Garland would
be &#8220;terrific&#8221; and could be confirmed &#8220;virtually
unanimously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encouraging words from Republicans may worry Democrats
seeking a justice to push for expanding individual rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., facing a
fraud lawsuit from U.S. regulators, reported first-quarter
earnings that surpassed analysts&#8217; estimates on record fixed-
income trading revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income almost doubled to $3.46 billion, or $5.59 a
share, from $1.81 billion, or $3.39, a year earlier, the New
York-based bank said today in a statement. The average estimate
of 23 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for $4.14 per share.
Predictions ranged from $3.33 to $5.97. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed Goldman Sachs maintained its dominance
in fixed-income trading, the biggest source of Wall Street&#8217;s
revenue. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is trying to
preserve the bank&#8217;s place as the most profitable investment bank
in Wall Street history while defending it against regulators&#8217;
claims that the company misled investors in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman is continuing to take market share, and I think
that&#8217;s the key move for them coming out of the financial
crisis,&#8221; Jason Tyler, senior vice president at Ariel Investment
LLC, which manages $5 billion, said in a Bloomberg Television
interview. &#8220;Goldman is a clear winner as people are trying to
figure out who they are going to do business with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders said concern about potential fallout from the
accusations would supersede news about earnings. The stock,
which fell 13 percent after the SEC filed its case on April 16,
climbed 1.6 percent yesterday on news that the SEC was split
over whether to file the suit. The shares rose to $163.45 at
7:48 a.m. from $163.32 at the close on the New York Stock
Exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of failing to tell investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet
against the CDO, played a part in selecting the underlying
assets. Goldman Sachs has said the SEC&#8217;s case is &#8220;completely
unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and that it plans to &#8220;vigorously
contest&#8221; the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 55, didn&#8217;t refer specifically to the SEC&#8217;s
lawsuit in today&#8217;s statement, saying only, &#8220;In light of recent
events involving the firm, we appreciate the support of our
clients and shareholders, and the dedication and commitment of
our people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, will address
the SEC&#8217;s complaint in a conference call today, the company said
in a statement yesterday. Chief Financial Officer David Viniar
will discuss earnings, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank&#8217;s Reputation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ralph Cole, a senior vice president in research at Ferguson
Wellman Inc., is among investors who said they are concerned the
case could hurt Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reputation and cause clients to
switch their business to other firms. Another worry is that the
case could lead to additional lawsuits against the bank and add
impetus to financial-reform efforts that would erode Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s earnings potential. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the cost of this one suit&#8217;s the big deal,
not certainly compared to what they make,&#8221; said Cole, whose
firm manages $2.6 billion including Goldman Sachs stock. &#8220;It&#8217;s
what does this do to their reputation and what does this do to
the industry because of the current legislation going through?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said revenue from fixed-income, currencies
and commodities trading, which contributed more than half of
revenue last year, rose 13 percent in the first quarter to an
all-time high of $7.39 billion from $6.56 billion. That beat
estimates for $5.95 billion from Howard Chen at Credit Suisse
Group AG and $6.09 billion from Roger Freeman at Barclays
Capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the two
biggest U.S. banks by assets, both reported record fixed-income
revenue last week of $5.52 billion and $5.46 billion
respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at a great year for capital markets
firms,&#8221; Thomas Brown, CEO of Second Curve Capital LLC and
founder of bankstocks.com, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equities-trading revenue rose 18 percent to $2.35 billion
from $2 billion a year earlier, Goldman Sachs said. Gains from
principal investments, which includes the company&#8217;s stakes in
Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd. as well as real
estate and other companies, were $510 million compared with a
net loss of $1.41 billion in the first quarter of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking revenue climbed 44 percent to $1.18
billion from $823 million last year. Within that, fees from
financial advice fell 12 percent to $464 million from $527
million and equity-underwriting revenue surged to $371 million
from $48 million. Debt underwriting generated $349 million
compared with $248 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation and benefits, the firm&#8217;s biggest expense,
increased 17 percent to $5.49 billion in the quarter, or 43
percent of the firm&#8217;s overall revenue. The cost compared with
$4.71 billion in the first quarter of 2009, when the firm set
aside 50 percent of revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said the percentage of quarterly revenue put aside
for compensation expense was the lowest for any first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former IKB Deutsche Industriebank
AG Chief Executive Officer Stefan Ortseifen may call more
witnesses at his German criminal trial following the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission civil case against Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortseifen, 59, is on trial on charges that he failed to
warn investors about the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage
market before the bank was forced to seek a government bailout.
The bank lost nearly all of its $150 million investment in the
subprime-mortgage related products at the center of the SEC case
against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are considering calling more and other people to
witness in the case,&#8221; Rainer Hamm, his lawyer, said in an
interview at a court in Dusseldorf, Germany, where Ortseifen is
being tried for misleading investors. Ortseifen is observing the
Goldman development &#8220;with big interest&#8221; and it is too early to
say if he will change his defense strategy, the lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB was bailed out in 2007 by KfW Group and banking
associations and has received guarantees of as much as 12
billion euros ($16.2 billion) from the Soffin bank-rescue fund.
Ortseifen is charged with misleading investors by downplaying
the effect of the real estate crisis in a press release on July
20, 2007. Ortseifen stepped down nine days later and shares of
IKB fell 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to
subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson 
Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. The hedge fund wasn&#8217;t accused
by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC says a Goldman executive misled a collateral
manager, ACA Management LLC, and IKB about Paulson&#8217;s role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German case is LG Dusseldorf, 14 KLs 6/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chancellor of the Exchequer
Alistair Darling rejected calls by opposition parties to suspend
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. from working for the U.K. government
until regulators complete a probe of the New York-based firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can stop doing business with a firm
because an individual is accused of doing something,&#8221; Darling
said in an interview as he traveled by train to Worcester,
central England, today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s Financial Services Authority said in a statement
today it will formally investigate Goldman Sachs&#8217;s London units
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the bank
for fraud last week over its marketing of a collateralized debt
obligation. A Goldman Sachs vice president named in the SEC
case, Fabrice Tourre, works at the bank&#8217;s London office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With elections due on May 6, the Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats today said Gordon Brown&#8217;s Labour Party should go
further than the premier&#8217;s statement yesterday in which he
criticized some employees at Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
company in Wall Street history, as &#8220;morally bankrupt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The allegations almost beggar belief,&#8221; Darling said.
&#8220;There may be wider lessons for the regulators to learn. It is
not in the public interest to allow behavior which is damaging
to confidence and the integrity of markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert Khuzami, shortly after
becoming the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s enforcement
chief last year, told Congress the agency must be willing to
fight big cases to show it poses a &#8220;credible threat.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable
company in Wall Street history, in the SEC&#8217;s first contested
lawsuit against a major investment bank in more than a decade
reflects the enforcement unit&#8217;s new combative approach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stakes for the SEC are high. While winning high-profile
cases may help the agency restore its image after being battered
by the financial crisis and its failure to detect frauds
including Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme, losing may tarnish the
SEC&#8217;s reputation. Goldman Sachs said it will &#8220;vigorously&#8221;
fight the case, which hinges on whether information withheld by
the firm should&#8217;ve been disclosed to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit says: &#8220;We&#8217;re willing to file big cases, we&#8217;re
willing to file against the biggest firms, and we&#8217;re willing to
file about the most complicated stuff,&#8221; said Mark Radke, a
former SEC official now at Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With this adversarial shot across Goldman&#8217;s bow, other
banks will feel immense pressure to avoid being cast in a
similar light,&#8221; said Charles Clark, a former SEC enforcement
lawyer who works at Kirkland  Ellis LLP in Washington. Firms
&#8220;may go to extraordinary lengths to avoid a similar fate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock-index futures gained,

&lt;p&gt;Most Japanese stocks rose on easing
concern that financial regulations will crimp bank profits and
as carmakers reported improving earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isuzu Motors Ltd. jumped 4.6 percent after reporting an
unexpected profit. Honda Motor Co. gained 0.5 percent after
Daimler AG raised its forecast for Mercedes-Benz vehicles.
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. increased 0.8 percent after
Bloomberg News said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
was split in its vote to sue New York-based Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. Mitsubishi Corp., Japan&#8217;s biggest commodities trader, slid
1.8 percent after metal prices fell in London yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix index rose 0.1 percent to 972.11 at the 3 p.m.
close in Tokyo, with three stocks advancing for every two that
declined. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average was little changed at
10,900.68 after rising as much as 0.8 percent earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Daimler earnings proved that car sales are not
slumping,&#8221; said Masaru Hamasaki, chief strategist at Toyota
Asset Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $14
billion. &#8220;The divided vote by regulators on Goldman eased
excessive anxiety that many other banks would be sued.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix has gained 7.1 percent this year, the second-most
among benchmarks for the world&#8217;s 15 largest equity indexes, as
speculation Japanese exporters will benefit from a revival in
the U.S. economy offset concern that China and other emerging
countries would tighten policies to cool their economies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks climbed, led by
finance companies, as concerns over increased scrutiny on banks
eased after people familiar with the matter said regulators were
split on suing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PT Bank Danamon Indonesia jumped 6.7 percent in Jakarta on
speculation it will report higher profit today. Finance shares
were the biggest contributor to the MSCI Asia Pacific Index&#8217;s
advance, as Morgan Stanley upgraded Japan&#8217;s banks. National
Australia Bank Ltd. climbed 2.7 percent in Sydney after
antitrust regulators blocked its bid for Axa Asia Pacific
Holdings Ltd. Isuzu Motors Ltd. jumped 4.6 percent in Tokyo
after reporting better-than-expected full-year profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.4 percent to 126.14
as of 4:24 p.m. in Tokyo. The gauge slumped the most since Feb.
19 yesterday after regulators sued Goldman Sachs for fraud
related to collateralized debt obligations and China stepped up
measures to cool property prices. Securities and Exchange
Commission officials voted 3-2 to pursue the case against
Goldman, two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market will eventually get over these policy
tightening and regulatory issues as growth prospects remain
positive,&#8221; said Terrace Chum, who helps manage about $6 billion
at MFC Global Investment Management in Hong Kong. &#8220;In the
meantime, the market could be choppy. There is no rush to buy
equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Index climbed 0.8 percent in Hong Kong, while
Japan&#8217;s Topix Index rose 0.1 percent. South Korea&#8217;s Kospi index
advanced 0.8 percent and Indonesia&#8217;s Jakarta Composite Index
gained 1.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Rate Increase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand&#8217;s SET Index surged 3.4 percent, the steepest gain
among the region&#8217;s key stock gauges, amid increased earnings
from Tisco Financial Group Pcl. India&#8217;s Sensitive Index gained
0.8 percent, even as the central bank raised interest rates for
the second time in a month and ordered lenders to set aside more
cash to contain inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index were little
changed. The gauge rose 0.5 percent yesterday as a U.S. leading
indicators index rose in March by the most in 10 months.
Citigroup climbed 7 percent after its first-quarter profit more
than doubled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of finance companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific
Index advanced 0.7 percent as SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro cast
the deciding vote to approve the case against Goldman, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the vote wasn&#8217;t
public. About twice as many stocks on the gauge gained as
declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Excessive Anxiety&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asian finance companies index slumped 2.4 percent
yesterday after the SEC on April 16 accused Goldman Sachs of
creating and selling CDOs in 2007 tied to subprime mortgages
without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities. Goldman Sachs also didn&#8217;t disclose to
investors that Paulson was betting against the securities, the
SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The divided vote by regulators on Goldman eased excessive
anxiety that other banks would be sued,&#8221; said Masaru Hamasaki,
chief strategist at Toyota Asset Management Co., which oversees
the equivalent of $14 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Danamon jumped 6.7 percent to 5,600 rupiah. First-
quarter profit may rise as much as 30 percent, said Arief
Budiman, an analyst at PT Phillip Securities Indonesia. Tisco
climbed 5.9 percent to 25 baht in Bangkok after its first-
quarter earnings surged 57 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krung Thai Bank Pcl, Thailand&#8217;s second-largest lender by
assets, surged 10 percent to 13 baht, the biggest gain in the
MSCI Asia Pacific Index. The bank may increase its loan growth
target this year, the Kao Hoon newspaper reported, citing the
bank&#8217;s President Apisak Tantivorawong. Apisak told Bloomberg
News later that Krung Thai planned to maintain its loan target. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley Upgrade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., Japan&#8217;s second-
biggest bank by market value, rose 0.8 percent to 3,200 yen in
Tokyo. Mizuho Financial Group Inc., the country&#8217;s No. 3 lender,
climbed 0.5 percent to 185 yen. Morgan Stanley upgraded Japanese
banks to &#8220;attractive&#8221; from &#8220;in-line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Australia Bank gained 2.7 percent to A$28.83 in
Sydney after the Australian Competition  Consumer Commission
blocked the company&#8217;s A$13.3 billion ($12.2 billion) bid for Axa
Asia Pacific. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It didn&#8217;t look particularly accretive and NAB has
underperformed on the back of it,&#8221; said Brian Johnson, an
analyst at CLSA Asia Pacific Markets in Sydney with an
&#8220;underperform&#8221; rating on the stock. &#8220;The equity market will
treat it with some relief.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Takeover Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axa slumped 3.3 percent to A$6.13 even as AMP Ltd.,
Australia&#8217;s second-largest asset manager, signaled a fresh bid
for the insurer after National Australia&#8217;s bid was blocked. AMP
sank 1.7 percent to A$6.29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in Sydney, Harvey Norman Holdings Ltd., Australia&#8217;s
biggest furniture and electronics retailer, fell 5.3 percent to
A$3.38 after posting third-quarter sales that missed some
analyst predictions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Better-than-estimated earnings and economic reports have
helped drive the MSCI Asia Pacific Index up by 10 percent from
its low this year on Feb. 8. The rally has pushed the average
price of companies in the gauge to 1.63 times book value,
compared with about 1.5 times at the February low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isuzu Motors, Japan&#8217;s largest maker of light-duty trucks,
jumped 4.6 percent to 274 yen after reporting full-year profit
that beat its forecast. Mazda Motor Corp. increased 2.7 percent
to 264 yen after it was raised to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Car manufacturers also rose after Germany&#8217;s Daimler AG
boosted its annual profit projection for Mercedes-Benz cars and
trucks, citing &#8220;strong&#8221; sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Real Estate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese real-estate companies fell after the nation&#8217;s
housing ministry ordered property developers not to take
deposits for the sale of uncompleted apartments without proper
approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Vanke Co., the country&#8217;s biggest listed property
developer sank 3.3 percent to 8.03 yuan in the southern city of
Shenzhen. China Merchants Property Development Co. slid 5.8
percent to 18.01 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should remain &#8220;cautious&#8221; as policies continue
to weigh on sentiment and valuations, and earnings may
deteriorate, according to a report today from brokerage Shenyin
 Wanguo Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asia stocks rebounded from the
biggest slump in two months as U.S. regulators were split on
suing Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The yen fell as signs of a
recovery damped demand for the Japanese currency as a refuge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.5 percent to 126.15
at 4:15 p.m. in Tokyo after plunging 2.1 percent yesterday. The
yen slid against all 16 major counterparts. Futures for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index were little changed. The Stoxx
Europe gained 0.6 percent to 267.84 at 8:15 a.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banking shares in the U.S. and Asia jumped after a
Bloomberg News report said the Securities and Exchange
Commission voted 3-2 to sue Goldman Sachs for fraud. Japan&#8217;s
demand for services fell less than economists estimated in
February, indicating the recovery is starting to benefit
households. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Charles
Evans said in a televised interview that the U.S. recession is
&#8220;definitely over,&#8221; following news that the index of U.S.
leading indicators rose 1.4 percent in March, the most in 10
months, a sign the economy will grow in the second half.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The leading indicators show that the recovery is ongoing
and the market is now focusing on the earnings season,&#8221; said
Roger Groebli, the Singapore-based head of financial market
analysis at LGT Capital Management, part of the group that
oversees $84 billion. &#8220;The Goldman Sachs suit is a problem for
the industry but the financial regulatory issue has been
recognized earlier.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Index increased 0.9 percent and the Kospi
index advanced 0.8 percent, both rising for the first time in
three days. The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index increased
0.8 percent after India&#8217;s central bank increased the reverse
repurchase rate to 3.75 percent from 3.5 percent, as expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. rose 0.8 percent in
Tokyo as Morgan Stanley upgraded the nation&#8217;s banks and
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s profit beat estimates. Bank of East Asia Ltd.,
the third-biggest Hong Kong lender by market value, climbed 0.9
percent, while HSBC Holdings Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest, increased
0.9 percent in Hong Kong trading.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China Minsheng Banking Corp., the nation&#8217;s first privately
owned lender, rallied 3.4 percent in Hong Kong, poised for the
biggest gain since its initial share offering in the city in
November 2009, after profit jumped 53 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit against Goldman will have a &#8220;limited&#8221; impact on
local financial markets, South Korea&#8217;s Financial Services
Commission said today, noting that the nation&#8217;s financial
companies at the end of last year held $350 million of
securities issued by Goldman. The SEC on April 16 accused
Goldman Sachs, the most profitable company in Wall Street
history, of creating and selling collateralized debt obligations
in 2007 tied to subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thai Rally &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thailand&#8217;s SET Index surged 3.4 percent, the most in more
than four months, as Tisco Financial Group Pcl and Kiatnakin
Bank Pcl reported higher profit, raising expectations of
earnings among the nation&#8217;s banks are improving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It suggest that most companies&#8217; earnings growth remain
strong despite domestic political crisis,&#8221; said Sasikorn
Charoensuwan, the head of research at Phillip Securities
(Thailand) Pcl. Thai stocks slumped 8 percent in the past three
trading days amid a clash between authorities and anti-
government protesters that left 25 people dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen fell ahead of reports forecast to show German
investor confidence improved and sales of U.S. existing homes
increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying Theme &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen was at 124.69 per euro in Tokyo from 124.64 in New
York yesterday, when it touched 123.16, the highest since March
26. It dropped to 92.60 per dollar from 92.40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as the global economic recovery remains on track,
stocks will rise and cross currencies should advance against the
yen,&#8221; said Daisaku Ueno, a president at Gaitame.Com Research
Institute Ltd. in Tokyo, a unit of Japan&#8217;s largest currency
margin company. &#8220;That&#8217;s an underlying theme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific corporate and sovereign
bonds from default declined. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan dropped 3 basis points
to 94 basis points, while the Markit iTraxx Australia index
retreated by 3 basis points to 81.5, Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 0.5 basis point to 88.5
basis points, according to Morgan Stanley prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities advanced. Copper for three-month delivery was
up 0.6 percent at $7,740 per metric ton, rubber for September
delivery increased 2.2 percent to 320 yen per kilogram and July
corn gained 0.8 percent to $3.60 a bushel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil rose from a three-week low on speculation a
report tomorrow will show U.S. stockpiles declined for a second
week and as rising equity prices buoyed investor sentiment. Oil
climbed 57 cents to $82.02 a barrel in New York, reversing
yesterday&#8217;s slump. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gold traded little changed in Asia
as traders weighed the likely impact of regulatory action
against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on investor demand for
commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold for immediate delivery swung between a gain of 0.2
percent and a matching decline before trading little changed at
$1,136.50 an ounce at 1:42 p.m. in Singapore. The metal plunged
to $1,124 yesterday, the lowest since April 6, as the action
against Goldman spooked investors, and helped lift the dollar to
a one-week high against its major counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cautious mood still dominates the markets on the
Goldman fallout,&#8221; said Hwang Il Doo, a senior trader with KEB
Futures Co. in Seoul. &#8220;But the precious metals complex is most
likely to be influenced by the path of the dollar.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greenback was little changed against a basket of six
currencies after three days of gains as investigations into
Goldman spread to Europe. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown
called for regulators to probe the Wall Street company, and
Germany signaled it may begin its own investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials fell as
much as 1.3 percent yesterday after declining 1.2 percent on
April 16. Goldman is the biggest U.S. commodity brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;So long as risk aversion remains in place, the danger is
that gold longs will run for the exit as fast as they entered
over the previous two weeks,&#8221; Edel Tully, London-based analyst
with UBS Group AG, wrote in a report. &#8220;But while the bias
amongst investors right now is to liquidate, a lower price
terrain makes gold more attractive to physical participants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net Longs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators increased
their net-long positions in New York gold futures in the week
ended April 13, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading
Commission data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculative long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 220,742 contracts on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Washington-
based commission said in its Commitments of Traders report. Net-
long positions rose by 17,296 contracts, or 9 percent, from a
week earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver increased 0.3 percent to $17.806 an ounce, platinum
advanced 0.1 percent to $1,696.90 an ounce and palladium fell
0.1 percent at $537.40 an ounce. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copper advanced from a three-week
low as investors sought riskier assets after people familiar
with the matter said regulators were split on suing Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., easing concern over the impact on bank profits.
Nickel, aluminum, zinc and lead rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange gained as much as 1 percent to $7,769 a metric ton, and
traded at $7,742 at 1:29 p.m. in Singapore. The contract fell to
$7,610.25 yesterday, the lowest price since March 29 after China,
the world&#8217;s largest user of industrial metals, moved to curb
property speculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
which is suing Goldman Sachs for fraud tied to collateralized
debt obligations, voted 3-2 to pursue the case, two people
familiar with the matter said. Metals also gained after
Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s first-quarter profit more than doubled as the
economic rebound trimmed costs for bad loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re seeing a little bit of a bounce after the big
selloff in the past two days as the Goldman shock gets priced
into the markets,&#8221; Liu Biyuan, an analyst at GF Futures Co.,
said from Guangzhou. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for July delivery on the Shanghai Futures Exchange
rose as much as 1.2 percent to 60,770 yuan ($8,903) a ton,
before trading at 60,590 yuan. July-delivery copper on the Comex
in New York was up 0.2 percent at $3.5250 a pound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a fundamental standpoint, the metals are still
looking weak as investors are concerned about a slowdown in
credit and the property sector in China,&#8221; said Liu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China told banks to stop loans for third-home purchases and
suspend lending to buyers who can&#8217;t provide tax returns or proof
of social security contributions, the State Council said in an
April 17 statement. The latest measures come on top of orders to
banks this year to set aside more deposits as reserves and raise
mortgage rates, and steps to re-impose a sales tax on homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aluminum rose 1.1 percent to $2,395 a ton, zinc added 0.8

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s problems
with the Securities and Exchange Commission are spilling over
into the U.S. midterm elections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressman Mark Kirk, the Republican nominee for an open
Senate seat in Illinois, said he will return contributions made
by Goldman employees because the SEC is investigating the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk, 50, made the announcement after his Democratic
opponent, Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, criticized him
for taking the donations. The two men are vying for the Senate
seat once held by President Barack Obama that will help
determine whether Democrats retain control of the chamber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are calling on Congressman Kirk to explain why he
voted against Wall Street reform,&#8221; said Matt McGrath, a
spokesman for Giannoulias. &#8220;And we are challenging him to give
back his tainted Goldman Sachs campaign contributions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk has taken $54,010 from Goldman employees, including
$21,600 for his Senate bid, McGrath said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The congressman said that his campaign is still determining
how much Goldman employees donated to him, and that he hasn&#8217;t
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I want to set an example on ethics for others to
follow,&#8221; Kirk said yesterday during a Chicago news conference.
&#8220;I will err on the side of caution and watch this case
unfold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gregory Craig, President Barack
Obama&#8217;s former White House counsel, is working as an adviser to
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a spokesman for the New York-based
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig is a lawyer assigned to Goldman Sachs at Skadden,
Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom LLP, a law firm that has worked for
the investment bank &#8220;for years,&#8221; Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas
van Praag said. Van Praag said he didn&#8217;t know how long Craig has
been working for Goldman Sachs and declined to comment on the
nature of his work for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, was sued last week by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission in a fraud case alleging that the company
misled investors about a mortgage-linked security it sold them
in 2007. Goldman Sachs has called the accusations &#8220;unfounded in
law and fact&#8221; and vowed to fight the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politico.com reported on Craig&#8217;s work for Goldman Sachs
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Craig, 65, announced his resignation from the White House
last November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several top officials at the White House didn&#8217;t learn about
Craig&#8217;s work for Goldman Sachs until reporters asked about it,
said two White House officials, who asked not to be named. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The officials dismissed any influence Craig may have with
the administration. They said that as a former White House
employee he isn&#8217;t allowed to represent clients before any unit
of the executive office of the president for two years, under an
executive order Obama signed upon taking office. The officials
also said the SEC is an independent agency and doesn&#8217;t
coordinate with the White House on any aspect of enforcement
actions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp. said signings of first-quarter service contracts fell,
signaling that spending on larger technology projects may not
pick up until the second half of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services signings, which account for more than half of
total revenue, dropped about 2 percent to $12.3 billion, IBM,
the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, said yesterday
in a statement. New contracts for application-management, which
help clients maintain and develop software, slid 23 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate customers are still delaying larger technology
projects as the economy recovers, said Andy Miedler, an analyst
at Edward Jones in St. Louis. One bright spot -- the 18 percent
gain in new consulting contracts -- suggest larger deals could
pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he said. Consulting
contracts are a leading indicator for other services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a slow thing to turn IT services,&#8221; said Miedler, who
recommends buying IBM shares and doesn&#8217;t own any. &#8220;Those
transformational deals -- they will come back. Businesses are
more open to them now, but it takes a long time to sell those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York fell 2.2 percent to $129.38
in late trading yesterday after rising $1.60 to $132.23 on the
New York Stock Exchange. It had gained 1 percent this year
before today, compared with a 7.4 percent advance in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology spending will climb 1.7 percent this year, after
dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an estimate from
Morgan Stanley. Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, lent support
to that prediction last week by forecasting second-quarter sales
that topped estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-Year Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM signed 13 contracts greater than $100 million last
quarter, down from 16 a year ago. Excluding the drop in
application-management signings, services contracts would have
been up 4 percent from a year earlier, IBM said. Still, that&#8217;s
slower growth than the fourth quarter&#8217;s 9 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales this quarter will increase on a constant currency
basis, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a
conference call with analysts yesterday, citing projected growth
in services, software and hardware. Total sales in the second
quarter of last year declined 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said profit this year will be $11.20 a share, up from a
previous forecast of at least $11 a share. Analysts predicted
$11.13 on average, based on estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the company has yet to signal that profit can rise
based on revenue growth rather than steps like costs cutting and
stock repurchases, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Broadpoint
AmTech in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a lackluster quarter,&#8221; Marshall said. &#8220;Really good
financial management from an earnings perspective. At the end of
the day, not much from a revenue perspective.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency Effect &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, once the largest computer maker, has spent the past
decade selling off hardware businesses and investing in its
higher-margin software and services units, which now make up
more than 80 percent of total revenue. That&#8217;s helped it boost
gross profit margins, the percentage of sales left after
production costs, for 10 straight quarters on a year-over-year
basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even so, the first-quarter margin of 43.6 percent was the
lowest in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total sales in the first quarter rose 5.3 percent to $22.9
billion. Adjusting for foreign-exchange fluctuations, or FX,
revenue was little changed from a year earlier, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Street has been looking for better organic revenue
when you net out FX,&#8221; said Keith Bachman, an analyst at BMO
Capital Markets in New York. He rates IBM &#8220;outperform&#8221; and
doesn&#8217;t own shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano, 58, completed five
acquisitions last quarter, including Initiate Systems Inc. and
National Interest Security Co. to add health-care-related
programs. U.S. government plans to put patient health records
online may spur more than $20 billion in spending, Framingham,
Massachusetts-based researcher IDC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income rose to $2.6 billion, or $1.97 a
share, from $2.3 billion, or $1.70, a year earlier, IBM said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, a divorced and
discontented Atalia Katz quit her job as a real-estate executive
in Israel and traveled through Thailand, Vietnam, Morocco and
Ethiopia, carrying her Canon and Leica cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was looking for myself,&#8221; said the 58-year-old blond,
green-eyed Israeli, in an interview in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The search resulted in &#8220;Voice of Ethiopia,&#8221; an exhibition
of 30 color photographs and a video at Zone: Contemporary Art
gallery on Manhattan&#8217;s West 57th Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the 12,000 photos Katz took during a two-week visit
in January focus on 8,000 Ethiopian Jews of the Beta Israel
community who are waiting in the city of Gondar for entry visas
to Israel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All of them have first-degree relatives in Israel,&#8221; Katz
said. &#8220;They are recognized as Jews but the paperwork takes
time. Sometimes it takes years. In the meantime, they are
separated from their brothers and sisters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a long interview process to prove that they are
in fact related to the community in Israel,&#8221; said Orlee
Guptman, director of operations of the North American Conference
of Ethiopian Jewry in New York, which contributes funds to the
Beta Israel community. &#8220;The Israeli government has brought in
about 1,000 people from the community since December 2009.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Makeshift Synagogue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katz&#8217;s work doesn&#8217;t focus on the effects of red tape and
the hardships of daily life. Instead she shows a crowded
makeshift synagogue and portraits of the praying people. Men
wear tallit shawls and yarmulkes. Women are cloaked in white
from head to toe. The faces look focused and stern. The scene is
familiar yet foreign, removed from the modern world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Film footage of the services, screened in a backroom, fills
the gallery with gentle chanting of a famous Hebrew song, &#8220;Am
Yisrael Chai!&#8221; (&#8220;The People of Israel Live!&#8221;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They don&#8217;t have anything, no transportation, only their
feet and what they can carry,&#8221; said Katz, speaking of her
Jewish and non-Jewish subjects. &#8220;It&#8217;s like I went to the Bible
days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photographs capture that biblical quality. Men in white
cloaks and turbans stand on a misty bridge in the mountains. Two
dung collectors carry their trove atop their heads. A white goat
leaps away as if to escape imminent sacrifice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Portraits show people praying, children, old women with
lined faces. A little girl wears a big grin as she jumps a
ratty-looking rope. One striking image features a scarlet
curtain billowing in the entrance of a blue-walled structure
with a red sign above the door, &#8220;Bar Frike.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Heart Was Pounding&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Katz returned from the trip, a friend introduced her
to Zone&#8217;s director Jennifer Bahng. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She started showing me these photographs and my heart was
pounding,&#8221; Bahng said in an interview at the gallery. &#8220;They
were perfect in terms of formal elements: composition, color,
shadows. And I had in a mind a project about Africa since
2005.&#8221; Katz studied photography at the Camera Obscura School of
Art in Tel Aviv and the International Center of Photography in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The smiles are what got me,&#8221; said Bahng. &#8220;They have
hardly any water, but they are smiling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of the photographs range from $1,500 to $20,000,
depending on size and edition, and 10 percent from the sales
will be donated to the Beta Israel community, Katz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The show runs through April 30 at 41 W. 57th St.

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. banker at the center of fraud allegations against the
firm, has agreed to testify and may defend his actions at a
Senate hearing next week, said two people briefed on the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, who was accused by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission of misleading investors in a collateralized debt
obligation, will appear before the Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations on April 27 along with Goldman Sachs Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the plan isn&#8217;t public. Tourre, 31, will
tell the panel he did nothing wrong, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, was sued by the SEC on April 16. Regulators claimed the
company and Tourre misled investors by failing to disclose that
Paulson  Co., the hedge fund run by billionaire John Paulson,
helped select loans for the CDO and then bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, the only individual named in the SEC case, was
&#8220;principally responsible&#8221; for creating and marketing the CDO
known as Abacus 2007-AC1, the agency said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime now,&#8221;
Tourre wrote to a friend in a January 2007 e-mail, according to
the complaint. &#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous Fab...

exotic trades he created without necessarily understanding all

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama said the
White House had no influence on the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s decision to file suit against Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. as financial regulation legislation is being debated in
Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any notion that the administration knew ahead of time about
the SEC action is &#8220;completely false,&#8221; Obama said in an
interview today with CNBC. The SEC is an independent federal
agency and &#8220;they never discussed with us anything&#8221; about the
Goldman Sachs case, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC on April 16 announced it is suing Goldman Sachs,
alleging the bank created and sold collateralized debt
obligations linked to subprime mortgages in early 2007 without
disclosing that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the
underlying securities and bet against the vehicles. Goldman
Sachs has called the accusations &#8220;unfounded in law and fact&#8221;
and vowed to fight the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The action was taken as the administration and Senate
Democrats were gearing up to push ahead with legislation on
market regulations in the face of unified Republican resistance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC is an entirely independent agency that we have no
day-to-day control over,&#8221; Obama said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Statement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro said in a separate statement
that the agency doesn&#8217;t coordinate its actions with the White
House or Congress and doesn&#8217;t consider the &#8220;political
consequences&#8221; in deciding which cases to pursue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim
agreed to pay $140 million for 417 Fifth Ave., a midtown
Manhattan office tower, from a partnership that includes Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., a person familiar with the transaction said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim, ranked by Forbes magazine as the world&#8217;s richest man,
is paying $343 a square foot for the building, said the person,
who asked not to be named because the deal is private. The 11-
story tower is at the corner of East 38th Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The seller is a joint venture of Moinian Group, an
investment company headed by developer Joseph Moinian, and
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Whitehall Street Real Estate Funds. The venture
paid $250 million for the building in 2007, city records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Typically we see high-profile new foreign buyers come in
and make a trophy acquisition at a huge price,&#8221; Peter Slatin,
editorial director at Real Capital Analytics Inc., a New York-
based research firm that tracks property sales, said in an
interview. &#8220;He&#8217;s not doing that. He&#8217;s not hanging a big sign on
himself saying, &#8216;Price is no object.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price is about half the $636 a square foot that SL
Green Realty Corp. agreed last week to pay for another Midtown
office building, 600 Lexington Ave. Sales are increasing in
Manhattan after the credit crisis sent transactions down 87
percent last year from the average during 2004 to 2008,
brokerage Cushman  Wakefield Inc. said in a report this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The price really tells you the market is on a two-tier
track,&#8221; Slatin said. The building at 600 Lexington is a block
south of Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s headquarters at 399 Park Ave., where
office rents are higher than south of 42nd Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rental Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rents in the Park Avenue submarket, which includes 600
Lexington, were slightly above $60 a square foot at the end of
March, among the highest in the city, according to a report by
CB Richard Ellis Group Inc., a competitor of Cushman. In the
Grand Central district, which includes 417 Fifth, rents averaged
about $55 a foot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 417 Fifth building is 96 percent leased, according to
the Cushman report. About a quarter of its leases expire in the
next two years, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenants whose leases expire in that period include CIBC
World Markets Inc. and American Eagle Outfitters Inc.&#8217;s AEO
Management Co., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Observer reported the sale earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim&#8217;s Banco Inbursa SA led a group of lenders that
foreclosed in February on an eight-acre luxury residential site
in Beverly Hills, California, that had been owned by Christian
Candy, a Monaco-based real estate entrepreneur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saks Stake &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim, whose net worth was estimated by Forbes at $53.5
billion, has said he bought shares in upscale retailer Saks Inc.
because of the value of its real estate holdings. The New York-
based company&#8217;s properties include its Fifth Avenue flagship
store. Slim&#8217;s family, through investment vehicle Inmobiliaria
Carso SA, is the biggest Saks holder with a 16 percent stake,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slim, 70, has dealt in Mexican real estate for decades,
following in the footsteps of his father, a Lebanese immigrant
who acquired property in downtown Mexico City after the Mexican
Revolution. His properties in Mexico, held through Grupo Carso
SAB, include shopping and office complexes, hospitals and
educational campuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arturo Elias, a spokesman for Slim in Mexico City, had no
immediate comment. Dwayne Doherty, a spokesman for New York-
based Cushman, which represented Moinian in the transaction,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moinian declined to comment through an outside spokesman,
Eric Gerard of Great Ink Communications in New York. Andrea
Raphael, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, had no
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
signaled it will fight a U.S. lawsuit over subprime mortgage
instruments the same way Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch
unit and UBS AG have challenged similar claims -- by invoking
the concept of caveat emptor: Latin for buyer beware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy may work. By insisting that purchasers of
collateralized debt obligations knew what they were getting
into, Goldman Sachs is following a well-traveled path. Both
Merrill and UBS won dismissal of similar claims that they
misrepresented the risks of such assets by saying the buyers
were sophisticated enough to know better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of creating and selling the CDOs without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the instrument. Goldman Sachs denied any
wrongdoing, saying that it provided &#8220;extensive disclosure&#8221; to
customers about the risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, whose mantra is clients&#8217; interests always
come first, has said &#8220;these are sophisticated investors who
knew what they were buying,&#8221; said David Irwin, a former federal
prosecutor in private practice in Towson, Maryland. The bank is
arguing that the average buyer of this product isn&#8217;t some
&#8220;credit union that didn&#8217;t know what it was doing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faltering Housing Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market began to falter,
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO vehicle, known as Abacus,
linking it to bundles of subprime mortgages whose value would
rise or fall depending on whether homeowners paid them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the
CDOs and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged in its April 16 complaint that, had Goldman
Sachs customers known Paulson helped choose the securities that
formed the basis of the CDO, and that Paulson was betting
against them, they might not have bought any. The regulator&#8217;s
case in Manhattan federal court may hinge on that issue, said
lawyer Mark Zauderer of New York&#8217;s Flemming Zulack Williamson
Zauderer LLC, who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if a jury finds the customer would have bought the
Goldman Sachs product with knowledge of Paulson&#8217;s role, the
panel may still find in favor of the SEC if it decides those
facts were intentionally hidden, Zauderer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sophisticated Investors&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman certainly can and will argue that the
sophisticated investors were perfectly capable of evaluating the
quality of securities, regardless of what Paulson&#8217;s intentions
were in betting against them,&#8221; said Zauderer, who helped defend
former New York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso. Grasso
successfully challenged a 2004 compensation lawsuit by then New
York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether they did sufficient due diligence or reasonably
relied upon what was presented to them&#8221; will be an issue,
Zauderer said of the CDO&#8217;s buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs lawyer Richard Klapper of New York-based
Sullivan  Cromwell LLP didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment.
Goldman Sachs said yesterday that the U.S. case hinges on the
actions of an employee it placed on paid leave this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about the
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will also be de-registered
from the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm
in London said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Factual Dispute&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The professional savvy of investors who buy such financial
vehicles was cited by a New York state judge as grounds for
dismissal earlier this month of fraud claims brought against two
Merrill units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that 2009 suit, Armonk, New York-based bond insurer MBIA
Inc. and its LaCrosse Financial Products LLC unit claimed that
Merrill had a &#8220;deliberate strategy to offload&#8221; billions of
dollars of &#8220;deteriorating&#8221; subprime mortgages from July 2006
to March 2007, as homeowner defaults began to soar. Merrill
rejected the allegations and denied any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Court Justice Bernard Fried in
Manhattan dismissed five of six claims brought by MBIA over
protection sold against mortgage-debt defaults. Fried, who
allowed a breach-of-contract claim to continue, said the credit-
default swaps were the product of &#8220;intensive negotiations among
the parties, whose sophistication and business acumen and
experience cannot be overstated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MBIA and LaCrosse specifically stated that they were able
to evaluate the validity of the CDOs, and were specifically
warned that the transaction was appropriate only for
sophisticated investors capable of analyzing the risks,
including the risk related to the type of collateral involved in
the transaction,&#8221; the judge wrote in his opinion. MBIA has said
it will appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS used that argument to fight a lawsuit by Hamburg-based
HSH Nordbank AG seeking to recover at least $275 million in
losses on a portfolio linked to the U.S. subprime-mortgage
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of Trickery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH alleged that the Zurich-based bank was able to trick it
into making the investment because in 2001, when they were
negotiating the deal, HSH was &#8220;a regional German bank with
little familiarity with international structured finance,&#8221;
according to its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS lawyer Barry Sher called that claim &#8220;the babes in the
woods defense&#8221; during a May 2008 hearing in the case. Sher said
HSH had done its own credit-linked note transaction a year
before entering the contract with UBS, which denied the
allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Supreme Court Justice Richard Lowe in
Manhattan dismissed most of HSH&#8217;s claims, including fraud, in
2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH amended its complaint, saying new documents obtained
during discovery showed UBS had an &#8220;undisclosed economic
motivation&#8221; and intended the transaction to be &#8220;other than a
vehicle for HSH&#8217;s gain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;UBS claimed that the transaction was &#8216;tailored to meet&#8217;
HSH&#8217;s needs when it was actually structured to enrich UBS at
HSH&#8217;s expense,&#8221; according to a ruling by Lowe last October. He
said HSH could proceed with its restated fraud claim as well as
claims for breach of contract and breach of the implied covenant
of good faith. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Na&#239;ve Investor&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowe said he still wasn&#8217;t convinced that HSH could sue for
negligent misrepresentation and dismissed that claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HSH&#8217;s reworded claim that it was but a na&#239;ve investor in
the hands of the more experienced UBS in a world of complex
investment rings as unconvincing now as it was in the original
complaint,&#8221; Lowe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides are appealing Lowe&#8217;s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are substantial parallels between SEC v. Goldman
Sachs and HSH&#8217;s case against UBS,&#8221; Michael McNicholas, legal
counsel at HSH, said today in an e-mailed statement. UBS and
Goldman Sachs exploited flaws in the ratings system to make
high-risk investments appear to be investment grade, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both cases are based on strong evidence that the
arranging bank concealed material facts regarding the adverse
selection of the portfolio and misrepresented the alignment of
investor&#8217;s interests,&#8221; McNicholas said. &#8220;However, unlike the
Goldman case where Paulson&#8217;s adverse economic interest was
concealed, in our case UBS fraudulently concealed its own
adverse economic interests to profit at HSH&#8217;s expense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH&#8217;s Specifications &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Morris, a UBS spokesman, said today in an e-mail that
the transaction was structured according to HSH&#8217;s
specifications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;HSH was a professional and knowledgeable German bank,&#8221;
Morris said. &#8220;We executed all of our contractual obligations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a third case, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s attempt to fend off
billionaire Len Blavatnik&#8217;s suit blaming his losses on the
bank&#8217;s risky mortgage bets led to a mixed court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, founder of Access Industries Group, accused the
second-largest U.S. bank of stuffing its portfolio with too much
subprime-mortgage risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, New York State Supreme Court Justice Melvin L.
Schweitzer, also in Manhattan, threw out Blavatnik&#8217;s claims of
negligence and breach of fiduciary duty. The judge refused to
dismiss accusations against the New York-based bank of breach of
contract and negligent misrepresentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Passive Investor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiff was a passive investor that looked to the
expertise and advice of defendants in structuring an investment
strategy,&#8221; Schweitzer wrote. &#8220;Since plaintiff properly has
alleged its reliance on these misrepresentations, there is a
strong presumption that its reliance was reasonable given the
investment management relationship between the parties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan had argued Blavatnik couldn&#8217;t state a claim merely
by pointing to losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Whether defendants acted with &#8216;negligence or willful
misconduct&#8217; cannot be assessed by asking what investment
decisions a reasonable investment adviser would have made under
normal market conditions,&#8221; the bank&#8217;s lawyers said in court
papers. &#8220;The relevant question is what a reasonable investment
adviser would have done in the face of this historic financial
crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Sedarat, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Arguments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Goldman Sachs made a significant misrepresentation to
customers looking to buy the instrument at issue in the SEC
lawsuit, it can&#8217;t argue that experienced investors should have
known what they were getting into, Zauderer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said in a statement responding to the SEC
lawsuit that it provided full disclosure about the offering and
that its portfolio was marketed solely to sophisticated
financial institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment bank also argued that the SEC complaint
failed to mention that it lost more than $90 million from the
transaction, as compared with the $15 million in fees it got. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said that IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG and
ACA Management LLC, two investors in the Abacus product that
were identified in the SEC complaint, were aware of the risk
associated with the securities and were &#8220;among the most
sophisticated mortgage investors in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill has mounted a similar, sophisticated investor-
defense to a suit brought by Netherlands-based Cooperatieve
Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank BA, known as Rabobank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabobank&#8217;s Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the Goldman Sachs case, Utrecht-based Rabobank
claimed Merrill omitted important information in advising on a
CDO tied to subprime mortgages. In that case, also presided over
by Judge Fried, the alleged omission was Merrill&#8217;s relationship
with another client betting against the investment, which
resulted in a loss of $45 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill countered in court papers that Rabobank was aware
of the risks, which were disclosed in the transaction documents.
The bank should have been responsible for conducting its own due
diligence, and shouldn&#8217;t have relied on Merrill, the bank said
in a court filing last year seeking to dismiss the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Rabobank have seized on the SEC&#8217;s allegations
against Goldman to support their own case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing in state court in Manhattan on the same day the
SEC sued Goldman, the Dutch bank drew a parallel between the
complaints. Rabobank urged the judge to grant it access to
Merrill&#8217;s records of how the collateral manager for a synthetic
CDO went about selecting investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Fraudulent Conduct&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rabobank said the SEC complaint justifies its lawsuit
because Merrill is accused of &#8220;precisely the same type of
fraudulent conduct in the structuring and marketing&#8221; of CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bill Halldin, a Merrill spokesman, rejected Rabobank&#8217;s
attempt to link its complaint to the Goldman Sachs case, saying
on April 16 that the matters are unrelated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Werder, a New York attorney for Blavatnik with Quinn
Emanuel Urquhart Oliver  Hedges LLP, said the SEC lawsuit
against Goldman Sachs supports a broader government inquiry into
the CDO market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The latest allegations provide further indication that,
in the area of mortgage-backed securities, some of our nation&#8217;s
financial institutions consistently placed their own self-
interest ahead of the interests of their customers,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

Says Role in Goldman Deal Was Appropriate</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co., the hedge fund that
made $15 billion betting on the decline in subprime mortgages in
2007, said its role in helping to design a mortgage-linked deal
sold by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was &#8220;appropriate and conducted
in good faith,&#8221; according to a letter sent to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
for fraud on April 16, saying it failed to disclose that Paulson
 Co. helped choose securities for a so-called synthetic
collateralized debt obligation and then wagered that it would
collapse. Goldman Sachs told clients the securities included in
the deal were selected by ACA Management LLC, an independent
third party, according to the regulator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have always been forthright in expressing our
opinions, and we never misrepresented our positions,&#8221; John
Paulson, the firm&#8217;s founder, wrote in the letter dated April 20.
&#8220;All our dealings were through arms-length transactions with
experienced counterparties who had opposing views based on all
available information at the time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co. has not been accused of any wrongdoing and
was not named in the suit. The SEC said that it didn&#8217;t sue the
firm because it was Goldman Sachs&#8217;s job to disclose to investors
how the CDO was constructed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asia weathered the &#8220;Lehman shock&#8221;
of 2008 with impressive calm. Now it is being tested by a jolt
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets recoiled at the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s April 16 fraud suit against Goldman. On April 19,
stocks fell the most in two months on concern that financial
companies face greater scrutiny. By the following day, all was
forgotten in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps it dawned on traders that the SEC action is good
for the region. Its resilience amid the global crisis and
progress in decoupling from the West haven&#8217;t changed. Looking
forward, anything that brings real reform to the biggest economy
is stellar news for Asia and the rest of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you consider the tests of the last 19 months, such as
a global credit crunch, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s
bankruptcy and Greece&#8217;s deficit woes, the odds of Asia escaping
any fallout looked grim. Especially with Japan beset by
deflation and China reliant on U.S. consumers living beyond
their means. Asia has managed to confound the skeptics, and that
isn&#8217;t about to change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the big challenge of central banks falling behind the
inflation curve is an enviable one. In Washington and Frankfurt,
the focus is on monetary policy&#8217;s limits. Near-zero interest
rates aren&#8217;t boosting growth as fast as they were supposed to.
The troubles facing officials in Hanoi and Seoul are preferable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s worth noting that bank shares in countries such as
China and India have outperformed global rivals by about 30
percentage points since Lehman blew up in September 2008. That
dynamic should continue and even gain steam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple of years ago, many global investors considered
Asia&#8217;s regulatory environment too strict and inhibiting of
financial innovation. Nowadays, that conservatism is a virtue.
The health of Asian balance sheets and the reasonable pace of
loan growth relative to the U.S. and Europe explain why
investors are heading this way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia is hardly devoid of problems. It has done well on a
macroeconomic level during this crisis, yet it&#8217;s also been hit
hard below the surface. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have 70 million-plus people still mired in poverty as
a result of the financial crisis,&#8221; Rajat Nag, managing director
of the Asian Development Bank, said on April 19. Nag, for one,
is &#8220;very pleased&#8221; with the SEC&#8217;s move to go after Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tightrope Walking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central banks have quite a bit of tightrope walking to do.
They need to be mindful of struggling households. They also must
mop up liquidity to avoid excessive asset prices. Indonesia is a
case in point: Even the central bank agrees Jakarta&#8217;s stock
market is a bubble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s woes are growing, too. Asia&#8217;s biggest economy was
hit hard by the financial crisis. Yet Japan&#8217;s experience jibes
with the nature of the turmoil. This crisis didn&#8217;t go to the
periphery of the global economy, but to its core. It&#8217;s the Group
of Seven economies that are reeling, not developing ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lehman shock gave way to the &#8220;Toyota shock,&#8221; which
really was a two-part process. The first was the plunge in
Toyota Motor Corp. sales in late 2008 and into 2009. The second
was the celebrated brand&#8217;s car-safety debacle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there is a silver lining here, it&#8217;s that Asia is proving
adept at living without Japan. Strong growth from China and
India don&#8217;t fill the void left by a hobbled U.S., yet it&#8217;s
helping. And so, the Asia decoupling argument gets to live on
until challenged anew by the next global crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Reform &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that front, Goldman&#8217;s plight is actually good news.
Surprise on the part of Asian investors at the lack of financial
reform in Washington gave way to disillusionment. Signs that
U.S. regulators are finally trying to exact some justice from
Wall Street could change everything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the effort involves Goldman Sachs means it&#8217;s a bit
loaded. Schadenfreude abounded last year when a Rolling Stone
magazine writer labeled Goldman a &#8220;great vampire squid wrapped
around the face of humanity.&#8221; It&#8217;s an image that captured how
many in Asia viewed Wall Street following the region&#8217;s 1997
crisis. American funds came in, wrapped their tentacles around
assets and bought them on the cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A functioning U.S. financial industry is one thing; a
sustainable one is equally important. American has been sending
financial contagion Asia&#8217;s way for the past 18 months, just as
Asia sent it to the West a decade earlier. The key for the
global economy is to avoid a repeat of either scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until now, there has been scant evidence that the U.S. was
righting its anything-goes model. The SEC&#8217;s Goldman suit is just
the tip of the iceberg. As such actions spread and financial
executives are made accountable, Asia can look forward to the
day when U.S. markets are sounder destinations for their
trillions of dollars of savings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia is working to wean itself off the U.S. In the
meantime, what&#8217;s good for the world&#8217;s dominant financial power
is good for Asia. Unlike the Lehman one, the Goldman shock may
be just the thing for this region&#8217;s prosperity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. named MT Carney
president of marketing for its film studio, where she will

&lt;p&gt;Carney will lead campaigns for Disney, Touchstone and Pixar
titles in areas including online development, publicity and
promotions, Rich Ross, chairman of the Burbank, California-based

&lt;p&gt;Ross reached outside of Hollywood to hire Carney, who
founded a New York-based advertising company, Naked NY, in 2006.
Disney is cutting costs at its film studio after Dick Cook, the

&lt;p&gt;The company plans to release &#8220;Prince of Persia: The Sands
of Time&#8221; on May 28 and &#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; on June 18, the IMDB Web

&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest

&lt;p&gt;Visa will pay $26 a share for Mountain View, California-

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley, which reported
earnings today that beat analyst&#8217;s estimates, said the company&#8217;s
average daily risk-taking in commodities rose 17 percent in the
first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-risk in commodity prices, a measure of how much
the firm estimates it might lose in a single day, rose to $27
million in the three months ended March 31 from $23 million in
the preceding quarter, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most profitable securities
firm in Wall Street history, said yesterday that the company&#8217;s
average daily risk-taking in commodities rose 29 percent in the
first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Value-at-risk rose to $49 million in the three months ended
March 31 from $38 million in the preceding quarter, the company
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. reported earlier this month that
value-at-risk in &#8220;commodities and other&#8221; fell to $15 million
from $17 million in the previous quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG said it hired
Stephen Byrne from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to head European
distressed debt trading in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Byrne joins after 14 years at Goldman Sachs, where he was
most recently co-head of European high-yield and public loan
trading, according to a statement from Frankfurt-based Deutsche
Bank. He will report to Gavin Colquhoun, head of Deutsche Bank&#8217;s
distressed products group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank ranked fourth underwriting leveraged loans in
Europe last year, with 6.5 percent of $88 billion of sales.
Loans are considered distressed when their price falls to less
than 70 percent of face value, or yield 10 percentage points
more than benchmark rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Distressed debt funds posted an average 8.7 percent return
this year, after earning 43 percent in 2009, making them this
year&#8217;s best performers in indexes compiled by hedge fund
advisory firm Hennessee Group LLC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel&#8217;s
administration wants to avoid awarding new business to Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. pending the outcome of U.S. regulators&#8217; fraud
suit against the firm, a government official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision to curb business with Goldman Sachs would be
considered if the Securities and Exchange Commission allegations
are proven, said the German official, who declined to be named
because the matter hasn&#8217;t been considered by Merkel&#8217;s Cabinet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remarks come as politicians in Europe squabble over
doing business with Goldman Sachs, underscoring the limits of
rhetoric. In Germany, Goldman Sachs remains a primary dealer of
bunds and underwriter for the KfW state development bank,
spokesmen for the institutions say. U.K. Chancellor of the
Exchequer Alistair Darling rejected calls to bar the New York-
based investment bank from government work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany&#8217;s BaFin regulator is in contact with the SEC to
seek further details of Goldman Sachs&#8217; involvement with IKB
Deutschland Industriebank AG, Finance Ministry spokeswoman
Jeanette Schwamberger told reporters April 19. IKB was Germany&#8217;s
first victim of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 and
was bailed out with almost 10 billion euros ($13.5 billion) by
KfW Group to shore up the German banking system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s largest banks are
pumping more money into the battle over the rewriting of the
rules of finance as legislation heads to a vote in the Senate as
early as this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six of the top 10 U.S. banks by assets, including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley,
ramped up donations to lawmakers from their political action
committees in the last month, according to reports filed for
yesterday&#8217;s Federal Election Commission deadline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Bank of America Corp. and U.S. Bancorp were among
seven banks that increased the amount spent on lobbying during
the first three months of the year compared with the same period
in 2009, separate reports filed with Congress showed. The U.S.
Chamber of Commerce doubled its lobbying spending in the first
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re in the endgame,&#8221; said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer
program director for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group
which is pressing for stronger regulations. &#8220;They&#8217;re all-in to
defeat reform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc.,
all based in New York, San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. and
Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services Group Inc. each donated
more to federal candidates in March than in the previous two
months combined. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has testimony from Paolo Pellegrini, a former top

Group Inc. misled ACA Management LLC about Paulson&#8217;s intention
to shortsell, CNBC reported, citing documents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
signaled it will fight a U.S. lawsuit over subprime mortgage
instruments the same way Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch
unit and UBS AG have challenged similar claims -- by invoking
the concept of caveat emptor: Latin for buyer beware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategy may work. By insisting that purchasers of
collateralized debt obligations knew what they were getting
into, Goldman Sachs is following a well-traveled path. Both
Merrill and UBS won dismissal of similar claims that they
misrepresented the risks of such assets by saying the buyers
were sophisticated enough to know better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission accused Goldman
Sachs of creating and selling the CDOs without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the instrument. Goldman Sachs denied any
wrongdoing, saying that it provided &#8220;extensive disclosure&#8221; to
customers about the risks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, whose mantra is clients&#8217; interests always
come first, has said &#8220;these are sophisticated investors who
knew what they were buying,&#8221; said David Irwin, a former federal
prosecutor in private practice in Towson, Maryland. The bank is
arguing that the average buyer of this product isn&#8217;t some
&#8220;credit union that didn&#8217;t know what it was doing,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market began to falter,
Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO vehicle, known as Abacus,
linking it to bundles of subprime mortgages whose value would
rise or fall depending on whether homeowners paid them off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC alleged in its April 16 complaint that, had Goldman
Sachs customers known Paulson helped choose the securities that
formed the basis of the CDO, and that Paulson was betting
against them, they might not have bought any. The regulator&#8217;s
case in Manhattan federal court may hinge on that issue, said
lawyer Mark Zauderer of New York&#8217;s Flemming Zulack Williamson
Zauderer LLC, who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the
CDOs and wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also said yesterday that the U.S. case hinges
on the actions of an employee it placed on paid leave this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Goldman Sachs executive
director who was accused of misleading investors about the
mortgage-linked investment in 2007, will be de-registered from
the Financial Services Authority, a spokeswoman at the firm in London said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he
remembers and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221;
Greg Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call
with reporters yesterday, without naming Tourre. &#8220;If we had
evidence that someone here was trying to mislead someone, that&#8217;s
not something we&#8217;d condone at all and we&#8217;d be the first one to
take action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By characterizing the case as a dispute involving a single
employee, Goldman Sachs may be taking its first steps to
publicly distance itself from Tourre in the case, some lawyers
said. That could reduce bad publicity and ultimately make it
easier for the company to settle the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre at Allen  Overy LLP in
New York, didn&#8217;t return a call seeking comment. The New York-
based bank has denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the
SEC&#8217;s case because it is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and
fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Goldman
Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S. District Court, Southern District of
New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BHP Says It Found Evidence of Possible Corruption &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company,
found evidence of possible breaches of anti-corruption laws
after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission requested
information for an investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP identified &#8220;possible violations of applicable anti-
corruption laws involving interactions with government
officials,&#8221; Melbourne-based BHP said today in a statement. The
U.K.&#8217;s Serious Fraud Office said BHP &#8220;opened a dialogue&#8221; and
is cooperating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said the probe into the termination of some
minerals exploration projects didn&#8217;t involve its business in China, where four Rio Tinto Group executives were jailed last
month for bribery. U.S. regulators have increased scrutiny of
corporate governance and compliance following the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC couldn&#8217;t &#8220;confirm or deny the existence or non-
existence of any investigation,&#8221; John Nester, a Washington-
based spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP &#8220;has been in to see us,&#8221; David Jones, a spokesman for
the U.K.&#8217;s SFO, said in an e-mail. The Australian Securities and
Investments Commission couldn&#8217;t comment, spokeswoman Georgie
Morell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP has exploration projects in Chile, Zambia, Australia,

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Faces Formal U.K. Probe After SEC Fraud Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London units of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable firm in Wall Street history, will be formally
investigated by Britain&#8217;s financial regulator after U.S.
authorities sued the bank for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Services Authority said in a statement
yesterday that it will begin a formal probe after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. The FSA
said yesterday it was reviewing whether a full investigation
into the New York-based bank was warranted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown called on the agency, which he
created in 1997, to investigate Goldman Sachs, accusing
employees of the bank of &#8220;moral bankruptcy.&#8221; The bank may be
fined or individuals banned if the FSA finds a breach of its
rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president named in the SEC case,
Fabrice Tourre, works at the bank&#8217;s London office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.K. entity, Goldman Sachs International, is not
mentioned in the SEC complaint, but the FSA&#8217;s latest move means
that this part of Goldman Sachs is now under the spotlight
too,&#8221; said Clive Cunningham, a regulatory lawyer at Taylor
Wessing LLP who isn&#8217;t involved in the case. &#8220;The question is
whether Goldman Sachs International was involved and, if so, did
it breach any U.K. regulatory rules.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will cooperate with the FSA&#8217;s investigation,
the bank said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The bank has
previously denied wrongdoing and said it will fight the SEC&#8217;s
case because it is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, 31, has been placed on paid leave until an
unspecified date, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman said yesterday.

&lt;p&gt;Gryphon Holdings Inc.&#8217;s owner and four employees of the
Staten Island, New York-based investment firm were charged with
conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud in an
alleged $17.5 million scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Marsh, 43, Gryphon&#8217;s president, and the employees,
who are accused of falsely claiming endorsements from financier
George Soros, are scheduled to appear in court yesterday,
Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Benton Campbell said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors, usually elderly retirees, received unsolicited
e-mails and phone calls touting Gryphon&#8217;s services, according to
the statement. Once the victims provided contact information,
Gryphon&#8217;s employees used high-pressure tactics and
misrepresentations to sell more expensive versions of their
services, Campbell said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banca Carige Sues Citigroup Over Note, Swap Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Banca Carige SpA sued Citigroup Inc. for misrepresenting as
safe a deal that allegedly cost the northern Italian bank almost
all of its $47 million investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup put its own interests above Banca Carige&#8217;s in
January 2007 when it sold 10 million euros ($13.5 million) in a
fund-linked note to the bank&#8217;s insurance units and entered into
a 25 million euro fund-linked total return swap with Banca
Carige, according to the complaint filed yesterday in federal
court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banca Carige and the insurers &#8220;had no interest in risky or
speculative investments, and were looking only to obtain good,
consistent returns with as little risk as possible,&#8221; the Genoa-
based bank wrote in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup knew the investors&#8217; objectives and misrepresented
that the deal was a low-risk investment because the note and the
swap were linked to an offshore bond fund that &#8220;earned reliable
returns through an &#8216;arbitrage opportunity&#8217; with municipal
bonds,&#8221; Banca Carige said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Citi believes these claims are without merit and we will
defend ourselves vigorously,&#8221; Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based company, said by e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Banca Carige SpA v. Citigroup Inc., 10-cv-3310,

&lt;p&gt;Household International Sues Insurer Over Coverage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Household International Inc., found liable last year by a
Chicago jury for misleading investors about the company&#8217;s
business practices, sued an insurance company in a bid to force
payment of its legal bills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Princeton Eagle West Insurance Co., based in Hamilton,
Bermuda, is refusing to provide $25 million of coverage,
contending that some of the claims in the lawsuit predate Nov.
1, 2000, when the policy went into effect, Household Financial
said yesterday in documents in federal court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is virtually certain that the entire limits of the
Princeton policy will be needed for ongoing defense costs,&#8221;
Household said in its statement of claim. &#8220;Princeton flatly
denied Household&#8217;s request for payment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury last May 8 found the company and three executives
including Chief Executive Officer William Aldinger, misled
investors from 1994 to 2005 with reckless remarks in financial
statements, inflating the value of the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The insurance case is Household International Inc. v.
Princeton Eagle West Insurance Co. 1:10-cv-02418. U.S. District

&lt;p&gt;Judge Calls New York&#8217;s Greenberg Case &#8216;Devastating&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York&#8217;s case against American International Group Inc.&#8217;s
former Chief Executive Officer Maurice &#8220;Hank&#8221; Greenberg is
&#8220;devastating,&#8221; State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos said
yesterday during a court hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2005 by
then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer that accused
Greenberg, 84, and former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard
Smith of using sham reinsurance deals and other transactions to
distort the reported financial condition of the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Attorney General David Ellenhorn yesterday told
Ramos that Greenberg directed or participated in fraudulent
transactions. David Boies, Greenberg&#8217;s lawyer, said the state
had &#8220;failed&#8221; and was relying on hearsay and inadmissible
evidence from a federal case in which Greenberg wasn&#8217;t a
defendant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can see big problems with establishing a defense&#8221; to
the state&#8217;s claims about securities fraud, Ramos told Boies.
&#8220;Mr. Ellenhorn has put together a devastating case, a strong
case, and we both know it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg&#8217;s lawyers and attorneys from New York Attorney
General Andrew Cuomo&#8217;s office are each asking Ramos in Manhattan
to grant their motion for summary judgment, or a decision before
trial. Greenberg has also asked, in the alternative, for Ramos
to dismiss the lawsuit. The former CEO wasn&#8217;t in court
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg has accused Spitzer of using the case to promote
his political career, according to a filing in state Supreme
Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rorech Testifies in First Insider-Trading Default-Swap Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon-Paul Rorech, the Deutsche Bank AG bond salesman who&#8217;s a
defendant in U.S. regulators&#8217; first insider-trading case over
credit-default swaps, took the stand in the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Rorech,
39, of illegally feeding information on a 2006 bond sale by
Dutch media company VNU Group BV to Renato Negrin, 46, a former
Millennium Partners LP portfolio manager. Negrin, Rorech&#8217;s co-
defendant, bought swaps to reap a $1.2 million profit when the
deal was announced, the SEC said in a complaint in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy Brown, an SEC lawyer, asked Rorech yesterday if he
understood in July 2006 that Deutsche Bank had &#8220;restricted&#8221;
VNU&#8217;s securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At one point I believe we were restricted from trading
securities but I did not believe I was restricted from
soliciting,&#8221; Rorech responded. &#8220;How can you market without
discussing what the relevant securities are?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rorech, who is on paid administrative leave from Deutsche
Bank, is scheduled to continue his testimony today. U.S.
District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan is hearing the
nonjury trial, which began April 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC didn&#8217;t accuse Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank or New
York-based hedge fund Millennium of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission&#8217;s civil suit focuses on efforts by VNU,
later renamed Nielsen Co., to restructure its debt as part of a
7.5 billion euro ($10 billion) leveraged buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After complaints from potential investors that the $1.67
billion in bonds wouldn&#8217;t be covered by existing VNU credit-
default swaps, VNU created a tranche of bonds that would be
covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Rorech tipped Negrin about the restructuring
before that announcement. Negrin bought 20 million euros of
swaps, and profited by selling them after the deal was announced
and the swap price rose, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negrin is liable because he knew, or should have known,
Rorech had a duty to keep the information private, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rorech and Negrin argue that the SEC has no jurisdiction
over the credit-default swaps because they are private
contracts, not securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Rorech,
1:09-cv-04329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former IKB Chief May Call More Witnesses After Goldman Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG Chief Executive
Officer Stefan Ortseifen may call more witnesses at his German
criminal trial following the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortseifen, 59, is on trial on charges that he failed to
warn investors about the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage
market before the bank was forced to seek a government bailout.
The bank lost nearly all of its $150 million investment in the
subprime-mortgage related products at the center of the SEC case
against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are considering calling more and other people to
witness in the case,&#8221; Rainer Hamm, his lawyer, said in an
interview at a court in Dusseldorf, Germany, where Ortseifen is
being tried for misleading investors. Ortseifen is observing the
Goldman development &#8220;with big interest&#8221; and it is too early to
say if he will change his defense strategy, the lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB was bailed out in 2007 by KfW Group and banking
associations and has received guarantees of as much as 12
billion euros ($16.2 billion) from the Soffin bank-rescue fund.
Ortseifen is charged with misleading investors by downplaying
the effect of the real estate crisis in a press release on July
20, 2007. Ortseifen stepped down nine days later and shares of
IKB fell 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC says a Goldman executive misled a collateral
manager, ACA Management LLC, and IKB about Paulson&#8217;s role. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German case is LG Dusseldorf, 14 KLs 6/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab Agrees to Pay $200 Million in Fund Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Charles Schwab Corp. said it agreed to pay $200 million to
settle claims that it misled investors on the amount of
mortgage-backed securities held by its Schwab YieldPlus Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab signed a memorandum of understanding to settle the
claims filed in 2008 by paying the $200 million to plaintiffs,
without admitting liability and avoiding trial, the San
Francisco-based company said yesterday in a statement. The
settlement agreement cuts first-quarter net income by $105
million, or 9 cents a share, bringing the company&#8217;s net income
reported last week down to $14 million, or 1 cent per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit alleged that Schwab incorrectly described the
fund, once the world&#8217;s largest short-term bond fund, as
&#8220;safe.&#8221; The plaintiffs sought damages of as much as $802
million, the estimate of losses made by their lawyers&#8217; experts.
A trial was scheduled for May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab had denied wrongdoing, saying the fund&#8217;s losses were
caused by the collapse of the financial markets. U.S. District
Judge William H. Alsup denied Schwab&#8217;s bid to dismiss the case
earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Charles Schwab Corp. Securities
Litigation, 08-cv-01510, U.S. District Court, Northern District
of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schottenfeld Settlement in Galleon SEC Case Approved &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schottenfeld Group LLC won a judge&#8217;s approval of a $763,000
settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in
the Galleon Group LLC insider-trading investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in New York approved the
agreement in an order yesterday. Schottenfeld Group agreed to
pay $460,475 in disgorgement, $72,203 in interest and a $230,238
civil penalty, according to a March 29 letter from the SEC to
Rakoff. The firm also agreed to implement policies to assure
compliance with securities laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon founder Raj Rajaratnam is accused in both civil and
criminal cases of using secret tips from hedge fund executives,
corporate officials and other insiders to earn millions of
dollars in illegal stock trades. Rajaratnam and Danielle Chiesi,
a New Castle Funds LLC consultant, are among 21 people who were
charged criminally since October in two overlapping insider
trading cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zvi Goffer and David Plate, formerly of Schottenfeld Group,
have pleaded not guilty in the criminal case. Gautham Shankar, a
former trader at Schottenfeld Group, pleaded guilty and is
cooperating with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schottenfeld Group&#8217;s disgorgement represents the amount the
firm either profited or avoided losing in the Galleon case,
according to the SEC&#8217;s letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-1184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The
SEC case is SEC v. Galleon Management LP, 09-cv-08811, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Siemens Managers Get Suspended Terms Over Bribery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former managers at Siemens AG, Europe&#8217;s biggest
engineering company, were found guilty of breach of trust by a
Munich court and received suspended sentences and fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former unit chief executive officer, identified only as
Joerg Michael K., 55, received a suspended sentence of two years
and was ordered to pay 160,000 euros ($215,000), the Munich
court said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. The head of
accounting at the unit, Hans-Werner H., 55, received an 18-month
suspended sentence and was ordered to pay 40,000 euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both men tolerated and supported a system of slush funds
at Siemens,&#8221; the court said. The system was &#8220;set up for the
sole purpose of paying bribes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens, based in Munich, has been embroiled in a bribery
scandal since 2006, leading to investigations in at least a
dozen countries, revealing it paid kickbacks and bribes to win
contracts. Siemens agreed to pay $1.6 billion to settle probes
in the U.S. and Germany in 2008. Prosecution of individual
managers has been ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joerg Michael K., who joined Siemens in 1974, became the
head of the communications unit in 2001. He was told about the
system of slush funds and chose not to stop it. He later gave
another Siemens employee in charge of organizing the system
powers to sign sham contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hans-Werner H., who learned about the scheme in 2003,
didn&#8217;t have his accounting staff thoroughly review the
transactions, according to the court. Between 2002 and 2004, the
system put 49 million euros in the slush funds which were used
for bribery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer Agrees to Settle Wisconsin Medicaid Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, the world&#8217;s largest privately
held drugmaker, agreed to pay $7.75 million to settle Wisconsin
claims that it overcharged a government health program for
medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Boehringer Ingelheim
Roxane, Roxane Laboratories and Ben Venue Laboratories, all
units of Boehringer, agreed to pay the state Medicaid program $7
million and $750,000 to Miner, Barnhill  Galland PC for legal
fees, in a settlement announced yesterday by Wisconsin Attorney
General J.B. Van Hollen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement again demonstrates to anyone who attempts
to defraud medical assistance programs that my office will
pursue them to the fullest extent of the law,&#8221; Van Hollen said
in a statement. The state won&#8217;t &#8220;line the pockets of those who
would engage in deceptive and fraudulent pricing activities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boehringer, based in Ingelheim, Germany, complies with all
federal and state Medicare and Medicaid guidelines, Amy Kunkel,
a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This case was settled to end expensive and disruptive
litigation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Wisconsin acknowledged that the
settlement did not constitute an admission of fault or liability
by Boehringer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is State of Wisconsin v. Abbott Inc., 04-cv-1709,
Dane County (Madison). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vodafone, O2 Win U.K. Appeal of Price Controls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Vodafone Group Plc, Telefonica SA&#8217;s O2 unit and other
mobile network operators overturned a U.K. ruling that applied
retroactive price controls that cut fees they charge to connect
callers from other networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal in London yesterday ruled that a lower
court couldn&#8217;t force the U.K.&#8217;s telecommunications regulator
Ofcom to apply a court-ordered reduction of limits on
&#8220;termination fees&#8221; back to 2007. The other operators are
France Telecom SA&#8217;s Orange unit and Deutsche Telekom&#8217;s T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m satisfied that the tribunal has no power to direct
Ofcom to impose revised price controls on a retrospective
basis,&#8221; said the three judge panel. The money involved in the
case amounts to &#8220;hundreds of millions of pounds,&#8221; the judges
said in the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a victory for Ofcom, which challenged a
finding by the Competition Appeal Tribunal that it should apply
price controls retroactively when charges are reduced further by
a court. Ofcom was ordered in 2009 to further cut price controls
it had already lowered in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simon Gordon, a Vodafone spokesman, and Simon Lloyd, a
spokesman for O2, didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama Considers Corporate Lawyer for Justice Department Job &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James M. Cole, a corporate defense lawyer who served as an
independent monitor of American International Group Inc., is
being vetted by the Obama administration for the No. 2 job at
the Justice Department, according to a person familiar with the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cole, a partner at Bryan Cave LLP in Washington and a
former Justice Department prosecutor, would replace former
Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden, who left office earlier
this year. If nominated by Obama, Cole would need to be
confirmed by the Senate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cole was an official with the Justice Department for 13
years before entering private practice, according to his law
firm&#8217;s Web site. His law practice includes advising companies on
securities, regulatory and criminal law matters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers Made $60,000 From U.K. Insider Scam, Prosecutors Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two attorneys who worked at the London offices of U.S. law
firms made illegal trades in NeuTec Pharma Ltd. after the
company&#8217;s financial director leaked information about a proposed
takeover, prosecutors told a court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Rimmington, a former corporate partner at Dorsey 
Whitney LLP,  Michael McFall, an ex-corporate partner at
McDermott Will  Emery LLP and NeuTec&#8217;s former financial
director Peter King are on trial for insider trading in a case
brought by the Financial Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Michael Bowes said the two lawyers made a profit
of 39,000 pounds each ($60,000) in June 2006 after King gave
McFall an early warning about Basel-based Novartis AG&#8217;s plan to
purchase NeuTec. McFall then passed the information on to
Rimmington, Bowes said. The men deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will present their defense later in the case, which is
scheduled to last six weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FirstRand Ltd., South Africa&#8217;s
second-biggest financial services company, delayed plans to sell
at least 500 million euros ($671 million) of bonds after probes
into Goldman Sachs Group Inc. made market pricing volatile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman Sachs case combined with the travel lockdown
in Europe introduces quite a lot of volatility into our
pricing,&#8221; Treasurer Andries du Toit said in an interview.
&#8220;We&#8217;d still like to enter the international market but we&#8217;re
not going to do it at any cost. We&#8217;ve got quite a lot of surplus
liquidity in foreign currency from internal sources.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johannesburg-based FirstRand said April 7 that it planned
to sell five-year bonds in Asia and Europe to fund expansion in
Africa. FirstRand said the bonds were likely to be sold in
dollars but could also be issued in &#8220;multiple currencies&#8221;
including euro, pounds, yen or rand, depending on demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International markets were rocked this week after the
Securities and Exchange Commission on April 16 announced it was
suing Goldman Sachs for fraud tied to collateralized debt
obligations. Regulators&#8217; probes into Goldman spread to Europe
this week after U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown called for an
inquiry in Goldman&#8217;s activities in Britain while a spokesman for
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that country&#8217;s financial
regulator had asked the SEC for details on the Goldman suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markets were also roiled after thousands of travelers were
stranded by an Icelandic volcanic ash cloud that disrupted
flights to Europe from destinations across the world. Airlines
have lost an estimated $1.7 billion in revenue following the
April 14 eruption of Iceland&#8217;s Eyjafjallaj&#246;kull volcano, the
International Air Transport Association said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FirstRand has not canceled its planned sale of
international debt and is likely to reconsider the issue later
this year &#8220;once markets stabilize,&#8221; said du Toit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.,
Standard Chartered Plc and UBS AG were hired to manage the sale,
due Toit confirmed last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- India&#8217;s main opposition Bharatiya
Janata Party rallied supporters through the streets of New Delhi
today to demand the government move to ease prices it says are
hurting the poor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesters marched from near the Indian capital&#8217;s historic
Red Fort to Jantar Mantar, an 18th-century observatory near the
country&#8217;s Parliament. Food-price inflation has stayed above 15
percent since November, contributing to two interest rate
increases in a month by the Reserve Bank of India. The BJP
estimates 300,000 people will take part in today&#8217;s demonstration,
Times Now television said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rally is to show the people&#8217;s anger for the inaction
of the government to contain prices,&#8221; said Nirmala Sitharaman,
a BJP spokeswoman. &#8220;There has been no concrete step by the
government&#8221; to contain prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Party supporters from 28 states have been brought to New
Delhi on special trains and buses, the BJP said. The gathering
of protesters blocked roads in parts of the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s benchmark wholesale-price inflation rate in March
stood at 9.9 percent, almost doubling since November. To slow
the fastest inflation among Group of 20 nations, the central
bank yesterday raised interest rates and ordered lenders to set
aside more cash as reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing food prices &#8220;is a problem of such severity that
common man does not know what he has to do and how to live with
limited income,&#8221; Sitharaman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BJP members walked out of Parliament. &#8220;People have come to
tell their sufferings to the government,&#8221; said leader Sushma
Swaraj. &#8220;We are going to join them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has vowed to bring inflation
under control. Inflation is a sensitive issue in India, where
the World Bank 2008 estimate showed that three-fourths of the
1.2 billion people live on less than $2 a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other opposition parties including the Communist Party of
India (Marxist) and the Samajwadi Party have announced plans to
use a vote in Parliament to force Singh&#8217;s administration to roll
back duties on fuel imposed in February&#8217;s budget. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, won an appeals patent case in Germany
over its file allocation table technology, or FAT, that allows
older computer operating systems to run alongside new software
using long file names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Court of Justice granted Microsoft&#8217;s appeal
against a lower court ruling, the court said in an e-mail today.
The case concerned the validity of European Patent EP 0618 540
in Germany. After hearing the case yesterday, the country&#8217;s top
civil tribunal overturned a ruling by Germany&#8217;s Federal Patent
Court that said the patent must be voided as it didn&#8217;t contain
an invention of new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology can be used by devices including digital
cameras and automotive navigation systems. Microsoft, holding
equivalent U.S. patents, last year sued Dutch navigation-device
maker TomTom NV over the technology used in global-positioning
systems for cars. The companies settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent protects technology that makes Microsoft&#8217;s MS-
DOS operating system, which can only handle files of up to eight
digits, compatible with applications that use longer names. It
allowed Microsoft to introduce its VFAT file system, making it
compatible with MS-DOS&#8217;s FAT file system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Patent Court had argued that the Rock Ridge
Interchange Protocol, used for file storages on CD-ROMs, had
already introduced the method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BGH, X ZR 27/07. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, told Japanese clients
the collateralized debt obligation at the center of a Securities
and Exchange Commission suit wasn&#8217;t sold in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs also said its Japanese asset management unit
didn&#8217;t participate in structuring or selling the CDO, according
to a Japanese-language letter to clients, a copy of which was
obtained by Bloomberg News. Representatives from the firm will
visit clients to provide additional explanation if requested,
the letter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are explaining to our clients in Japan that the
synthetic CDO in question was not sold in Japan,&#8221; said Hiroko
Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based Goldman Sachs spokeswoman. Matsumoto,
who confirmed the contents of the letter, said Japanese clients
began receiving it earlier this week. She declined to
comment on their responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, alleging that the
New York-based company misled investors in a collateralized debt
obligation, called Abacus 2007-AC1. U.K. Prime Minister Gordon
Brown has asked for Britain&#8217;s Financial Services Authority to
start an inquiry, as the ramifications of the suit affect the
company globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold the CDO, which was
linked to subprime mortgages, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicle. The hedge fund wasn&#8217;t sued by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in its letter to Japanese clients said the
SEC suit is &#8220;completely unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said yesterday its net income rose 91 percent to
$3.46 billion, or $5.59 per share, in the three months through
March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary
was sued by a former employee who said the bank fired him
without cause and breached a spinout agreement that allowed him
to leave with the private equity team and platform he managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varun Kumar Bery, former head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Private Capital
Asia unit, filed the complaint on Monday against his former
employer in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First Instance claiming damages
&#8220;in the region of US$30.8 million.&#8221; JPMorgan spokeswoman Marie
Cheung declined to comment on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint, Bery joined JPMorgan in January
2008 after negotiations with Gaby Abdelnour, the bank&#8217;s Asia-
Pacific chairman and chief executive officer, to establish a
private equity group within the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint states that after a firm-wide reorganization
in 2009 when JPMorgan disbanded an investment-banking unit that
bet on leveraged buyouts, hedge funds and real estate, the head
of a new global special opportunities business, Chris Nicholas,
indicated the bank wouldn&#8217;t commit more capital to Bery&#8217;s group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdelnour told Bery that JPMorgan &#8220;did not intend to
permit&#8221; the spinout, or departure of the business, according to
the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bery, 51, alleges the bank later acknowledged through its
lawyers breaching the spinout agreement and &#8220;did not proceed
expeditiously, constructively or responsively with the
negotiations&#8221; of finalizing the spinout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund manager is seeking a court order for the bank to
carry out the agreement and to recover any losses due to the
delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is HCCL9/2010 in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First
Instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European non-financial
companies may sell Kangaroo bonds for the first time in four
years to profit from historically-low currency swap costs,
according to Goldman Sachs JBWere Pty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. affiliate is in talks with
potential borrowers about sales of local-currency notes in
Australia, head of debt capital markets Robert Foale said in an
interview in Sydney, declining to name the companies. Vodafone
Group Plc raised A$265 million ($247 million) in August 2006 in
the last Kangaroo sale by a non-financial company, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think you&#8217;ll see new corporate names in the Kangaroo
market in the next six months, and over the next 12 months it
should build up some momentum,&#8221; Foale said. &#8220;If they can
access a new market, diversify funding and currency, and they
don&#8217;t have to pay up for it, it&#8217;s a great opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scottish Power Ltd. and Vodafone were among overseas
companies that sold bonds in Australia before the 2008 collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. spurred investors to retreat to
the relative safety of government debt, closing the Kangaroo
market to all but supranational lenders and state-backed
borrowers. JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised A$700 million from
Kangaroo notes last month after credit markets thawed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Contributions from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. employees threaten to become toxic campaign assets
for both political parties facing elections this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be hard for Democrats to make the accusation
about Republicans because the president raised so much Goldman
Sachs money,&#8221; said John Feehery, a Republican political
strategist who advised former House Speaker Dennis Hastert. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donations from the bank&#8217;s employees became an issue when
U.S. Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias pushed his Republican
opponent in Illinois to return such contributions after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed a fraud lawsuit April
16 against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias said the money sent to the campaign of his
opponent, Republican congressman Mark Kirk, is &#8220;tainted,&#8221;
without saying whether President Barack Obama should return
almost $1 million that bank employees contributed to his White
House bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs employees tend to have a lot of money that
they can give to politicians,&#8221; Feehery said. &#8220;They are very
good at reading the marketplace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama and Democrats in Congress are proposing the most
sweeping financial regulation since the Great Depression. The
personal push by the president, who plans to deliver a speech on
the subject on April 22 at the Cooper Union in New York, comes
as Goldman reported its net income almost doubled in the first
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama, 48, a political mentor and basketball buddy to
Giannoulias, received the money from employees and their family
members, making Goldman Sachs second only to the University of
California as his biggest single source for donors in 2007 and
2008, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk, competing against Giannoulias for the seat once held
by Obama, ranks sixth for donations from Goldman employees, the
center&#8217;s data shows. The top five are Democratic Congressman
Michael McMahon of New York, Republican Senator Richard Shelby
of Alabama, and three other New York Democrats: Senator Kirsten
Gillibrand, Representative Scott Murphy and Senator Charles
Schumer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gillibrand, 43, will wait to see whether Goldman loses its
case, said Matt Canter, a spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is long-standing practice for the Gillibrand campaign
that if any contributor is found guilty of wrongdoing, then the
campaign immediately donates their contribution to charity,&#8221;
Canter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Democratic Party officials dismissed the significance of
Goldman campaign contributions to Obama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tooth and Nail&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would be a lot more interesting if Wall Street
banks, joined by Mark Kirk, weren&#8217;t fighting tooth and nail
against the needed reforms the administration is advocating,&#8221;
Hari Sevugan, Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sevugan didn&#8217;t respond to an e-mail query when asked
whether Obama plans to return money from Goldman Sachs
employees. Jen Psaki, a White House spokeswoman, deferred
questions about contributions to the DNC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias, 34, the Illinois treasurer, criticized Kirk
April 19 for taking what he said totaled $21,600 from Goldman
Sachs employees for the Senate campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk, a five-term congressman from Chicago&#8217;s northern
suburbs, said he wanted to &#8220;err on the side of caution&#8221; as the
SEC case unfolded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs spokesman, Lucas van Praag, declined to
comment yesterday on the question of contributions to Obama and
other politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still Counting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk, 50, said that his campaign is still determining how
much Goldman Sachs employees donated to him, and that he hasn&#8217;t
accepted money from the bank&#8217;s political action committee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and its employees and family members gave
$5.9 million to candidates in the 2007-2008 election cycle, data
from the Washington-based Center for Responsive Politics shows.
Three-quarters of that went to Democrats, the non-partisan group
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias&#8217;s campaign further criticized Kirk yesterday
for agreeing to return contributions to his Senate campaign and
not the full $54,010 it says Kirk has taken from Goldman
employees during his congressional career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His artfully worded pledge to return contributions made
only in the current cycle offers a fig leaf of ethical
propriety, but in reality is nothing more than a typical
Washington politician&#8217;s trick,&#8221; Giannoulias spokesman Matt
McGrath said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraud Allegations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC filed a civil suit alleging Goldman failed to tell
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., which planned to bet against the CDO, helped
select the underlying assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has denied the SEC&#8217;s accusations and Greg Palm,
co-general counsel, told analysts on a conference call yesterday
that the firm didn&#8217;t intentionally mislead anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Obama, Wall Street provided three of his seven biggest
sources of contributors for the 2008 presidential campaign. In
2007 and 2008, Goldman Sachs employees and family members gave
him $994,795, Citigroup Inc. $701,290, and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
$695,132. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathleen Strand, a Giannoulias spokeswoman, declined to
provide a yes or no response when asked whether Obama should
give money back to Goldman employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unlike President Obama, Republican Congressman Mark Kirk
takes Wall Street money hand over fist and then votes their way
every single time, including voting against Wall Street
reform,&#8221; she said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk&#8217;s Money Lead &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kirk raised $2.2 million during the first quarter of 2010
and ended the period with more than $3 million in the bank, his
campaign said April 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giannoulias raised $1.2 million during the first quarter
and ended the period with that amount in the bank, his campaign
said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate seat in Illinois is held by Democrat Roland
Burris, who isn&#8217;t seeking a full term. Republicans are trying to
take advantage of ethical problems experienced by Illinois
Democrats, including a public corruption trial set to begin June
3 for former Governor Rod Blagojevich, who appointed Burris to
complete Obama&#8217;s term. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. and former News
Corp. President Peter Chernin have discussed creating a
television channel for users of the Xbox video-game console,
said two people with knowledge of the proposal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel would be exclusive to subscribers of
Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox Live video-game network, said the people, who
sought anonymity because the talks are private. At an April 12
meeting in Redmond, Washington, Chernin suggested raising Xbox
Live&#8217;s monthly fee by $1 or $2 to add programming aimed at the
online service&#8217;s young, male target audience, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The channel would be owned jointly by Chernin and
Microsoft, said one of the people, and would offer reruns and
original shows. Chernin&#8217;s proposal underscores Hollywood&#8217;s
efforts to find new ways to convince viewers to pay for films
and TV shows delivered on the Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Peter is talking to lots of people about lots of ideas in
the digital space,&#8221; said Allan Mayer, his publicist. Mayer
wouldn&#8217;t comment on talks with Microsoft. Wayne Hickey, a
spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, hasn&#8217;t
responded to the proposal, both people said. The Redmond-based
company rose 32 cents to $31.36 yesterday on the Nasdaq Stock
Market. The shares have gained 2.9 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chernin also broached the idea for the channel with Conan
O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s representatives before the late-night comedian opted
for a show with Time Warner Inc.&#8217;s TBS, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Netflix, PS3 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox, Sony Corp.&#8217;s PlayStation3 and Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii now
provide access to programming including movie rentals from Los
Gatos, California-based Netflix Inc. Microsoft charges $7.99 a
month for multiplayer gaming on Xbox Live. A separate Netflix
subscription with online access to movies costs $8.99 a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PlayStation3, which offers free access to online gaming,
and Microsoft allow users to buy and rent TV shows and film
releases that include &#8220;Sherlock Holmes,&#8221; from Warner Bros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chernin stepped down as New York-based News Corp.&#8217;s second-
in-command on June 30, 2009, taking a film and television
production deal at Fox. He agreed to give the company&#8217;s
Twentieth Television and Twentieth Century Fox movie studio the
first option to buy any projects, according to regulatory
filings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest software maker, won an appeals patent case in Germany
over its file allocation table, or FAT, technology that allows
older computer operating systems to run alongside new software
using long file names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Court of Justice granted Microsoft&#8217;s appeal
against a lower court ruling, the court said in an e-mail
yesterday. The case concerned the validity of European Patent EP
0618 540 in Germany. After hearing the case April 20, the
country&#8217;s top civil tribunal overturned a ruling by Germany&#8217;s
Federal Patent Court that said the patent must be voided as it
didn&#8217;t contain an invention of new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology can be used by devices including digital
cameras and automotive navigation systems. Microsoft, holding
equivalent U.S. patents, last year sued Dutch navigation-device
maker TomTom NV over the technology used in global-positioning
systems for cars. The companies settled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent protects technology that makes Microsoft&#8217;s MS-
DOS operating system, which can only handle files of up to eight
digits, compatible with applications that use longer names. It
allowed Microsoft to introduce its VFAT file system, making it
compatible with MS-DOS&#8217;s FAT file system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Patent Court had argued that the Rock Ridge
Interchange Protocol, used for file storages on CD-ROMs, had
already introduced the method. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BGH, X ZR 27/07. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Gets Patent for Digital Camera Color-Correction Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., maker of the iPhone, iPod and iPad, received a
U.S. patent that may point the way to an iCamera for the
Cupertino, California-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday Apple Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs
tantalized investors with the promise of &#8220;extraordinary&#8221; new
products. And April 15 Apple filed a patent-infringement
complaint with the International Trade Commission to block
imports of some Eastman Kodak Co. digital cameras &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 7,701,489, which was issued to Apple April 20, is
for a method and apparatus for color correction in image-sensing
devices. The technology covered by the patent involved the use
of diffusers to determine the properties of the lighting
environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in contrast to many digital cameras&#8217; dependence on
software&#8217;s predetermined assumptions about lighting, according
to the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple applied for this patent in May 2003, with the
assistance of Blakely, Sokoloff, Taylor  Zafman LLP of Los
Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamaha Sued for Infringing Patents on Web Site Paper Models &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yamaha Motor Co., the motorcycle maker second in size only
to Honda Motor Co., was sued for patent infringement by a
Chicago-based patent owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper Models LLC accused Yamaha of infringing its patents
7,072,949 and 7,546,356, which were issued in July 2006 and June
2009 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two patents cover systems for providing paper model
replicas over a computer network. Yamaha&#8217;s &#8220;papercraft&#8221;
offerings on its Web site infringe these patents, Paper Models
claimed in a suit filed yesterday in federal court in Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When accessed yesterday, the Yamaha Web site entertainment
section featured pattern sheets and instructions for making
paper models of motorcycles, animals and various Japanese
cultural artifacts such as festival shrines, doll displays and
Samurai helmets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paper Models asked the court for an order barring Honda&#8217;s
future infringement of the two patents, and for money damages,
attorney fees and the costs of litigation, and requested that
any damage award be tripled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent holder is represented by Mark D. Roth of
Chicago&#8217;s Orum  Roth LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Paper Models LLC v. Yamaha Motors Corp., 1:10-
cv-02459, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bionovo Gets Patent for Metastatic Breast Cancer Treatment  &#8216; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bionovo Inc. received a patent on a method of using a
Chinese medicinal herb for the treatment of metastatic breast
cancer, the Emeryville, California-based company said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 7,700,136 covers the use of an extract of
Scutellaria barbata to arrest cancer cell growth and shrink
solid cancers. In addition to breast cancer, the patent also
covers the use of the extract to treat ovarian cancer. Bezielle
is Bionovo&#8217;s proprietary formulation of the extract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extract is formed from the above-ground portions of the
plant in either a water or alcohol-based solution, according to
the patent. The plant is a member of the mint family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent was issued April 20. Bionovo applied for the
patent in November 2008, with the assistance of Wilson, Sonsini,
Goodrich  Rosati of Palo Alto, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the company statement, Bionovo has had two
positive Phase 1 clinical trials of Bezielle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTA Text Released, Provides Damages Provisions, ISP Liability &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties to the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement
released a draft text of the accord yesterday, together with a
statement from the European Commission&#8217;s Directorate-General for
Trade that said &#8220;concerns&#8221; about the agreement &#8220;are
unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. is a party to the agreement, as are Australia,
Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Morocco, New
Zealand, Singapore and Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the elements in the agreement is the question of
damages for infringement. According to the draft text, judicial
authorities should consider &#8220;any legitimate measure of value&#8221;
including lost profits, value of the infringed good or service
measured by market price, the suggested retail price or the
profits of the infringer attributable to the infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One section of the agreement appears to offer the
possibility of preventative action. Judicial authorities will
have the authority to issue an order intended to prevent &#8220;the
imminent infringement&#8221; of an IP right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes the provisions that customs authorities can,
on their own authority, act to &#8220;suspend the release&#8221; of goods
suspected of infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement places the burden on Internet service
providers to &#8220;remove or disable access to infringing material
or infringing activity upon obtaining actual knowledge of the
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Sued for Infringement by Owner of &#8216;Prove It!&#8217; Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp.&#8217;s Toyota USA unit was sued for trademark
infringement by an Arizona resident who registered the phrase
&#8220;prove it!&#8221; as a U.S. trademark in 1998. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael D. Calmese of Phoenix accused Toyota of breaching a
license agreement to use the phrase that ended Dec. 31, 2009.
Toyota used the phrase in its promotions after that date without
authorization, according to the complaint filed April 19 in
federal court in Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He claims that he is damaged by the automaker&#8217;s
unauthorized use of his mark, in light of &#8220;the negative image&#8221;
the Japanese automaker has as a result of its recent recalls of
defective autos. By Toyota&#8217;s &#8220;not coming clean about its
acceleration and brake problems,&#8221; Calmese has potentially been
damaged by the association&#8221; with the company, he said in his
pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calmese claims he&#8217;s won trademark disputes with other
companies, and asked the court to award him money damages, and
extra damaged intended to punish the automaker for its alleged
infringement. He also seeks an award of attorney fees,
litigation costs and an order barring future infringement of his
mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is unrepresented by counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Calmese V. Toyota USA Inc., 2:10-cv-00857-JWS,
U.S. District Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Raid Nets Counterfeit Electronics Worth $2.7 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Singapore residents were arrested yesterday and
accused of being part of a syndicate that imported and sold
counterfeit electronics, the ChannelNewsAsia.com Web site
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officers in the intellectual property rights branch of
Singapore&#8217;s Criminal Investigation Department seized more than
15,000 fake electronic items, mainly mobile phones, with an
estimated value of $3.7 million Singapore dollars ($2.7
million), according to the news Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mobile phones were copies of well-known brands, and
were shipped from overseas, ChannelNewsAsia.com reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was the largest seizure of fake electronic goods in
three years, according to the news Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Livermore Lab Didn&#8217;t Take Nanotech Trade Secret, Jury Finds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawrence Livermore National Security, operator of the U.S.
Energy Department&#8217;s Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, didn&#8217;t steal
trade secrets from a Bay Area inventor, a jury in California&#8217;s
Alameda County Superior Court said April 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury rejected claims by Victor B. Kley and Berkeley,
California-based General Nanotechnology LLC that the lab stole a
nanotechnology process for the invention of a diamond capsule. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury found that the lab officials and scientists were
researching design of nanodiamond capsules years before they
were aware of Kley&#8217;s design, the lab&#8217;s lawyers said in a
statement. The capsules are used in fusion experiments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kley sued the lab management in California state court in
April 2008, alleging his technology was misappropriated and a
non-disclosure agreement was violated. He is a named inventor on
65 issued patents, according to the database of the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Livermore, California-based law was represented by
Patrick Michael, Dean Morehous and Nicole Norris of Chicago&#8217;s
Winston  Strawn LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is General Nanotechnology LLC v. Lawrence
Livermore National Security LLC, VG08384523, California Superior
Court, Alameda County. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capstone Group Hires IP Valuation/Damages Expert Michael Dansky &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capstone Advisory Group LLC hired Michael Dansky to lead
its litigation and forensic practice group, the Saddle Brook New
Jersey-based financial adviser group said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dansky joins from the Brattle Group where he was a
principle, with IP valuation and damages his area of expertise.
He has also served as president of Intellectual Property
Strategies, a group he founded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before that, he was a managing director for Huron
Consulting Group, vice president for corporate strategy and
business development at Polaroid Corp., and an executive with
both Xerox Corp. and Amoco Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dansky has an undergraduate degree in economics and
political science from Tufts University and a master&#8217;s degree in
business administration from George Washington University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, reported third-quarter revenue that
missed analysts&#8217; most optimistic predictions, a sign that
corporate customers may be putting off computer buying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, compared with
analysts&#8217; estimates that were as high as $14.8 billion for the
quarter that ended March 31. Shares fell in late trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer demand for personal computers, corporations
have hung back, avoiding purchases of new machines and long-term
contracts. Investors held out for added evidence of a spending
resurgence after chipmaker Intel Corp. last week forecast rising
sales this quarter and record profit margins for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Expectations were for more, given the strength we&#8217;ve seen
in PC sales,&#8221; Brendan Barnicle, an analyst at Pacific Crest
Securities, said in an interview from Portland, Oregon. He rates
the shares &#8220;outperform&#8221; and said he doesn&#8217;t own them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell $1.02, or 3.3 percent, to $30.37 in extended
trading after the report. The shares had risen 6 cents to $31.39
at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock
fell 3.9 percent last quarter, while the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500
Index rose 4.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income rose 35 percent to $4.01 billion,
or 45 cents a share, beating the average forecast of 42 cents in
a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Sales exceeded the $14.4 billion
average in the survey, reflecting rising demand for Windows 7,
the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putting Off Orders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, some companies are reluctant to place orders that
stretch over years. Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $12.3 billion. Analysts&#8217; average estimate was
$12.8 billion, according to Katherine Egbert, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. In January, Microsoft reported second-quarter
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates by 15 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deferred revenue was lower than expected, suggesting
that enterprise spending is still just beginning to recover,&#8221;
said Sarah Friar, a San Francisco-based analyst for Goldman
Sachs Group who has a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on Microsoft. &#8220;Enterprise
spending is still making its way out of the downturn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said operating expenses for the year ending June
30 will be $26.1 billion to $26.3 billion, compared with a
January prediction of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. Microsoft
no longer provides forecasts for sales and profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mixed Bag &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumer demand is still strong, but we also saw for the
first time growth in business hardware spending,&#8221; said Peter
Klein, Microsoft&#8217;s chief financial officer, in an interview.
Yet, it&#8217;s still taking longer to close multiyear deals. The
company did have growth in billings for multiyear agreements, he
said. &#8220;We are starting to fill that pipeline,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
think it will resolve itself over time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the third quarter a year ago, net income was $2.98
billion, or 33 cents a share, on sales of $13.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology bellwethers reporting earnings in recent weeks
have given a mixed picture of the rebound in technology
spending. Oracle Corp., the second-biggest software maker behind
Microsoft, last month forecast the fastest sales growth for new
software licenses since mid-2008. Intel, the world&#8217;s biggest
chipmaker, last week indicated that recovery may be gathering
steam with a forecast for rising sales this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People had thought there would be closer correlation
between what Intel said about PC demand and PC outlook&#8221; and
Microsoft&#8217;s results, said Sasa Zorovic, a Boston-based
analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott LLC. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t seem to
be the case.&#8221; He rates the shares &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, International Business Machines Corp. reported a
drop in services signings, showing corporate spending on larger
technology projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Business Division revenue, mostly from Office
productivity software, fell 5.9 percent to $4.24 billion as some
customers held off purchases before Microsoft begins rolling out
a new version next month. Server software sales were $3.58
billion, missing estimates from Goldman Sachs and UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sales of server computers have started to recover, it
will take longer for sales of Microsoft&#8217;s related software to
come back, Microsoft&#8217;s Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an
estimate from Morgan Stanley. Personal-computer shipments rose
27 percent last quarter, according to Gartner Inc. The PC market
bounced back from the year-earlier period, when the recession
dragged down shipments almost 7 percent -- the worst performance
since 2001, according to market research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business, Bing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s Business Division was reduced as the
company deferred some sales to a future quarter. The company
gave customers who have purchased older versions of Office the
right to upgrade to the new version, Office 2010, which is
available to businesses next month. It hits stores in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online advertising revenue rose 19 percent as search and
graphical display ad markets recovered, Klein said.&#160;Sales in the
company&#8217;s online business rose 11.6 percent to $566 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Bing search engine has increased the company&#8217;s
share of searches by 3.7 percentage points since Microsoft
overhauled the product in June, according to research firm
ComScore Inc. Microsoft had 11.7 percent of the U.S. search
market in March, compared with 65.1 percent for Google Inc. and
16.9 percent for Yahoo! Inc., according to ComScore. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Apr 22, 2010  4:52 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-22/microsoft-s-profit-gains-35-as-companies-buy-machines-with-latest-windows.html"><headline>Microsoft Sales Miss Some Predictions</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest software maker, reported third-quarter revenue that
missed analysts&#8217; most optimistic predictions, a sign that
corporate customers may be putting off computer purchases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, compared with
analysts&#8217; estimates that were as high as $14.8 billion for the
quarter that ended March 31. Shares fell in late trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft&#8217;s Windows business has benefited from
increased consumer purchases of personal computers, corporations
have hung back, avoiding spending on new machines and contracts
with the Redmond, Washington-based software maker. Customers may
also be refraining from deals that stretch over multiple years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have been looking for reasons to sell stocks,
even when the results are good,&#8221; Todd Lowenstein,
a fund manager for Highmark Capital Management, said in an
interview from Los Angeles. &#8220;They needed to deliver
near-perfect execution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell $1.40, or 4.5 percent, to $29.99 in extended
trading after the report. The shares had risen 6 cents to $31.39
at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock
fell 3.9 percent last quarter, while the Standard and Poor&#8217;s 500
Index rose 4.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income rose 35 percent to $4.01 billion,
or 45 cents a share. Unearned revenue, a measure of multi-year
contracts, was $12.3 billion, compared with $12.8 billion
anticipated by some analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said operating expenses for the year ending June
30 will be $26.1 billion to $26.3 billion, compared with a
January prediction of $26.2 billion to $26.5 billion. Microsoft
no longer provides forecasts for sales and profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last Quarter&#8217;s Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year earlier, net income was $2.98 billion, or 33 cents a
share, on sales of $13.6 billion. Net income in that period
included severance costs and impairments to investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, Microsoft beat analysts&#8217; estimates
for profit by 15 cents a year. Yet the company raised investors&#8217;
concerns by saying that gains were fueled by consumer demand as
business demand remained sluggish. Shares fell the day after the
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technology bellwethers reporting earnings in recent weeks
have given a mixed picture of the rebound in technology
spending. Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, last week
indicated that recovery may be gathering steam with a forecast
for rising sales this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel&#8217;s View &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel Chief Executive Officer Paul Otellini told analysts
corporate executives are starting to replace aging machines.
Oracle Corp., the second-biggest software maker behind
Microsoft, last month forecast the fastest sales growth for new
software licenses since mid-2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, International Business Machines Corp. shares dropped
yesterday after the company reported a drop in services
signings, showing corporate spending on larger technology
projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information-technology spending will climb 1.7 percent in
2010, after dropping 3.1 percent last year, according to an
estimate from Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be a gradual business cycle -- it&#8217;s not something
that happens in a single quarter,&#8221; Parakh said. &#8220;It will be
something that that goes on for a year or two, but it&#8217;s
important because Microsoft gets significant uplift from the
business versions of Windows.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PC Shipments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personal-computer shipments rose 27 percent last quarter,
according to Gartner Inc. That topped Gartner&#8217;s prediction of a
22 percent rise. The PC market bounced back from the year-
earlier period, when the recession dragged down shipments almost
7 percent -- the worst performance since 2001, according to
market research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue in Microsoft&#8217;s Business Division was reduced as the

</body></entry><entry author="By Rob Waters" date="Apr 22, 2010  4:18 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-22/-dead-as-doornail-gene-therapy-revival-spurs-hope-for-genzyme-pfizer.html"><headline>Gene Therapy Revival Spurs Hope for Genzyme, Pfizer</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, doctors drilled a
hole into Jean Erickson&#8217;s skull, pushed in a needle and injected
a cold virus modified to help transport a gene into her brain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gene&#8217;s job was to create a mini-factory within her
brain cells to pump out dopamine, a chemical that regulates
physical movement. Since then, Erickson has lived more
comfortably with Parkinson&#8217;s disease, a disorder that robs
patients of mobility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I stopped freezing up,&#8221; said Erickson, 71, a former pre-
school director who lives in Castro Valley, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erickson&#8217;s treatment was part of a gene therapy experiment
funded by Genzyme Corp., one of 354 U.S. studies employing the
technique, said the Food and Drug Administration. Eleven years
after the death of an 18-year-old boy led to the suspension of
some trials and close scrutiny by regulators, Bloomberg Business
Week will report in its April 26 issue that gene therapy is
experiencing a revival among scientists and drugmakers led by
Genzyme and Pfizer Inc. in the U.S. and Novartis AG in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite earlier negative publicity and disappointment,
the reality is that science has forged ahead,&#8221; said Brian
Sorrentino, a researcher at St. Jude Children&#8217;s Research
Hospital in Memphis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preliminary successes against brain and eye disorders are
helping to spur the renewed interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the journal Science reported that brain damage
in two 7-year-olds with an inherited condition called
adrenoleukodystrophy was halted or reversed in a gene therapy
experiment in Paris. Genetix Pharmaceuticals Inc., a closely
held Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company, has licensed the
treatment and is seeking to market it with backing from Genzyme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biotech&#8217;s Beginnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent advances have led some to compare the state of
gene therapy with the early days of biotechnology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were lots of ups and downs, lots of believers and
nonbelievers,&#8221; said Nick Leschly, a partner in Third Rock
Ventures, the lead investor last month in a $35 million
financing for Genetix. But &#8220;look at Roche&#8217;s Genentech portfolio
today: Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin. Right there, you&#8217;ve got
$17 billion in sales. That&#8217;s the kind of future we see for gene
therapy over time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corey Haas, a 9-year-old from Hadley, New York, was able to
&#8220;see stars&#8221; in the night sky for the first time after he and
11 others were treated with gene therapy at Children&#8217;s Hospital
of Philadelphia. The result was reported in October 2009 in the
journal Lancet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bubble Boy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy was first used in the early 1990s to treat 19
children with severe combined immunodeficiency disorder, or
SCID, the so-called Bubble-Boy disease. In SCID, children&#8217;s
damaged immune systems leave them unable to fight germs, making
infections potentially deadly. Researchers modified the
children&#8217;s blood cells to make more of a key enzyme they lacked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in an early setback that was a harbinger of others to
come, five children developed leukemia from the treatment. An
even more devastating failure occurred in 1999 when 18-year-old
Jesse Gelsinger died of a massive immune response within hours
of being treated for a liver disease at the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. That was followed in 2007 by the
death of a woman who received a modified gene in an arthritis
trial run by Targeted Genetics Corp. of Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gene therapy was dead as a doornail,&#8221; said Axel Polack,
a general partner in TVM Capital, a venture capital firm based
in Munich, in a telephone interview. &#8220;No one was investing
anymore. People were fed up with big promises and not seeing any
results.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Virus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the woman&#8217;s death in the arthritis trial was
tied to a fungal disorder and scientists linked Gelsinger&#8217;s
death to the virus used to deliver the gene, a modified
adenovirus, or cold germ. A different type, called an adeno-
associated virus, or AAV, triggers milder immune responses and
is now in use in many trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, small successes have breathed life into the
field, drawing support from companies led by Genzyme, which has
invested &#8220;well north&#8221; of $200 million over the past 10 years
and now has 80 to 90 employees working on the technology, said
Sam Wadsworth, a Genzyme group vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genzyme fell $1.01, or 1.9 percent, to $53.44 at 4 p.m. in
Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The company gained 4.1
percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Novartis, of Basel, Switzerland, licensed gene
treatments for hearing loss and balance disorders from GenVec
Inc., a Gaithersburg, Maryland, company with a $90 million
market cap, in a deal worth as much as $213 million. A month
later, Tacere Therapeutics, a San Jose, California, startup,
said New York-based Pfizer would license a hepatitis C treatment
in an agreement valued at as much as $145 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating Instructions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genes contain instructions for cells to make proteins that
carry out chemical reactions in the body, help the immune system
fight infections and form the basis of skin, muscle and bone.
When a gene is defective and can&#8217;t make the correct protein,
disease can occur. The idea of gene therapy is to treat disease
by replacing malfunctioning genes with healthy ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Philadelphia eye experiment the genes were delivered
directly to target cells via a virus injected into patients. In
the Paris tests, doctors removed the patients&#8217; blood-forming
stem cells, inserted gene-bearing viruses into them and
reinfused the patients with the modified cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. approvals for gene therapy will start coming in about
four years and the first one cleared may be for a hereditary eye
disease, predicted Philip Reilly, Genetix&#8217;s chief medical
officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right Targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gene therapy has matured,&#8221; said Ronald Crystal, a
researcher at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who
helped pioneer the field two decades ago. &#8216;Now the real
challenge is to choose the right targets, which diseases and,
from a commercial point of view, which markets make sense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now 189 companies developing gene therapies, an
increase from 44 in 1995, according to a report released this
month by Jain Pharmabiotech, a Basel, Switzerland-based market
research group. A 2009 report, from Global Industry Analysts,
based in San Jose, California, predicted gene therapy products
would have revenue of $465 million in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revival of gene therapy comes at a time when drugmakers
led by London-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc, in London, and Pfizer
are entering collaborations to develop drugs for rare diseases,
historically the turf of mid-size companies like Genzyme and
Dublin-based Shire Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common Neurological Conditions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With trials under way for Parkinson&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, hearing
loss and macular degeneration, gene therapy also has the
potential to move from rare genetic diseases to common
neurological conditions, said Zack Lynch, executive director of
the Neurotechnology Industry Organization, a San Francisco-based
trade group. In 2008, the market for drugs to treat Parkinson&#8217;s
disease alone was $3.6 billion, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a massive potential market,&#8221; Lynch said. Within
three years, he predicts, clinical trials will produce strong
evidence that gene therapies are effective for conditions of the
central nervous system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genzyme sponsored the 10-patient Parkinson&#8217;s disease trial
at the University of California, San Francisco, that included
Jean Erickson. Like most Parkinson&#8217;s patients, she takes a drug
that contains levadopa, which the brain converts to dopamine.
Over time, however, the medication becomes less effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study showed a gene injected into patients&#8217; brains
reached nerve cells in the region of the brain controlling
movement, said Michael Aminoff, the neurologist who led the
research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s an important finding because inserting genes isn&#8217;t
an exact science, said Krystof Bankiewicz, a University of
California, San Francisco, neurology professor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Blind Man&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every single gene therapy trial that has been done in the
brain, it was done by a blind man,&#8221; he said in an interview at
his office in San Francisco. &#8220;The neurosurgeon gets the patient
on the table, drills a hole and injects and hopes that the drug
has been delivered. But he doesn&#8217;t know that, he can&#8217;t see it.
He might as well close his eyes and inject.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erickson now spends more time in an &#8220;on-state&#8221; that lets
her move and function as she did before, said Chad Christine, a
neurologist who follows Erickson&#8217;s treatment. &#8220;Even after
almost five years, we haven&#8217;t made significant adjustments in
her medications,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not typical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genzyme is preparing to test the therapy, using an AAV
virus, in a larger trial that could begin next year, Genzyme&#8217;s
Wadsworth said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vision Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also is starting a study of up to 34 patients
with the so-called &#8220;wet&#8221; form of macular degeneration that
causes severe central-vision loss in 1.4 million U.S. residents
older than age 40, according to the American Academy of
Ophthalmology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy is unlikely to produce revenue for Genzyme, or
any company, for several years, said Phil Nadeau, an analyst at
Cowen  Co. in New York, in a telephone interview. Because of
that, it isn&#8217;t on the radar of most investors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the long haul it&#8217;s very intriguing and holds a lot
of promise, particularly for some of the rare disorders,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;But there have been a lot of fits and starts and, from a
public-market investment standpoint, it&#8217;s still too early.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since his September 2008 gene therapy treatment in one
eye, Corey Haas says he can ride his bike and recognize color.
Now he wants doctors to fix his other eye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, he said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going into Little League&#8221; to
play organized baseball. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mexico may have 10 to 12 initial

Eduardo Cepeda, head of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s local unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors view Mexico as &#8220;cheaper&#8221; than Brazil and
benefiting from a U.S. economic recovery, he said at a

Brazil, which is &#8220;going ballistic,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are realizing that Mexico is actually cheaper than

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and five past and present
executives will testify with Fabrice Tourre, the banker at the
center of U.S. fraud allegations, at a Senate hearing next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, Chief Risk Officer
Craig Broderick, former mortgage department head Daniel Sparks,
and current and former structured products group managing
directors Michael Swenson and Joshua Birnbaum were listed as
witnesses for the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations
hearing on April 27. The hearing will explore the role of
investment banks in the financial crisis, the panel said today
in an e-mail release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
and Tourre, 31, last week, claiming they misled investors in a
collateralized debt obligation. Tourre and Blankfein agreed to
speak publicly to show Goldman Sachs has nothing to hide, people
with knowledge of the matter said yesterday. Tourre plans to
tell the panel he did nothing wrong, one person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators claim that Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
firm in Wall Street history, misled investors by failing to
disclose that Paulson  Co., the hedge fund run by billionaire
John Paulson, helped select loans for the CDO and then bet
against them. Goldman Sachs, which is contesting the SEC&#8217;s
claims, has said it &#8220;will take all necessary steps to defend
the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama doesn&#8217;t plan
to give back almost $1 million in campaign contributions from
employees of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis, and in
this case we have not accepted contributions from specific
individuals accused of wrongdoing, nor have we advocated for
positions that big Wall Street banks generally favor,&#8221; Hari
Sevugan, a Democratic National Committee spokesman, said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donations from the bank&#8217;s employees have become an issue
for political candidates from both parties after the Securities
and Exchange Commission filed a fraud lawsuit April 16 against
Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flap comes as Obama and Democrats in Congress are
proposing the most sweeping changes to financial regulation
since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our system only works -- our markets are only free --
when there are basic safeguards that prevent abuse, that check
excesses, that ensure that it is more profitable to play by the
rules than to game the system,&#8221; Obama said today in a speech at
the Cooper Union in New York. &#8220;That is what the reforms we&#8217;ve
been proposing are designed to achieve -- no more, no less.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama, 48, received the contributions in 2007 and 2008 for
his White House bid. In an interview yesterday with CNBC, Obama
defended his fundraising. &lt;/p&gt;

Bernstein  Co. analyst Brad Hintz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not going to be a long-term impact on a Goldman,&#8221;
Hintz said in a Bloomberg Radio interview with Tom Keene.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen problems before on Wall Street. I don&#8217;t view this
as the end of Goldman.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, was sued by the SEC on April 16. Regulators claim that
in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market teetered, Goldman
Sachs created and sold a collateralized debt obligation linked
to subprime mortgages without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson
 Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC has a tough case here,&#8221; Hintz said, because the
case centers on a private placement, not an underwriting.
&#8220;There isn&#8217;t a lot of requirement for the placement agent in
terms of disclosure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pullback in equity trading with Goldman Sachs would be
temporary, Hintz said. The bank&#8217;s core businesses, which include
underwriting, prime brokerage and mergers and acquisitions, will
remain strong &#8220;as long as the partnership holds together,&#8221; he
said. The firm won&#8217;t suffer a so-called brain drain of employees
going to other firms, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s never any shortage of talent on Wall Street and
the MBAs lining up to come into Goldman Sachs,&#8221; Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Settlement Speculation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will probably negotiate settlement in which
provides no grounds for secondary civil litigation, and fight a
Section 10-B settlement, in which the bank would be open to
further litigation, Hintz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New-York based firm won&#8217;t be the last to face charges,
he said. According to Hintz, other firms are likely to be sued
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, which
protects the interests of participants in private pension and
benefits plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see an awful lot of these CDOs
attacked,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The ERISA argument&#8217;s going to be that the
portfolio manager managing the portfolio of the CDO did not act
correctly, and then you&#8217;re going to attack them on the
disclosures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares of Goldman Sachs fell for a third day, declining
1 percent to $157.37 at 1:25 p.m. in New York. The shares had
gained 9.1 percent this year before the charges were announced
last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
Geithner said his department didn&#8217;t get advance notice about the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit against
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; Geithner said on ABC&#8217;s Good Morning
America program today, when asked whether the Obama
administration received a preview of the enforcement action
before it became public. &#8220;That could never happen, it should
never happen. It&#8217;s a fully independent agency and they give no
warnings, no notice, no heads up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner said the executive branch is not involved in the
probe, and he declined to comment on the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy is getting &#8220;stronger&#8221; as it recovers
from the worst recession since the Great Depression, Geithner
also said. He predicted the economy would improve &#8220;gradually&#8221;
now that firms are starting to add workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geithner also praised an International Monetary Fund report
on how to make banks pay for the costs of cleaning up the
financial crises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a very good report,&#8221; Geithner said. &#8220;It did what
we asked for last September, which is take a look at how best to
do this.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate interview broadcast today on MSNBC, Geithner
said the U.S. is committed to reducing its budget deficit to
&#8220;acceptable&#8221; levels over the next five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also said the Obama administration would work to make
sure its relationship with China did not threaten the U.S.
economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency Peg &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is the biggest foreign holder of U.S. government debt
and also has kept its currency pegged to the dollar since 2008,
amid calls from President Barack Obama and others to let the
currency appreciate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not beholden to China,&#8221; Geithner said. &#8216;We&#8217;re
going to work very hard to make sure that our firms that compete
in China, compete with China around the world and in the United
States are competing on a level playing field and we&#8217;re working
very hard to encourage the Chinese to work in that direction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-
sponsored mortgage companies that have been in conservatorship
since 2008, Geithner said their situation has been a &#8220;colossal
mess, colossal mistake, never should have happened.&#8221; He said
the Obama administration plans to &#8220;change that system
completely&#8221; when it makes housing proposals to Congress next
year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;California&#8217;s treasurer said six
investment banks that underwrite the state&#8217;s bonds traded $27.5
billion in credit-default swaps on them since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasurer Bill Lockyer said the banks are JPMorgan Chase

Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trading figure includes buys and sells the firms
completed for themselves or their clients, including hedge

according to information provided by the six underwriters,
Lockyer said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blackstone Group LP&#8217;s chief
executive officer said his company will remain a &#8220;major
client&#8221; of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and that he&#8217;s never doubted
the firm&#8217;s ethics in his 40-year career. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve never had any circumstance where there&#8217;s been a
question about their ethical character,&#8221; CEO Stephen Schwarzman
said today on a conference call. &#8220;We&#8217;re a major client of
Goldman&#8217;s and will continue to be a major client of Goldman&#8217;s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone, the world&#8217;s biggest private-equity company,
follows Goldman Sachs clients including Ford Motor Co. and
Macy&#8217;s Inc. in saying it will stick with the firm after it was
sued for fraud by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
last week. New York-based Goldman Sachs has called the
allegations &#8220;unfounded in law and fact&#8221; and vowed to
&#8220;vigorously contest&#8221; them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwarzman, 63, who said he worked with Goldman Sachs for
40 years, helped found Blackstone 25 years ago. Before
Blackstone, Schwarzman was employed by Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., a rival to Goldman Sachs that went bankrupt in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blackstone and Goldman Sachs also compete when it comes to
private-equity investments, with Goldman Sachs raising a
$20 billion leveraged-buyout fund -- the company&#8217;s sixth -- in
2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said that in early 2007, as the U.S. housing market
teetered, Goldman Sachs created and sold a collateralized debt
obligation linked to subprime mortgages without disclosing that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities
and bet against the vehicle, known as Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed that the SEC would bring this
action,&#8221; Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, Greg Palm, told
analysts and investors earlier this week. &#8220;We would never
intentionally mislead anyone, certainly not our clients or our
counterparties.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greece is likely to cut or delay
payments to bond investors even as the country negotiates a
bailout package with the European Commission and International
Monetary Fund, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Look out for signs that the government might offer a
voluntary debt-restructuring arrangement sometime over the next
few months,&#8221; Erik F. Nielsen, chief European economist at
Goldman Sachs in London, wrote in a report. &#8220;A large multi-year
official rescue package combined with a voluntary debt
restructuring would create a much longer breathing space for the
government to undertake the necessary reforms.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek two-year notes plunged today, pushing the yield up by
the  most on record, as Prime Minister George Papandreou&#8217;s
government began a second day of talks in Athens with euro-
region and IMF officials on a 45 billion-euro ($60 billion) aid
package for the country. Moody&#8217;s cut Greece&#8217;s credit rating
today on the expectation that its debt load will be higher and
more costly than previously estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Markets are in the process of pricing in some kind of
rescheduling or exchange,&#8221; said Robin Marshall, who helps
oversee about $20 billion as director of fixed income at Smith 
Williamson Investment Management in London. &#8220;The protracted
nature of the resolution of this is not helping sentiment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget Deficit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papandreou has failed to convince investors Greece can
narrow a budget deficit that is more than four times the
European Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product. The
government may activate the bailout before the end of the Athens
talks, which may last up to three weeks, Finance Minister George
Papaconstantinou said yesterday. Speculation about a debt
restructuring is &#8220;absurd,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the cost of protecting Greek bonds against default
rose to a record 524 basis points today, that&#8217;s little more than
half the 1,000-level that typically signals a default may be
imminent. Credit default swaps on Iceland rose to 1,473 in
October 2008 before it was rescued by the IMF, according to CMA
DataVision closing prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do not think we are about to cross into the territory
of forced debt restructurings,&#8221; Nielsen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Greek 10-year bonds surpassed 9 percent today,
driving the premium, or spread, over bunds to 577 basis points
as of 4 p.m. in London, the most since Bloomberg began
collecting the data in March 1998. The spread averaged about 62
basis points during the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds Tumble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year Greek bond yield climbed 86 basis points to
9.02 percent, with the two-year note yield jumped 270 basis
points to 10.86 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU&#8217;s statistics office said today that Greece&#8217;s deficit
was 13.6 percent last year, higher than the government&#8217;s April 7
forecast of 12.9 percent. The EU forecast a shortfall of 12.7
percent in November. The Greek Finance Ministry said it will
maintain a goal to cut its 2010 deficit by four percentage
points of gross domestic product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although the Greek government appears to be on, or even
ahead of, schedule in terms of the implementation of the actions
laid out in its Stability and Growth Program, the difficult
macroeconomic and financial environment has made continued
adherence to the program considerably more challenging,&#8221; Sarah
Carlson, the lead Moody&#8217;s analyst on Greece, wrote in the
statement accompanying the downgrade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece needs to pay investors 8.1 billion euros on May 19
and a further 28.2 billion euros by the end of 2011, according
to Bloomberg calculations. The government must raise about 30
billion euros by the end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Severe Damage&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece&#8217;s borrowing costs more than doubled at an auction of
1.95 billion euros of three-month bills on April 20 amid concern
the nation will default unless it taps the bailout package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU would fight any suggestion of debt restructuring by
Greece, because it would imply a failure of the bloc&#8217;s bailout
plan, according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even a voluntary restructuring should be seen as a
disaster,&#8221; Harvinder Sian, a senior bond strategist at RBS in
London, wrote in an e-mailed report today. &#8220;It would mean the
failure of the EU to buy Greece time, a prelude to eventual
Greek default and then EMU breakup. The big picture would be
horrendous.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek civil servants held their fourth national walkout
this year to protest austerity measures. The strike shut
hospitals and schools and is also affecting ministries,
government offices and the Acropolis, home to the 2,500-year-old
Parthenon temple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Fire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papandreou is under fire from voters who say his austerity
measures have gone too far and from investors who argue that
further action is needed to cut the EU&#8217;s largest budget deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may be at the limit of the austerity measures that are
practical for the Greek government,&#8221; said Marshall. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
danger that it becomes self-defeating, because you just bury the
economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek bonds are expensive even with 10-year yields at 8
percent given the skepticism about the country&#8217;s ability to
close its budget deficit, according to Blackstone Group LP
senior managing director Byron Wien. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have the PIIGS -- Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece
and Spain -- in very difficult shape, enormous spread between
revenues and expenses, not much prospect of improving that any
time soon, so isn&#8217;t that similar to what would be a junk bond in
the U.S.?&#8221; Wien said in a Bloomberg Radio interview with Tom
Keene yesterday. &#8220;An 8 percent yield on Greek paper seems to me
to be too cheap.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bayerische Landesbank, the German
state-owned lender that said yesterday it would stop doing
business with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., retracted the comments
in part, saying it will continue to use the U.S. bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munich-based BayernLB only ended one advisory mandate with
Goldman Sachs after the firm was sued for fraud by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, spokesman Matthias Priwitzer
said by telephone today. BayernLB continues to work with Goldman
Sachs on other &#8220;typical banking businesses,&#8221; he added. Monika
Schaller, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BayernLB yesterday confirmed a Handelsblatt report that it
would stop doing business with Goldman Sachs. Chief Executive
Officer Gerd Haeusler cited the SEC allegations and wasn&#8217;t under
pressure from politicians when he notified the U.S. bank of the
decision this week, the newspaper reported, without saying where
it got the information. BayernLB believes the bank is innocent
until proven guilty, yet needed to act because the state lender
is under strict public scrutiny, Handelsblatt reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BayernLB needed 10 billion euros ($13.3 billion) in fresh
capital from the State of Bavaria amid the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Bank of Canada Governor
David Dodge said that fraud allegations against Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. may encourage regulators to create new rules that
fail to address the causes of the global credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is going to give a further push for tighter rules, I
am not sure we are going to take the right lesson,&#8221; Dodge said
in an interview in Ottawa. &#8220;The real lesson is to drive stuff
through transparent markets, whether it&#8217;s clearinghouses,
whether it&#8217;s exchanges, to standardize products.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund&#8217;s recommendation that the
Group of 20 nations consider a tax financial institutions to
help pay for future bailouts of the industry is an example of
rule that could create a problem, Dodge said. France and the
U.K. have already backed the idea of a tax on banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations yesterday from the IMF on bank taxes
are &#8220; very unhelpful,&#8221; said Dodge, who is also a co-chair of
the Global Market Monitoring Group of the Institute of
International Finance and who was nominated to the board of Bank
of Nova Scotia in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think what&#8217;s going to happen down in Washington
over the next couple of days is necessarily going to focus on
the right thing either,&#8221; Dodge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-20 meet in
Washington this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said yesterday that
new taxes on banks may end up weakening financial institutions
and fueling risky behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said last week
it is suing Goldman Sachs for fraud linked to derivatives.
President Barack Obama is speaking in New York today about
financial markets, and his spokesman said last night Obama will
say new regulations are needed so the country&#8217;s economic system
isn&#8217;t at the mercy of &#8220;risky decisions&#8221; on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When something like this happens, it certainly
strengthens the hand of Mr. Geithner and the U.S.
administration, and it strengthens the hand of the French
administration to have tougher rules,&#8221; Dodge said, referring to
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nevin Shapiro, chief executive
officer of Capitol Investments USA Inc., defrauded investors of
at least $80 million to fund his lavish lifestyle after raising
$880 million in a Ponzi scheme, U.S. prosecutors charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro, 41, raised money from at least 60 investors from
January 2005 to November 2009 to finance Capitol, a Miami Beach-
based wholesale grocery distribution business, authorities said
in a complaint unsealed yesterday in federal court in Newark,
New Jersey. Capitol and Shapiro &#8220;had virtually no legitimate
business during this time&#8221;, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shapiro surrendered to authorities after he was charged
with securities fraud and money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He misappropriated $35 million for his personal use, paying
millions of dollars in debts from illegal sports bets, buying
$400,000 in floor seats to Miami Heat professional basketball
games and buying diamond-studded handcuffs that he gave to a
&#8220;prominent professional athlete,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors forced Capitol Investments into involuntary
bankruptcy, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RBS Sued by MBIA Over $2 Billion Credit Protection &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc is being sued by MBIA
Insurance Corp., which is seeking to end an agreement to provide
$2 billion in default protection on credit derivatives after the
bank&#8217;s rating was downgraded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA&#8217;s LaCrosse Financial Products LLC unit agreed to
provide credit protection to RBS for 10 years, according to the
lawsuit filed in February in London and made public this week.
Under the deal, MBIA and LaCrosse were allowed to terminate the
deal if RBS&#8217;s credit rating fell below a specified level,
according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA, the largest bond insurer, asked the court to approve
ending the deal without stating what it would owe RBS if the
contract were allowed to stand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS, based in Edinburgh, Scotland, was bailed out with 45.5
billion pounds ($70 billion) in taxpayer aid between 2008 and
2009, more than any other bank in the world. It&#8217;s now majority-
owned by the U.K. government. Bond insurers including MBIA and Ambac Financial Group Inc. have sued banks including JPMorgan
Chase  Co., Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch  Co. and
GMAC LLC over home-loan securities they agreed to insure. &lt;/p&gt;

on the recruitment firm&#8217;s recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays was &#8220;unjustly enriched&#8221; by Pagoda after the
headhunter sent the bank Last&#8217;s resume in January 2009 and
wasn&#8217;t paid, according to documents filed with the Singapore
High Court. A pre-trial hearing was held on April 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last, Barclays Capital&#8217;s head of equity derivatives flow
sales for Asia, excluding Japan, was hired as a direct referral
after Pagoda failed to set up a meeting, Barclays&#8217;s lawyers from
Straits Law LLC said in the court filing. &#8220;There was never any
agreement for the engagement of&#8221; Pagoda, Barclays said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick Burnham, a partner at Pagoda, declined to comment on
the case. Last declined to comment, as did Clare Williams, a
Hong Kong-based spokeswoman for Barclays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pagoda Partners Pte. Ltd. v. Barclays Bank Plc,

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Sued by Fund Manager for $31 Million Over Spinout Pact &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. subsidiary was sued by a former
employee who said the bank fired him without cause and breached
a spinout agreement that allowed him to leave with the private
equity team and platform he managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varun Kumar Bery, former head of JPMorgan&#8217;s Private Capital
Asia unit, filed the complaint on Monday against his former
employer in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First Instance claiming damages
&#8220;in the region of US$30.8 million.&#8221; JPMorgan spokeswoman Marie Cheung declined to comment on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is HCCL9/2010 in Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of First
Instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Seeks to Intervene in Municipal Bond Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department wants to intervene in a civil
lawsuit alleging that Wells Fargo  Co., UBS AG, Morgan Stanley
and more than a dozen other financial institutions conspired to
rig bids for municipal derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department&#8217;s antitrust unit is seeking to limit the
pre-trial exchange of information among the parties in the civil
lawsuit, according to a court order April 20 by U.S. Magistrate
Judge Gabriel Gorenstein in Manhattan federal court. The 2008
lawsuit was brought by Mississippi, municipalities and other
bond issuers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department previously filed criminal charges in
a related bid rigging probe. In February, a former worker at CDR
Financial Products Inc. pleaded guilty to conspiring to rig
bidding on investment contracts sold to local governments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the civil lawsuit, banks, brokers and dealers are
accused of conspiring with one another to not compete and to rig
bids for municipal derivatives sold to issuers of municipal
bonds. The defendants allegedly allocated customers among
themselves and fixed and stabilized prices, including the interest rates paid to issuers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consolidated civil case is Hinds County, Mississippi v.
Wachovia Bank, 08-2516, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rorech Testifies He Didn&#8217;t Know Swaps Were Restricted &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jon-Paul Rorech, a Deutsche Bank AG salesman accused in
U.S. regulators&#8217; first case alleging insider-trading of credit-
default swaps, testified he didn&#8217;t know a company&#8217;s swaps were
on the bank&#8217;s restricted list when he took an order for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Rorech,
39, of illegally feeding information to Renato Negrin, a former
Millennium Partners LP portfolio manager, on a 2006 bond sale by
Dutch media company VNU Group BV. Negrin, 46, Rorech&#8217;s co-
defendant, bought swaps to reap a $1.2 million profit after the
deal was announced, the SEC said in a complaint in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC lawyer Nancy Brown yesterday showed Rorech part of
Deutsche Bank&#8217;s restricted list that she said made clear bank
employees in July 2006 weren&#8217;t allowed to solicit purchases of
the VNU swaps, though traders could make markets in them, or
take unsolicited offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised to hear we&#8217;re restricted to non-soliciting
because no one ever told us that in New York,&#8221; Rorech testified
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 17, 2006, Rorech sold VNU swaps to Negrin with a
face value of 10 million euros ($13.4 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rorech got information on activity in the VNU swaps from
traders that didn&#8217;t say they were restricted to unsolicited
orders as they normally would if that were the case, he
testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan is hearing
the nonjury trial, which began April 7. The SEC didn&#8217;t accuse
Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank or New York-based hedge fund
Millennium of wrongdoing. Rorech is on paid administrative leave
from Deutsche Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Rorech,
1:09-cv-04329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merck Should Refund Money Paid for Vioxx, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. misled Louisiana officials about the heart-
attack risks posed by its withdrawn Vioxx painkiller and should
be ordered to refund more than $11 million paid for the drug, a
lawyer for the state argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managers of Louisiana&#8217;s state-sponsored health programs
would have halted reimbursements for Vioxx prescriptions if they
had known the drug posed a greater heart-attack risk than
competing medicines, Stephen B. Murray Jr., one of the state&#8217;s
lawyers, said in closing arguments of a trial over the refund
claims. Merck had an obligation to fully disclose Vioxx&#8217;s health
risks, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They can&#8217;t just put their heads in the sand and pretend
there&#8217;s nothing wrong with the drug,&#8221; Murray told a federal
judge in New Orleans yesterday. It&#8217;s the first of more than a
dozen refund cases filed by states over Vioxx to go to trial.
&#8220;They can&#8217;t just wait for the bodies to stack up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck pulled Vioxx off the market in 2004 after a study
showed the drug doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
The company won 11 of 16 Vioxx lawsuits at trial before setting
up a $4.85 billion settlement fund in 2007 to resolve thousands
of injury claims over the drug. State officials allege Merck
executives downplayed and distorted Vioxx&#8217;s health risks in
medical literature, advertisements and communications with
doctors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Louisiana case is State of Louisiana v. Merck, Sharp 
Dohme Corp., 05-3700, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novartis&#8217;s NeuTec Used Law Firm in Insider Case, Court Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeuTec Pharma Plc, the biopharmaceutical company whose 2006
takeover by Novartis AG is at the heart of an insider-trading
trial, employed the law firm where one of the defendants worked,
a witness said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NeuTec used McDermott Will  Emery LLP as advisers on
patent disputes with Cambridge Antibody Technology Group Plc,
NeuTec founder James Burnie testified. Michael McFall, one of
three defendants, is a former mergers and acquisitions lawyer at
McDermott. Andrew King, NeuTec&#8217;s ex-financial director, and
Andrew Rimmington, a former partner at Dorsey  Whitney LLP are
also on trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You said that NeuTec received legal advice from McDermott
Will  Emery, and this had come from a recommendation Andrew
King had received through a contact,&#8221; prosecuting attorney
Michael Bowes said to Burnie yesterday at Southwark Crown Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burnie, who is NeuTec&#8217;s chief executive, confirmed the
statement to Bowes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three men deny the eight charges and will present their
defense later in a trial, which is scheduled to last six weeks.
Bowes said yesterday that they made 39,000 pounds ($60,000) each
in 2006 after King gave McFall early notice that Basel,
Switzerland-based Novartis would buy NeuTec. McFall then passed
on the information to Rimmington, the FSA alleges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; KB Home&#8217;s Bruce Karatz Guilty in Backdating Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former KB Home Chief Executive Officer Bruce Karatz was
found guilty by a U.S. jury of hiding from auditors and
regulators that he backdated stock options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in federal court in Los Angeles yesterday found
Karatz guilty of two counts of mail fraud and two counts of
making a false statement. He was acquitted of 16 charges,
including mail and wire fraud, securities fraud and filing false
proxy statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karatz, 64, was accused of unauthorized and undisclosed
backdating of stock options that brought him $6.62 million in
compensation he wasn&#8217;t entitled to from 1999 to 2005. He stepped
down as chief executive at Los Angeles-based KB Home in 2006
after 20 years in charge of the homebuilder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The jury got 80 percent of it right,&#8221; Karatz&#8217;s lawyer,
John Keker, said outside the courthouse. &#8220;We&#8217;re very
disappointed about the other counts. We&#8217;ll continue to fight
those.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keker said he&#8217;ll file requests for acquittal by the judge
and for a new trial, and if those fail, he&#8217;ll file an appeal. In
a separate statement Keker said he was pleased that the jury
acquitted Karatz of all charges that alleged backdating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Otis D. Wright scheduled sentencing for
Sept. 8 and increased Karatz&#8217;s bail to $2 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karatz faces as long as 80 years in prison on the four
counts for which he&#8217;s been convicted, Thom Mrozek, a spokesman
for U.S. Attorney Andre Birotte Jr., said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keker argued during the trial that Karatz had been
authorized by the company&#8217;s compensation committee to select the
grant dates of the options awarded to him and other executives.
Karatz didn&#8217;t hide that the option dates weren&#8217;t the same as the
dates on which the committee awarded them and nobody at KB Home
thought there was an issue with that, according to his lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Karatz, 09-203, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Among Banks to Settle Refco Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units of Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were among the banks that agreed to pay
$49.5 million to settle an investor lawsuit alleging fraud at
Refco Inc., according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2005 lawsuit in Manhattan federal court sought to hold
Refco&#8217;s underwriters partially responsible for the firm&#8217;s
failure to disclose that it hid hundreds of millions of dollars
in debt owed to it by former Chief Executive Officer Phillip
Bennett. In a court filing April 20, lawyers for the investors
said they reached a settlement with the banks and asked a judge
to approve it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We settled with the underwriters,&#8221; James Sabella, a
lawyer for RH Capital Associates LLC and Pacific Investment
Management Co., the lead investors in the case, said yesterday
in a phone interview. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s a good settlement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors previously settled with another underwriter
for $3.5 million, with Austria&#8217;s Bawag PSK Bank for $140
million, and with Refco investor Thomas H. Lee Partners for at
least $130 million, Sabella said. Refco&#8217;s auditor, Grant
Thornton LLP, hasn&#8217;t settled with investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the biggest independent U.S. futures trader, New York-
based Refco collapsed in 2005, two months after raising $670
million in an initial public offering. Refco Inc., as it was
known after the IPO, filed for bankruptcy after disclosing that
a firm owned by Bennett owed the company hundreds of millions of
dollars. Bennett pleaded guilty to fraud and is in prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn Wilson, a lawyer for the underwriters, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mazur v. Refco, 05-cv-8626, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.J. Reynolds Loses $46.3 Million Smoker&#8217;s Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the second-biggest U.S.
cigarette maker, must pay $46.3 million to the widow of a
Florida man who died from lung cancer in 1995, a jury in
Gainesville, Florida, decided yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six state-court jurors voted unanimously in favor of
Lyantie Townsend, the widow of Frank Townsend, who took up
smoking at age 13 or 14, according to Greg Prysock, the winning
lawyer in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict is the latest in favor of a Florida smoker
following a 2006 Florida Supreme Court decision in the &#8220;Engle&#8221;
case, which allowed smokers to file individual suits after the
court decertified a statewide class-action case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smokers and their families have won 13 verdicts in 15
trials in these post-Engle cases, including five in March and
April, according to Edward Sweda, senior staff attorney for the
anti-smoking Tobacco Products Liability Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jurors in Gainesville yesterday returned a verdict of
$10.8 million in compensatory damages plus $80 million in
punitive damages, Prysock said. Because jurors found Townsend 49
percent responsible for his illness and death, R.J. Reynolds
must pay 51 percent, or $46.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re disappointed with the jury&#8217;s verdict and plan to
appeal,&#8221; said Reynolds spokesman David Howard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Townsend v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 08-CA-
131, Florida Circuit Court (Gainesville). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses Win at U.S. Supreme Court in Pension Plan Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court sided with businesses in a dispute
over the meaning of ambiguous pension plans, ruling that a
federal trial judge should have deferred to Xerox Corp.&#8217;s
interpretation of its plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices, voting 5-3, overturned a lower court ruling
favoring more than 100 Xerox employees who were rehired by the
company after they left and received pension distributions. The
employees say Xerox, in calculating their future benefits,
improperly accounted for the money they had already received. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question in the Supreme Court case was whether a trial
judge should afford plan administrators the deference they
normally receive even after they make a mistake in interpreting
a plan provision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for the court, Chief Justice John Roberts said
judges should continue to defer to administrators, as long as
their interpretation is reasonable. Rejecting what he called the
&#8220;one-strike-and-you&#8217;re-out approach,&#8221; Roberts said a &#8220;single
honest mistake&#8221; shouldn&#8217;t trigger tougher judicial scrutiny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justices Stephen Breyer, John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader
Ginsburg dissented. Justice Sonia Sotomayor didn&#8217;t take part in
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling is a victory for business trade groups including
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. It&#8217;s a defeat for the Obama
administration, which argued in favor of the employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority stopped short of upholding Xerox&#8217;s calculation
of benefits, instead sending the decade-old case back to a lower
court for additional proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Conkright v. Frommert, 08-810, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama Says He Will Have Supreme Court Nominee by May &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama said he will announce a nominee to
replace retiring Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens by next
month and that he&#8217;ll seek a candidate who values individual
rights and privacy when ruling on cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama said he&#8217;s confident the nomination will go through
the Senate confirmation process in time to have Stevens&#8217;s
successor in place when the court begins its next term in
October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president, repeating the stand of his predecessors,
said he won&#8217;t have any &#8220;litmus tests&#8221; on abortion rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But I will say that I want somebody who is going to be
interpreting our Constitution in a way that takes into account
individual rights, and that includes women&#8217;s rights,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s going to be something that&#8217;s very important to me.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens, 90, announced April 9 that he will retire at the
end of the court&#8217;s term this summer. The president already has
begun talking with and vetting potential nominees for the high
court, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading candidates include U.S. Solicitor General Elena
Kagan and federal appellate judges Diane Wood in Chicago and
Merrick Garland in Washington. All were considered for the
Supreme Court vacancy Obama filled last year with Sotomayor, who
replaced Justice David Souter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other potential court nominees include federal appellate
judge Sidney Thomas; Homeland Security Secretary Janet
Napolitano; Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm; former Georgia
Chief Justice Leah Ward Sears; and Harvard Law School Dean
Martha Minow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Ackermann to Testify in IKB Former CEO&#8217;s Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank AG Chief Executive Officer Josef Ackermann
will be called as a witness in the trial of IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG&#8217;s former top officer Stefan Ortseifen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ackermann will be summoned by the Dusseldorf Regional
Court, which hasn&#8217;t yet set a date for the testimony, court
spokesman Peter Schuetz said. Ortseifen is facing charges he
misled investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the opening of his trial last month, Ortseifen blamed
Deutsche Bank for causing IKB&#8217;s near-collapse in 2007. Deutsche
Bank halted all transactions with IKB on July 27 that year,
hurting IKB&#8217;s reputation and triggering the crisis, the former
executive said. Deutsche Bank has rejected Ortseifen&#8217;s claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IKB was bailed out in 2007 by KfW Group and banking
associations and has received guarantees of as much as 12
billion euros ($16 billion) from the Soffin bank-rescue fund.
Ortseifen is charged with misleading investors by downplaying
the effect of the looming crisis in a press release on July 20,
2007, shortly before IKB received a first bailout package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rainer Hamm, Ortseifen&#8217;s lawyer, has said he may have more
witnesses called in light of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil case against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. IKB lost
nearly all of its $150 million investment in the subprime-
mortgage-related products at the center of the SEC case against
Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is LG Dusseldorf, 14 KLs 6/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro faces an investigation into
whether politics drove the agency&#8217;s decision to sue Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican, asked
SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz to determine whether the
agency&#8217;s April 16 lawsuit was timed to bolster the Obama
administration&#8217;s push to overhaul financial rules. Schapiro said
on April 21 that neither the White House nor Congress have any
influence on SEC enforcement actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The circumstances of the filing and subsequent events
fueled suspicion that the commission, or one or more of its
officials or employees, may have engaged in unauthorized
disclosure of commission proceedings,&#8221; Issa said today in a
letter to Kotz seeking a probe. Kotz, in a Fox television
interview, said he would do an investigation at Issa&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation will bring additional scrutiny to a case
the SEC is relying on to restore its standing with investors and
lawmakers after the agency failed to detect frauds including
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. Goldman Sachs, the most
profitable company in Wall Street history, said the SEC lawsuit
is &#8220;completely unfounded&#8221; and pledged to fight it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDO Disclosure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC accused Goldman Sachs of creating and selling
collateralized debt obligations in 2007 based on subprime
mortgages without disclosing that Paulson  Co., the hedge fund
run by billionaire John Paulson, helped pick the underlying
securities. Goldman Sachs also didn&#8217;t disclose to investors that
Paulson was betting against the assets, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schapiro, a political independent, joined the SEC&#8217;s two
Democratic commissioners in voting to approve the suit on April
14. The two Republican members voted against the action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issa and eight other Republican lawmakers sent Schapiro a
letter April 20 asking whether any SEC employee discussed the
suit with the White House before the case was announced. He also
requested all records and communications between the SEC and
congressional Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her April 21 statement, Schapiro said she&#8217;s
&#8220;disappointed by the rhetoric.&#8221; The SEC is an &#8220;independent
enforcement agency&#8221; and will &#8220;neither bring cases, nor refrain
from bringing them because of political consequences.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking Forward &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester said the agency looks &#8220;forward
to cooperating with the inspector general&#8217;s investigation.&#8221;
Kotz didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, in an April 21 interview with CNBC,
denied there was communication between the SEC and the White
House about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, in an April 22
interview on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; program, said the
SEC gave him and his staff &#8220;no warnings&#8221; about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama is encouraging lawmakers to approve tougher rules for
Wall Street in response to a credit crisis that triggered the
worst economic slump since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate will likely begin debate next week on the
measure, which would create a consumer regulator within the
Federal Reserve to protect borrowers against deception in
mortgage and credit-card lending. The bill would also create a
mechanism for unwinding failed financial companies and increase
transparency of derivatives markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Republican senators have argued that the measure would
increase the likelihood that banks will take excessive risks in
the future because it ensures government bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. director
Rajat Gupta is suspected by U.S. investigators of tipping off a
hedge fund billionaire to a $5 billion investment in the bank by
Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc., a person with direct
knowledge of the inquiry said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 61, who has said he won&#8217;t stand for re-election to
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s board, told Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam
about Buffett&#8217;s plan before it was announced in September 2008,
the person said, declining to be identified because the inquiry
isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who was arrested Oct. 16, is fighting criminal
charges and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil claims
that he used inside information to trade shares of companies
including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. In a March 22 letter to
Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers, made public April 9, prosecutors said they
had an interest in his trading in Goldman Sachs stock in 2008.
Three days before the letter was sent, Goldman Sachs announced
Gupta was leaving its board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rajat has neither violated any law nor done anything else
improper,&#8221; his attorney, Gary Naftalis of Kramer, Levin,
Naftalis  Frankel LLP, said in a statement. &#8220;He has always
conducted himself with integrity in his business, philanthropic
and personal life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson, SEC spokesman John
Nester and Janice Oh, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta hasn&#8217;t been formally accused of any wrongdoing. The
Wall Street Journal reported the news earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, agreed to sell $5 billion in preferred shares that paid
10 percent interest to Buffett, after the Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. bankruptcy and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s purchase of
Merrill Lynch  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta was McKinsey&#8217;s worldwide chief from 1994 to 2003, and
a senior worldwide partner until 2007. He withdrew from the
consulting firm and joined the boards of American Airlines
parent AMR Corp., Procter  Gamble Co., Harman International
Industries Inc. Genpact Ltd., the business outsourcing company,
and Russia&#8217;s OAO Sberbank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, chairman and chief
executive officer of JPMorgan Chase  Co., sliced another $1
million off the asking price of his Chicago mansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into its fourth year on the market, the Gold Coast
neighborhood property is now listed for $9.5 million, according
to the Web site of broker Sudler Sotheby&#8217;s International Realty.
It was previously listed for $10.5 million by Koenig  Strey
GMAC Real Estate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon bought the house at 25 E. Banks St. in 2000 when he
headed Chicago-based Bank One Corp. The 15,000 square-foot
mansion has eight bedrooms, nine full bathrooms and was built in
the late 1800s. Dimon first listed it for sale in April 2007 for
$13.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a statement home,&#8221; said Jim Kinney, vice president
of luxury sales for Baird  Warner, a residential brokerage in
Chicago. &#8220;It represents an attractive value in the
neighborhood.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The house, near Lake Michigan and Oak Street Beach, has a
rooftop terrace, wine vault and gym, according to the listing.
Located on the corner of tree-lined Astor and Banks streets, it
lies in one of the city&#8217;s most expensive neighborhoods and is
among the largest homes in the Gold Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sluggish Market &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is that demand for Chicago&#8217;s high-end homes is
&#8220;sluggish, sluggish, sluggish,&#8221; Kinney said, even though
overall sales in the nation&#8217;s third-largest city climbed 50
percent to 1,814 in March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median price fell 4.6 percent to $209,000 from a year
earlier, the Illinois Association of Realtors said in a
statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While there has been some improvement in delinquencies
and home prices in some markets, we believe that significant
improvements will depend largely on an improving economy,&#8221;
Dimon wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Kelly, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 54, helped engineer the sale of Bank One to JPMorgan
Chase in 2004. He and his wife Judith bought the Banks Street
property in 2000 for $4.7 million, according to records on the
Web site of the Cook County Recorder of Deeds. &lt;/p&gt;

Stanford" date="Apr 23, 2010  4:21 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-23/coca-cola-to-expand-honest-tea-distribution-throughout-u-s-to-lift-sales.html"><headline>Coca-Cola to Expand Honest Tea Distribution Throughout U.S. to Lift Sales</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Honest Tea, partly owned by Coca-
Cola Co., may increase sales by at least 70 percent within a
year as it becomes available throughout the U.S., said Seth
Goldman, the tea maker&#8217;s co-founder and president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the soda maker&#8217;s largest
bottler, and the majority of franchise distributors have
committed to the expansion, which includes some Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. locations, Goldman said today in an interview in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got a ship leaving the port, now you&#8217;ve got a
turbo-charged engine,&#8221; Goldman said of the national
distribution. Honest Tea sold about 5 million cases last year,
for revenue of $47 million, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola bought a 40 percent stake in Bethesda, Maryland-
based Honest Tea in 2008 to tap into demand for healthier
beverages amid soft-drink volume sales declines. The company has
also invested in Innocent Drinks, a maker of fruit smoothies,
and coconut-water maker Zico Beverages LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honest Tea, which produces U.S. Department of Agriculture-
certified organic teas, lemonades and children&#8217;s drinks, sold
the stake to get capital and access to the world&#8217;s largest
beverage distribution system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola bottlers distribute Honest Tea in the western and
northeastern U.S., and CVS Caremark Corp. recently agreed to
sell four flavors in its stores nationally, Goldman said. The
national expansion by Coca-Cola this year won&#8217;t include New York
and some Mid-Atlantic markets, where Honest Tea will keep its
existing independent distributors, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Williamson, a spokesman for Atlanta-based Coca-Cola,
said the company looks forward to supporting Goldman&#8217;s &#8220;work in
building the Honest Tea brand,&#8221; declining to elaborate.
Officials at Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart couldn&#8217;t
immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola helped finance a $1 million tea brewer at one of
its bottling plants to process Honest Tea, which steeps tea
leaves in hot water rather than mixing a manufactured powder,
Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola fell 43 cents to $53.88 at 4:07 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has dropped 5.5
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit and Altana
AG won a jury verdict on the validity of their patent for the
heartburn drug Protonix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in Newark, New Jersey, today rejected
arguments by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Sun
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. that the patent covered an
obvious variation of earlier patented compounds in the same
family as Protonix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva and Sun conceded they infringed the patent, which left
the jury with only the question of whether the patent was issued
properly. Teva, in a statement, said it can make additional
invalidity arguments to U.S. District Judge Jose Linares and a
decision &#8220;independent of today&#8217;s jury verdict would be
sufficient to invalidate the patent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer can now ask Linares to order Teva and Sun to stop
selling the drug until the patent expires in January. A second
trial would be held to determine what New York-based Pfizer
should be paid for profit lost since Teva and Sun began selling
cheaper versions of the drug two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we are successful at the end of this process, we will
be seeking the full measure of our damages,&#8221; Chris Loder, a
spokesman for Pfizer, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reflux Disease &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protonix, whose chemical name is pantoprazole sodium, is a
proton pump inhibitor that reduces the secretion of stomach
acids and is used to treat the effects of gastroesophageal
reflux disease, or GERD, which cases heartburn and chronic
ulcers in the esophagus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s biggest drugmaker, acquired Protonix
last year as part of its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protonix sales reached $1.9 billion in 2007, and then fell
58 percent to $806 million in 2008, after Teva, based in Petah
Tikva, Israel, began selling its generic version. Mumbai-based
Sun entered the market in January 2008, a month after Teva. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of the generic sales went to those two companies.
Wyeth began selling Protonix under its chemical name as a so-
called authorized generic to challenge Teva and Sun sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent, licensed to Wyeth, is owned by Altana&#8217;s
pharmaceutical business, which was bought by closely held
Nycomed Danmark ApS. AstraZeneca Plc&#8217;s Prilosec was the first
proton pump inhibitor. Others include AstraZeneca&#8217;s Nexium,
Novartis AG&#8217;s Prevacid and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s Aciphex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawsuit Pending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and 16 states have a pending lawsuit claiming
Wyeth manipulated prices of the heartburn pill to increase
market share and defraud Medicare, the U.S. government health-
insurance program for the elderly. A judge in February denied
Pfizer&#8217;s request to dismiss the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wholesale drug distributors also have sued Wyeth and
Altana, accusing them of misleading the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office to obtain the patent and protect their monopoly
on Protonix. That case was put on hold until the patent case was
completed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Altana Pharma AG v. Teva Pharmaceuticals USA
Inc., 04cv2355, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey
(Newark). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. increased
the most in nine months after its Nexavar treatment for advanced
liver cancer outperformed a potential competitor from Pfizer
Inc. in trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onyx rose $2.69, or 9.4 percent, to $31.18 at 4 p.m. New
York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading for the
biggest single-day increase since July 22. The company gained 16
percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer halted testing of anti-tumor drug Sutent as a liver
cancer therapy because patients taking it had more serious side
effects than those on Nexavar, the New York-based company said
yesterday in a statement. The results leave Nexavar as the only
approved medication for advanced liver cancer and will help the
drug achieve sales of $1 billion this year, Onyx Chief Executive
Officer Anthony Coles said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discontinuation of the Sutent study &#8220;is extremely
positive&#8221; for shares of Emeryville, California-based Onyx,
George Farmer, an analyst at Canaccord Adams Inc. in New York,
said today in a note to investors. &#8220;Nexavar will probably hold
a monopoly in this market for the foreseeable future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nexavar, co-marketed by Onyx and Leverkusen, Germany-based
Bayer AG, had worldwide sales of $844 million in 2009, Coles
said. It is approved for use in patients with inoperable liver
cancer and kidney cancer and is being tested in breast cancer
and lung cancer, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unique Compound&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results released by Pfizer show that &#8220;Nexavar is a
unique compound with a unique mechanism of action,&#8221; Coles said.
Nexavar is the only approved drug that inhibits a particular
cancer-related protein known as B-Raf, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several drugs are in head-to-head testing with Nexavar to
gain approval for use in liver cancer, including ABT-869, being
co-developed by Abbott Laboratories of Abbott Park, Illinois,
and Basel, Switzerland-based Roche AG, and New York-based
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.&#8217;s Brivanib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sutent, which was in the third and final round of testing
required by U.S. regulators, failed to show improved survival
compared with Nexavar, Pfizer said. The drug is already approved
for kidney cancer and a digestive system malignancy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown said
that if Goldman Sachs Group Inc. broke the law then compensation
will be owed to British banks and the U.K. government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If what happened at Goldman Sachs and in any other bank
is proven to be wrong, then hundreds of millions of dollars in
compensation should be paid to the British banks and, because we
are the biggest shareholder in many of them, to the British
taxpayer,&#8221; Brown said in a speech on a campaign visit to
Coventry, central England, today before the election on May 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs on April 16, alleging that the bank created and sold
collateralized debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing to buyers that hedge fund Paulson  Co.
helped pick the underlying securities and bet against the
vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc paid $841 million to
Goldman Sachs to unwind its position after taking over ABN Amro
in 2007, according to the SEC. The Edinburgh-based lender is 84
percent-owned by the British government after receiving a 45.5
billion-pound ($70 billion) taxpayer rescue, the world&#8217;s biggest
banking bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. government also has a 41 percent stake in Lloyds
Banking Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may be
better off cutting its losses instead of fighting what it terms
&#8220;unfounded&#8221; fraud claims, say professors of securities law who
have examined the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s
lawsuit against the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most profitable firm in Wall Street history will
probably lose what is typically the first hurdle in court, a
motion to throw out the April 16 suit because it lacks legal
merit, the professors said in interviews this week. After that,
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s risks will mount and its negotiating position
will weaken, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a very low probability that Goldman could get the
case dismissed,&#8221; said Thomas Hazen of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, whose books include a two-volume
treatise on broker-dealer law. &#8220;Every pretrial motion the SEC
wins, Goldman gets one step closer to losing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the first major Wall Street firm accused
by regulators of fraud connected to the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market. The SEC&#8217;s allegation that Goldman Sachs
defrauded investors sparked a 13 percent, one-day decline in its
shares. The New York-based firm, led by Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, 55, said it will vigorously contest the claims.
It must weigh the risks of a drawn-out legal battle against the
benefits of a more immediate resolution. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.
fell after releasing earnings reports that showed a rebound in
technology spending by companies and online buying by consumers
is less robust than analysts had predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, said third-
quarter sales rose 6.3 percent to $14.5 billion, missing the
most optimistic revenue estimates. Amazon.com, the biggest
online retailer, said operating income this quarter may be as
low as $220 million, compared with $322.2 million, the average
prediction of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft and Amazon.com had rising sales and profit
last quarter, neither lived up to analysts&#8217; most bullish
predictions. Optimism rose last week after Intel Corp. forecast
record profit margins in 2010, indicating that a revival in
computer demand is gathering steam. Results from Apple Inc. and
Best Buy Co. this week reflected robust consumer purchasing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With technology in general and Microsoft in particular,
you&#8217;re going to get this issue where it&#8217;s not good enough or
it&#8217;s already in the stock and it sells off a little bit,&#8221; said
Dave Stepherson, a fund manager at Hardesty Capital Management
in Baltimore. Hardesty manages $700 million in assets, including
Microsoft shares. &#8220;You&#8217;ve had a lot of momentum in technology
stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Decline &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 3.6 percent
to $30.27 in extended trading after the report. The shares had
risen 6 cents to $31.39 on the Nasdaq Stock Market yesterday.
Amazon.com, based in Seattle, dropped 5.9 percent to $141.30
after closing at $150.09. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon stock traded in Germany fell 4.9 percent to $142.70
as of 10:09 a.m. in Frankfurt, while Microsoft declined 3.2
percent to $30.40 from yesterday&#8217;s Nasdaq closing price of
$31.39. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter net income at Microsoft rose 35 percent to
$4.01 billion, or 45 cents a share, beating the average forecast
of 42 cents in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Sales exceeded
the $14.4 billion average in the survey, reflecting rising
demand for Windows 7, the latest version of Microsoft&#8217;s flagship
operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, investors were expecting more, Stepherson said. For
the second straight quarter, much of Microsoft&#8217;s strength came
from consumers, while business spending hasn&#8217;t rebounded with
vigor. Sales of Office and server software missed estimates at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear contracts, was
$12.3 billion. Analysts&#8217; average estimate was $12.8 billion,
according to Katherine Egbert, an analyst at Jefferies  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The numbers suggest corporate customers are holding off on
big orders that stretch over many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Really Poor&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The deferred revenue was really poor,&#8221; said Brent Thill,
an analyst with UBS AG in San Francisco. &#8220;Microsoft is one of
the last companies in technology to say enterprise spending is
turning. Everyone thought they&#8217;d put up better growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com said operating income will be $220 million to
$320 million, below the average estimate in the Bloomberg
survey. The company is struggling to extract favorable pricing
from its suppliers who, with improving demand, don&#8217;t have to
offer as many discounts, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC
Financial LP in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more consumers snap up digital books and other media --
buying fewer of the physical products that have long been
Amazon.com&#8217;s mainstay -- the company faces increased competition
from rivals such as Apple, Gillis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Amazon is not likely to experience the same
profitability and leadership position in digital media that it
enjoys selling physical books, movies and music,&#8221; Gillis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter sales of $7.13 billion and profit of $299
million, or 66 cents a share, beat analysts&#8217; estimates. The
company&#8217;s shares have climbed 90 percent in the past year,
double the gain by the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com and Microsoft are not the only companies whose
quarterly earnings reports compared poorly to those of Intel and
Apple. Google Inc., the biggest seller of Internet advertising,
posted its biggest drop since December 2008 last week after
reporting profit that missed the highest analyst estimates.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#8220;The leading Internet stocks so far all reported fairly
good results and guidance and still saw their stocks drop,&#8221;
said Fred Moran, an analyst at Benchmark Co. in Boca Raton,
Florida. &#8220;The stock market expectations for where technology
stocks should trade may have temporarily gotten ahead of
themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Russia&#8217;s economy will expand 5.8
percent this year compared with a previous forecast of 4.5
percent, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in an e-mailed report
dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent economic data show &#8220;a definite macro turnaround,&#8221;
the report said. Goldman also raised its 2011 growth forecast to
6.1 percent from 5.5 percent.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&#8217;s Warren
Buffett, who injected $5 billion into Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
in 2008, remains comfortable with his investment after
regulators sued the bank for fraud, said Berkshire Director
Thomas Murphy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s not concerned with the investment at all,&#8221; Murphy,
84, said in a Bloomberg Television interview, citing a telephone
conversation with Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chief executive officer.
&#8220;He has to see what&#8217;s going to happen on it, but I think he has
great confidence in Goldman,&#8221; Murphy said. The two men spoke
after the Securities and Exchange Commission announced its
lawsuit on April 16, Murphy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, a longstanding Wall Street critic, has supported a
firm that&#8217;s become a lightning rod for politicians and people
who feel cheated by the recession. Public regard for Goldman
Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street history, has
plummeted in the year and a half since Buffett, 79, provided the
company with capital in the depths of the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think he&#8217;s awfully secure&#8221; in Berkshire&#8217;s Goldman
Sachs holdings, said Glenn Tongue, a partner at T2 Partners LLC,
which invests in Buffett&#8217;s firm. &#8220;He assessed the culture of
Goldman Sachs when he made the investment. He had known the
company for decades.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s stocks may rally 25 percent
by the end of the year on higher earnings and the prospect a
stronger yuan will allow for an earlier end to the tightening
cycle, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Timothy Moe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk reward is pretty good even though we may have to
endure a little bit more uncertainty in terms of the policy
tightening cycle,&#8221; Moe, Hong Kong-based chief Asian strategist
at Goldman Sachs, said on Bloomberg Television. A gain in the
yuan means tightening is &#8220;closer to the end rather than to the
beginning&#8221; and is a &#8220;powerful signal for people to become more
constructive on equities on a broader basis,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s equities have fallen this year on concern an
exit from government stimulus and measures to curb record
property-price gains will hurt economic growth. The Shanghai
Composite index has slumped 8.8 percent in 2010, the world&#8217;s
fifth-worst performer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSI 300 Index, which tracks stocks on the Shanghai and
Shenzhen exchanges, may slide to 2,900 points before reaching
4,000 by the end of the year, Moe said. The measure fell 0.1
percent to 3,196.97 as of the 11:30 a.m. local-time break. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares on the CSI 300 trade at 18.2 times this year&#8217;s
estimated earnings, compared with 52 times at its record in
October 2007, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuations have &#8220;compressed significantly&#8221; while
companies are growing their profits &#8220;comfortably,&#8221; Moe said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional equity markets may benefit when China allows its
currency to appreciate, according to Moe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuan forwards headed for a weekly gain as central bankers
in India and Brazil joined the International Monetary Fund and
European Union in backing a stronger Chinese currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. director
tipped off a hedge fund billionaire about a $5 billion
investment in the bank by Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. before it became public knowledge, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment came at the height of the 2008 financial
crisis and Federal prosecutors say Goldman director Rajat Gupta
told Galleon Group founder Raj Rajaratnam about the Berkshire
investment; investigators wrote to Gupta, who said last month
he was stepping down as a Goldman director, to say they had
found out about the tip through an intercepted phone call
between Gupta and Rajaratnam, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta hasn&#8217;t been formally accused of any wrongdoing and
Goldman wouldn&#8217;t coment, the Journal said, adding that his
lawyer said he hadn&#8217;t violated any law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Connie Ling wouldn&#8217;t comment on
the report when contacted by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is being sued by the Securities and Exchange
Commission for criminal insider-trading, which he denies. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive director facing a fraud lawsuit in the sale
of a mortgage-linked investment, said an index that facilitated
derivatives trading in the market was &#8220;like Frankenstein.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called ABX index is &#8220;the type of thing which you
invent telling yourself: &#8216;Well, what if we created a &#8216;thing,&#8217;
which has no purpose, which is absolutely conceptual and highly
theoretical and which nobody knows how to price?&#8217;&#8221; Tourre said
in a Jan. 29, 2007, e-mail released yesterday by Goldman Sachs.
Watching the index fall is &#8220;a little like Frankenstein turning
against his own inventor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, released more than 70 pages of e-mail and other
documents yesterday ahead of a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing
on the firm&#8217;s actions throughout the mortgage meltdown. The firm
disputes the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s claim
that Goldman Sachs and Tourre, now 31, misled investors in a
2007 collateralized debt obligation about the role played by
hedge fund Paulson  Co., which bet the CDO would collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABX index enabled investors to trade derivatives known
as credit default swaps on different portions of the subprime
mortgage market without actually owning loans or securities. &lt;/p&gt;

Donmoyer" date="Apr 24, 2010  6:01 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-24/goldman-sachs-clashes-with-senate-s-levin-ahead-of-blankfein-s-testimony.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Clashes With Senate's Levin Ahead of Blankfein's Testimony</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and U.S.
Senator Carl Levin fired opening shots ahead of a congressional
hearing this week, releasing conflicting evidence of the
investment bank&#8217;s tactics during the mortgage market&#8217;s collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, posted internal Goldman Sachs e-
mails on his website yesterday that he said show the firm &#8220;made
a lot of money by betting against the mortgage market.&#8221; Goldman
Sachs responded with documents indicating the firm lost money on
mortgages in 2008 and that executives didn&#8217;t know the market
would fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six
current and former Goldman Sachs employees will have to face
questions from Levin&#8217;s panel against the backdrop of fraud
claims from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
regulator sued the firm on April 16, saying it defrauded
investors when selling a debt instrument tied to mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which contests the SEC&#8217;s claims, said
Levin&#8217;s committee has &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; evidence and jumped to
conclusions &#8220;even before holding a hearing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment banks such as Goldman Sachs were not simply
market-makers, they were self-interested promoters of risky and
complicated financial schemes that helped trigger the crisis,&#8221;
Levin, 75, said in a statement released with the e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the e-mails provided by Levin yesterday shows
Blankfein telling colleagues on Nov. 18, 2007, that the firm was
making more money from its so-called short bets on mortgages
than it lost on its investments related to home loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Mortgage Mess&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course we didn&#8217;t dodge the mortgage mess,&#8221; Blankfein
wrote in an e-mail dated Nov. 18, 2007, that was among eight
pages of documents made public by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. &#8220;We lost money, then made more
than we lost because of shorts. Also, it&#8217;s not over, so who
knows how it will turn out ultimately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another document contains an exchange between Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar and Gary Cohn, the firm&#8217;s
president and chief operating officer, about the fixed-income
division&#8217;s profit and loss statement in July 2007. Cohn&#8217;s e-mail
describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage unit is up &#8220;in the index
book,&#8221; while recording writedowns on residential mortgages and
collateralized debt obligations. One method the firm used to
make bets against the mortgage market was to take short
positions on the so-called ABX index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tells you what might be happening to people who don&#8217;t
have the big short,&#8221; Viniar replies, according to the
documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses Overwhelmed Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Documents released yesterday by Goldman Sachs show that the
firm&#8217;s gains from shorting subprime mortgages in 2007 were
overwhelmed by losses in 2008 when higher-quality mortgages
suffered more than the firm anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs did not have access to any special
information that caused us to know that the U.S. housing market
would collapse,&#8221; the firm stated in an &#8220;executive summary&#8221; of
its arguments released yesterday. &#8220;As a result of the spread of
the crisis from subprime to all residential mortgages, Goldman
Sachs had overall net losses of approximately $1.7 billion with
respect to residential mortgage-related products for fiscal
2008.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Goldman Sachs wrote a letter to Levin April 23
asking the subcommittee to warn the firm of any information the
panel plans to release so it has a chance to respond. The letter
followed Levin&#8217;s statement at a hearing the same day that
&#8220;investment banks such as Goldman Sachs were not market makers
helping clients; they were self-interested promoters of risky
and complicated financial schemes that were a major part of the
2008 crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Already Drawn Conclusions&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The statement suggests that you and the subcommittee have
already drawn conclusions about the conduct of Goldman Sachs,&#8221;
K. Lee Blalack II from the law firm O&#8217;Melveny  Myers LLP wrote
to Levin. &#8220;We strongly disagree with your statement at today&#8217;s
hearing and believe that, if we were provided an opportunity to
respond to your specific findings, Goldman Sachs could produce
to you information that establishes that your findings are
incorrect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blalack, a partner in the Washington office of O&#8217;Melveny 
Myers, is a former chief counsel and staff director of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, according to his
biography on the firm&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs disputes the criticism that the firm&#8217;s short
position on mortgage securities during 2007 constituted a bet
against its own clients. In a letter to shareholders earlier
this month, Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said the positions
&#8220;served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to
be in a position to make markets for our clients while managing
our risk within prescribed limits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interrogation of Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
securities firm in Wall Street history, may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. Levin, who has
served in the Senate for more than 30 years, and his panel have
a reputation for thorough research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is Pecora II,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;They have to squirm and
they have to answer the questions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pecora Commission &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate investigation into the causes of the Wall Street
crash of 1929 became known as the Pecora Commission, after the
former New York City assistant district attorney who was
appointed its chief counsel. Congress went on to pass the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
portions of which Goldman Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre,
are accused of violating in the Securities and Exchange
Commission&#8217;s suit filed on April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 31, failed to inform
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge
fund Paulson  Co., led by billionaire John Paulson, played a
role in choosing the mortgage securities that underpinned the
CDO and planned to bet on its failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said it would never mislead investors and
that ACA Management LLC and IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG,
investors in the deal, had all the material information they
needed. Tourre will tell Levin&#8217;s panel he did nothing wrong,
according to a person briefed on his planned testimony. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Enforcement Chief &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, oversaw a
group that helped create CDOs when he worked at Deutsche Bank
AG, the Wall Street Journal reported April 23, citing
unidentified people familiar with the matter. It isn&#8217;t clear
whether Khuzami reviewed any documents at Deutsche Bank related
to CDOs, the newspaper said. Khuzami declined to comment because
the terms of his SEC recusal prevent him from discussing
Deutsche Bank, John Nester, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg
News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Pecora&#8217;s, Levin&#8217;s hearings may have implications for
financial regulation. They take place as the Senate starts
considering a package of financial rules that would require
better disclosure of derivatives trading and could force banks
to split off divisions that trade for their own accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tougher Questioning &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein may get tougher questioning than he received in
front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission led by former
California state Treasurer Phil Angelides in January, Geisst
said. Levin&#8217;s committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs on June 30 and sent a second subpoena on March 12,
before conducting interviews with Goldman employees this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Levin is smarter,&#8221; said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar of
the Brookings Institution who has written books including &#8220;The
Fed&#8221; and &#8220;The Bankers&#8221; about the financial system. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stronger committee.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin has been chairman or the top Democrat on the
Permanent Subcommittee for more than a decade. He delves deeply
into the issues, said Jack Blum, who spent 14 years as an
investigator for other Senate panels and has testified before
Levin&#8217;s committee as a private citizen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What you&#8217;re going to expect is a guy who first of all
really will have done his homework,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very
influential senator.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blum said the permanent subcommittee also is one of the
rare panels in which senators and their staffs cooperate across
party lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parade of Critics &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criticizing Goldman &#8220;is going to be everybody&#8217;s great
moment,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the parade you want to be in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Washington time
on April 27. The first panel will question Tourre, Michael
Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s structured
products group, and two former employees: Daniel Sparks, who was
head of the mortgage department, and Joshua Birnbaum, who was a
managing director in the structured products group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second panel will feature Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, followed by a
final panel at which Blankfein is slated to appear alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin&#8217;s chief investigator, Robert Roach, has been at the
permanent subcommittee since September 1997 and has almost 20
years of experience working for congressional oversight
committees. Staff director Elise Bean has focused on the pay gap
between executives and average workers for almost as long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roach balances his investigative work with speeches at
conferences that interact with his areas of expertise, such as a
meeting on offshore bank jurisdictions held annually in Miami
Beach. After an interview over drinks last year, Roach insisted
on paying for his own $3 beer, saying he never let anyone,
reporters included, pay for his meals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget Watchdog &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the Republican staff
led by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, is a former executive at
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Washington-based budget watchdog
group that first dubbed a proposal to build a bridge in Alaska
the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in 1948, the panel was led in the 1950s by then-
Senator Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, who alleged that
communists had infiltrated the federal government. McCarthy
later was censured for hearings that Levin wrote in 2003
&#8220;destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the
infiltration of our government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, the committee focused on the role
played by UBS AG and Liechtenstein&#8217;s LGT Group in facilitating
offshore tax evasion worldwide. At a July 2008 hearing, UBS made
worldwide headlines by announcing it would stop offering
offshore banking services for U.S. customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enron, Saddam Hussein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Levin&#8217;s leadership, the panel has exposed how banks
such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. helped Enron
Corp. structure fraudulent financial transactions, and
investigated the dangers of buying prescription drugs over the
Internet and how former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein abused the
United Nations Oil-for-Food program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee has focused on tax issues other than the UBS
case in recent years. In 2003, it revealed how firms such as
KPMG LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP spent
much of the 1990s devising and marketing tax shelters judged
illegal by the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Levin introduced legislation to limit tax benefits
for companies that pay executives millions of dollars in stock
options after his panel concluded the tax subsidies helped widen
the divide between compensation of top officials and ordinary
workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel&#8217;s shortcoming, Blum said, is that it rarely
enjoys legislative jurisdiction in the areas it investigates,
meaning any bill the probes produce must go through other
committees. In the Goldman case, any ensuing legislation would
probably go through the Senate Banking Committee or the
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Blum said, when Levin holds hearings, &#8220;the
companies involved have a hell of an image problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street&#8217;s smartest will meet
the Senate&#8217;s toughest at a hearing next week that could provide
a seminal moment in the reckoning after the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman and
chief executive officer, and six current and former employees of
his firm will face a grilling from the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Led by Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who has
served in the U.S. Senate for more than 30 years, the panel has
a reputation for thorough research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interrogation of Goldman Sachs, the most profitable
securities firm in Wall Street history, may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. It comes after
regulators sued Goldman Sachs and employee Fabrice Tourre,
alleging fraud in the sale of a mortgage-linked investment as
the market for such investments turned, accusations the firm
denies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is Pecora II,&#8221; said Charles Geisst, a finance
professor at Manhattan College in Riverdale, New York, who has
written about Wall Street&#8217;s history. &#8220;They have to squirm and
they have to answer the questions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
portions of which Goldman Sachs and Tourre are accused of

&lt;p&gt;SEC Accusations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Goldman Sachs and Tourre, 31, failed to inform
investors in a 2007 collateralized debt obligation that hedge

&lt;p&gt;Levin today released Goldman Sachs e-mails obtained by his
committee that he said demonstrate the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market.&#8221; Among them was
an e-mail in which Blankfein said, &#8220;We lost money, then made
more than we lost because of shorts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cherry-Picked&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
today released information on the firm&#8217;s residential mortgage
profits and losses in 2007 and 2008. The information shows
Goldman Sachs had net losses of $1.2 billion in residential
mortgage-related products in the period. While the firm
generated more money than it lost on mortgage positions in 2007,
losses overwhelmed gains in the first quarter of 2008, the
documents show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The U.S. Senate subcommittee has cherry-picked just four
e-mails from the almost 20 million pages of documents and e-
mails provided to it by Goldman Sachs,&#8221; van Praag said. &#8220;It is
concerning that the subcommittee seems to have reached its
conclusion even before holding a hearing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implications for Regulation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Pecora&#8217;s, Levin&#8217;s hearings could have implications for
financial regulation. They take place as the Senate starts
considering a package of financial rules that would require
better disclosure of derivatives trading and could force banks
to split off divisions that trade for their own accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, 55, may get tougher questioning than he received
in front of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission led by
former California state Treasurer Phil Angelides in January,
Geisst said. Levin&#8217;s committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs on June 30 and sent a second subpoena on March 12,
before conducting interviews with Goldman employees this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Levin is smarter,&#8221; said Martin Mayer, a guest scholar of
the Brookings Institution who has written books including &#8220;The
Fed&#8221; and &#8220;The Bankers&#8221; about the financial system. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
stronger committee.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, 75, has been chairman or the top Democrat on the
Permanent Subcommittee for more than a decade. He delves deeply
into the issues, said Jack Blum, who spent 14 years as an
investigator for other Senate panels and has testified before
Levin&#8217;s committee as a private citizen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homework Done &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What you&#8217;re going to expect is a guy who first of all
really will have done his homework,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a very
influential senator.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blum said the Permanent Subcommittee also is one of the
rare panels with bipartisan cooperation between the senators and
their staffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criticizing Goldman &#8220;is going to be everybody&#8217;s great
moment,&#8221; Blum said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the parade you want to be in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testimony is scheduled to begin at 10 a.m. Washington time
on April 27. The first panel will question Tourre, Michael
Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s structured
products group, and two former employees: Daniel Sparks, who was
head of the mortgage department, and Joshua Birnbaum, who was a
managing director in the structured products group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second panel will feature Chief Financial Officer David
Viniar and Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick, followed by a
final panel at which Blankfein is slated to appear alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Lose-Lose&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing presents a &#8220;lose-lose situation&#8221; for Goldman
Sachs, Geisst said, because the firm is fighting a battle over
its reputation as well as the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they answer with generalities and maintain that they
haven&#8217;t done anything wrong, then it just gets worse for them,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;If they do admit that they&#8217;ve actually done something
wrong, specifically, it won&#8217;t go well for them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs disputes the criticism that the firm&#8217;s short
position on mortgage securities during 2007 constituted a bet
against its own clients. In a letter to shareholders earlier
this month, Blankfein and President Gary Cohn said the positions
&#8220;served to offset our long positions. Our goal was, and is, to
be in a position to make markets for our clients while managing
our risk within prescribed limits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of these things Goldman did had no useful
function,&#8221; said Richard Sylla, a financial historian and
economics professor at New York University&#8217;s Stern School of
Business. &#8220;They have that problem even if they didn&#8217;t do
anything illegal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Goldman Sachs senior executives sold $65.4 million of
stock after the firm received notice of possible fraud
allegations last year from the SEC, the Wall Street Journal
reported yesterday. Michael DuVally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman,
declined to comment on the sales when contacted by Bloomberg
News. The firm has said it didn&#8217;t disclose receiving a Wells
notice from the SEC because it didn&#8217;t think it was material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s enforcement chief, oversaw a
group that helped create CDOs when he worked at Deutsche Bank
AG, the Journal reported yesterday, citing unidentified people
familiar with the matter. It isn&#8217;t clear whether Khuzami
reviewed any documents at Deutsche Bank related to CDOs, the
newspaper said. Khuzami declined to comment because the terms of
his SEC recusal prevent him from discussing Deutsche Bank, John
Nester, an agency spokesman, told Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roach, Ashdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin&#8217;s chief investigator, Robert Roach, has been at
Permanent Subcommittee since September 1997 and has almost 20
years of experience working for congressional oversight
committees. Staff director Elise Bean has focused on the pay gap
between executives and average workers for almost as long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roach balances his investigative work with speeches at
conferences that interact with his areas of expertise, such as a
meeting on offshore bank jurisdictions held annually in Miami
Beach. After an interview over drinks last year, Roach insisted
on paying for his own $3 beer, saying he never let anyone,
reporters included, pay for his meals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keith Ashdown, chief investigator for the Republican staff
led by Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, is a former executive at
Taxpayers for Common Sense, the Washington-based budget watchdog
group that first dubbed a proposal to build a bridge in Alaska
the &#8220;Bridge to Nowhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McCarthy Censure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created in 1948, the panel was led by then-Senator Joseph
McCarthy of Wisconsin in the 1950s, who alleged that communists
had infiltrated the federal government. McCarthy later was
censured for hearings that Levin wrote in 2003 &#8220;destroyed
careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of
our government.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last two years, the committee focused on the role
played by UBS AG and Liechtenstein&#8217;s LGT Group in facilitating
offshore tax evasion worldwide. At a July 2008 hearing, UBS made
worldwide headlines by announcing it would stop offering
offshore banking services for U.S. customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Levin&#8217;s leadership, the panel has exposed how banks
such as Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. helped Enron
Corp. structure fraudulent financial transactions, and
investigated the dangers of buying prescription drugs over the
Internet and how former Iraq dictator Saddam Hussein abused the
United Nations Oil-for-Food program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on Taxes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee has focused on tax issues other than the UBS
case in recent years. In 2003, it revealed how firms such as
KPMG LLP, Ernst  Young LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP spent
much of the 1990s devising and marketing tax shelters judged
illegal by the Internal Revenue Service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Levin introduced legislation to limit tax benefits
for companies that pay executives millions of dollars in stock
options after his panel concluded the tax subsidies helped widen
the divide between compensation of top officials and ordinary
workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel&#8217;s shortcoming, Blum said, is that it rarely
enjoys legislative jurisdiction in the areas it investigates,
meaning any bill the probes produce must go through other
committees. In the Goldman case, any ensuing legislation would
probably go through the Senate Banking Committee or the
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Blum said, when Levin holds hearings, &#8220;the
companies involved have a hell of an image problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told colleagues in
an e-mail that the firm made money by shorting, or betting
against, mortgages, according to documents obtained and released
today by a U.S. Senate subcommittee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course we didn&#8217;t dodge the mortgage mess,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, wrote in an e-mail dated Nov. 18, 2007, that was among eight
pages of documents released today by the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations. &#8220;We lost money, then made more
than we lost because of shorts. Also, it&#8217;s not over, so who
knows how it will turn out ultimately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, has come under scrutiny for its sales of
collateralized debt obligations linked to mortgages during 2007,
just as the market for such instruments started to crumble.
Blankfein, 55, and six current and former employees will face
questioning next week about its business practices by the
subcommittee, led by Michigan Democrat Carl Levin, 75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 16 the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the
firm for fraud, alleging that the company and an employee,
Fabrice Tourre, misled investors about a CDO. Goldman Sachs has
contested the allegations, arguing that the investors had all
the information they needed and that the firm would never
mislead investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Main Street teamed up with Wall
Street to produce something the four biggest U.S. lenders
haven&#8217;t had since the banking crisis began two years ago: reason
for optimism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc.
and Wells Fargo  Co., beneficiaries of $140 billion in taxpayer
funds, reduced loan-loss provision expenses from last quarter
and said the bottom of the credit cycle was past. Their
investment-banking arms capitalized on fixed-income trading,
leading to combined first-quarter profits of $13.4 billion, the
most since the second quarter of 2007 before the crisis began.
Citigroup reduced reserves for the first time since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This quarter is confirmation that credit has turned a
corner,&#8221; said Charles Peabody, an analyst at New York-based
Portales Partners LLC who assigns &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings to Bank of
America and JPMorgan, and a &#8220;hold&#8221; to Citigroup. Peabody
doesn&#8217;t cover Wells Fargo. &#8220;You&#8217;ve heard every CEO say credit
has turned, and there is nothing to be gained for them by being
overly optimistic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian T. Moynihan, Bank of America&#8217;s chief executive
officer, said April 16 that &#8220;the worst of the credit cycle is
clearly behind us&#8221; and that economic growth is &#8220;real.&#8221;
JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy may be poised for a
&#8220;strong recovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;White House officials and Democratic
lawmakers, bracing for a Senate showdown on Wall Street
oversight, seized on internal e-mails from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to push for new curbs that would include a ban on
proprietary trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These e-mails signify that there are all kinds of
conflicts of interest on Wall Street, that Wall Street is
working for its clients and working against its clients in the
same sort of bundled toxic securities,&#8221; Senator Sherrod Brown,
a Democrat from Ohio, said today on ABC&#8217;s This Week. &#8220;That&#8217;s
why we need really strong reform that will separate the
proprietary trading from banking functions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mails show that the New York-based firm &#8220;made a lot
of money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; said Carl
Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations and published the e-mails
yesterday. Democrats are using the revelations to bolster
support for Senator Christopher Dodd&#8217;s financial overhaul, which
faces a test vote in the Senate tomorrow. At least one
Republican vote is needed to open debate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ban on proprietary trading, named the Volcker rule after
former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker who&#8217;s advising the
President Barack Obama, is &#8220;highly relevant&#8221; to ending
conflicts of interest on Wall Street, Austan Goolsbee, a White
House economic adviser, said today on ABC&#8217;s program &#8220;This
Week.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein at Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin&#8217;s panel is scheduled to question Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six other current and former
Goldman Sachs employees on Tuesday. The firm is battling an
April 16 fraud lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission that accused Goldman Sachs of misleading investors in
a collateralized debt obligation about the role played by hedge
fund Paulson  Co. in assembling the deal and its intention to
bet against the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has called the SEC suit &#8220;completely
unfounded.&#8221; The firm responded to Levin&#8217;s publication of the e-
mails with documents indicating the firm lost money on mortgages
in 2008 and that executives didn&#8217;t know the market would fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CEO of Goldman Sachs is not going to win any
popularity contests, when over a period that ordinary Americans&#8217;
pensions, houses et cetera were collapsing in value, they were
actually making significant money off of it,&#8221; Goolsbee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s case and the e-mails heighten the need to pass
regulatory reform, Dodd, who chairs the Senate Banking
Committee, said today in an interview on NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the
Press.&#8221; Dodd has been working with Richard Shelby, the top
Republican on the committee, since last year to try to broker a
compromise on the legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby and Dodd &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby, also speaking on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221;, said that
while he and Dodd are &#8220;conceptually very, very close&#8221; on the
legislation, he doubts they will reach an agreement by tomorrow.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to end, once and for all, the casino atmosphere on
Wall Street,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Summers, the director of the White House National
Economic Council, said the e-mails underscore &#8220;what is at the
center&#8221; of Obama&#8217;s plan for overhauling financial regulation.
That includes &#8220;the importance of things being in the open,&#8221;
and of knowing &#8220;who&#8217;s got a stake in success, who&#8217;s got a stake
in failure,&#8221; Summers said on the CBS program &#8220;Face The
Nation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican and member of
the Senate Banking Committee who helped write parts of the bill,
said the e-mails &#8220;certainly do not read well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Conflicts of Interest&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am in no way defending sort of the attitude expressed
in the e-mails, but I think we&#8217;re better off waiting to see
exactly what has taken place,&#8221; Corker said. &#8220;There are some
conflicts of interest that can exist and do need to be looked
at, but I&#8217;d rather wait and see how this investigation unfolds
before making any judgments.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a really uncomfortable week, a
challenging week, for CEO Lloyd Blankfein,&#8221; Jon Corzine, the
former Democratic New Jersey governor and senator who ran
Goldman Sachs from 1994 to 1999, said in an interview broadcast
today on ABC News&#8217;s Good Morning America. &#8220;The silver lining is
this is going to reinforce the need for moving forward with
financial regulatory reform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Albert R. Hunt" date="Apr 25, 2010 10:10 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-25/goldman-finds-resume-a-pariah-with-governments-albert-r-hunt.html"><headline>Goldman Finds Resume a Pariah With Governments: Albert R. Hunt</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), whose
exceptional cachet and clout have been enhanced by its role in
public policy, suddenly is a pariah in government and political
circles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#8217;s assume, for a moment, that the company prevails in
the fraud suit brought by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, that no one was misled about the content of the
product it sold, only about the background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also assume that, as Goldman Sachs executives insisted
last week, most of their customers are supportive of the firm,
and any short-term losses will be negligible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the Goldman Sachs brand, one of the most
prestigious in the world, corporate or otherwise, is tarnished,
perhaps indelibly. If the company believes it can tough its way
through this, it&#8217;s as insular as critics charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, the fraud suit, which Goldman Sachs says is
without merit, may not be the only problem facing the company.
The Germans and British are already piling on, and reportedly
Goldman Sachs is nervous about the full-scale inquiry into the
Wall Street fiasco by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Getting in the cross hairs of the panel&#8217;s
Democratic chairman, Michigan&#8217;s Carl Levin, one of the
toughest, straightest shooters in Congress, is cause for
concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stellar Values &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, professionally I&#8217;ve known a half-dozen top
former Goldman Sachs executives; they&#8217;re all able and
thoughtful. The one I know well has stellar values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, despite working for two of the great financial news
organizations in the world for more than four decades, I&#8217;ve
never covered Wall Street; I cover politics, a proud
journalistic hack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the prism of politics is illuminating. The
global Goldman Sachs mystique has been enhanced by the number
of executives tapped for leading government jobs. Treasury
Secretaries Robert Rubin in the Clinton administration and
Henry Paulson in the George W. Bush administration were former
Goldman Sachs chairmen, as was Stephen Friedman, the top White
House economic adviser during the Bush presidency. There is a
plethora of Goldman alums sprinkled throughout the Obama
administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently there was no better credential for
government service than a Goldman Sachs background; now the G
is more like the forbidden A in Nathaniel Hawthorne&#8217;s &#8220;The
Scarlet Letter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lethal Background &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If there were an opening today for a Federal Reserve
governor or a deputy Treasury secretary or for a prominent
White House economic role, a Goldman Sachs background,
administration officials privately admit, would be lethal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Clearly, they&#8217;ve become a toxic asset,&#8221; says Simon Johnson, a former International Monetary Fund economist who is
now a finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology&#8217;s Sloan School of Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fraud charges were the final straw in the building
resentment against Goldman Sachs; synthetic collateralized debt
obligations aren&#8217;t the stuff of backyard barbecue chatter or
debates at a bar. The public and political resentment, as one
crisis manager put it, grows out of the sense that Goldman
Sachs not only hasn&#8217;t &#8220;shared the pain&#8221; experienced by the
rest of America, but has &#8220;profited from it.&#8221; (Goldman Sachs,
which reported record profit last week, did take a government
handout in 2008 and repaid it in full with interest). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political Giving &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this environment, a firm&#8217;s political standing
dissipates. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s political-action committee gave
$290,500 to congressional candidates last month as the
legislature weighed the financial-regulation overhaul.
President Barack Obama shook the Goldman Sachs money tree for
almost $1 million in the last presidential campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is now a bipartisan scramble to strike distance from
the Wall Street powerhouse. Mark Kirk, Republican candidate for
an Illinois U.S. Senate seat, says he&#8217;ll refund any
contributions from Goldman Sachs employees. His Democratic
opponents say that isn&#8217;t sufficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Arkansas Senate Democratic primary, Lieutenant
Governor Bill Halter assailed incumbent Senator Blanche Lincoln
for getting money from Goldman Sachs&#8217;s PAC. Lincoln just
canceled a plan to hold a fundraising lunch at Goldman. In the
California gubernatorial race, opponents are assailing former
EBay Inc. (EBAY) Chairwoman Meg Whitman for being an ex-Goldman Sachs
director. The Whitman camp&#8217;s response: Her critics have Goldman
ties, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keeping the Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Obama may be capitalizing on the anti-Wall Street
wave with his regulatory overhaul bill, Republicans such as
South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint are demanding he give back
the big bucks he got from Goldman Sachs in the last campaign;
he won&#8217;t. White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel, the guest of
honor at a private Park Avenue cocktails soiree for wealthy
Obama supporters last weekend, surely wasn&#8217;t pleased it was
reported that a Goldman Sachs partner was present. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever the legalities of the fraud charge, it looks
awful, more like the doings in a Las Vegas casino than on Wall
Street, and more like Gordon Gekko greed than the legitimate
economic interest to hedge against risk. Goldman Sachs contends
the SEC&#8217;s case boils down to the actions of Fabrice Tourre,
then a 28-year-old vice president, who while putting together
the multibillion-dollar deal was writing e-mails, according to
the SEC, exclaiming that the &#8220;whole building is about to
collapse,&#8221; and that it&#8217;s &#8220;surreal&#8221; that no one understands
these instruments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If he was the culprit, who was the enabler? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Scapegoat &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no inside knowledge, but based on years of watching
politicians and political institutions respond to such crises,
there are two certainties about what&#8217;s going on in the
corporate suites of Goldman Sachs. There is likely near-
universal consensus that much of this is unfair and the company
is being made a scapegoat by pandering politicians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The established order says we&#8217;re going to fight this with
all our considerable resources, while continuing to flourish
financially because we&#8217;re better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeper, however, there is another, more profound debate.
Others, perhaps privately, realize this is a fantasy. If there
is a way to settle the fraud case without risking huge
financial exposure, it has to be considered. Someone with Paul Volcker-like credibility has to be enlisted to review the
company&#8217;s culture and practices; contrition and change at the

&lt;p&gt;Former South African central bank
Governor Tito Mboweni will join Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as an
international adviser on June 1.
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mboweni will be based at Goldman&#8217;s Johannesburg office and
provide strategic advice to the U.S. bank on business
development opportunities, with a focus on South Africa and sub-
Saharan Africa, the New York-based company said today in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former labor minister in President Nelson Mandela&#8217;s first
Cabinet in 1994, Mboweni, 51, left the South African Reserve
Bank in November after a decade at its helm, declining President
Jacob Zuma&#8217;s offer to serve a third term. Mboweni was named
chairman of AngloGold Ashanti Ltd., Africa&#8217;s biggest gold
producer, on Feb. 24, three weeks after he was appointed to the
same position at packaging-maker Nampak Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&#8220;one shi**y deal,&#8221; according to an excerpt from internal
e-mails released by Senate lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction was Timberwolf Ltd., a $1 billion

&lt;p&gt;Newly disclosed Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. internal e-mails cast light on how the investment bank
devised collateralized debt obligations called Abacus, including
one at the center of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
fraud lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mails show employees discussed which outside firms
would be &#8220;easiest&#8221; to work with while creating Abacus CDOs to
bet against the housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mails were released yesterday by Senator Carl Levin,
the Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations, as the panel prepares to
question Goldman Sachs executives today. In one message, a
Goldman Sachs worker asked which outside firm would most likely
approve assets that hedge fund Paulson  Co. wanted to include
in a CDO and bet against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The way I look at it, the easiest manager to work with
should be used for our own axes,&#8221; the author wrote in December
2006, using industry jargon that can refer to the firm&#8217;s 
financial interest in a deal. The writer also expressed concern 
that two firms being considered weren&#8217;t likely to sign off on 
Paulson&#8217;s suggested assets. &#8220;They will never agree to the type 
of names [P]aulson want to use[.]&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate committee&#8217;s investigators have pored through
about 2 million Goldman Sachs documents as lawmakers prepare to
question Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and six
other current and former employees. They include Fabrice Tourre,
the banker at the center of the SEC&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Be Sensitive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one e-mail, Tourre emphasized the firm should focus on
serving Paulson to reap greater profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We need to be sensitive of the profitability of these
trades vs. profitability of abacus,&#8221; Tourre wrote in one e-
mail, according to a copy released by Levin. &#8220;We should
prioritize the higher profit margin businesses with Paulson.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mail about picking the easiest manager was part of an
exchange with Tourre, according to a list of exhibits released
by the lawmaker. The author wasn&#8217;t identified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another December 2006 e-mail, Tourre discussed other
business opportunities for Abacus, outlining a strategy in which
Goldman Sachs would &#8220;&#8216;rent&#8217; our Abacus platform to
counterparties&#8221; that wanted to short the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The messages show &#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its own
interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221;
Levin said. While his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for
determining whether there was any criminal activity, it will
decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter to the
SEC or the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, claiming the New
York-based bank misled investors in a CDO about the role Paulson
played in assembling the deal and the fund&#8217;s intent to bet that
its underlying assets would lose value. The hedge fund, run by
billionaire investor John Paulson, wasn&#8217;t accused of wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is fighting the SEC&#8217;s claims, which it says
are &#8220;unfounded in law and fact.&#8221; In prepared testimony for
today&#8217;s hearing, Blankfein said the firm didn&#8217;t bet against
clients and didn&#8217;t &#8220;make a massive short&#8221; against the housing
market. &lt;/p&gt;

Harrington" date="Apr 26, 2010  5:30 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-26/goldman-sachs-credit-swaps-climb-to-10-month-high-before-congress-grilling.html"><headline>Goldman Credit Risk Rises as U.S. Senate Considers Reform Bill, Swaps Show</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect the debt of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and two other derivatives dealers jumped for the fourth day as
the U.S. Senate considers a bill that may curb their trading
revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs, the bank facing
fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, jumped to the highest in almost a year. Contracts on
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America&#8217;s Merrill Lynch unit reached
the highest since August, and JPMorgan swaps climbed the most in
more than 11 weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation would damp one of Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable businesses, in which Goldman, JPMorgan, Bank of
America, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. earned an estimated
$28 billion in revenue last year, according to filings with the
Federal Reserve and people familiar with their income sources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate was set to hold a test vote today on legislation
that would force the most actively traded derivatives to
exchanges or trading platforms that resemble exchanges, mandate
banks to hold more capital on other derivatives trades and
require commercial banks to wall off swaps trading desks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re talking about a pretty significant contributor to
earnings,&#8221; said Alexander Yavorsky, a senior analyst at Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service in New York. &#8220;If they lost a material portion
of that, it obviously wouldn&#8217;t be good. The problem with
exchange trading for dealers is that they would be giving up
profits without a concomitant decrease in risk to compensate for
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test Vote &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Richard Shelby, a lead negotiator on the financial-
reform bill, said Republicans will block Democrats&#8217; efforts to
begin debate on the measure in a test vote today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The derivatives provisions are part of a broader financial-
regulation bill intended to prevent a repeat of the credit
crisis that led to the failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
the near collapse of Bear Stearns Cos. and the government
bailout of insurer American International Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legislation includes measures empowering federal
agencies to dissolve failed systemically important financial
firms to prevent their collapse from disrupting the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan alone could lose as much as $3 billion a year in
revenue if it doesn&#8217;t combat the move of derivatives trades to
exchanges, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a March 15 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banking system is on a journey to being much more
utility-like,&#8221; Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive officer at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said today at the Milken
Global Institute conference in Los Angeles. &#8220;What&#8217;s likely to
happen over the next few months is much more emphasis on
stability and less emphasis on efficiency and innovation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing Tomorrow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five-year credit-default swaps on Goldman jumped 23 basis
points to 167 basis points as of 4:35 p.m. in New York,
according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. That&#8217;s the highest
since May 2009, CMA DataVision prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is set
to question Goldman Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein and six current and former employees of the firm
tomorrow. The SEC says Goldman Sachs and executive director
Fabrice Tourre misled investors in a 2007 collateralized debt
obligation about the role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co.,
which bet the CDO would collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, will tell the panel, according to a prepared text of his
remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman swaps have jumped 76 basis points since April 15,
the day before the SEC announced its fraud suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on JPMorgan climbed 17 basis points to a mid-price of
89.5 basis points, the most since Feb. 4, CMA prices show.
Morgan Stanley swaps jumped 34 to 184.5. Contracts on Merrill
rose 37 to 193 and Bank of America swaps increased 37 to 162,
CMA prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markit CDX Index &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on Citigroup Inc. rose 21 basis points to a mid-price
of 183, Phoenix prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A benchmark indicator of U.S. corporate credit risk rose to
the highest in two months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index Series 14, which investors use to hedge
against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, climbed 2.2 basis points to a mid-price of 91
basis points as of 5:23 p.m. in New York, according to index
administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was sued
by shareholders over a collateralized-debt obligation known as
Abacus 2007-AC1 that prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose the truth about Abacus or the
bank&#8217;s financial condition, investors said in the complaint
filed today in federal court in Manhattan. &#8220;As news of
Goldman&#8217;s misconduct reached the market, Goldman stock
immediately plummeted,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the SEC sued Goldman Sachs on April 16, its shares
fell 13 percent to close at $160.70. That case centers on
whether the New York-based firm should have told investors that
hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick underlying securities in
the CDO -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of
wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendants omitted and/or misrepresented material facts
concerning Goldman&#8217;s participation in structuring the CDO to
help one client who was short the CDO while simultaneously
selling the CDO to another client,&#8221; investors said in today&#8217;s
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Ilene Richman filed the lawsuit on behalf of
others who bought Goldman Sachs shares from Oct. 15 to April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a call seeking comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The securities-fraud suit, filed by San Diego-based law
firm Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd LLP, also names as defendants
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar and President Gary D. Cohn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Investigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank concealed from investors that it was being
investigated by the SEC over the CDO late last year, at the same
time it launched a public-relations campaign touting its
&#8220;responsible business practices&#8221; to combat negative publicity
over $16 billion in bonuses it was scheduled to pay employees,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose the SEC probe in its third-
quarter filing with the commission on Nov. 4, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 22, two investors separately sued Goldman Sachs
officers and directors, including Blankfein, on behalf of the
bank in state court in Manhattan for permitting the company to
enter into a series of CDOs, including Abacus 2007-AC1, tied to
the subprime market. Another so-called derivative lawsuit was
filed against the officers and directors today in federal court
in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell $5.37, or 3.4 percent, to $152.03 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Richman v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 10-03461,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, made an
estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against
mortgage-linked securities, including some it created, a U.S.
senator said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released e-mails and
other documents that he said show &#8220;Goldman repeatedly put its
own interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents precede a showdown on Capitol Hill tomorrow
between Levin&#8217;s panel and seven current and former Goldman Sachs
employees. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 55, and
Fabrice Tourre, 31, an executive director who was named in the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s April 16 fraud lawsuit
against the firm, are among Goldman employees set to answer
questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To sell to customers at the same time you&#8217;re betting
against what you&#8217;re selling -- we think it&#8217;s not uncommon and we
think it ought to end,&#8221; Levin said at a briefing for reporters
today on tomorrow&#8217;s hearing. &#8220;We think there are a number of
banks engaged in similar conduct but we had to focus on one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee estimated that Goldman Sachs generated
$3.7 billion from its short bets on a declining mortgage market
in 2007, Levin said. The figure doesn&#8217;t take into account losses
they suffered on mortgage-related securities they held, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC, Justice Department &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin said his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for determining
whether there was any criminal activity, although he said the
panel will decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter
to the SEC or the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein will tell the committee tomorrow that the firm
didn&#8217;t wager against clients and didn&#8217;t make a big bet against
the housing market, according to the prepared text of his
remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
will say, according to the text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the firm disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;I also
recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many
people,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;We have to do a better job of striking
the balance between what an informed client believes is
important to his or her investing goals and what the public
believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Real Bad Feeling&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the evidence Levin presented today was an internal e-
mail about a March 2007 presentation to the board of directors
that describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage derivatives desk started
the quarter with a $6 billion &#8220;long&#8221; position on BBB- rated
mortgages &#8220;and shifted the position to net short $10bn
notional.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An October 2007 internal e-mail sent to Daniel Sparks, who
ran the mortgage business at the time and is among those
scheduled to testify, includes the comment &#8220;real bad feeling
across European sales about some of the trades we did with
clients. The damage this has done to our franchise is very
significant. Aggregate loss of our clients on just these 5
trades along (sic) is 1bln+.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Swenson, a managing director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
structured products group who is also to appear tomorrow,
boasted in his 2007 performance review that &#8220;I said &#8216;no&#8217; to
clients who demanded that GS should &#8216;support the GSAMP&#8217; program
as clients tried to gain leverage over us,&#8221; he said, referring
to the name for Goldman&#8217;s own mortgage-backed deals. &#8220;Those
were unpopular decisions but they saved the firm hundreds of
millions of dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ties That Bind &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a September 2007 e-mail to Blankfein, an employee
describes having met with 10 or more individual &#8220;prospects&#8221;
and clients and tells Blankfein about how their attitudes differ
from institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur (sic) good at making money for urself
(sic) but not us,&#8221; the e-mail said. &#8220;The individuals do
sometimes, but while it requires the utmost humility from us in
response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to
the firm, because the alternative of take ur (sic) money to a
firm who is an under performer and not the best, just isn&#8217;t
reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association with the best
is good for them in the long run.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs built a &#8220;conveyer belt&#8221; of mortgage deals
and then bet against them, Levin said, actions that he said
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Incalculable Harm&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a number of ways they contributed to the collapse of
this economy,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The toxins that Goldman Sachs and
others helped inject into our financial system has done
incalculable harm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Levin said he is ready to vote on a financial
regulation package that is set to be considered by the Senate
this week, he said he thinks it could be strengthened. He has
proposed an amendment that would help resolve the conflicts of
interest among Wall Street firms that he said are embodied in
the documents. He also endorsed banning financial firms from
engaging in so-called naked credit default swaps, or bets on a
decline in creditworthiness by parties that have no exposure to
the credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Levin posted internal Goldman Sachs e-mails on his
website on April 24 that he said show the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; the firm
responded with more than 70 pages of e-mails and other documents
that it said showed the firm lost money on mortgages in 2008 and
that executives didn&#8217;t have any kind of consensus that the
market would fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$68 Million Bonus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs contests the SEC&#8217;s claims that the firm
defrauded investors when selling a debt instrument tied to
mortgages by failing to inform them of the role played by hedge
fund Paulson  Co. The company said on April 24 that Levin&#8217;s
committee &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; the evidence it released and jumped
to conclusions &#8220;even before holding a hearing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then set a new
record in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. Blankfein, whose $67.9 million bonus in 2007
was a record for a Wall Street CEO, received no bonus in 2008
and a $9 million all-stock bonus for last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pecora Era &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Levin said his committee hasn&#8217;t found any evidence
that Blankfein was himself aware of the firm&#8217;s positions on
specific deals, he said the documents show that Blankfein knew
the firm was shorting the market in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interrogation of Goldman Sachs may echo Ferdinand
Pecora&#8217;s Depression-era investigation of powerful financiers
like J.P. Morgan Jr., said some historians. Levin, who has
served in the Senate for more than 30 years, and his panel have
a reputation for thorough research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Looking at this crisis, it&#8217;s hard not to agree with the
conclusion of another congressional committee, which found &#8216;the
result of the unregulated activities of the investment bankers
were enormous,&#8217;&#8221; Levin said in the briefing with journalists.
&#8220;That conclusion came in 1934, when the Senate looked into the
reasons for the Great Depression.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oliver was in charge of CME&#8217;s credit-default swaps clearing

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, will tell a
Senate committee tomorrow that the firm didn&#8217;t wager against
clients and didn&#8217;t make a big bet against the housing market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, will tell the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations,
according to a prepared text of his remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein and six other current and former Goldman Sachs
executives will testify in front of the panel about their
practices in the mortgage-securities market leading up to the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The firm
faces a fraud lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange
Commission that accuses it of failing to inform investors about
the role played by a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As you know, ten days ago, the SEC announced a civil
action against Goldman Sachs in connection with a specific
transaction,&#8221; Blankfein will say, according to the text of his
remarks. &#8220;It was one of the worst days in my professional life,
as I know it was for every person at our firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein will say that New York-based Goldman Sachs has
been a &#8220;client-centered firm for 140 years and if our clients
believe that we don&#8217;t deserve their trust, we cannot survive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Complicated Transaction&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the firm says it disagrees with the SEC&#8217;s complaint,
&#8220;I also recognize how such a complicated transaction may look
to many people,&#8221; Blankfein said in his remarks. &#8220;We have to do
a better job of striking the balance between what an informed
client believes is important to his or her investing goals and
what the public believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein will also say that the firm favors more
transparency for the public and regulators and is supporting the
creation of clearinghouses for eligible derivatives. He also
said the firm recognizes that many in the U.S. are skeptical
about investment banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we and other banks, rating agencies and regulators
failed to do was sound the alarm that there was too much lending
and too much leverage in the system -- that credit had become
too cheap,&#8221; Blankfein will say, according to the remarks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Meriwether, Singapore may be
just the place for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s not what last week&#8217;s headlines suggest. Singapore is
reviewing rules for its investment-management industry,
including hedge funds and private-equity outfits. It didn&#8217;t cite
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s troubles, yet regulatory tweaks are
sure to mushroom everywhere and damp trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could, oddly enough, benefit Asian financial hubs,
which are wooing hedge funds. Singapore is even planning to
create its own Greenwich, Connecticut -- the playground of the
Meriwethers and Paul Tudor Jones&#8217;s of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who argue hedge funds do humankind little good have a
point. Meriwether&#8217;s Long-Term Capital Management LP almost took
the global financial system down with it in 1998. Yet no city
can be a real global market center while barring hedge funds
from setting up shop. It&#8217;s all about balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud suit against
Goldman is the vanguard of a Wall Street inquisition. As the
process unfolds, it will shine a bright light on the ways in
which investment banks and hedge funds interact. In Goldman&#8217;s
case, it&#8217;s the bank&#8217;s dealings with Paulson  Co. The focus will
be more on the West&#8217;s practices -- not Asia&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asian Conservatism &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years ago, Asia was a center of criticism on the part
of investors. Regulations were said to be too tight, rules on
leverage and proprietary trading too rigid, governments too
skeptical of foreign bankers and financial innovation. That
conservatism paid off following the events of 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in Asia hadn&#8217;t bet big on subprime debt or gone
overboard on collateralized-debt obligations. It&#8217;s a key reason
why the region held its ground while major economies such as the
U.S. went into freefall. And today, Asia&#8217;s less permissive
regulatory environment is more an asset than a liability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the pendulum swings toward greater accountability in
Washington, you can bet the process will go further than
investors want. That may be needed to right an economy in which
finance has become bigger and more influential than it ever
should have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investigations into Goldman allowing hedge-fund manager
John Paulson to select securities he wanted to bet against
without informing investors will beget others. It&#8217;s the price
the U.S. will pay for spending the last 25 years removing
safeguards against markets taking the entire economy with them
when they go off the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Oasis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the process unfolds and the subpoenas fly, investors
will be looking for an oasis. That place may be Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decade ago, hedge funds were blamed for Asia&#8217;s financial
crisis. In Malaysia, for example, then-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad assailed billionaire George Soros for the ringgit&#8217;s
slide. Throughout Asia, public sentiment turned against foreign
funds, regardless of whether they were short-sellers or long-
term value investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The push now in cities from Kuala Lumpur to Seoul is to
become global financial hubs. Greater openness to even the most
aggressive foreign investors is a sign of confidence that Asia&#8217;s
financial systems have come of age. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia must be careful not to go too far. We now understand
that one of U.S.-style capitalism&#8217;s biggest flaws is skewed
incentives. Massive paychecks and bonuses drove the supposedly
best and brightest to Wall Street, where great rewards awaited
the biggest risk takers. Going into science or engineering,
running large corporations or launching start-ups lost its
appeal to working on trading floors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recipe for Disaster &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More people looking to manage wealth than create it is a
recipe for disaster. The absence of reform since the crash of
2008 meant it was business as usual, and the return of massive
bonuses is proving it. That was, until the SEC came down on
Goldman. The step was a game-changer and any crackdown on hedge
funds will partly bear Goldman&#8217;s fingerprints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia was wise not to follow the U.S.&#8217;s flawed model in
lockstep. What Robert Rubin, Treasury secretary in Bill Clinton&#8217;s administration, saw as intransigence a decade ago now
looks like enviable prescience. What officials under President
George W. Bush saw as timidity on financial matters now bears
study in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The obvious alternative is Asia. The region&#8217;s impressive
growth is just part of the story. Markets here are less
researched and liquid than Western ones, which means there are
plenty of the inefficiencies that hedge funds look for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond markets in Asia are a work in progress and many of the
largest initial public offerings in the years ahead will be in
this region. Policy makers also are seeking to attract firms to
expand as the U.S. and Europe go the other way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore is Exhibit A. Its plans for a Greenwich-like
cluster of investment outfits follow tax and regulatory
incentives for funds to set up shop there. They are helping the
industry grow from near zero in 1997 to almost 140 firms today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore hardly wants to be host to a debacle like Long-
Term Capital Management, which explains its review of investment
rules. There&#8217;s reason to believe, though, that Asia will avoid
the market excesses that devastated the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG will be allowed to
issue non-sponsored Brazilian depositary receipts of 10 overseas
companies as the nation&#8217;s stock exchange seeks to increase the
range of assets available to investors, BMFBovespa SA said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank was approved to issue BDRs of stocks
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Google Inc. without
participation from the companies, the first such offering in
Brazil, according BMFBovespa. A phone call to Deutsche Bank&#8217;s
Sao Paulo press office was not immediately returned. Deutsche
Bank will hold shares of the companies and create depositary
receipts that can be bought and sold over the counter in Brazil
starting in the second half, the exchange owner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven BDRs that were issued directly by companies
currently trade on Brazil&#8217;s stock exchange, according to
BMFBovespa&#8217;s Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trend of exchanges becoming more international is
irreversible, and with this the Bovespa won&#8217;t be left out of
that trend,&#8221; said Aloisio Lemos, an analyst at Agora Corretora
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil&#8217;s second-biggest brokerage. &#8220;This
opens up a new investment possibility for outside companies to
participate in the Brazilian market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank was approved to issue depositary receipts
representing shares of Goldman Sachs, Google, Apple Inc.,
ArcelorMittal, Bank of America Corp., BHP Billiton Ltd., Exxon

Inc., BMFBovespa said. The exchange will likely allow other
lenders to act as depositary banks in a competitive bidding
process in the future, the statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The BMFBovespa has as its objective the offer of new

&lt;p&gt;Now that the Securities and
Exchange Commission has unofficially declared Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to be the big bad wolf of the 2007-2009 financial
crisis, what should investors do? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe they should buy Goldman Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like some other financial companies too, but let&#8217;s start
with the wolf. With a market value of about $86 billion, New
York-based Goldman is the largest U.S. securities firm, and the
one currently occupying the regulatory hot seat. Several
executives from the firm will testify tomorrow before the Senate
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#8217;t know whether Goldman will prevail if the SEC&#8217;s case
alleging fraud goes to trial. If I were a lawyer, I could argue
either side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an SEC attorney, I would claim that Goldman created and
sold to the public a security designed to fail. This was a
synthetic collateralized debt obligation whose component
investments were allegedly chosen by hedge-fund manager John Paulson because he wanted to bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Goldman&#8217;s defense counsel, I would say that Paulson&#8217;s
opinion of those underlying investments doesn&#8217;t matter. What
does matter is whether the risks were properly disclosed, and
they were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will watch the trial with great interest, assuming no
out-of-court settlement is reached first. But as an investor, I
maintain that it doesn&#8217;t matter who wins. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember Exxon&#8217;s Rebound &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guilty verdict might nick Goldman&#8217;s reputation. But the
firm could withstand the hit, I believe. When the Exxon Valdez
had a colossal oil spill in 1989, it harmed the reputation of
Exxon (now Exxon Mobil Corp.) That didn&#8217;t stop Exxon shares from
posting a total return of about 1,000 percent in the 21 years
following the accident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it loses, Goldman might have to pay a substantial fine.
But many firms, from Microsoft Corp. to the big tobacco
companies, have taken legal blows and come back to perform well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider Goldman&#8217;s record. Its revenue has climbed
steadily: $4.5 billion in 1995, $16.6 billion in 2000, $25.2
billion in 2005 and $45.2 billion last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits have also moved up smartly: $1.3 billion in 1995,
$3.1 billion in 2000, $5.6 billion in 2005 and $13.4 billion in
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What earnings multiple would you expect to pay for this
sort of growth? I think that in normal times many investors
would be willing to pay 30 times earnings for it, or more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet today, nervous investors value Goldman shares at only
six times earnings and 1.5 times revenue. This seems like a
bargain to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about $159, Goldman shares have declined more than a
third from their 2007 high of about $247. Investors who don&#8217;t
own the stock can thank the recession and bear market of 2007 to
2009, plus the SEC&#8217;s fraud complaint, for this buying
opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be sure, there are things to worry about. My biggest
concern is Goldman&#8217;s debt, which is 823 percent of stockholders
equity -- way beyond my normal limit of 100 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High debt is commonplace for financial stocks, especially
brokerage firms. That doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t dangerous. Just ask
people who worked for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. before it
went under, or Bear Stearns Cos. before it almost failed and was
forced into a shotgun wedding with JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A second worry, of course, is the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit. Finally,
some of Goldman&#8217;s profit centers -- high-frequency trading,
proprietary trading and collateralized debt obligations -- are
likely to be curbed by proposed financial reform legislation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money Machine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My take on all this is that Goldman has assembled a pool of
creative, talented and driven people who will always find a way
to make money. Not every year will be a blockbuster, but many
years will. If your time horizon is two years or longer, I think
these shares are a good investment. I bought some last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&#8217;t care for the stock of rival Morgan Stanley. It
sells for 46 times earnings, and the debt-to-equity ratio of
1,391 percent is considerably higher than Goldman&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles Schwab Corp. also leaves me cold. At 30 times
earnings and more than five times revenue, the San Francisco-
based retail-oriented firm is too expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More to my liking is Raymond James Financial Inc. of St.
Petersburg, Florida, which has brokerage, investment management
and banking operations. I appreciate its debt-to-equity ratio of
64 percent, svelte for a brokerage firm. And I can tolerate its
price-earnings ratio of 20, because I figure that earnings are
temporarily depressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raymond James is trading at around $31. I wouldn&#8217;t put in
fresh money at that price, but suggest buying if the stock drops
to $27 or less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper Jaffray &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piper Jaffray Cos., with headquarters in Minneapolis, does
institutional brokerage and investment banking. It has a debt-
to-equity ratio of 85 percent, which is good for a brokerage
firm. At 18 times earnings and 1.2 times revenue, the stock may
be fairly priced for the moment at about $38. However, analysts
see better earnings ahead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disclosure note: I own Goldman Sachs, Raymond James and
Piper Jaffray shares personally and for clients. I have no long
or short positions in the other stocks discussed in this week&#8217;s
column. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visa Europe Ltd., operator of the
largest payment-card network in the 27-nation European Union,
offered to reduce debit card transaction fees paid by retailers
in a bid to resolve an EU antitrust case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said it may close its investigation
into debit-card charges after Visa Europe promised &#8220;to
significantly cut&#8221; fees to 0.2 percent. A separate probe into
fees for credit-card and deferred-debit transactions, where
customers must settle their bills at the end of the month, will
continue, the Brussels-based agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This does not mean that the Visa case is over,&#8221; Amelia
Torres, a commission spokeswoman told journalists at a regular
briefing in Brussels today. &#8220;We still have an investigation
concerning credit cards and that continues.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of 390 million Visa-branded cards in Europe, about 256
million are debit cards, the London-based company said.
The so-called interchange fee, based on Visa&#8217;s guidelines, is
paid by the retailer&#8217;s bank to the bank that issued the
customer&#8217;s card. MasterCard Inc. settled a similar case with the
commission last year, agreeing to reduce the interchange fee to
0.3 percent a transaction for credit cards and 0.2 percent a
transaction for debit cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In proposing these commitments Visa Europe has acted in
the best interests of consumers, retailers and our member
banks,&#8221; said Peter Ayliffe, president of Visa Europe, in a
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission will seek comments on the debit-card
proposals before formally adopting the commitments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Weak&#8217; Compromise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EuroCommerce, a group representing retailers such as
Carrefour SA and Tesco Plc, said the commission had accepted a
&#8220;weak interim compromise&#8221; only on debit card fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very disappointed that the commission has opted
for this marginal way out on Visa&#8221;, Xavier Durieu,
EuroCommerce&#8217;s secretary general, said in a statement. &#8220;Since
EuroCommerce lodged the first complaints 13 years ago, neither
Visa nor MasterCard have brought convincing justification for
interchange fees on card transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group last year complained to the commission over the
fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer concerns Visa Europe&#8217;s fees in 9 European
countries, including Iceland, Ireland and Italy. New fees in
Luxembourg and the Netherlands concern prepaid cards issued by
Visa, the commission said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Visa Europe resolved an initial EU complaint by
agreeing to cut the interchange fee over time and cap it based
on costs. The commission concluded then that the five-year
agreement would help payment cards work to the benefit of
consumers. The commission in 2008 opened its new probe into Visa

&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc,
Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and other oil companies are
being investigated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission over
employee compensation practices, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation of whether the companies colluded to curb
employee wages has been open for several years and includes as
many as 12 oil companies, the newspaper said, citing the people.
The FTC may never file a lawsuit, the WSJ said. Calls to the
FTC&#8217;s public affairs office for comment went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court reinstated in 2001 a suit accusing
oil companies including Exxon, Occidental Petroleum Corp. and
Sunoco Inc. of fixing employee pay. The plaintiff, Roberta Todd,
filed the suit in 1997 that cited meetings among the companies&#8217;
human resources departments where managers shared salary
information and surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls outside of regular business hours to Exxon and
Chevron&#8217;s press offices in Dallas and San Ramon went unanswered.
Calls to Shell, Sunoco and Occidental also went unanswered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies and the FTC have discussed possible
settlements over the course of the investigation and failed to
reach agreement, the WSJ said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., seeking
to reduce assets tied to the declining U.S. housing market,
urged its sales force in 2006 and 2007 to sell those products to
clients, newly disclosed internal e-mails show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mails, including communications from Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, show that employees discussed how to
&#8220;arm&#8221; salespeople to shed bonds the firm found too risky to
hold. The e-mails were released yesterday by Senator Carl Levin
in connection with a hearing where current and former managers
testified about the firm&#8217;s role in the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, grilled the executives
about the firm&#8217;s bets against the housing market and its
disclosure to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one of the e-mails, Blankfein asked whether employees
were doing enough to sell bonds backed by home loans including
subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Could/should we have cleaned up these books before and
are we doing enough right now to sell off cats and dogs in other
books throughout the division,&#8221; Blankfein, 55, wrote in an e-
mail dated Feb. 11, 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questioned about the e-mail at yesterday&#8217;s hearing,
Blankfein told senators that his comment didn&#8217;t represent an
opinion of the bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When I use the expression &#8216;cats and dogs&#8217; I mean
miscellaneous stuff,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is part of my normal
point about aged inventory. Part of the discipline of our
business is to manage risk and sell inventory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients&#8217; Questions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The e-mails show that as early as the fall of 2006 clients
were questioning products tied to the mortgage market. On Oct.
19, 2006, Mitchell Resnick sent an e-mail to two colleagues
asking whether the firm had material about &#8220;how great&#8221; BBB
bonds tied to home loans were. BBB is a credit rating from
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings that indicates an
asset is two levels above junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A common response I am hearing&#8221; from potential investors
is &#8220;a concern about the housing market and BBB in particular,&#8221;
Resnick wrote. &#8220;We need to arm sales with a bit more. Do we
have anything?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar convened
a meeting of mortgage traders and risk managers on Dec. 14,
2006, according to a document prepared by the firm that the
Senate panel released yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Net Long&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Goldman Sachs had a &#8220;net long exposure&#8221; to
the subprime-mortgage market, meaning the bank was betting the
market would continue to rise. At the meeting, executives agreed
that the firm should &#8220;reduce its overall exposure to the
subprime mortgage market,&#8221; the document said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Stacey Bash-Polley sent an e-mail to
colleagues six days later with the subject line &#8220;Mezz Risk,&#8221; a
reference to lower tranches of collateralized debt obligations
linked to mortgages. Investors in mezzanine tranches are among
the first to lose money when the asset starts souring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have been thinking collectively about how to help
people move some of the risk,&#8221; wrote Bash-Polley, an executive
in the Goldman Sachs division that sold bonds. &#8220;We need to make
sure we arm&#8221; salespeople &#8220;with our pricing and have them focus
on the more difficult positions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeting Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In targeting clients, Bash-Polley wrote that Goldman Sachs
should focus on those that &#8220;can possibly do larger size at a
level that would be attractive when you take into consideration
the size of risk we could move.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Makes sense to me,&#8221; responded Kevin Gasvoda, a Goldman
Sachs colleague. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Samuel Robinson declined to comment
on the e-mails. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate hearing comes less than two weeks after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm and employee
Fabrice Tourre, 31, on claims they withheld material information
from investors in a CDO. Goldman Sachs said it will vigorously
contest the case, and Tourre told the senators yesterday, &#8220;I
deny categorically the SEC&#8217;s allegations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin said at the hearing that Goldman Sachs &#8220;profited by
taking advantage of its clients&#8217; reasonable expectation that it
would not sell products that it didn&#8217;t want to succeed, and that
there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and
the customers it had pledged to serve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Sept. 26, 2007, e-mail released by the committee, Peter
Kraus, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s then co-head of investment management,
told Blankfein that some clients were expressing concern that
the firm was making money for itself but not its customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had reported six days earlier that third-
quarter net income rose 79 percent to $2.85 billion after the
bank bet against mortgage bonds. Kraus told Blankfein he had met
with more than 10 clients and &#8220;individual prospects&#8221; since the
earnings announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur good at making money for urself but
not us,&#8221; wrote Kraus, who left Goldman Sachs in September 2008
after working at the company for 22 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The individuals do sometimes, but while it requires the
utmost humility from us in response, I feel very strongly it
binds clients even closer to the firm. The alternative of take
ur money to a firm who is an under performer and not the best,
just isn&#8217;t reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association
with the best is good for them in the long run,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told a Senate panel that
market-makers have no obligation to tell clients about their own
position in a security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, responding to questions from Senator Carl Levin,
chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said
the nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn&#8217;t care what our views are.
They shouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate panel, winding up a probe of Goldman Sachs that
has lasted more than a year, used today&#8217;s hearing to pepper
current and former executives with questions about their duty to
clients and the ethics of betting against the housing market as
the bank also sold mortgage-linked securities to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees testified
about the mortgage-securities business in the years leading to
the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history, was sued for fraud earlier this month by the
Securities and Exchange Commission. The company contests the
claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said people on Wall Street weren&#8217;t certain that
housing prices would drop before the financial crisis began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think we&#8217;re not that smart,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;Even the
people who in hindsight knew it, I think they thought it, and
then it turned out they were right. I can tell you for my own
self, at 20 percent down in the housing market, I didn&#8217;t know
whether it would go down 30 percent or rebound up 10 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Levin Agree: Don't Call Securities `Crap'</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. Chief Financial Officer David Viniar agreed on
at least one thing during his testimony today before the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations: Investment bankers
shouldn&#8217;t call the securities they sell &#8220;crap.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin asked what Viniar felt when he read e-mails in which
Goldman Sachs employees described mortgage-linked securities as
&#8220;crap&#8221; or &#8220;shitty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate to have on e-mail,&#8221;
Viniar said, drawing laughter from the audience and the press. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Please don&#8217;t take that the wrong way,&#8221; Viniar said when
pressed by Levin. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate for anyone
to have said that in any form.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin then asked, &#8220;How about to believe that and sell
it?&#8221; and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you should have started with,&#8221; Levin
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar apologized to Levin a second time after the senator
returned to the hearing room following a vote. &#8220;You were 100
percent right,&#8221; Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. received a
100 percent payout on its collateral from American International
Group Inc. because &#8220;it was what they owed us,&#8221; Chief Financial
Officer David Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, who spoke today at a Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations hearing in Washington, said there was no
negotiation with the U.S. Treasury Department over the payout.
Viniar said Goldman Sachs received about $12.9 billion in 2008
related to securities-lending and credit-default swap contracts
with AIG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based insurer, as part of a bailout
orchestrated by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, paid 100
cents on the dollar on credit-default swaps purchased by bank
counterparties including New York-based Goldman Sachs. The New
York Fed said it had to make the payments after banks refused to
accept so-called haircuts, according to a November audit from
Neil Barofsky, the special inspector of the U.S. Troubled Asset
Relief Program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
testified at a hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry
Commission in January that he was never asked by U.S. regulators
to accept a discount on the AIG contracts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, boosted
its dividend by 18 percent, almost double last year&#8217;s increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quarterly payout will rise 10 cents to 65 cents a
share, IBM said today in a statement. The Armonk, New York-based
company also is adding $8 billion to its current stock-
repurchase plan, bringing the total to $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increases may boost IBM&#8217;s appeal with investors after
the company, led by Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano,
posted its smallest profit increase last year since 2005 as
clients curbed spending amid the recession. Last week, the stock
dropped after IBM reported a decline in first-quarter signings
of service contracts, suggesting corporate spending on larger
projects hasn&#8217;t picked up yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a positive sign,&#8221; UBS AG analyst Maynard Um said of
the dividend boost, noting that investors expected it. He rates
the shares, which he doesn&#8217;t own, &#8220;neutral,&#8221; and said IBM&#8217;s
earnings growth is outpacing sales gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The higher payout reflects the strength of IBM&#8217;s business
more than the economy, Vice President of Financial Management
Jesse Greene said today in an interview. IBM has spent the past
decade investing in its software and services businesses, which
tend to have higher profit margins than hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Acquisitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increases won&#8217;t affect IBM&#8217;s acquisition strategy,
Greene added. The company bought five companies last quarter for
a total of $1 billion, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge
said on a conference call last week. Cash flow increased $400
million to about $1.4 billion in the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales climbed 5.3 percent last quarter, the largest
increase in more than a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM fell $1.91 to $128.82 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares have fallen 1.6 percent
this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payout increase marks the 15th year in a row IBM has
raised its dividend, which is payable June 10 to shareholders of
record May 10. Last year was the first time since 2006 the
company didn&#8217;t boost it by 10 cents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
were grilled by U.S. senators probing the bank&#8217;s mortgage
business as Senator Carl Levin asked why it sold a set of
investments the lender had itself labeled &#8220;shitty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of
that deal after your people knew it was a shitty deal?&#8221; the
Michigan Democrat asked Daniel Sparks, who ran the bank&#8217;s
mortgage unit at the time. &#8220;Does that bother you at all?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, who heads the Senate subcommittee that&#8217;s holding
today&#8217;s hearings, was referring to a June 2007 e-mail from
Thomas Montag, the former head of sales and trading in the
Americas at Goldman Sachs, to Sparks. The message described a
set of mortgage-linked investments that his bank had been trying
to sell as part of &#8220;one shitty deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal
after that,&#8221; Sparks replied, adding that he believed the e-mail
referred to his performance, not the security itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks,
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to get too many clear answers from
you,&#8221; Levin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven current and former Goldman Sachs employees including
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein are testifying about the
mortgage-securities business in the years leading to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs, the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, had been
sued for fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
contests the claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre Denies Allegations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the executives testified, Goldman Sachs shares had one
of three gains among the 79 financial companies in the SP 500.
The stock rose 70 cents to $152.73 as of 12:50 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the only Goldman Sachs employee named by
the SEC, testified today that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denied the
allegations. &#8220;I will defend myself in court against this false
claim, Tourre, 31, told the standing-room-only hearing of the
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction referred to by Levin was Timberwolf Ltd., a
$1 billion collateralized debt obligation holding pieces of
other CDOs. The CDO also included optimistic side-bets on the
performance of CDOs, derivatives in which the firm took the
opposite pessimistic side in &#8216;&#8216;many&#8217;&#8217; cases, the panel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Timberwolf&#8217;s 2008 Liquidation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Boy that timberwo[l]f was one shitty deal,&#8217;&#8217; Montag, who
is now Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s president of global banking and
markets, said in a June 22, 2007, e-mail. Within five months of
Timberwolf&#8217;s debut, the CDO had lost 80 percent of its value,
and it was liquidated in 2008, according to the statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;The message that I took from the e-mail from Mr. Montag
was that my performance on that deal wasn&#8217;t good and I think the
fact that we had lost money related to that wasn&#8217;t good,&#8221;
Sparks said at the hearing. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t use that term in respect
to this deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparks, 43, who left the bank in 2008, told Montag earlier
on June 22, 2007, that $300 million of Timberwolf securities were
the &#8220;main thing&#8221; left among a group of positions the bank had
bought from an unidentified source, according to the e-mails. In
a June 7, 2007, e-mail, a Goldman Sachs employee said a head of
sales in Korea at the New York-based company felt like he could
&#8220;push&#8221; a buyer whose name was redacted to purchase more of the
debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein to Speak &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDO was among securities that Goldman Sachs sold to
clients after deciding the firm needed to reduce its mortgage
holdings, Levin&#8217;s panel said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montag, now 53, isn&#8217;t scheduled to appear and didn&#8217;t
respond to a request for comment. Bank of America spokeswoman
Jessica Oppenheim declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee began to release excerpts of the Goldman
Sachs documents yesterday. Today, Blankfein, 55, will tell the
panel his firm didn&#8217;t wager against clients, according to a
prepared text of his remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe we at all times worked appropriately with our
clients,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. We did try to manage our
risk, as our shareholders and regulators would expect.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Buys Timberwolf &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Timberwolf CDO was issued in March 2007, following a
Goldman Sachs quarter that ended February 2007 in which one
department of the bank shifted from $6 billion of bets that
mortgage bonds would perform to $10 billion they would default,
according to Bloomberg data and information the panel released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns Asset Management, the manager of two hedge
funds overseen by Ralph Cioffi whose collapse in June 2007
roiled global markets, was among the buyers, purchasing about
$300 million, according to the committee. Cioffi&#8217;s funds that
month sold some securities to meet margin calls from lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparks in one e-mail urged &#8220;personnel working on a
potential Korean sale to &#8216;[g]et &#8216;er done,&#8217; and sent a mass e-
mail to the sales force promising &#8216;ginormous credits&#8217; for
selling&#8217;&#8217; the debt, according to Levin&#8217;s statement. &#8216;&#8216;A
congratulatory e-mail was sent to an employee who sold a number
of the securities: &#8216;Great job _ trading us out of our entire
Timberwolf Single-A position,&#8217; &#8217;&#8217; the panel said, potentially
referring to $36 million of A-rated notes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montag&#8217;s Career &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Montag retired from Goldman Sachs in December 2007, and was
recruited in April 2008 by then Merrill Lynch  Co. CEO John A.
Thain to his firm. Merrill Lynch was bought by Bank of America
in a government-assisted deal at the start of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs repackage pools of assets such as mortgage bonds, bank
capital notes and buyout loans into new securities with varying
risks. While Timberwolf was initially intended to be about half
invested in mortgage-bond CDOs and half invested in
collateralized loan obligations tied to company debt, the bank
sold many of its &#8216;&#8216;best-performing&#8217;&#8217; CLOs separately after a
rebound in their values, Levin&#8217;s statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin&#8217;s committee also released e-mails with references to
Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, Anderson Mezzanine 2007-1 and Abacus
2007-AC1, the CDO at the heart of the SEC suit filed April 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. claims Goldman Sachs misled investors by failing
to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co. -- which was betting
against the U.S. mortgage market -- helped the Abacus CDO
manager select securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman
Sachs has called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8216;&#8216;completely unfounded.&#8221;
Paulson wasn&#8217;t accused of any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greywolf&#8217;s Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDO managers select the collateral going into the vehicles,
and sometimes reinvest as the underlying positions pay down and
trade in and out of holdings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Timberwolf&#8217;s case, the manager was Purchase, New York-
based Greywolf Capital Management LP. The firm&#8217;s partners
included the late Greg Mount, who joined in 2005 after nine
years at Goldman Sachs, where he helped build its CDOs business,
according to the prospectus and the firm&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greywolf, which focuses on corporate debt and says on its
website it manages $848 million, planned to buy $41 million of
the CDO&#8217;s junior-most tranches, according to the prospectus. In
January 2007, Goldman Sachs underwrote a $502 million CLO
managed by Greywolf tied to high-yield company loans, according
to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflicts Disclosed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conflicts of interest section of Timberwolf&#8217;s
prospectus said that Greywolf might &#8220;take into consideration
research and other brokerage services&#8221; from investment banks in
its decision-making for the CDO and also make separate
investments with &#8220;interests different from or adverse to&#8221; the
CDO&#8217;s collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Under the terms of the Collateral Management Agreement,&#8221;
Greywolf &#8220;will be permitted to take whatever action is in the
Collateral Manager&#8217;s best interest regardless of the impact on
the Collateral Assets,&#8221; according to the prospectus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mount died last April, the company said in a statement at
the time. Shawn Pattison, a spokesman for Greywolf, declined to
immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Goldman Sachs&#8217;s role, the prospectus said the firm would
act as the sole counterparty for the bullish derivative bets on
CDOs that the vehicle was making through so-called credit-
default swaps, &#8220;which creates concentration risk and may create
certain conflicts of interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matthew G. Bieber, described by the panel as the Goldman
trader responsible for managing Timberwolf&#8217;s issuance, later
characterized the day that the CDO was created as &#8220;a day that
will live in infamy,&#8221; according to an e-mail released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An employee at Goldman Sachs who today answered a number
for Bieber said that he was &#8220;off the desk&#8221; and didn&#8217;t take a
message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Charles River Laboratories
International Inc.., a provider of drug-testing services, plans
to use $1.25 billion in bank loans to finance its WuXi
PharmaTech (Cayman) Inc. acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. committed to provide $687.5 million
portion of the loan and Bank of America Corp. will finance the
remaining $562.5 million, Wilmington, Massachusetts-based
Charles River said yesterday in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two banks intend to syndicate the loan to additional
financial institutions in consultation with Charles River,
according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $1.6 billion transaction is the largest foreign
takeover of a Chinese company. It would give Charles River
testing facilities in Shanghai, Suzhou and Tianjin in China,
where cheaper labor and laboratory costs are luring the world&#8217;s
biggest drugmakers in search of new blockbuster medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charles River will borrow $1 billion in a term loan, as
much as $170 million of which will be available in euros, and a
$250 million revolving credit line, with as much as $150 million
available in euros, according to a commitment letter attached to
the filing. Both loans will mature in five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will repay 5 percent of the term loan during
the first year; 10 percent, 15 percent and 20 percent in years
two through four, according to the letter. The rest will be due
during the last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the proposed terms, Charles River will pay lenders an
interest rate 2 percentage points to 2.75 percentage points more
than the London interbank offered rate. Banks will also get a
commitment fee ranging from 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent on the
revolving portion of the loan, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The margin over Libor, the rate banks charge to lend to
each other, and the commitment fee will depend on the company&#8217;s
leverage ratio, the letter shows. Charles River&#8217;s debt to
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
will be capped at 3.5 times after the transaction, according to
the letter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, sending the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index down for a second day, as growing
concern Europe&#8217;s debt crisis is spreading overshadowed better-
than-estimated earnings and consumer confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcoa Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. led the Dow Jones
Industrial Average lower as Standard  Poor&#8217;s reduction of
Portugal&#8217;s credit rating added to concern that Greece&#8217;s struggle
to finance its deficit will spread to other indebted European
nations. Ford Motor Co. fell more than 4 percent from a five-
year high as an analyst said first-quarter results were
&#8220;unsustainable.&#8221; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. rose as executives
testified to a Senate panel about mortgage-securities practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 declined 0.8 percent to 1,202.41 at 11:16 a.m.
in New York. The Dow lost 61.37 points, or 0.6 percent, to
11,143.66. Equities pared losses earlier as 3M Co. rallied on
better-than-estimated profit and the Conference Board&#8217;s consumer
sentiment gauge reached the highest since September 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until you get more clarity around what the IMF and more
importantly the EU are going to do to help out Greece, you do
have more difficulty for risky assets such as stocks to do
well,&#8221; said David Chalupnik, head of equities at First American
Funds in Minneapolis, which manages $13 billion in stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 retreated from a 19-month high yesterday as
concern that financial reform legislation will curb bank profits
overshadowed improving earnings at Caterpillar Inc. and
Whirlpool Corp. The main benchmark for American equities is up
79 percent from a 12-year low in 2009 after falling as much as
57 percent from a record in October 2007 amid a global recession
intensified by the collapse of the U.S. real estate market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece Concern &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek two-year notes tumbled, sending the yield above 15
percent, the highest level since at least 1998. Germany&#8217;s
Chancellor Angela Merkel said Greece must provide a program for
cutting its budget deficit before getting an EU-led bailout
package. Portuguese 10-year spreads, the extra yield that
investors demand to hold its debt rather than German
equivalents, jumped to 260 basis points today, the most since at
least 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose less than forecast in
February from a year earlier, a sign a housing recovery will
take time to develop. The SP/Case-Shiller home-price index of
property values in 20 cities increased 0.6 percent from February
2009, the first gain since December 2006, the group said today
in New York. The median forecast of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News projected a 1.3 percent advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unsustainable&#8217; Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford, the only U.S. auto company to avoid bankruptcy last
year, fell 4.4 percent to $13.82. Ford&#8217;s first-quarter earnings
of $2.1 billion, which topped the average analyst estimate, were
boosted by &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; gains at finance unit Ford Motor
Credit from rising resale prices, Himanshu Patel, a JPMorgan
Chase  Co. analyst in New York, told investors in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office Depot Inc. tumbled 14 percent, the most in the SP
500, to $7.72. The second-largest U.S. office-supplies retailer
posted first-quarter profit excluding some items of 7 cents a
share, trailing the average analyst estimate by 14 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 80 percent of SP 500 companies to have posted first-
quarter earnings have topped analysts&#8217; projections, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit estimates for companies in
the index rose 9.1 percent on average in April, twice the gain
in prices and the largest monthly increase since at least 2006,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Watch &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3M rose 1.9 percent to $89.13. The maker of 55,000 products
from dental implants to Post-It Notes topped analysts&#8217; estimates
for first-quarter profit as sales rose at least 12 percent in
each of its main units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tellabs Inc. rose the most in the SP 500, advancing 9.5
percent to $9. The supplier of network technology said second-
quarter sales will climb at least 10 percent from the previous
quarter. That amounts to about $418 million, beating the $386.5
million average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lexmark International Inc. gained 4.6 percent to $41.78.
The second-largest U.S. printer maker forecast second-quarter
profit of 85 cents to 95 cents a share, excluding some items,
compared with the 73-cent average of estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose 2.4 percent to $155.63 as the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations began a hearing to
discuss the company&#8217;s business practices leading up to the
collapse of the subprime mortgage market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the subcommittee,
released documents that he said showed the company &#8220;put its own
interest and profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221; a
conflict he called on Congress to end. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, will dispute that
assertion and argue the firm was merely managing its own risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senate is debating financial reform legislation that
could prevent banks from trading for their own accounts and
require them to separate derivatives businesses from regulated
depository subsidiaries. Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar estimated in January that approximately 10 percent
of the company&#8217;s revenue derives from trading that has no
connection with customer business. &lt;/p&gt;

Donmoyer" date="Apr 27, 2010 11:15 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-27/goldman-s-tourre-to-categorically-deny-sec-s-claims.html"><headline>Goldman's Tourre `Categorically' Denies SEC's Claims</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. executive director sued by the Securities and
Exchange Commission for fraud, told a Senate subcommittee that
he will defend himself in court against the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I deny categorically the SEC&#8217;s allegations,&#8221; Tourre, 31,
said today at a standing-room-only hearing of the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations in Washington. &#8220;I will defend
myself in court against this false claim,&#8221; he said, adding that
a deal at the center of the suit &#8220;was not designed to fail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre spoke after protesters dressed in prison garb held
up signs reading &#8220;shame&#8221; and one shouted, &#8220;Too big to fail but
not too big for jail.&#8221; Six other current and former Goldman
Sachs employees including Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein are testifying today about the firm&#8217;s mortgage-
securities business in the years leading up to the biggest
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Goldman Sachs, the
most profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, contests
the SEC&#8217;s suit, saying it provided investors with all of the
information they needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2007, as the U.S. housing market teetered, Goldman
Sachs created and sold a CDO linked to subprime mortgages
without disclosing to investors ACA Management LLC and IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped
pick the underlying securities and bet against the vehicle,
known as Abacus 2007-AC1, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its complaint, the SEC alleged that Tourre misled ACA
into thinking that Paulson planned to invest in the equity, or
riskiest piece, of the deal instead of betting against it by
buying credit protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Most Important Clients&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I never told ACA, the portfolio selection agent, that
Paulson  Co. would be an equity investor in the AC-1
transaction or would take any long position in the deal,&#8221;
Tourre told the panel, as media including television crews from
Japan and Russia looked on. &#8220;Although I don&#8217;t recall the exact
words that I used, I recall informing ACA that Paulson&#8217;s fund
was expected to buy credit protection on some of the senior
tranches.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre also told the panel that ACA and IKB were
&#8220;institutions with significant resources and experience in the
CDO market&#8221; and that they &#8220;were two of the most important
clients of my desk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs also had no economic motive to design the
AC-1 transaction to fail,&#8221; said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unfounded Attacks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have been the target of unfounded attacks on my
character and motives,&#8221; Tourre said. &#8220;I appreciate the
opportunity to appear before the subcommittee to answer these
false charges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The line to get into today&#8217;s hearing stretched down the
corridor on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate office
building, the equivalent of half a city block. At the head of
the line were four protestors dressed in jail stripes holding
&#8220;wanted&#8221; posters for Tourre and Blankfein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Blankfein&#8217;s not doing God&#8217;s work, he&#8217;s doing the work of
the devil,&#8221; one of the protestors said, referring to a comment
Blankfein made in November while defending the banking industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre was placed on paid leave by Goldman Sachs after the
Securities and Exchange Commission filed its suit on April 16.
Joining him on the first panel of witnesses were Michael
Swenson, a managing director in the structured products group,
Joshua Birnbaum, a former managing director in the same group,
and Daniel Sparks, a former partner who ran the mortgage
department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar, Broderick &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later today, the panel will hear from David Viniar, the
firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Craig Broderick, the chief
risk officer. Blankfein, 55, will be the final witness at the
end of the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs made an estimated $3.7 billion in 2007 by
placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against mortgage-linked securities,
including some it created, Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who
leads the investigations panel, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t just make money, it profited by
taking advantage of its clients&#8217; reasonable expectation that it
would not sell products that it did not want to succeed and that
there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and
its customers,&#8221; Levin said today in his opening remarks. &#8220;Its
conduct brings into question the whole conduct of Wall Street.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, in his prepared remarks, said the firm &#8220;didn&#8217;t
have a massive short against the housing market and we certainly
did not bet against our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s Position &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre &#8220;believes that he indicated&#8221; to investors that
Paulson was interested in taking a &#8220;short&#8221; position on the
deal, meaning he was betting against it, Greg Palm, Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican Senator from Maine, said
in her opening Statement that &#8220;even legal practices can raise
ethical concerns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is something unseemly about Goldman betting against
the housing market at the same time as it is selling to its
clients mortgage backed securities containing toxic loans,&#8221;
Collins said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole building is about to collapse anytime now,&#8221;
Tourre wrote to a friend in a January 2007 e-mail, according to
the SEC complaint. &#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous
Fab... standing in the middle of all these complex, highly
leveraged, exotic trades he created without necessarily
understanding all of the implications of those
monstruosities!!!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Not Too Brilliant&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a March 7, 2007, e-mail released by the firm, Tourre
described the U.S. subprime mortgage market as &#8220;not too
brilliant&#8221; and said that &#8220;according to Sparks,&#8221; an apparent
reference to Daniel Sparks who ran Goldman Sachs&#8217;s mortgage
business at the time, &#8220;that business is totally dead, and the
poor little subprime borrowers will not last too long!!!&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John McCain, the Republican Senator from Arizona, said he
didn&#8217;t know if anything Goldman Sachs did was illegal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But from the reading of these e-mails and the information
that this committee has uncovered there&#8217;s no doubt that their
behavior was unethical,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;The American people will
render a judgment as well as the courts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
facing fraud allegations from the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, has the worst-performing actively traded corporate
bonds from a benchmark offering this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s 5.375 percent bonds due 2020 have fallen
3.9 cents on the dollar since being issued on March 1 to 95.9
cents as of 9:52 a.m. in New York, according to Trace, the bond-
price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The debt yields 2.17 percentage points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt has declined 5.18 cents since April 15, the day
before the SEC said New York-based Goldman Sachs created and
sold securities linked to subprime mortgages in 2007, as the
U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying loans and bet against
the vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives, including Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, are scheduled to appear today
before a Senate subcommittee. The SEC&#8217;s allegations &#8220;are
completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously
contest them and defend the firm and its reputation,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs said April 16 in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial company bonds yielded 1.93 percentage points more
than benchmarks as of yesterday, an increase of 0.07 percentage
point from April 15, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Financial Corporate Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global demand for dry bulk
commodities will expand 6 percent this year, compared with a
previous forecast of 3.7 percent, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank now expects iron-ore trade growth of 11.2 percent,
from an earlier estimate of 5.7 percent, and coal demand
expansion of 5.7 percent, from 3.8 percent, analysts Jonathan
Chappell and Darren Hicks in New York wrote in a note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increased trade will coincide with half the ships that
are scheduled to be built this year being delayed or cancelled,
as yards in Asia fail to deliver a record order book on time,
they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not believe that it is even physically possible for
the shipyards to meet this robust schedule, with or without
financing concerns,&#8221; they added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan increased its forecasts for what ships will earn
as a result by as much as 33 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called panamax ships, the largest to sail through the
Panama Canal, will average $21,200 a day this year, up from a
previous forecast of $16,000, JPMorgan said. Rates for
capesizes, most commonly used to haul iron ore, were revised up
3.1 percent to $33,000 a day; supramaxes were increased 22
percent to $17,100 a day, and handymaxes will make $14,700,
compared with a prior estimate of $12,000, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman

collateralized debt obligation that hedge fund Paulson  Co.
played a part in selecting the underlying assets while it also
planned to bet against the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable firm, will face off against a U.S.
Senate subcommittee today in a pivotal hearing that could have
repercussions for the future of the financial industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who leads the Senate&#8217;s
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, released documents
that he said showed the company &#8220;put its own interest and
profit ahead of the interests of its clients,&#8221; a conflict he
called on Congress to end. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
chairman and chief executive officer, will dispute that
assertion and argue the firm was merely managing its own risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing takes place as the Senate debates financial
reform legislation that could prevent banks from trading for
their own accounts and require them to separate derivatives
businesses from regulated depository subsidiaries. It also
follows a U.S. regulator&#8217;s civil-fraud lawsuit against Goldman
Sachs and an employee, Fabrice Tourre, for misleading investors
in a mortgage-linked investment, charges the firm denies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This market is not free until it is free of self-dealing
and until it is free of conflict of interest,&#8221; Levin, 75, said
at a press briefing yesterday. &#8220;It is not free until it ends
the gambling operation that results in gambling debts that the
public ends up paying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, Blankfein &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hearing, set to begin at 10 a.m. in Washington, will
start with questioning of Tourre; Michael Swenson, a managing
director in the structured-products group; Joshua Birnbaum, a
former managing director in the same group; and Daniel Sparks, a
former partner who ran the mortgage department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, the subcommittee will hear from David
Viniar, the firm&#8217;s chief financial officer, and Craig Broderick,
the chief risk officer. Blankfein, 55, will be the final
witness, facing the panel alone at the end of the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We didn&#8217;t have a massive short against the housing market
and we certainly did not bet against our clients,&#8221; Blankfein
will tell the committee, according to a prepared text of his
remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the firm contests the SEC&#8217;s complaint, &#8220;I also
recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many
people,&#8221; Blankfein said in his remarks. &#8220;We have to do a
better job of striking the balance between what an informed
client believes is important to his or her investing goals and
what the public believes is overly complex and risky.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Fall &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell 0.4 percent to $151.43 by 12:23 p.m. in
Germany, after dropping 3.4 percent to $152.03 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading yesterday, before Levin&#8217;s statements
were made public. The shares have tumbled 17 percent from their
level before the SEC filed its suit and are down 10 percent so
far this year in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday U.S. Senate Republicans blocked Democrats from
advancing their plan to overhaul Wall Street regulation as the
two sides debate provisions including consumer protections and
derivatives. Both parties are trying to tap into voter anger at
Wall Street and the bank bailouts that took place as Americans
grappled with record home foreclosures and rising unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs would probably be hardest hit among large
U.S. banks if Congress bans firms from trading for their own
account. Viniar, the CFO who&#8217;s scheduled to testify today,
estimated in January that approximately 10 percent of the
company&#8217;s revenue derives from trading that has no connection
with customer business. That would have been about $4.5 billion
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees of Goldman Sachs, which set a Wall Street pay
record in 2007 when Blankfein was awarded a $67.9 million bonus,
are among the biggest political donors in the last two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaign Contributions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nine of the 10 members of Levin&#8217;s committee have accepted
campaign finance donations from the firm&#8217;s employees, both
individually and through a political action committee, since
1989, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a
Washington-based research group. The exception is Senator Edward
Kaufman, a Democrat from Delaware, who never raised money for an
election because he was appointed to fill Vice President Joseph
Biden&#8217;s former seat and hasn&#8217;t run for a full term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arizona Republican John McCain, who ran for president in
2000 and 2008, has accepted the most of any member of the
subcommittee with $337,065, while Jon Tester, a Democrat from
Montana, has taken just $6,400, the group&#8217;s data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the spotlight is on Goldman Sachs at today&#8217;s hearing,
Levin emphasized that the firm&#8217;s actions represent practices
that he said are widespread on Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To sell to customers at the same time you&#8217;re betting
against what you&#8217;re selling -- we think it&#8217;s not uncommon and
think it ought to end,&#8221; Levin said yesterday. &#8220;We think there
are a number of banks engaged in similar conduct, but we had to
focus on one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Heavy Bets&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, whose committee first subpoenaed information from
Goldman Sachs in June, estimates that the firm made $3.7 billion
in 2007 by placing &#8220;heavy bets&#8221; against mortgage-linked
securities, including some it created. The figure doesn&#8217;t take
into account losses Goldman Sachs suffered on mortgage-related
securities it held, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We respectfully disagree with Chairman Levin&#8217;s
statement,&#8221; Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs,
said yesterday. &#8220;We did not have a big bet against the housing
market, as our performance in residential mortgages
demonstrates, and we believe we at all times worked
appropriately with our clients.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs released data on April 24 that showed the
firm reaped gains on its mortgage trading activities in 2007 and
then lost money in the same unit in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Real Bad Feeling&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the evidence Levin released yesterday was an internal
e-mail that describes how the firm&#8217;s mortgage derivatives desk
started the quarter with a $6 billion &#8220;long&#8221; position on BBB-
rated mortgages &#8220;and shifted the position to net short $10bn
notional.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An October 2007 internal e-mail sent to Sparks, who ran the
mortgage business and is among those testifying today, includes
the comment &#8220;real bad feeling across European sales about some
of the trades we did with clients. The damage this has done to
our franchise is very significant. Aggregate loss of our clients
on just these 5 trades along (sic) is 1bln+.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swenson, the managing director in the structured-products
group who is also to appear today, boasted in his 2007
performance review that &#8220;I said &#8216;no&#8217; to clients who demanded
that GS should &#8216;support the GSAMP&#8217; program as clients tried to
gain leverage over us,&#8221; he said, referring to the name for
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s own mortgage-backed deals. &#8220;Those were
unpopular decisions but they saved the firm hundreds of millions
of dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveyor Belt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a September 2007 e-mail to Blankfein, an employee
describes having met with 10 or more individual &#8220;prospects&#8221;
and clients and tells Blankfein about how their attitudes differ
from those of institutional clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The institutions don&#8217;t and I wouldn&#8217;t expect them to,
make any comments like ur (sic) good at making money for urself
(sic) but not us,&#8221; the e-mail said. &#8220;The individuals do
sometimes, but while it requires the utmost humility from us in
response I feel very strongly it binds clients even closer to
the firm, because the alternative of take ur (sic) money to a
firm who is an under performer and not the best, just isn&#8217;t
reasonable. Clients ultimately believe association with the best
is good for them in the long run.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs built a &#8220;conveyer belt&#8221; of mortgage deals
and then bet against them, Levin said, actions that he said
contributed to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conflicts of Interest &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin said his committee isn&#8217;t responsible for determining
whether any crimes occurred, although he said the panel will
decide after the hearing whether to refer the matter to the SEC
or the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC and the courts will resolve the legal question of
whether Goldman&#8217;s actions broke the law,&#8221; Levin said. &#8220;The
question for us is whether Goldman&#8217;s actions in 2007 were
appropriate and whether we should act, legislatively, to bar
similar actions in the future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Levin said he is ready to vote on a financial
regulation package in the Senate this week, he said he thinks it
could be strengthened. He has proposed an amendment that would
help resolve the conflicts of interest among Wall Street firms
that he said are embodied in the documents. He also endorsed
banning so-called naked credit-default swaps, or bets on a
decline in creditworthiness by parties that have no exposure to
the underlying loans or bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cherry-Picked&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Levin posted internal Goldman Sachs e-mails on his
Web site on April 24 that he said show the firm &#8220;made a lot of
money by betting against the mortgage market,&#8221; the firm
responded with more than 70 pages of e-mails and other documents
that it said showed the firm lost money on mortgages in 2008 and
that executives didn&#8217;t have any kind of consensus that the
market would fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs disputes the SEC&#8217;s claims that the firm
defrauded investors when selling a collateralized debt
obligation tied to mortgages by failing to inform them of the
role played by hedge fund Paulson  Co. The company said on
April 24 that Levin&#8217;s committee &#8220;cherry-picked&#8221; the evidence
it released and jumped to conclusions &#8220;even before holding a
hearing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As other banks struggled throughout the financial crisis,
Goldman Sachs posted record earnings in 2007 and then topped
that in 2009. In late 2008, following the collapse of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., the firm was allowed to convert to a
bank under the oversight of the Federal Reserve and received $10
billion of taxpayer money, which it repaid with interest about
eight months later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Ultimate Harm&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Levin said his committee hasn&#8217;t found any evidence
that Blankfein was himself aware of the firm&#8217;s positions on
specific deals, he said the documents show that Blankfein knew
the firm was shorting the market in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The ultimate harm here is not just to the clients who
were not well-served by their investment bank, the harm here is
to all of us,&#8221; Levin said yesterday. &#8220;The toxins that Goldman
Sachs and others helped inject into our financial system have
done incalculable harm to people who have never heard of a
synthetic CDO and who have no defenses against the harm that
such exotic Wall Street creations can cause.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union and the
International Monetary Fund may have to lend Greece 150 billion
euros ($201 billion) over three years to keep the nation from
the bond markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU and the IMF will need to inject more than three
times the existing $60 billion aid package to give Greece the
time to enact economic reform including reducing nominal wages
by as much as 20 percent, Erik Nielsen, chief European economist
with Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients today. Even a 75
billion-euro, 18-month lending program implies &#8220;important risks
and could lead to debt restructuring,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The IMF-EU dealing with the present liquidity issue will
be more pronounced and longer than I had originally envisaged,&#8221;
the London-based Nielsen said. &#8220;I suspect that some haggling is
now going on between the IMF and the Euro-zone on the burden
sharing of a bigger program, but I rather doubt that the
Europeans can do more than the already announced 30 billion euro
for the first year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Potash application by farmers may
stay below average this year as agricultural profitability
remains &#8220;subdued&#8221; this year and next, Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
said in a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With limited discretionary free cash flows and facing
inflationary pressures from fuel, labor and land rents, we do
not expect farmers will accept the $30 a ton price increase
proposed by producers globally in the first half of 2010,&#8221; the
bank said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. and its partners in
the Gorgon liquefied natural gas venture off northwest Australia
have awarded about A$20 billion ($19 billion) in contracts, with
Australian companies winning more than a third of the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Leighton Holdings Ltd. unit is among Australian
contractors that have gained more than A$7 billion in combined
Gorgon orders, Chevron Australia said in its Frontier magazine.
The company plans to add 700 workers in Australia by the end of
this year as the country&#8217;s importance to Chevron&#8217;s global
operations grows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian gas developments have become the &#8220;centerpiece&#8221;
of Chevron&#8217;s growth strategy as the second-largest U.S. energy
producer advances the A$43 billion Gorgon venture, Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said in the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron expects to employ more than 2,500 people in
Australia by the end of 2010, compared with 1,800 now, the
company said. Gorgon, due to start LNG exports in 2014, has
already generated almost 3,000 jobs, the company estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The construction of Gorgon on the Barrow Island nature
reserve is proceeding after San Ramon, California-based Chevron,
Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc approved the project
last year. Unions and contractors reached an agreement on
working conditions in January, Chevron said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture, Australia&#8217;s largest resources investment, will
spend A$20 billion on Australian &#8220;goods and services&#8221; over the
next five years, Chevron said. The U.S. oil and gas producer&#8217;s
Wheatstone venture, also in Western Australia, is among more
than a dozen proposed LNG projects in Australia targeting rising
Asian demand for cleaner-burning fuels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An environmental report for Chevron
Corp.&#8217;s plan to upgrade an oil refinery near San Francisco
failed to adequately specify whether heavier and more polluting
crude oil could be processed or disclose measures for mitigating
increases in greenhouse gas emissions, a California court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state appeals court in San Francisco yesterday found that
elements of the report violated requirements of California&#8217;s
environmental quality law. The Richmond City Council relied on
the report when it voted 5-4 in 2008 to issue permits for the
Chevron project in that city, according to the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project, which would replace equipment including a
40-year-old hydrogen unit, was halted after a state court judge
ruled that an environmental permit was inadequate. Groups
including Earthjustice and Communities for a Better Environment
alleged in a lawsuit that the project would increase pollution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is reviewing the ruling, said spokesman Brent
Tippen, in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We feel both the evidence and the law amply supported the
adequacy of the environmental impact report prepared by the city
of Richmond for the renewal project,&#8221; Tippen said in the
statement. &#8220;Chevron believes that the renewal project was
properly analyzed and permitted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and environmental groups halted talks on reviving
the project, Chevron said in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Communities for a Better Environment v. City of
Richmond, A125618, Court of Appeal (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which for
years saw no need to play a traditional Washington lobbying
game, is deploying former lawmakers and crisis specialists as it
tries to tamp down the political firestorm threatening its well-
honed brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s 12-person government affairs office in
Washington is aiding what one person involved called a franchise
protection strategy in the wake of a Securities and Exchange
Commission fraud suit against the firm this month. Advisers
include an ex-House Democratic Leader, a chief of staff to
President Ronald Reagan, President Bill Clinton&#8217;s SEC chairman
and President Barack Obama&#8217;s first White House counsel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first test of the campaign comes today as Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and six other current or
former Goldman Sachs employees testify before a Senate panel
investigating the company&#8217;s role in fueling the subprime loan
crisis. The grilling is a turnabout for the firm, which has seen
its former partners become Treasury secretaries, top
presidential aides and even senators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman relied on their top-level connections so they
wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about the public relations and the crisis
lobbying,&#8221; said Mark Corallo, a former Justice Department
spokesman who now provides communications advice to companies.
&#8220;Seemingly they haven&#8217;t learned the lesson of politics: In a
crisis, it&#8217;s every man for himself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dubai International Capital LLC got
a boost in its efforts to keep its Almatis alumina-making unit,
with backing for a $685 million debt refinancing that would
repay senior lenders including Oaktree Capital Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai International is challenging a plan by Oaktree, the
biggest of Almatis&#8217;s senior lenders, to seize control of Almatis
after the German unit violated loan terms last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Merrill Lynch are
preparing final term sheets and underwritten commitments for
$350 million of senior secured notes and a $50 million revolving
credit, Dubai International said in a letter yesterday to the
company&#8217;s senior lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Blackstone Group LP&#8217;s unit GSO Capital
Partners LP has agreed to arrange $185 million of senior
subordinated securities and plans to manage the sale of another
$100 million of senior secured debt for Frankfurt-based Almatis,
the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai International, an investment fund owned by Dubai&#8217;s
ruler, is urging Almatis&#8217;s senior lenders to vote against the
restructuring plan proposed by Los Angeles-based Oaktree. The
United Arab Emirates-based fund is seeking to retain its
controlling stake in Almatis by repaying all $675 million in
senior loans, while giving equity to junior lenders in return
for canceling their debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The refinancing proposal seeks a consensual outside-of-
bankruptcy deal that avoids a lengthy and expensive contested
Chapter 11 process,&#8221; Dubai International Chief Executive
Officer Anand Krishnan wrote in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Infusion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dubai International said it also plans to inject $100
million of capital into Almatis as part of the refinancing
proposal, according to the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almatis breached its debt covenants last year as the global
economic slowdown hurt demand for its products. Oaktree, the
biggest senior lender, rallied support in July for a takeover
after the debt breach. Lenders to a company that violates loan
conditions can demand immediate repayment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-thirds of senior lenders to Almatis in March have
already voted in favor of Oaktree&#8217;s proposal to take over the
company in exchange for writing down more than half its debt.
Oaktree&#8217;s plan would cut Almatis&#8217;s debt to about $420 million
and give it protection from other creditors under Chapter 11 of
the U.S. bankruptcy code. A Dutch court earlier this month ruled
against Dubai&#8217;s petition to prevent Oaktree from seizing Almatis

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. will stop
financing tax-refund loans for about 13,000 independent U.S.
preparers, according to a person at the bank briefed on the
matter, a move that may drive customers toward HR Block Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank decided tax-refund loans don&#8217;t fit the New York-
based company&#8217;s strategic plans, said the person, who declined
to be identified because the decision hasn&#8217;t been announced.
American Banker, the industry trade journal, reported the halt
earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Block is the biggest winner in this,&#8221; said John Hewitt,
chief executive officer of Liberty Tax Service, a privately held
company in Virginia Beach, Virginia, that also may benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refund-anticipation loans, or RALs, are used to attract
clients who need cash immediately by offering short-term loans
based on the expected amount of their tax refunds. Consumer
groups fault RALs for putting people deeper in debt, with interest rates on some versions that exceed 100 percent on an
annualized basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. lender after Bank of
America Corp., joins banks that have stopped offering refund-
anticipation loans or plan to do so, including London-based HSBC
Holdings Plc and Santa Barbara Bank  Trust. The decision may
give Kansas City, Missouri-based HR Block an advantage through
2013, when its contract with HSBC expires. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street employers, long
concerned that their staff&#8217;s e-mails may be used against them,
now have another thing to worry about: the self-evaluations
employees fill out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a 10-hour congressional hearing yesterday, senators
pointed to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. employees&#8217; self-evaluations,
which included boasts about making &#8220;extraordinary profits&#8221; by
betting against the subprime market, as proof the company misled
investors into a mortgage-linked investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that self-evaluations were used against Goldman
employees could keep companies from being open in their own
review process, hampering feedback that makes evaluations
productive, said Gary Hayes, co-founder of management consulting
firm Hayes Brunswick  Partners in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s fairly chilling,&#8221; Hayes said. &#8220;It would make
many senior executives very cautious, if not guarded in what
they say in evaluations. You&#8217;ll hinder the kind of dialogue
that&#8217;s necessary.&#8221; Such evaluations are &#8220;a standard part of
corporate America,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senators used e-mails and self-evaluations produced by
Goldman, which is being sued by the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, to attack the firm. Goldman denies the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his 2007 self-evaluation, Michael Swenson, a managing
director in the structured-products group, said he earned the
firm &#8220;extraordinary profits&#8221; after he recognized the subprime
mortgage market was going to crumble and &#8220;aggressively
capitalized&#8221; on betting against it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iranian President Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad has applied for a U.S. visa to attend a nuclear
conference at the United Nations that begins next week, the U.S.
ambassador said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice told reporters at the UN about
the Iranian request to come to the review conference in New York
for the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is scheduled to
begin on May 3 and last until May 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials indicated they wouldn&#8217;t bar Ahmadinejad from
attending. &#8220;We have certain responsibilities as the host of the
UN,&#8221; State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said. &#8220;Any
foreign official who&#8217;s coming to the UN for business is normally
granted a visa.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmadinejad was last in the U.S. for the UN General
Assembly in September, when he denied any Iranian intent to
develop nuclear weapons, criticized U.S.-led military action in
Iraq and Afghanistan and drew attention to what he saw as U.S.
complicity in the international financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bak Sahraei, spokesman for Iran&#8217;s mission to the UN, said
he couldn&#8217;t confirm Rice&#8217;s statement or say anything about
Ahmadinejad&#8217;s travel plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Meeting Planned &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crowley said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has no
plans to have bilateral meetings with Iran during the two-day
conference. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro is touting the agency&#8217;s fraud
lawsuit against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as she seeks more
funding from Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schapiro, in testimony prepared for a Senate appropriations
subcommittee today, said the SEC&#8217;s enforcement activity has
&#8220;increased significantly&#8221; during her 15 months as chairman.
She cited the Goldman Sachs case, in which the agency this month
accused the Wall Street firm of misleading clients, as an
example of &#8220;the importance of the actions we brought.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Swift and vigorous prosecution of those who have broken
the law is at the heart of the agency&#8217;s efforts to restore
investor confidence,&#8221; Schapiro said. &#8220;In recent years, the
SEC&#8217;s enforcement program had suffered under a variety of
procedural, structural and budgetary constraints.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama proposed $1.26 billion in spending
for the SEC in the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, a 12 percent
increase over its current budget. Democratic lawmakers and SEC
officials have said stagnant budgets during President George W.
Bush&#8217;s second term caused the agency to lose employees, making
it difficult to keep pace with Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schapiro, 54, became SEC chairman in January 2009. She has
tried to restore the agency&#8217;s reputation after it drew criticism
from investors for its oversight of investment banks that
collapsed amid the financial crisis and for failing to detect
Bernard Madoff&#8217;s $65 billion Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., Petroleo
Brasileiro SA and other oil producers offered Argentine workers
an 18 percent raise in a bid to avert a nationwide strike that
could lead to fuel shortages, an industry group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Oil Industry Chamber, which also represents Royal Dutch
Shell Plc in salary negotiations with unions, will discuss the
offer in government-brokered talks with union officials
tomorrow, Executive Director Enrique Pourteau said in a
telephone interview today. The Argentine Federation of Oil, Gas
and Biofuel Workers called a strike for April 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petrobras, Exxon, Shell, Destileria Argentina de Petroleo
SA and Rutilex Hidrocarburos Argentinos SA refine about 50
percent of the country&#8217;s fuel in the seven cities where the
federation plans the stoppage. A fuel shortage in Argentina
would come at a time when neighboring Chile is boosting imports
from Asia to cover domestic demand after a Feb. 27 earthquake
devastated the country&#8217;s biggest refinery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union hasn&#8217;t named the units that will be affected by
the Argentine strike. Eight refineries in the seven cities have
a combined capacity to process 330,800 barrels of oil a day, or
about 50 percent of Argentina&#8217;s total refining capacity,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repsol YPF SA&#8217;s Argentine unit said in an e-mail to
Bloomberg News that its three refineries in the country won&#8217;t be
affected by a strike because its workers belong to a different
union. The units have a combined capacity to process 320,000
barrels per day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
Chairman Philip Hampton said it would be &#8220;premature&#8221; for the
bank to take legal action against Goldman Sachs Group Inc. over
collateralized debt obligations called Abacus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS is reviewing the Securities  Exchange Commission&#8217;s
case, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The legal advice is it&#8217;s premature for that action,&#8221;
Hampton told reporters before the bank&#8217;s annual general meeting
in Edinburgh today. &#8220;We will review the process of the SEC and
make a decision later.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on April 19 that legal
action against Goldman Sachs was possible. Three days earlier
the SEC filed a suit against the New York-based bank, citing
fraud and misrepresentation in the marketing of a collateralized
debt obligation called Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS unwound a position in Abacus bought by its ABN Amro
unit by paying Goldman $840.9 million, the SEC said. Germany&#8217;s
IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG lost nearly all of its $150
million investment in Abacus, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were aware that the SEC was investigating that
trade,&#8221; Hampton told investors later. &#8220;But the announcement
came out of the blue, as I think it did to Goldman too. It&#8217;s a
complicated case. The allegations are being vigorously
defended.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co.,
the world&#8217;s second-largest bottler of Coke beverages, has
surpassed National Bank of Greece SA to become the nation&#8217;s
biggest company by market value after the Greek debt crisis
caused banking stocks to plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Hellenic, which is 24 percent owned by the Coca-
Cola Co., has a value of more than 7 billion euros ($9.3
billion), the only such company on the Athens exchange, after
National Bank plunged more than 41 percent this year on concern
over the country&#8217;s debt. Shares in the bottler gained 0.5
percent to 19.80 euros today, for a value of 7.2 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Bank, the country&#8217;s oldest and biggest bank,
rebounded today for the first time since April 15 after the
country&#8217;s securities regulator banned short selling on the
bourse for two months. The lender gained 8.5 percent to 10.85
euros, valuing the business at 6.5 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Athens-based CCHBC bottles Coca-Cola drinks, teas, water
and juices in 27 European countries, including Russia, and
Nigeria, and its geographical expansion has helped buffer the
company from the effects of the Greek economic crisis. The

earlier, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executives
endured more than 10 hours of congressional grilling in one of
the most public, and most hostile, political lashings in the
firm&#8217;s 141-year history. By day&#8217;s end, the investment bank&#8217;s
market value had risen by $549 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin and members of his Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations said evidence they presented made
the case for Congress to pass legislation tightening financial
regulation. Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable
securities firm, was alone among 79 stocks of the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Financial Index in posting a gain yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both sides got what they wanted,&#8221; said Robert Hillman, a
securities law professor at the University of California, Davis.
&#8220;The Senate probably did what it felt it had to do, which was
bring Goldman people up and embarrass them. For Goldman, the
goal was to demonstrate that they had not engaged in fraud or
illegal conduct. They probably succeeded in that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The senators, capping a probe of Goldman Sachs that has
lasted more than a year, peppered Chief Executive Officer Lloyd
Blankfein and six current and former executives with questions
about their duty to clients and the ethics of betting against
the housing market as the bank sold mortgage-linked securities
to customers. The hearing came 12 days after the Securities and
Exchange Commission sued the New York-based firm for fraud,
saying the bank misled investors in a mortgage-linked investment
known as Abacus, claims the company denies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Jarring&#8217; Realities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The cultural realities of what you all do is jarring to
most Americans,&#8221; Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from
Missouri and former prosecutor, told Blankfein during the
hearing. &#8220;This notion of selling a product that you&#8217;re betting
against is hard for people to understand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who repeatedly insisted the company had done
nothing wrong, said after the hearing that he had &#8220;no
illusions&#8221; about how hard Wall Street must work to win back the
trust of the American people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Wall Street has a lot of work to do to regain the
confidence of Main Street,&#8221; Blankfein told Bloomberg
Television. &#8220;We have a lot to improve in our communication with
Main Street and we&#8217;re committed to do it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a voicemail to employees last night, Blankfein called
the questioning &#8220;rigorous,&#8221; and said he tried to convey the
&#8220;seriousness with which we adhere to the rules and regulations
that govern our business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Continued External Focus&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Let me remind you that we should anticipate continued
external focus on Goldman Sachs for the foreseeable future,&#8221;
Blankfein said in the message. &#8220;Please do not let this distract
you from your daily responsibilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some senators used the hearing to advertise their position
on a financial regulatory bill that&#8217;s been blocked by
Republicans so far this week. Levin concluded the hearing by
calling for tougher regulation than the bill contains, while
Republicans including Tom Coburn said they felt the measure
fails to address issues such as how to handle companies that are
&#8220;too big to fail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the day began, a line to enter the hearing stretched
down the corridor on the first floor of the Dirksen Senate
office building, the equivalent of half a city block. At the
head of the queue were four protesters dressed in black-and-
white convict stripes and holding &#8220;wanted&#8221; posters for
Blankfein and Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old Frenchman who was
the only Goldman Sachs employee named in the SEC suit.
Television crews from Russia and Japan were among journalists
who filled the packed room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Huge Shorts&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disagreements between the senators and the executives
started with how much money the bank earned. Levin said Goldman
Sachs made $3.7 billion in 2007 by placing &#8220;huge shorts&#8221;
against mortgage-linked securities. Taking into account losses
on securities it held, the firm&#8217;s residential mortgage
securities had net revenue of less than $500 million, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of
that deal after your people knew it was a shitty deal?&#8221; Levin
asked Daniel Sparks, who ran the bank&#8217;s mortgage unit at the
time. &#8220;Does that bother you at all?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin was referring to a June 2007 e-mail from Thomas
Montag, the former head of sales and trading in the Americas at
Goldman Sachs, to Sparks. The message described a set of
mortgage-linked investments that his bank had been trying to
sell as part of &#8220;one shitty deal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;I Don&#8217;t Recall&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal
after that,&#8221; Sparks replied, adding that he believed the e-mail
referred to his performance, not the security itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you can&#8217;t give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks,
I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to get too many clear answers from
you,&#8221; Levin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, responding to questions from Levin, said the
nature of the principal business often puts the firm on the
opposite side of customers and market-makers have no obligation
to tell clients about their own position in a security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;The thing we are selling to
them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not
coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably, the
institutional clients we have, wouldn&#8217;t care what our views are.
They shouldn&#8217;t care.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin, a Michigan Democrat, told Blankfein he&#8217;s
&#8220;troubled&#8221; by his view that the company doesn&#8217;t seem to
understand conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Troubles Me&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You can make sure that someone you sell an investment to
knows that you believe it&#8217;s a bad investment,&#8221; Levin said.
&#8220;You obviously don&#8217;t see that. It troubles me that you don&#8217;t
see that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin added, &#8220;It troubles me that you don&#8217;t see that your
client is yourself. Goldman Sachs has turned itself into its own
client.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. claims Goldman Sachs misled investors by failing
to disclose that hedge fund Paulson  Co., which was betting
against the U.S. mortgage market, helped the Abacus CDO manager
select securities to include in the portfolio. Goldman Sachs has
called the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit &#8220;completely unfounded.&#8221; Paulson
wasn&#8217;t accused of any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, wearing a charcoal-gray suit, white shirt and red-
and-navy striped tie, testified that he &#8220;categorically&#8221; denied
the allegations. &#8220;I will defend myself in court against this
false claim,&#8221; Tourre told the standing-room-only hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conveying Risks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The securities weren&#8217;t meant to fail; they succeeded by
conveying the risks that people wanted,&#8221; Blankfein told Senator
Jon Tester about the Abacus deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re speaking a different language
here,&#8221; replied Tester, a Democrat from Montana who was a farmer
before he entered politics. Tester said &#8220;it seemed to me more
than just a little bit odd&#8221; that Paulson helped pick securities
even as he was betting against a CDO that later collapsed in
value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The politicians expressed frustration over a lack of direct
answers during the first panel, which lasted more than five
hours and featured testimony from Tourre; Sparks; Michael
Swenson, a managing director in the structured-products group;
and Joshua Birnbaum, a former managing director in the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin and Viniar, the chief financial officer, agreed on at
least one thing during his testimony: Investment bankers
shouldn&#8217;t call the securities they sell &#8220;crap.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Unfortunate&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate to have on e-mail,&#8221;
Viniar said, drawing laughter from the audience and the press,
after Levin asked how he felt when he read e-mails in which
Goldman Sachs employees described mortgage-linked securities as
&#8220;crap&#8221; or &#8220;shitty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Please don&#8217;t take that the wrong way,&#8221; Viniar said when
pressed by Levin. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s very unfortunate for anyone
to have said that in any form.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levin then asked, &#8220;How about to believe that and sell
it?&#8221; and Viniar agreed that was also unfortunate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s what you should have started with,&#8221; Levin
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Senate
grilling may be the start of a series of inquiries into banks in
the wake of the global crisis, said Pippa Malmgren, George W.
Bush&#8217;s former chief financial-markets adviser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Various U.S. investigators, from the Justice Department
to the FBI to the Federal Reserve, bank examiners, have been
crawling all over these institutions, not just Goldman but
others, for now two years,&#8221; she said in an interview today with
Bloomberg Television from Singapore. &#8220;My guess is that we&#8217;re at
the beginning of a process of uncovering all these sorts of
stories. It&#8217;s not the end of it, it&#8217;s the beginning of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executives of Goldman, the world&#8217;s most profitable
securities firm, were questioned in Congress yesterday 12 days
after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm for
fraud, saying it misled investors in a mortgage-linked
investment. Malmgren said the point of the inquiry is to
convince investors that it&#8217;s safe to put money into markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a phase of the cycle that is about showing the
public that the so-called bad guys, bad practices are being
removed from the system so it becomes safe to come back and
invest in the markets again,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I suspect that the
actual legal case against Goldman Sachs is pretty weak. If what
they were doing was selling something to someone knowing that
somebody else valued it higher, that&#8217;s called a market, so this
is not such a dramatic issue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dodd Bill &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. politicians are also under pressure to attract voters
before mid-term elections in November, said Malmgren, who is now
president of London-based Canonbury Group. This means that
legislation to address the causes of the crisis or avert a new
one, such as a banking bill written by Senate Banking Committee
Chairman Christopher Dodd, probably won&#8217;t work, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s highly unlikely that what the Dodd bill contains is
going to prevent these kinds of crises in future or redress
what&#8217;s happened in the past,&#8221; Malmgren said. &#8220;What&#8217;s important
is to be seen to be doing something about the incredible losses
that have been incurred by the American public and frankly the
global public as well. If it serves that purpose, there are
votes in it, that&#8217;s the important thing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malmgren was an adviser to President Bush before his
election in 2000, and then served on the National Economic
Council as special assistant to the president for economic
policy, responsible for all financial-market issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong police arrested two more
men in relation to the accidental discovery of a record 372 
kilograms (820 pounds) of cocaine earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arrests bring to 10 the number of people detained after
officers investigating a missing person report stumbled across
the drugs, estimated by police to be worth up to HK$337 million
($43.4 million), on the rooftop of a village house close to the
border with mainland China. Two men and two women have been
charged with drug-trafficking offences, a police statement said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chang Ma-ki, a Dutch passport holder, was reported missing
on April 23 after telling his wife to contact police if he
didn&#8217;t return from a meeting in relation to the drugs, the South
China Morning Post reported, citing an unidentified police
officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missing man arrived in the city on April 15 to &#8220;hold
negotiations with local dealers because the drugs were
mistakenly shipped to Hong Kong,&#8221; the newspaper quoted the
police officer as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No conclusions have been drawn about the destination of the
drugs, Ambrose Lee, the secretary for security, said last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no evidence to indicate whether the seized
cocaine is for local consumption or for onward trans-shipment to
other places,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to jump to a
conclusion at this point in time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s role as a major trans-shipment point for drug
smugglers has diminished in recent years as better law
enforcement and alternative routes through mainland China made
it less attractive, according to a U.S. State Department report.
Most drugs seized in the city are for local consumption, the
March 10 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Drug-trafficking groups operating in Hong Kong are
primarily transnational in nature,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;Some
drug traffickers continue to use Hong Kong as their financial
base of operations, including investors involved in
international drug-trafficking activity who reside in Hong
Kong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. plans to build ties with
Muslim-majority countries and help improve conditions within
them through new programs linking American companies with
entrepreneurs around the world, Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new programs include mentoring backed by New York-based
Ernst  Young LLP and Intel Corp. of Santa Clara, California, a
global entrepreneurship program, a Silicon Valley effort to fund
start-up companies, and a collaboration with Atlanta-based Coca-
Cola Co. to get businesses involved in these State Department
programs, Clinton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Relationships between nations are sustained by the
connections between their peoples,&#8221; Clinton told a gathering of
the entrepreneurs in Washington. &#8220;You have the power not only
to drive economic growth, but promote shared prosperity, call
for open and accountable governance, help expand access to
services like health care and education.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinton announced the new programs at a two-day conference
meant to jump-start the &#8220;new beginning&#8221; between the U.S. and
Muslim nations that President Barack Obama called for in a
speech last year in Egypt. The conference drew more than 250
participants from over 50 countries, including Algeria,
Kazakhstan, Bangladesh and Cameroon, the administration said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This summit reflects the new approach to foreign policy
that President Obama described last year at Cairo University,&#8221;
Clinton said. &#8220;One that we have been putting into practice
through partnerships based on shared values, mutual respect and
mutual responsibility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Ties &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of business ties and assistance reflects an
administration effort to make various kinds of development
assistance a pillar of U.S. foreign policy, alongside military
involvement and diplomacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a January speech, Clinton said that a safer, more
prosperous, democratic and equitable world remains out of reach
as long as one-third of the world&#8217;s people live in poverty.
Yesterday, she announced four new programs designed to help
aspiring small business owners in the Muslim world prosper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Global Entrepreneurship Program will provide &#8220;concrete
support&#8221; to entrepreneurs in Muslim-majority countries,
eventually expanding worldwide. The program will sponsor
business plan competitions, help with access to credit and
facilitate exchanges between U.S. business schools and those in
other countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The program will be in a dozen countries in the next two
years, Clinton said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silicon Valley &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a second initiative, the State Department will work with
Global Technology and Innovation Partners and the Innovators
Fund, Silicon Valley groups started by U.S. venture capital
investors and business leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will support innovation and entrepreneurship in
predominantly Muslim countries with seed funding, venture
capital and expertise. The program will begin in Egypt, Jordan,
Lebanon, Turkey and Malaysia and expand from there, Clinton
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A third program called e-Mentor Corps would expand
mentoring opportunities and draw on expertise at Intel, Ernst 
Young and the Young Presidents&#8217; Organization in Irving, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final project is intended to involve U.S. companies,
universities, and foundations in the administration&#8217;s outreach
efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department will work with Partners for a New
Beginning, a non-profit led by former Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright that will spearhead the effort to get private
business involved in State Department programs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola CEO &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partners for a New Beginning, co-chaired by Coca-Cola Chief
Executive Officer Muhtar Kent, will reach out to U.S. companies,
universities, laboratories, research centers, non-profit
organizations, philanthropists and others. They will be asked to
invest in and guide entrepreneurs in Muslim-majority countries
and contribute equipment or technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Global corporations have an important role to play in
small business development and in helping to create sustainable
communities where they operate,&#8221; Kent said in a statement read
by Coca-Cola executive Barclay Resler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has been present in countries such as Malaysia
since 1936 and in Pakistan since 1953, according to Kent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest company, posted a smaller gain in first-quarter profit
than analysts estimated as health-care legislation increased
costs and U.S. refineries operated at a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income rose 38 percent to $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a
share, from $4.55 billion, or 92 cents, a year earlier, Irving,
Texas-based Exxon said today in a statement. Per-share profit
was 8 cents below the average of 16 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon recorded a $200 million charge to reflect an increase
in health-care costs driven by legislation that President Barack
Obama signed into law last month. The company&#8217;s U.S. refineries
lost more than $600,000 a day as gains in gasoline and diesel
prices failed to keep pace with crude-oil costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The costs of health-care legislation are a hit every
company is going to take in one shape or another,&#8221; said Gianna
Bern, president of Brookshire Advisory  Research in Flossmoor,
Illinois. &#8220;In refining, they&#8217;re taking it on the chin because
crude is so expensive and demand for fuel is lackluster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon fell 53 cents to $68.66 as of the 4 p.m. close of New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has 10 buy
ratings from analysts, 10 holds and 1 sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profit increase was Exxon&#8217;s first since the 2008 third
quarter. The company benefited from a jump in oil prices and its
biggest gain in first-quarter crude and natural-gas production
since 2000. Revenue climbed 41 percent to $90.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash Stockpile Grows &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company spent $2 billion on share buybacks during the
first three months of the year and intends to maintain that pace
of purchases during the current quarter, according to the
statement. Exxon&#8217;s cash and cash equivalents rose by $3 billion
during the January-to-March period, to $13.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from oil and gas sales climbed 66 percent to $5.81
billion. Exxon was paid an average of $74.21 per barrel of crude
sold outside the U.S., a 77 percent increase from a year
earlier, according to data on the company&#8217;s Web site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon increased production 4.5 percent to the equivalent of
4.36 million barrels of crude a day, led by higher gas output in
the U.S., Europe, Asia and the Middle East. Gas from Exxon&#8217;s
U.S. wells sold for $5.32 per thousand cubic feet, a 15 percent
increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global oil demand increased enough to fill 83 supertankers
after economies around the world emerged from recession,
according to the International Energy Agency in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining Margins Narrow &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s worldwide refining profit tumbled 97 percent to $37
million as margins from processing crude into fuels such as
gasoline and jet fuel in the U.S. evaporated. Chemicals earnings
more than tripled to $1.25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson plans $28 billion in
capital spending this year to boost production with new wells
from California to the Middle East and to upgrade refineries.
Exxon also agreed in December to buy XTO Energy Inc., the
largest U.S. gas producer, for more than $29 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon plans to close the purchase of Fort Worth, Texas-
based XTO by the end of June. The acquisition, Exxon&#8217;s largest
since it bought the former Mobil Corp. in 1999, will give the
company access to XTO&#8217;s gas reserves and its expertise in
tapping rock formations impervious to conventional drilling
techniques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Europe&#8217;s largest oil company,
yesterday said its net income climbed 57 percent to $5.48
billion. BP Plc of London said April 27 that its first-quarter
profit more than doubled to $6.08 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings also more than doubled at ConocoPhillips and
Occidental Petroleum Corp., the third- and fourth-largest U.S.
oil companies by market value, which released their reports
today. Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. energy company, is
scheduled to report earnings tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options traders are boosting bets
that shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most-profitable
Wall Street firm, will rebound from losses spurred by the
Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors used a butterfly strategy yesterday, spending an
average of $1.56 per trade on contracts expiring in June,
according to a report from Interactive Brokers Group Inc. The
maximum profit of $8.44 per spread is earned should Goldman
Sachs close at $175 on June 18, the brokerage said. The shares
have sunk to $160.24 from $184.27 on April 15, the day before
the SEC announced its lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The transaction is a very efficient way to act on bullish
sentiment because maximum loss potential -- $1.56 per contract
in this case -- is scant when compared to potential profits
which are 5.4 times greater,&#8221; Caitlin Duffy of Greenwich,
Connecticut-based Interactive Brokers wrote in a note yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs fell the most since January 2009 on April 16
after the SEC said the bank misled investors in a mortgage-
linked investment. On April 27, executives endured more than 10
hours of congressional grilling in one of the most public, and
most hostile, political lashings in the firm&#8217;s 141-year history.
By day&#8217;s end, the investment bank&#8217;s market value had risen by
$549 million, and it posted the only gain among 79 financial
institutions in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;June Contracts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create the butterfly yesterday, investors bought about
8,000 June $165 calls and 8,000 June $185 calls, while selling
16,000 June $175 calls. More than 108,000 Goldman Sachs calls
traded yesterday, 30 percent above than the four-week average,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interactive Brokers said that traders also used a bullish
butterfly strategy on Goldman Sachs on April 26 and April 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A butterfly spread strategy combines three options with the
same expiration date and different strike prices, with half of
the contracts bought or sold at the middle strike price and the
rest divided among the top and bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, an investor made a bullish bet by selling almost
10,000 calls at the May $170 strike while buying June $165 calls
and selling June $175 calls, Duffy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares rose 2.1 percent today, rallying for
the third straight day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are among U.S. investment banks that may be
forced to raise an additional $250 billion in capital, cut
executive pay and divest some of their most lucrative assets
under a bill on the U.S. Senate floor today, analysts say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-page provision tucked inside the 1,558-page bill on
April 21 would change the structure of about 40 of the largest
U.S. investment banks by forcing them to spin off their
derivatives businesses. Another measure added this month would
require derivatives dealers to maintain a &#8220;fiduciary duty&#8221; to
municipal, pension and retirement plan investors, which some
analysts say would wipe out that market altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bill has moved so far left so hard, that it&#8217;s caught
everybody by surprise,&#8221; said FBR Capital Markets analyst Paul
Miller, a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia. He said the bill was a &#8220;big, big hot button issue
with voters.&#8221; &#8220;The Street now is just realizing that all of
this stuff is getting in the bill.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin-off provision would result in a capital deficit of
$85 billion at eight of the largest global investment banks,
analysts led by Kian Abouhossein at JPMorgan Securities in
London estimated in a research note today. It prohibits swaps
dealers from taking any federal assistance, including access to
the Federal Reserve discount window or deposit insurance from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinning out Derivatives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, the measure would require banks to spin out
their derivatives business into a separately capitalized
affiliate, analysts say. It was actually designed to force about
40 of the largest U.S. swaps dealers that also have federally
insured banks to divest all swaps activities, said Courtney
Rowe, a spokeswoman for bill sponsor Senator Blanche Lincoln,
who sponsored the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This would be a sweeping change to our financial system
and it was introduced 11 days ago without a hearing, without a
study on its impact,&#8221; said Luke Zubrod of Pennsylvania-based
Chatham Financial Corp., which advises more than 1,000 firms on
derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If passed, analysts say the provision would drive business
to foreign broker dealers that don&#8217;t take deposits in the U.S.,
such as Societe Generale, France&#8217;s No. 2 bank by market value.
The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, which
represents Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and other large
derivatives dealers, estimates the provision would require as
much as $250 billion in new capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that the proposed regulatory
changes would have a significant impact on global return on
equities, declining from 19 percent pre-regulation to 12
percent,&#8221; Abouhossein wrote. &#8220;Given the political pressure in
various geographies, we believe investment bank compensation
reduction would be a key driver&#8221; to boost profitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Banks Should Be Banks&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lincoln, an Arkansas Democrat, said she may not have the
votes to pass the measure, and several other amendments are
pending in the Senate that would potentially separate certain
investment-banking activities from the traditional business of
taking deposits and lending money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks should be banks,&#8221; Rowe said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve heard from
Arkansans, especially our community banks in Arkansas, that they
need a level playing field.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say they fear that anger over Wall Street may
drive support for more burdensome amendments, like reinstating
Glass-Steagall-like regulations that separated investment and
commercial banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There really is a new kind of political model at work
here,&#8221; said Brian Gardner, an analyst for KBW Inc. in
Washington and a former staff director for Louisiana
Representative Richard Baker, who was chair of the House
Financial Services committee sub-committee before he left
Congress in 2008. &#8220;The dissatisfaction with Wall Street and
then the Goldman news has just changed the political dynamic.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legg Mason Inc.&#8217;s Bill Miller said
he is sticking with his bets on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. because
the fallout from the fraud accusations against the bank will
probably be limited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any evidence that they would lose
enough business that you would notice it,&#8221; Miller, chairman and
chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management, a
stock-fund unit of Baltimore-based Legg Mason, said in a phone
interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s much more of a political problem and a
reputational problem that I believe will pass.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller, who held a total of 1.5 million Goldman Sachs
shares through his funds as of Dec. 31, said he hasn&#8217;t sold any
since the investment bank was sued by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission for misleading clients on the sale of
mortgage-related securities. He joins investors such as Warren
Buffett in expressing confidence that the most profitable Wall
Street firm will rebound from stock-market losses spurred by the
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell the most since January 2009 after
the charges were made public on April 16. Executives this week
endured more than 10 hours of grilling by a Senate subcommittee,
centering on the ethics of selling clients products that the
firm was betting against. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman did not cover themselves in glory answering the
questions,&#8221; Miller said. If the SEC suit succeeds, it would
have an impact on Goldman Sachs, although it&#8217;s not &#8220;going to
put them out of business,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Rebound &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs rose for a third day, gaining $2.61, or 1.7
percent, to $159.62 by 12:06 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading. The shares dropped 13 percent on April 16 and
are down 5.5 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller had 26 percent of his $4.6 billion Legg Mason
Capital Management Value Trust fund in financial stocks as of
Dec. 31, including 718,300 shares of Goldman Sachs, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Banks overall are attractive
investments based on their valuations, which on average are in
the bottom 10 percent of their historical price-to-book range,
Miller said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big banks will benefit from reduced competition following
the financial crisis, Miller said. Tighter regulation of the
financial industry, as contained in a bill sought by President
Barack Obama, probably won&#8217;t damage the industry in the long
run, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do have concerns about short-term proposals that are
punitive,&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;The broad outlines of the bill, I
think the industry could live with.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s Bet &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller, known for beating the SP 500 Index a record 15
straight years through 2005, trailed the U.S. market benchmark
for the next three years. His Value Trust fund fell 55 percent
in 2008, while his Opportunity Trust fund dropped 65 percent.
Both rebounded last year after Miller&#8217;s bet on an improving
economy paid off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s $2 billion Opportunity Trust fund soared 83
percent in 2009, while his Value Trust climbed 41 percent,
beating the 26 percent gain in the SP 500. This year, the Value
Trust fund has gained 6.9 percent, compared with the 7.5 percent
gain by the SP 500. The Opportunity Trust fund is up 19
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co., the world&#8217;s
largest consumer products company, gave a fourth-quarter profit
forecast that trailed analysts&#8217; estimates and said annual sales
may be lower than it anticipated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings will be 68 cents to 74 cents a share in the
quarter ending in June, the company said today in a statement.
Analysts predicted 76 cents, the average of 13 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales will rise as much as 5 percent this
year, compared with a January forecast of as much as 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG sold more products in developing markets at lower
prices, reducing net sales last quarter. In India, Cincinnati-
based PG cut prices on diapers and started selling low-cost
versions of Gillette razors and Tide, according to Ali Dibadj,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It feels like every lever they&#8217;re pulling isn&#8217;t really
working,&#8221; Dibadj, who rates the stock &#8220;market perform,&#8221; said
in a telephone interview. &#8220;Sales in emerging markets were a
factor but there are also a lot of people trading down. How does
PG get out of that cycle? This is the quarter they should have
done really, really well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG fell $1.69, or 2.7 percent, to $61.48 at 11:12 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, after declining 3.7
percent for the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 6. Before
today, the shares have advanced 4.2 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India, China &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG, which made about a third of its 2009 revenue in
developing markets, said in January that earnings for the last
two quarters of the fiscal year would be lower than a year
earlier because it was investing in new products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter profit fell to $2.59 billion, or 83 cents a
share, from $2.61 billion, or 84 cents, a year earlier. Analysts
predicted 82 cents on average. Sales rose 7.4 percent to $19.2
billion, the second straight gain after four quarterly declines.
Analysts predicted $19.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gross margin -- the fraction of sales left after deducting
the costs of goods sold -- widened to 51.9 percent from 49
percent, helped by lower commodity costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is to build market share profitably,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Bob McDonald said on a conference call.
&#8220;By our standards, this is a good quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said he expects
commodity expenses to rise this quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Products in emerging markets generally sell for less than
in developed markets, which narrows the gross margin there,
Moeller said on the conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unilever Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unilever, the world&#8217;s second-largest food and detergent
company, said today that first-quarter profit rose 33 percent as
lower prices spurred demand for Dove soap and Lipton tea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In India and other markets, such as Turkey, Indonesia,
China, it&#8217;s clear that competition has figured out that these
markets are very attractive,&#8221; Unilever Chief Financial Officer
Jean-Marc Huet told journalists. &#8220;You do see a lot of
competition and as a result a lot of pricing intensity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colgate-Palmolive Co. also reported earnings today. First-
quarter net income dropped to $357 million, or 69 cents a share,
from $508 million, or 97 cents, a year earlier, the New York-
based company said. Sales rose to $3.83 billion from $3.5
billion. Analysts predicted $3.89 billion, the average of 15
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, has a larger exposure than any of
its peers to Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain,
according to Wells Fargo  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s exposure to the five so-called PIIGS countries
is $36.3 billion, equating to 28 percent of the firm&#8217;s Tier-1
capital, a measure of financial strength, Wells Fargo analysts
including Matthew Burnell wrote today. Morgan Stanley holds
$32.4 billion of debt in the region, which equates to 69 percent
of its Tier 1 capital, Burnell wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Regulatory data suggests JPMorgan&#8217;s exposure is largest
in aggregate, but Morgan Stanley held the largest aggregate
exposure to the PIIGS relative to Tier 1 capital,&#8221; the analysts
wrote. Overall U.S. bank &#8220;exposure to Greece is lower than
exposure to Ireland, Italy and Spain.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds and stocks plunged across Europe in the past week on
concern the Greek debt crisis is spreading across the euro area.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s this week cut Greece, Portugal and Spain&#8217;s
credit ratings as concern the nations may fail to meet their
debt commitments increased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks held a total of $236.8 billion of exposure to
the five nations, including $18.1 billion to Greece, Wells Fargo
said. European banks have claims totaling $193.1 billion on
Greece, according to the Bank for International Settlements,
with another $832.2 billion of claims on Spain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. met
regulators from the U.K. Financial Services Authority today to
formally discuss how the agency&#8217;s probe into the bank will
progress, two people familiar with the investigation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first time Goldman Sachs and the agency met to
discuss the timetable of the probe, the people said, on
condition of anonymity because the inquiry is confidential. The
regulator has a duty to meet with firms it is investigating at
an early stage to outline what will happen during the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA said earlier this month that it was investigating
Goldman Sachs&#8217; London office after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit over the New York-based
bank&#8217;s marketing of a collateralized debt obligation. Prime
Minister Gordon Brown, facing a May 6 election, called on the
FSA to investigate after the SEC suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London and FSA spokesman
Chris Hamilton both declined to comment. Sky News first reported
the meeting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank may be fined or individuals banned if the FSA
finds a breach of its rules. A Goldman Sachs vice president
named in the SEC case, Fabrice Tourre, is employed at the bank&#8217;s
London office. His FSA authorization was suspended at the firm&#8217;s
request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Questioning &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives, including Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein, were questioned by a U.S. Senate Subcommittee
earlier this week over the bank&#8217;s marketing of CDOs, which the
SEC alleges was fraudulent. Goldman Sachs denies the allegations
and has said it will fight the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre was also questioned at the Senate hearing. He
started working at the London office in November 2008, according
to the FSA&#8217;s register, and the SEC&#8217;s allegations relate to when
he worked in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French markets regulator, the Autorite des Marches
Financiers, said today it found no evidence that local fund-
management companies bought the CDO, known as Abacus 2007-AC1,
which is the subject of the SEC lawsuit. Germany&#8217;s BaFin
regulator said this month it will seek information from the SEC
about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German and British banks both lost money because of the
fraud, according to the SEC suit. The Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc, majority-owned by U.K. taxpayers, unwound a position
in Abacus bought by its ABN Amro unit by paying Goldman Sachs
$840.9 million, the SEC said. Germany&#8217;s IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG lost nearly all of its $150 million investment
in the CDO, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDOs bundle bonds or loans, or both, from a variety of
issuers, such as companies or countries. Interest payments on
the underlying bonds or loans are used to pay investors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group LLC founder Raj
Rajaratnam, who faces criminal insider-trading charges, won a
bid to keep confidential wiretap applications that prosecutors
say may be disclosed to the public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam in March opposed the government&#8217;s request for a
court procedure that would address &#8220;the public&#8217;s right to
access wiretap applications&#8221; that investigators probing him
confidentially submitted to a judge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam argued &#8220;no such right exists&#8221; and that the
applications should remain secret until a judge decides whether
the wiretaps may be used at his trial. His attorney, John Dowd,
said Rajaratnam&#8217;s right to try to exclude the wiretaps from his
trial &#8220;would be irreversibly compromised if the government were
permitted to publicize the same evidence in public filings&#8221;
before a judge ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Though the First Amendment grants the public and the
media a right of access&#8221; to such wiretap documents, &#8220;that
right is far from absolute,&#8221; U.S. District Judge Richard
Holwell in Manhattan said in a ruling made public yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Shielding such material from the public eye is often
critical to protect defendants&#8217; fair trial and privacy
interests, especially when the material has yet to be tested in
court,&#8221; the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had asked Holwell for a procedure that lawyers
in the case could follow when submitting wiretap applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government&#8217;s proposed procedure does not address the
special concerns that untested wiretap material raises,&#8221;
Holwell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s insider-trading case is based on testimony
from cooperating witnesses and wiretaps of Rajaratnam and
others. Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a related ruling, Holwell denied a request by
Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyers for access to unedited documents related to Roomy Khan, a government witness in the case against Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. asked for permission to redact portions of the
documents that related &#8220;to ongoing covert investigations
involving two individuals occasionally mentioned in the Khan
documents,&#8221; Holwell said in a ruling issued yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-CR-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-AKO Hedge-Fund Trader Charged With Insider Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former hedge-fund trader at AKO Capital LLP was charged
by the U.K. financial regulator with insider trading in
transactions involving 22 different shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anjam Ahmad, 38, was charged with one count of conspiracy
to commit insider dealing relating to trades between June and
August 2009, the Financial Services Authority said in a
statement yesterday. Ahmad was at AKO Capital until September
2009, according to the FSA&#8217;s register. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Robert Brown, Ahmad&#8217;s lawyer at London-based Corker
Binning, declined to comment. Ahmad faces a maximum of seven
years in jail if found guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were shocked when, subsequent to his departure from
AKO Capital, we were notified by the FSA that it was
investigating,&#8221; said David Woodburn, a compliance officer at
London-based AKO Capital who confirmed that Ahmad used to be an
execution trader there. The transactions in question were
personal, and AKO Capital hasn&#8217;t been accused of wrongdoing, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad was released on bail and will appear at a London
court next week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Memphis-Area Man Indicted Over Wheat Futures Trades &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A broker who worked in Memphis, Tennessee, was charged with
making unauthorized wheat futures trades that cost MF Global
Inc. $141 million in losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evan Brent Dooley, 42, of Olive Branch, Mississippi, was
indicted in Chicago April 27 on 16 counts of wire fraud and two
of violating the federal Commodity Exchange Act&#8217;s limit on
speculative positions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dooley, who was a broker at the Memphis office of MF
Global, executed the trades on two nights in January and
February 2008, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When MF Global authorities learned of Dooley&#8217;s overnight
trading, they deactivated his account and liquidated the
remainder of his position,&#8221; resulting in a loss of $141 million
in February 2008 which Dooley was unable to cover, U.S. Attorney
Patrick J. Fitzgerald said yesterday in a press statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each wire fraud count carries a maximum penalty of as much
as 20 years&#8217; imprisonment. The Exchange Act violations are
punishable by as much as five years in prison. Dooley&#8217;s lawyer,
identified by prosecutors as Keri Ambrosio of Chicago, didn&#8217;t
immediately reply to a voice-mail message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trades were executed through the Chicago Board of
Trade, now part of CME Group Inc., using the CME Globex
electronic trading platform, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We applaud the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s Office and grand jury for
indicting Mr. Dooley and support their efforts to bring him to
justice,&#8221; MF Global spokeswoman Maria Gemskie said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Dooley, 1:10-cr-00335, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Wins Ruling Keeping German CDO Case in U.K. Courts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. won a ruling allowing a U.K. judge to
hear a dispute over credit-default swaps sold to Berlin&#8217;s public
transport provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal in London ruled that the case, filed by
Berlin&#8217;s BVG transport agency, over a 2007 credit default swap
transaction, should be heard by a U.K. Court. Lawyers for BVG
argued that U.K. court didn&#8217;t have jurisdiction and the case
should be tried in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German municipal agencies have also filed lawsuits in
Germany against banks over derivatives contracts used to hedge
credit risks. BVG, which has run the Berlin public transport
system for 80 years, says it shouldn&#8217;t have to pay the bank more
than $100 million over a 2007 credit swap arrangement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Collinson, spokesman for BVG law firm Addleshaw
Goddard, didn&#8217;t respond to a message seeking comment. JPMorgan
spokesman David Wells declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BVG claims in the lawsuit that JPMorgan gave it incorrect
advice. The bank claims BVG owes it $112 million under the terms
of the contract, the judgment says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is A3/2009/1637 JP Morgan Chase Bank NA  anr -v-
Berliner Verkehrsbetriebe (BVG), U.K. Court of Appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi Can&#8217;t Block French Investors From U.S. Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Vivendi SA can&#8217;t block French investors from participating
in a U.S. class-action lawsuit, a Paris appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French investors can remain in the American case, Judge
Jean-Claude Magendie said in a ruling yesterday in Paris.
Vivendi in January was found liable in a New York case for
misleading investors from 2000 to 2002 with statements that hid
a liquidity crisis at the Paris-based owner of the largest music
and video game companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company had sought to reduce the number of investors
who can claim an award from the class-action ruling. About two-
thirds of the plaintiffs in the U.S. case live in France, where
such group lawsuits aren&#8217;t permitted. Vivendi has set aside 550
million euros ($726 million) to cover a possible payout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &#8220;serious ties existing&#8221; between the French
company, French investors, and the U.S., Magendie said in his
11-page decision. The court rejected a request for damages by
the investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivendi &#8220;regrets that the Court of Appeal has decided not
to make a ruling at this stage on the question of whether
American class actions were in accordance with French public
policy,&#8221; the company said in an e-mailed statement. The company
denies wrongdoing in the U.S. case and has said it will appeal
the New York verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Paris court in January allowed Vivendi&#8217;s French investors
to participate in the U.S. suit. Vivendi last year sued the
Association for the Defense of Minority Shareholders, or Adam,
and investors Olivier Gerard and Gerard Morel arguing its French
shareholders have remedies available in their home country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The class-action award will mean &#8220;one type of shareholder
will be reimbursed by another type of shareholder,&#8221; the company
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s ruling is &#8220;satisfactory on all points for
us,&#8221; Adam president Colette Neuville said in an e-mail. &#8220;The
court ruled we were correct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank&#8217;s Rorech Broke No Laws, Lawyer Argues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank AG salesman Jon-Paul Rorech broke no law by
giving a hedge-fund manager information on a bond sale, his
lawyer said as U.S. regulators&#8217; first trial alleging insider-
trading of credit-default swaps came to a close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Everything he knew he was allowed to share with
customers,&#8221; attorney Richard Strassberg said yesterday in his
summation. U.S. District Judge John G. Koeltl in Manhattan, who
heard the nonjury civil trial that began April 7, said he will
rule on the case at a future date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Rorech,
39, of illegally feeding information to Renato Negrin, 46, a
former Millennium Partners LP portfolio manager, who bought
swaps to reap a $1.2 million profit when the 2006 deal was
announced, according to the civil complaint filed in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants contend the SEC has no jurisdiction over
swaps and no basis for bringing the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission&#8217;s suit focuses on efforts by Dutch media
company VNU Group BV, later renamed Nielsen Co., to restructure
its debt in 2006 as part of a 7.5 billion euro ($9.9 billion)
leveraged buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency didn&#8217;t accuse Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank or
New York-based hedge fund Millennium of wrongdoing. Rorech is on
paid leave from Deutsche Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2006, VNU, whose units include the Nielsen TV-
ratings company, announced a $1.67 billion bond offer by
subsidiaries. Investors were concerned that the bonds weren&#8217;t
&#8220;deliverable,&#8221; or couldn&#8217;t be used to settle existing VNU
credit-default swaps, according to the trial evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 24, 2006, Deutsche Bank announced the offer would
be restructured to include a 200 million euro tranche of bonds
issued by the holding company that would be covered by the
swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Rorech tipped Negrin to the restructuring
before that announcement. Negrin bought 20 million euros of
swaps, and profited by selling them after the deal was announced
and the swap price rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Negrin had perfectly legitimate reasons to buy the
credit-default swaps,&#8221; his lawyer Lawrence Iason said in his
closing argument. &#8220;It was because he thought the credit-default
swaps were underpriced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The SEC has been wholly unable to carry its burden on any
element in this case,&#8221; Strassberg said. &#8220;It&#8217;s time for this
nightmare for Mr. Rorech to end.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He knows sales people are on the public side and normally
only have public information,&#8221; said Iason, Negrin&#8217;s lawyer, of
Morvillo, Abramowitz, Grand, Iason, Anello  Bohrer PC in New
York. &#8220;There is no evidence to support the commission&#8217;s claims
against Mr. Negrin.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Rorech,
1:09-cv-04329, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Bankruptcy Had No Planning, Lawyer Miller Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy was &#8220;preceded
by no planning whatsoever&#8221; and the sale of its brokerage was
negotiated amid pressure from regulators to stabilize financial
markets, its lead bankruptcy lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Harvey Miller, a partner at Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP, was
Lehman&#8217;s first witness yesterday in a trial that began April 26
over whether Barclays Plc should pay as much as $11 billion to
Lehman for the alleged &#8220;windfall&#8221; the bank received when it
bought the brokerage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This was not normal merger and acquisition activity, this
was very unusual, said Miller, testifying on the third day of
the trial. He described the brokerage assets in September 2008
as &#8220;a melting ice cube&#8221; that would quickly have lost value if
not swiftly transferred to a buyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan before
Judge James Peck pits the U.K.&#8217;s second-biggest bank, which more
than doubled its profit last year, against Lehman, which wants
money to pay off creditors and brokerage customers. Lehman said
its advisers didn&#8217;t know how much money Barclays would make on
the deal, which was sealed in the wake of Lehman&#8217;s 2008
bankruptcy, the biggest in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Values were plummeting,&#8221; Miller said. Lehman executives
Richard Fuld, Herbert &#8220;Bart&#8221; McDade and Steven Berkenfeld were
concerned about how to preserve some of the brokerage&#8217;s value,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller&#8217;s testimony partly explained why parts of the sale
documents were never scrutinized by the court. He said he had
explained in court at the sale hearing as &#8220;objections were
coming in and Blackberries were wearing out&#8221; that the deal was
&#8220;a moving target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck approved the deal in unfinished form because he &#8220;said
he didn&#8217;t see any other realistic alternative,&#8221; Miller said,
apologizing to the judge for paraphrasing him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck is handling three lawsuits against Barclays, including
one by the Lehman brokerage&#8217;s trustee, James Giddens, and one by
creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-
13555, and James W. Giddens v. Barclays Capital Inc., 09-01732,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BA, Virgin Atlantic Weren&#8217;t in a Cartel, Defense Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; British Airways Plc didn&#8217;t always tell Virgin Atlantic
Airways Ltd. before raising fuel surcharges during a period of
record oil prices, a defense lawyer said at a criminal price-
fixing trial in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BA&#8217;s eight-pound increase ($12.15) on June 23, 2005, wasn&#8217;t
discussed with Virgin and is proof the carriers had neither a
consensus on prices nor a commitment to a cartel, lawyer Clare
Montgomery told a jury yesterday in Southwark Crown Court.
Virgin later decided on its own to match the increase, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a genuine debate at Virgin about what
independent decision they should make&#8221; to respond to BA&#8217;s
increase, Montgomery told the jury. &#8220;There was no agreement to
stop competing and fix surcharges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former BA executives and one current manager face
claims by the U.K.&#8217;s antitrust regulator that they schemed with
Virgin from July 2004 through April 2006 to keep surcharges as
high as possible without losing customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew Crawley, BA&#8217;s head of sales; Martin George, a former
board member; Iain Burns, ex-head of communications; and Alan
Burnett, former head of U.K. and Ireland sales, pleaded not
guilty in July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, the first of its kind since criminal antitrust
laws were enacted, was brought by the Office of Fair Trading and
is being heard by Judge Robert Owen. The men each face as many
as five years in prison if found guilty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Virgin employees were charged because the Crawley,
England-based company admitted its role in the scheme and
cooperated with authorities, prosecutors said. Montgomery, the
defense lawyer, said Virgin admitted guilt to be cautious and
wasn&#8217;t necessarily doing anything wrong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi Mei Executive Agrees to Prison for Price Fixing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corp. sales executive, charged in
the U.S. with participating in a conspiracy to fix prices of
display panels, agreed to a prison sentence of 270 days and a
fine of $25,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors and an attorney for Chu-Hsiang &#8220;James&#8221; Yang
said in a plea agreement filed yesterday in U.S. federal court
in San Francisco that Yang will plead guilty to participating in
a conspiracy to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the
prices of liquid-crystal display panels sold in the U.S. from
2004 to 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government recommended a reduced sentence for Yang
because he helped prosecutors in its investigation and
prosecutions of LCD price fixing, according to the agreement.
The maximum penalty for price fixing is 10 years in prison and a
$1 million fine, or twice the gain or loss from the conduct plus
restitution, according to the filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s unfortunate for the executive and his family, but
it&#8217;s not surprising and not unprecedented that some of these
Asian tech executives have gone to jail,&#8221; said Matt Cleary, who
rates Chimei Innolux &#8220;buy&#8221; as an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG
in Taipei. &#8220;This brings a chapter to a close for Chimei
Innolux.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge still must approve the sentence for Yang, who is
scheduled to appear in court to enter a guilty plea on April 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chi Mei pleaded guilty in December and agreed to pay $220
million in fines. The investigation has led to more than $860
million in fines for LCD makers and guilty pleas by at least
four executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Lawler, an attorney for Yang, didn&#8217;t return voice-
mail messages seeking comment after regular business hours
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v Yang, 10-00335, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of California (San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sempra Settles Litigation, Cuts Earnings Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sempra Energy, the co-owner of an energy-trading venture
with Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, agreed to a $410 million
settlement of claims arising from the California energy crisis
in 2000 and 2001. The company also cut its 2010 earnings
forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal with the state resolves &#8220;substantially all of the
remaining litigation related to the energy crisis,&#8221; San Diego-
based Sempra said yesterday in a statement. The cost of the
settlement reduced first-quarter earnings by $96 million, or 38
cents a share, and trading venture RBS-Sempra Commodities will
pay most of the agreement, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This settlement closes another chapter on California&#8217;s
energy crisis,&#8221; Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican,
said in an e-mailed statement from the California Public
Utilities Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state has negotiated $3.2 billion in settlements with
energy companies who profited during the crisis, when
electricity prices soared and power shortages caused blackouts,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knauf Ordered to Pay $164,000 for Louisiana Home &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin Co. was ordered to pay $164,000
to a family that claimed their Louisiana home was ruined by
defective drywall made in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Eldon Fallon, who is overseeing federal
lawsuits filed against Chinese drywall makers throughout the
U.S., ruled that homeowners Tatum and Charlene Hernandez are
entitled to have their home restored to its original condition.
He also granted damages to replace personal property and cover
the couple&#8217;s living expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiffs purchased a new home and are entitled to have
it restored to a new condition,&#8221; Fallon wrote in a 47-page
decision in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallon&#8217;s ruling comes after a trial in March, where he
presided without a jury. The case, part of coordinated
multidistrict litigation over defective drywall, is intended as
a bellwether to help determine property damage issues in other
cases against manufacturers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,100 homeowners in the U.S. have filed federal
suits claiming their homes were damaged or ruined by defective
drywall that gives off noxious odors and chemicals that can
corrode wiring, plumbing and heating equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knauf said it may appeal the Hernandez decision. Evidence
introduced by Knauf at trial &#8220;showed that a home impacted by
Chinese drywall could be repaired for a much more reasonable
amount than what was awarded by the court,&#8221; Don Hayden, a
lawyer for the company, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Chinese-Manufactured Drywall Products
Liability Litigation, 2:09-md-02047, U.S. District Court,
Eastern District of Louisiana (New Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Court Upholds Price-Fixing Fines in Threadmakers&#8217; Cartel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A European Union court upheld antitrust fines totaling
23.44 million euros ($31 million) levied against five makers of
industrial thread for colluding to fix prices for the product
used in clothes, car seats and mattresses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court &#8220;rejects the arguments relied on by the
companies in support of their actions for annulment of the
decision,&#8221; the EU General Court in Luxembourg, the 27-nation
region&#8217;s second-highest tribunal, said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Commission, the EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator,
fined the threadmakers, including units of German companies
Amann  Soehne GmbH and Guetermann GmbH, in September 2005 for
agreeing on prices and exchanging information in meetings
throughout the 1990s. The EU regulator can fine companies as
much as 10 percent of their annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guinness Peat Group Plc&#8217;s Coats unit, based in Uxbridge,
West of London, didn&#8217;t appeal its 15 million-euro fine, the
highest among the group of threadmakers. Yesterday&#8217;s decision
can be appealed a last time to the EU&#8217;s top court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petra Grathwohl, a spokeswoman for Gutach-Breisgau-based
Guetermann, and Johannes Ibach, group marketing manager at
Boennigheim-based Amann, said they were unable to immediately
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgian Sewing Thread&#8217;s fine was reduced to 856,800 euros
from 980,000 euros &#8220;on account of its cooperation&#8221; during the
commission&#8217;s investigation into the cartel, the court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are T-446/05 Amann  Soehne and Cousin Filterie,
T-448/05 Oxley Threads, T-452/05 Belgian Sewing Thread, T-456/05
Guetermann and T-457/05 Zwicky v. European Commission. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rothstein Firm Official Pleads Innocent to Conspiracy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former chief operating officer of the defunct Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, law firm at the center of an alleged $1.2
billion Ponzi scheme pleaded not guilty to a charge of money-
laundering conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debra Villegas, 42, was accused yesterday of helping Scott
W. Rothstein sell investors discounted stakes in bogus cases
that were supposedly being handled by his firm, Rothstein
Rosenfeldt Adler PA. Villegas was charged by federal authorities
in Fort Lauderdale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Villegas is to be released on a $250,000 personal surety
bond. Her attorney said the defendant isn&#8217;t going to oppose the
government&#8217;s forfeiture request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors asked that Villegas be required to forfeit real
estate in Weston, Florida, a 2009 Maserati and $1.2 billion in
cash -- the total losses in the alleged scheme -- according to
both the charging document and an FBI statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She is, at this point, basically indigent,&#8221; Villegas
attorney Robert Stickney told U.S. Magistrate Judge Robin
Rosenbaum yesterday in federal court in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rothstein pleaded guilty in January to two counts of wire
fraud and three conspiracy charges. He used the Ponzi scheme to
keep afloat his law firm, fund a lavish lifestyle and buy
political influence, he admitted. He faces as much as 100 years
in prison at his sentencing June 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Villegas, 10-60126, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (Fort Lauderdale). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the
U.K. Financial Services Authority are meeting today to discuss
the probe into the U.S. lender, Sky News reported, without
saying where it got its information. &lt;/p&gt;
</body></entry><entry author="By Editors: Andrew Reierson" date="Apr 29, 2010  5:48 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-29/goldman-sec-taint-limited-to-u-s-in-bank-bonds-evolution-s-jenkins-says.html"><headline>Goldman SEC Taint Limited to U.S. in Bank Bonds, Evolution's Jenkins Says</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s legal
troubles may be contained to the U.S. as investors in Europe bet
regulation will lead to more stability for banks, said Gary
Jenkins, head of credit strategy at Evolution Securities Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of U.K. banks have returned 0.28 percent since
Goldman was accused of defrauding investors 11 days ago,
compared with losses of 0.75 percent in the U.S., according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global Broad Market Corporate
Index. Securities of New York-based Goldman gave up 3.45 percent
in the same period, making them the worst performers among the
biggest firms in the benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;More intense regulation isn&#8217;t necessarily a bad thing,&#8221;
Jenkins said. &#8220;Bondholders are concerned about the ability of
banks to repay debt. The more stable financial firms are and the
more focus there is on a steady return over a business cycle,
the better for bondholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, became on April 16 the first major bank accused by the
Securities and Exchange Commission of fraud connected to the
collapse of the subprime mortgage market. Investors in the U.S.
have &#8220;woken up&#8221; to the Obama Administration&#8217;s determination to
target investment banks, while regulators in Europe have been
more passive, Jenkins said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Goldman Sachs SEC investigation is having much more
of an impact in the U.S. than in Europe,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Significant Upside&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Europe are favoring bonds of Barclays Plc,
Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, said
Louis Gargour, chief investment officer at LNG Capital LLP, a
London-based hedge fund he co-founded in 2006. Barclays bonds
have gained 0.08 percent since April 15, while debt of Lloyds
returned 0.41 percent, Bank of America data show. RBS bonds
gained 0.44 percent. Debt of ING Groep NV in Amsterdam was the
best bank performer globally, returning 0.65 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is significant upside in some of the European banks
as a result of the decimation they have taken over the past two
years,&#8221; Gargour said. &#8220;Systemic risks will be minimal for the
next few years and banks are sufficiently profitable in good
times to bear the burden of the proposed global bank tax.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund has recommended banks set
aside money to fund future bailouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds of the top five U.S. banks have all lost money for
investors since the SEC suit was filed. Fixed-income securities
of Morgan Stanley gave up 1.13 percent, Bank of America lost
0.72 percent, Citigroup Inc. lost 0.5 percent and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. lost 0.27 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sovereign default by a country like Greece remains a risk
to financial firms in Europe, Evolution&#8217;s Jenkins said. European
banks had total claims on Greece including bonds and loans of
$193.1 billion as of Dec. 31, according to the Bank for
International Settlements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lloyds said yesterday that its &#8220;exposure&#8221; to Greece and
Portugal isn&#8217;t material. RBS chairman Philip Hampton said his
firm has less than 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) of Greece
debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caltex Australia Ltd. scrapped a
A$300 million ($288 million) plan to buy 302 service stations
from Exxon Mobil Corp. after a regulator opposed the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission blocked
the transaction saying Feb. 10 it would allow the nation&#8217;s
biggest oil refiner to raise retail fuel prices. Caltex
Australia agreed with Exxon to terminate the agreement they had
entered in May last year, the Sydney-based company said today in
a statement to the Australian stock exchange clearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Caltex does not agree with the ACCC&#8217;s position, but has
since engaged in discussions with Mobil in relation to possible
solutions to the ACCC&#8217;s concerns,&#8221; the statement said. &#8220;The
parties have now agreed they will not proceed with the current
proposal. However, Caltex will continue to explore opportunities
to grow its business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caltex, half-owned by San Ramon, California-based Chevron
Corp., declined 1.5 percent to A$11.58 in Sydney trading prior
to the release of the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett, who called Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. an &#8220;exceptional institution&#8221; when he invested
$5 billion in the firm, will have his biggest platform to
discuss the bank after it was sued for fraud by regulators and
pilloried in Congress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, who will host shareholders of his Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. at the May 1 annual meeting, was a satisfied
Goldman Sachs client when he extended capital and credibility to
the firm during the credit crisis in 2008. Buffett has since
defended the bank amid public outrage about its pay and conduct,
drawing on a relationship that dates to a visit with a Goldman
Sachs executive in New York at the age of 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s more than 60 years of experience with Goldman
Sachs that&#8217;s talking,&#8221; said Jeff Matthews, author of
&#8220;Pilgrimage to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Omaha&#8221; and founder of the
hedge fund Ram Partners LP. &#8220;Buffett is not going to be turning
around selling his Goldman Sachs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett said people who feel cheated by the recession have
unfairly lashed out at Wall Street when regulators, mortgage
lenders and politicians should share the blame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re going to rewrite Genesis and have Goldman Sachs
offering the apple,&#8221; Buffett said in a March 1 interview with
CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The billionaire has &#8220;great confidence&#8221; in his investment,
according to Berkshire Director Thomas Murphy, who told 
Bloomberg Television that he spoke with Buffett after the  
Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs on April 
16. Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said 
he also spoke privately with Buffett after the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder Questions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett will take about five hours of shareholder questions
at the meeting and, according to Murphy, should expect inquiries
about Goldman Sachs, which was accused of misleading clients on
the sale of mortgage-related investments. About 35,000 people
attended last year&#8217;s meeting at Omaha&#8217;s Qwest Center arena.
Buffett&#8217;s comments from the gathering and subsequent press
conference are read throughout the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, a critic of Wall Street greed and corruption, has
supported a firm that&#8217;s been a lightning rod for criticism.
Public regard for Goldman Sachs plunged in the year and a half
since Buffett, Berkshire&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer,
bought preferred securities paying 10 percent interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire makes $500 million a year in interest on the
Goldman Sachs perpetual preferred stock, which the bank may call
at any time by paying a 10 percent premium. The warrants Buffett
negotiated as part of the deal give Berkshire the option to buy
$5 billion of common stock for $115 a share. Berkshire&#8217;s paper
profit on the warrants was about $1.8 billion as of yesterday,
down from $3 billion before the SEC lawsuit was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs advanced $3.97, or 2.6 percent, to $157.01
yesterday in New York trading. The bank closed at $184.27 on
April 15. Berkshire rose $675 to $115,625. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is reminiscent of a 1987 deal with Salomon
Inc. in which Buffett invested $700 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett was named interim chairman of Salomon in 1991 after
the firm was accused of misconduct in the Treasury debt auction
market, and he worked with regulators to restore the company&#8217;s
credibility. In testimony to Congress, he summarized his message
for Salomon employees: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding,&#8221;
Buffett said. &#8220;Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I
will be ruthless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senate Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs executives endured more than 10 hours of
grilling before the Senate&#8217;s Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations on April 27 about their duty to clients and the
ethics of betting against the housing market as the bank sold
mortgage-linked securities. Michigan Democrat Carl Levin said he
was &#8220;troubled&#8221; that the company doesn&#8217;t seem to understand
conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has said the SEC suit is unfounded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What clients or customers are buying is they are buying
an exposure,&#8221; Blankfein told the committee. &#8220;The thing we are
selling to them is supposed to give them the risk they want.
They are not coming to us to represent what our views are.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs posted a record $13.4 billion profit in 2009,
a year after receiving $10 billion in a taxpayer bailout. It
repaid the funds with interest in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett told television interviewer Charlie Rose in
November that the bank didn&#8217;t need the bailout. As politicians
railed about bonuses, Buffett, the world&#8217;s third-richest person,
praised Blankfein and said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind paying for
performance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding a Target &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to expect vilification of banks,&#8221; Buffett
said in a January interview. &#8220;If I lost my job I&#8217;d be mad at
somebody, I&#8217;d probably be mad at everybody. And that&#8217;s human
nature. And it sometimes gets fanned by people to whom it&#8217;s to
their advantage to have a target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs case is the SEC&#8217;s first contested lawsuit
against a major investment bank in more than a decade, and comes
as the regulator seeks to restore a reputation tarnished by its
failure to detect Bernard Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, who has ridiculed investment bankers for the size
of their fees, relied on Goldman Sachs for some of his biggest
deals, including the $4.5 billion acquisition of Marmon Holdings
Inc. in 2008 and the $1.45 billion takeover of McLane Co. Those
deals were facilitated by Byron Trott, the former Goldman Sachs
managing director of whom Buffett said &#8220;I trust him
completely.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Investing Icon &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At last year&#8217;s meeting, Buffett praised Wells Fargo  Co.
and dismissed the importance of government analysts who were
reviewing banks in an industrywide stress test. The San
Francisco-based bank jumped 44 percent the following week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Warren Buffett is certainly an icon in terms of picking
the right companies and investing with a long-term strategy,&#8221;
said Jeff Resnick of Opinion Research Corp., a specialist in
brand and reputation consulting. A good reputation &#8220;will give
you a reservoir of goodwill among your most important
stakeholders.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Berkshire rose to first place this month in Harris
Interactive&#8217;s annual survey of corporate reputations. Goldman
Sachs came in 56th out of 60. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s an important client as well as an investor,&#8221;
Blankfein said of Buffett in the April 27 Bloomberg Television
interview. &#8220;I can&#8217;t speak for Warren.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett said last year in Omaha that almost everyone
associated with finance, from bankers to regulators to insurers,
contributed to the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of it stemmed from greed, some from stupidity, some
from people saying the other guy was doing it,&#8221; Buffett said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Empresas Cablevision SAB, the
Mexico City cable-TV company controlled by Grupo Televisa SA,
plans to boost its subscriber rolls by 11 percent this year to
700,000, Chief Executive Officer Jean Paul Broc said.
&#160; &#160;  The company forecasts that sales will rise 18 percent this
year, Broc said yesterday in an interview at a cable industry
convention in Monterrey, Mexico. Cablevision reported sales of
5.28 billion pesos ($428 million) in 2009.
&#160; &#160;  Cablevision will offer cheaper high-definition TV packages
with more channels, such as movies and news networks,&#160;to attract
customers, Broc said. The company is battling with satellite
competitor Dish Mexico for new video subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company added 41,000 television customers last year, a
7 percent increase from 2008.
&#160; &#160;  Cablevision was unchanged yesterday in Mexico City trading
at 25.03 pesos. Televisa, also based in Mexico City, gained 1.06
pesos to 49.93 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may have
backed itself into a corner by speaking out quickly to counter
fraud claims by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the two weeks since the SEC filed its lawsuit, Goldman
Sachs has released multiple written defenses, sent executives to
Capitol Hill for sworn testimony and put Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein on television to explain the firm&#8217;s conduct as
the housing market soured. While broadcasting its story, the New
York investment bank also has given regulators, lawmakers and
law enforcement agencies material to scour for contradictions
that could weaken its defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC attorneys are already poring through the April 27
Senate testimony of Fabrice Tourre, the 31-year-old banker at
the center of the lawsuit, looking for any deviation from sworn
statements he made during the agency&#8217;s investigation, according
to a person familiar with the probe who declined to be
identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Going under oath and committing yourself before you have
any idea what kind of a case might be brought against you -- and
more particularly what the evidence in that case might be -- is
going to seriously curtail a defense lawyer&#8217;s ability to find
running room to defend you,&#8221; said Samuel Buell, a former
federal prosecutor who is now a law professor at Washington
University in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the hearing, Tourre and Blankfein, 55, were
interviewed under oath by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations. Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who
heads the panel, said he&#8217;s looking into whether they &#8220;tried to
fudge&#8221; their responses in the public hearing this week.
Blankfein will appear next week at the annual shareholders
meeting to answer questions related to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khuzami Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Khuzami, the SEC&#8217;s chief of enforcement, said in a
closed meeting with Congressional staff on April 29 that it
wouldn&#8217;t be appropriate to discuss whether there are settlement
talks taking place, according to one person who attended and
spoke on condition of anonymity because the briefing was
private. Khuzami also declined to comment on why Tourre was the
only individual named in the lawsuit, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC&#8217;s April 16 lawsuit revolves around whether the firm
should have told investors in 2007 that hedge fund Paulson 
Co., helped pick the underlying securities for a collateralized
debt obligation -- and then bet against it. Paulson wasn&#8217;t
accused of any wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Strategy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While locking in testimony this early in the litigation
process posed risks, it was part of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s strategy,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm&#8217;s
defense. Tourre&#8217;s public statements make it less likely that he
could change his story later and negotiate a lesser penalty with
the SEC in return for information that could be damaging to the
firm or other executives, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre, whose legal fees are paid by Goldman Sachs, said he
&#8220;categorically&#8221; denies the SEC&#8217;s allegations. He may have
testified to save his reputation and career, Buell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These guys&#8217; considerations aren&#8217;t just legal,&#8221; said
Buell. &#8220;They have to do with public relations, with reputation,
with their ability to continue to function the way they want to
in the business world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s stock dropped 13 percent on the day the SEC
announced its case and declined 9.4 percent yesterday after
reports that federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
the matter to determine whether to pursue a criminal fraud case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with two analyst downgrades, the scrutiny &#8220;puts the
pressure&#8221; on Goldman Sachs to try to settle sooner rather than
later, Matt McCormick, an analyst at Bahl  Gaynor Inc. in
Cincinnati, which manages about $2.8 billion, said yesterday in
a Bloomberg Television interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of public opinion, McCormick said, Goldman Sachs
has &#8220;already been condemned, the question is the price.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks tumbled, capping the
biggest weekly drop since January, as criminal investigators
took aim at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and technology shares slid
after MEMC Electronic Materials Inc. posted a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sank 9.4 percent to the lowest since July as
people familiar with the matter said federal prosecutors are
exploring whether to bring a criminal fraud case. Barclays Plc
plummeted in U.S. trading after investment banking at the U.K.&#8217;s
third-largest bank missed estimates. MEMC, which makes silicon
wafers, sank 19 percent. Transocean Ltd. tumbled 7.9 percent as
the White House banned new offshore drilling until the Gulf of
Mexico oil spill is investigated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index retreated 1.7 percent to
1,186.69 at 4 p.m. in New York, extending its weekly retreat to
2.5 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 158.71
points, or 1.4 percent, to 11,008.61 and lost 1.8 percent over
the past five days, snapping an eight-week streak of gains,
which was its longest rally since 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word criminal &#8220;sounds bad, gets everybody&#8217;s attention
and is responsible for taking down financial companies,&#8221; said
Jeffrey Davis, who oversees $5 billion as chief investment
officer at Lee Munder Capital Group in Boston. &#8220;There&#8217;s concern
that the government could accidently hurt or kill companies,
either Goldman or others. In Europe, there&#8217;s Barclays and it
doesn&#8217;t surprise me that European businesses are feeling more
pressures than the U.S. right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.R. Horton &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs-led slump in financial shares
overshadowed rallies in Sunoco Inc., D.R. Horton Inc. and others
on better-than-estimated earnings and further evidence the U.S.
recovery is holding firm. The economy grew at a 3.2 percent
annual rate last quarter, compared with 3.3 percent forecast in
a Bloomberg survey and 5.6 percent gain in the fourth quarter.
Consumer spending rose 3.6 percent, the most in three years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The thing that is really important here is the personal
consumption number,&#8221; said Mike Ryan, the New York-based head of
wealth management research for the Americas at UBS Financial
Services Inc., which oversees about $663 billion. &#8220;This is
going to be driven by a pick-up in private demand. From now on,
it will be important to see a consumer re-engagement given that
the government won&#8217;t provide the same lift that we&#8217;ve had in
2009.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Return to Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has surged 75 percent from a 12-year low in
March 2009 as earnings returned to growth following a record
nine-quarter slump and the Federal Reserve kept its benchmark
interest rate at a record low to safeguard the recovery from
recession. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs tumbled 9.4 percent to $145.20 to extend its
April decline to 15 percent, its worst month since October 2008.
Bank of America Corp. cut its recommendation to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;buy,&#8221; citing media reports indicating federal prosecutors are
investigating the firm. Bank of America also slashed its price
estimate on the shares to $160 from $220, according to a report
dated today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in New York are investigating transactions by
Goldman Sachs after the Securities and Exchange Commission sued
the firm two weeks ago on accusations of misleading investors in
collateralized debt obligations.  The federal review, which
lawyers say is common in such a high-profile case, is being done
by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said the people, who weren&#8217;t
authorized to comment and spoke on condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays Tumbles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. shares of Barclays Plc slumped 8.6 percent to $20.42.
First-quarter investment banking revenue dropped more than
estimated. Revenue at the Barclays Capital unit slumped 26
percent to 3.8 billion pounds ($5.8 billion) for the three
months to March 31, missing the 4.9 billion-pound estimate of
analyst Mark Phin at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial shares in the SP 500 slumped 2.5 percent for the
biggest loss among 10 groups, nine of which fell. JPMorgan Chase
 Co. slid 3.2 percent to $42.58 and Bank of America retreated
2.6 percent to $17.83. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEMC plunged 19 percent to $12.97 for the biggest decline
in the SP 500 and the stock&#8217;s largest drop since July 2008. The
maker of silicon wafers for solar modules and semiconductors
reported a first-quarter loss as prices for both products
declined and administrative expenses doubled. Analysts had
forecast a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean, Halliburton Co. and McMoRan Exploration Co.
plunged after President Barack Obama&#8217;s chief strategist David
Axelrod told ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America&#8221; that no new offshore
drilling will be allowed until this month&#8217;s Gulf of Mexico oil
spill is investigated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drillers Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transocean, whose Deepwater Horizon rig caught fire and
sank last week, tumbled 7.9 percent to $72.32. Halliburton, the
second-largest oilfield contractor and a service provider on the
Deepwater Horizon, declined 3 percent to $30.65. McMoRan, a New
Orleans-based oil and gas producer that&#8217;s drilling in the Gulf,
dropped 8.6 percent to $11.94. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAfee Inc. slumped 12 percent to $34.75. The second-
biggest maker of security software reported first quarter profit
that missed analysts&#8217; estimates after some customers put off
large purchases of programs designed to protect computers from
malicious software. The company&#8217;s rating was cut to &#8220;market
perform&#8221; from outperform&#8221; at Wells Fargo Securities by equity
analyst Philip Rueppel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. sank 3.9 percent to $21. The
securities exchange operator missed the average analyst earnings
estimate as U.S. stock trading slowed. Excluding some items,
first-quarter profit at Nasdaq was 43 cents a share, missing the
46-cent average estimate of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Energy Tumbles &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Energy Co. dropped 11 percent to $36.63. The coal
producer is being probed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
with regard to the explosion at one of the company&#8217;s mines in
West Virginia, NPR reported on its website, citing people
familiar with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunoco had the biggest gain in the SP 500, surging 4.3
percent to $32.78. The oil refiner reported profit of 14 cents a
share after the market close yesterday, beating the average
analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey for a loss of 14 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D.R. Horton surged 3.2 percent to $14.69. The second-
largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue reported its second straight
quarterly profit as buyers purchased property in time to beat
the deadline for federal tax credits. Net income was $11.4
million, or 4 cents a share, for the fiscal second quarter ended
March 31, compared with a loss of $108.6 million, or 34 cents, a
year earlier. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey forecast that D.R.
Horton would break even. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discovery Communications Inc. rose 3.3 percent to $38.73.
The owner of the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet cable
channels increased its revenue forecast to as much as $3.78
billion from as much as $3.75 billion. The company also reported
first-quarter profit of 39 cents a share, beating the 34-cent
average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit at companies in the SP 500 surged 176 percent
during the final three months of 2009, the most in Bloomberg
data going back to 1998, and analysts estimate a 47 percent
increase for the first quarter of 2010. Earnings estimates for
companies in the index rose 10 percent on average in April, the
largest monthly increase since at least 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Income for the first three months of this year is beating
estimates at nearly the fastest rate ever, with 77.9 percent of
the companies that have reported topping projections. That
compares with 79.5 percent in the third quarter and 72.3 percent
in the period before that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barton Biggs, who recommended buying U.S. stocks last year
when benchmark indexes sank to the lowest levels since the
1990s, said he anticipates total profit from SP 500 companies
of $88 to $90 a share this year, and $100 in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His 2010 forecast compares with the average projection of
$78.43 from 12 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The earnings are really coming in strong in the U.S.,&#8221;
Biggs, who runs New York-based hedge fund Traxis Partners LP,
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. &#8220;I&#8217;m still very
positive. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a pretty decent market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. fell in
New York trading after reports that federal prosecutors are
weighing criminal fraud charges against Wall Street&#8217;s most
profitable firm and the stock was downgraded to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from
&#8220;buy&#8221; at Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs dropped $15.04, or 9.4 percent, to $145.20 at
4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares,
which doubled last year, have slumped 21 percent since April 15,
the day before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
announced a civil lawsuit alleging the bank misled investors in
a mortgage-linked investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
transactions by Goldman Sachs to determine whether to pursue a
criminal fraud case, according to two people familiar with the
matter. The review, which lawyers say is common in such a high-
profile case, is being done by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
said the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on
condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that GS has long-term earnings
power beyond what is discounted in the share price,&#8221; Guy
Moszkowski, an analyst at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank
of America, wrote in a report today. &#8220;However, it is very
difficult to see the shares making further progress until the
matter has been resolved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burden of Proof &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America also reduced its share-price estimate on
Goldman Sachs to $160 from $220, according to Moszkowski.
Standard  Poor&#8217;s equity analyst Matthew Albrecht cut his
recommendation on the shares today to &#8220;sell&#8221; from &#8220;hold&#8221; and
reduced his price estimate to $140 from $180. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC suit said the bank created and sold collateralized
debt obligations linked to subprime mortgages in early 2007, as
the U.S. housing market faltered, without disclosing that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities and bet
against the vehicles. The company called the SEC&#8217;s claims
&#8220;unfounded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden of proof in a criminal case would be higher than
in the SEC&#8217;s civil case. Criminal allegations have to be proven
beyond a reasonable doubt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on public reports about the SEC matter, a criminal
case may be difficult, said Douglas R. Jensen, an attorney with
Park  Jensen LLP in New York. The case appears &#8220;highly
complex&#8221; and Goldman Sachs would be able to make multiple
arguments in its defense, he said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein Speaks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In order to proceed criminally in a case, you need to
have very clear evidence of lying, cheating and stealing,&#8221; said
Jensen, a former deputy chief of the criminal division of the
U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in the Southern District of New York who
served on that office&#8217;s securities fraud task force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs needs to be more transparent to stave off the
type of criticism the firm has recently endured, Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein told National Public Radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to have to be in a position where we&#8217;re much
more transparent about the activities that we do,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said in the interview, according to a transcript dated
yesterday on NPR&#8217;s website. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in a position
where activities seem to people as mysterious as they were at
the start of this crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with CBS News earlier this week, he said,
&#8220;It is my belief that nothing unethical and nothing illegal has
happened, but I will tell you if I discovered something like
this, or any senior person at Goldman Sachs discovered illegal
or unethical behavior, we would eliminate that from the firm.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Annual Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein will be up for re-election as chairman when the
bank holds its annual shareholder meeting on May 7. Charles
Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which invested
$5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008, told CNBC today that he
admires Blankfein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m favorably impressed by him,&#8221; Munger said in an
interview on the news channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in the Southern District
&#8220;pretty consistently&#8221; reviews SEC cases that are &#8220;higher
profile&#8221; such as those involving large dollar amounts or policy
issues, he said. The reviews may begin before the SEC files a
lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yusill Scribner, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Preet
Bharara, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full Cooperation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucas van Praag, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, said the company would &#8220;fully cooperate with any
requests for information.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Given the recent focus on
the firm, we&#8217;re not surprised by the report of an inquiry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Bureau of Investigation hasn&#8217;t opened a
criminal investigation, said a U.S. official who spoke on
condition of anonymity and wasn&#8217;t authorized to comment publicly
on the matter. The Postal Inspection Service, which also could
investigate such cases, doesn&#8217;t have any open probes into
Goldman, said Tom Boyle, a spokesman for the agency in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two former prosecutors for the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office in
New York, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said prosecutors
have their own investigators who may be examining the case
before determining whether to involve the FBI or postal
inspectors. The SEC may have provided documents and other
information to prosecutors gathered as part of its
investigation, allowing them to assess whether a criminal case
could be made, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty-one House Democrats and one House Republican, led by
Representative Marcy Kaptur, an Ohio Democrat, sent a letter to
the Justice Department on April 23 asking Attorney General Eric
Holder to investigate Goldman Sachs, if the Justice Department
wasn&#8217;t already. The department will review the letter, Alisa
Finelli, a spokeswoman, said in an April 27 e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire John Paulson&#8217;s firm earned $1 billion on the

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. energy company, reported its largest profit increase in at
least a decade, exceeding analyst estimates, after recovering
economies around the world spurred increases in fuel demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-quarter net income more than doubled to $4.55
billion, or $2.27 a share, from $1.84 billion, or 92 cents, a
year earlier, San Ramon, California-based Chevron said today in
a statement. Excluding severance costs, per-share profit was
about $2.38, 43 cents higher than the average of 14 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Chief Executive Officer John Watson boosted oil and
natural-gas output by 4.5 percent with new wells from the Gulf
of Mexico to Australia. Watson is selling money-losing assets
and shifting capital to oil and natural-gas fields Chevron has
been working to bring online for years, said Edward Westlake, an
analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Production was above expectations so it&#8217;s very hard to
shoot any holes in their story,&#8221; said Robbert Van Batenburg,
head of research at Louis Capital Markets LP in New York. &#8220;As
long as they continue to bring new projects on line, it&#8217;s blue
skies ahead.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worldwide demand for crude rose by 1.84 million barrels a
day during the first quarter, almost three times the growth rate
of the final three months of 2009, according to the
International Energy Agency in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 85 cents to $81.44 as of the 4 p.m. close of
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock rose as
much as 1 percent after the earnings report was released this
morning. It has 19 buy and 6 hold ratings from analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue jumped 33 percent to $48.2 billion, Chevron said.
The company&#8217;s oil and gas production increased to the equivalent
of 2.78 million barrels of crude a day, a company record, as new
wells started output in Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Angola and the Gulf
of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit from oil and gas wells more than tripled to $4.72
billion as the prices the company was paid for crude and gas
surged 97 percent and 28 percent, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining and chemicals earnings tumbled 74 percent to $196
million as higher crude prices squeezed margins on making
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, 53, announced plans last month to reduce the
company&#8217;s refining workforce by 12 percent, sell Chevron&#8217;s only
remaining European refinery and shed other assets that aren&#8217;t
meeting internal profitability goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, who succeeded David O&#8217;Reilly as CEO on Jan. 1, is
contending with reduced access to some of the world&#8217;s biggest
remaining untapped oil fields. The refining restructuring
announced last month includes plans to sell more than 1,000
gasoline stations and 60 fuel-storage terminals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the biggest U.S. oil company, said
yesterday that its first-quarter net income rose 38 percent to
$6.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., which some
analysts had predicted would make an offer for Palm Inc., won&#8217;t
bid after Hewlett-Packard Co. agreed to acquire the maker of Pre
and Pixi phones this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer, asked
whether the world&#8217;s largest software maker planned to make a
counteroffer, replied, &#8220;No we don&#8217;t.&#8221; Ballmer, who was
speaking at a conference in Mexico City, said the company also
will continue to invest in tablet-computer devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, whose Windows operating system is used in
Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s smartphones and tablet computers, stands to
lose if the computer maker replaces Windows with Palm&#8217;s
software. Earlier this year, Eric Risley, founder of Architect
Partners, a Menlo Park, California-based merger-and-acquisition
advisory firm, suggested that Microsoft could be a suitor for
Palm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard has canceled plans for a Windows-based
tablet, expected to go on sale later this year, TechCrunch
reported yesterday, citing a person it didn&#8217;t name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Bill Cox declined to comment on
specific products today. &#8220;H-P is a strategic partner of
Microsoft and will continue to be,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 47 cents to
$30.53 at 4 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grupo Hevi Chief Executive Officer
Hector Vielma is shrugging off acquisition interest from bigger
carriers like Megacable Holdings SAB, saying his Mexican cable
operator isn&#8217;t for sale at any price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closely held company, with 340,000 video subscribers
and 100,000 Internet customers, is a family business and can
keep growing on its own, Vielma said yesterday in an interview
in Monterrey, Mexico. Vielma founded the company in 1974 and has
sons who work for the business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We like to work. We have 40 years&#8217; experience in the
industry,&#8221; said Vielma, 64. &#8220;Why would we want to sell?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vielma&#8217;s resistance presents an obstacle for Megacable CEO
Enrique Yamuni, who said this week that his company remains
interested in buying Hevi. Megacable, the country&#8217;s biggest
cable operator, has 1.6 million TV customers and 532,000 Web
subscribers. Andres Coello, an analyst at BBVA Bancomer SA in
Mexico City, estimated Hevi&#8217;s value at $440 million in a
research note earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Megacable nor Grupo Televisa SA, which controls
three other Mexican cable providers, has made an offer for Hevi,
Vielma said. While Yamuni confirmed yesterday in an interview
that he hasn&#8217;t approached Hevi, he said he&#8217;s interested in
purchasing the Guadalajara, Mexico-based carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If we were a bigger company, we would have many more
possibilities to defend ourselves and be more aggressive,&#8221; said
Yamuni, who like Vielma was in Monterrey for a cable industry
conference. &#8220;Big companies have the opportunity to create more
synergies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish Mexico, Telmex &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable carriers are facing competition from Dish Mexico, a
satellite-TV joint venture between EchoStar Corp. and MVS
Comunicaciones SA, and from Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the
nation&#8217;s biggest phone and Internet carrier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megacable, also based in Guadalajara, has analyzed the
costs it could cut by buying the smaller company, said Yamuni,
54. He said he couldn&#8217;t disclose the estimate for competitive
reasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hevi has cable operations in 10 states and in cities such
as Nuevo Laredo, Puerta Vallarta and Irapuato. Megacable&#8217;s
territory includes Guadalajara, Mexico&#8217;s second-biggest city
after Mexico City, and other locations across 24 states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Hevi, Megacable is interested in buying
Cablecom, a Mexico City-based cable operator with about 650,000
TV subscribers, Yamuni said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Sooner or Later&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They know that we&#8217;re interested in getting together with
them in a possible purchase,&#8221; he said of both Cablecom and
Hevi. &#8220;We know that sooner or later they&#8217;re going to sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hevi is the fifth-biggest cable carrier in Mexico,
following Megacable, Cablemas SA, Cablecom and Empresas
Cablevision SAB. Televisa controls Cablemas and Cablevision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa is interested in consolidating the cable industry,
meaning it may buy companies, Executive Vice President Alfonso de
Angoitia said on a conference call in October. A Televisa
spokesman declined to comment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megacable is waiting for the market to stabilize before
making offers for the carriers, Yamuni said. The global economic
crisis hurt companies&#8217; market value over the past two years, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ernesto Tinajero, CEO of closely held Cablecom, didn&#8217;t
return e-mail messages left with his assistant yesterday, and no
one answered at the company&#8217;s corporate offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megacable fell 39 pesos to 30.81 pesos at 2:35 p.m. New
York time in Mexico City trading. Mexico City-based Televisa
gained 43 centavos to 50.88 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. needs to
be more transparent to stave off the type of criticism the firm
has recently endured, Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein
told National Public Radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to have to be in a position where we&#8217;re much
more transparent about the activities that we do,&#8221; Blankfein,
55, said in the interview, according to a transcript on NPR&#8217;s
website. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in a position where activities
seem to people as mysterious as they were at the start of this
crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which generates more trading revenue than
any other Wall Street firm, faces a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission civil fraud lawsuit over its sale of a mortgage-
linked security and is under scrutiny by federal criminal
prosecutors. Blankfein, who has run the company since June 2006,
tried to defend the firm&#8217;s actions this week when he was
interrogated by a U.S. Senate subcommittee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Someone like Goldman Sachs has never been in the consumer
business and never really had to get out and explain to the
public at large how we do our business,&#8221; Blankfein said,
according to the transcript, dated yesterday. &#8220;And now I&#8217;m
afraid it&#8217;s become very, very important for us to do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year
even as it repaid $10 billion of taxpayer bailout funds, played
a role in creating the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression, Blankfein told NPR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Contributed to Crisis&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the things that Goldman Sachs did contributed to
the crisis,&#8221; Blankfein said, according to the transcript. &#8220;So,
for example, Goldman Sachs did transactions for companies that
involved lending them a lot of money, maybe too much money. We
financed real estate that was probably overleveraged.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 8.4 percent, or $13.42, to
$146.82 as of 2:30 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The stock is down about 20 percent since April 15, the
day before the SEC filed suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the future, Blankfein said, Goldman Sachs and the
industry as a whole should be better at spotting bubbles in the
markets if they occur and better at absorbing the effects of
those bubbles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If institutions can&#8217;t absorb it and don&#8217;t have the
financial wherewithal to deal with the problems as they arise,
at least we have to have a system in place where financial
systems can be put out of business in a way that doesn&#8217;t
jeopardize the entire system by creating system risk,&#8221;
Blankfein added, according to the transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs contests the SEC&#8217;s allegations and that it
will &#8220;fully cooperate&#8221; with any requests for information from
federal prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to delete sentence in 12th paragraph containing
erroneous information about Goldman campaign contributions to
subcommittee members in column published April 23.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The satraps of Capitol Hill don&#8217;t
have much taste for aggressive financial reform. They do have a
certain talent, however, for the theater of aggressive reform.
And when Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein settles in at the
witness table of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations on Tuesday, that&#8217;s what they&#8217;ll try to deliver: a
moment that crystallizes three years of global disgust with the
smart money boys who seem to have played the rest of us for
fools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the curtain falls, the case that brought Blankfein to
the hot seat -- the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s civil
lawsuit alleging that Goldman misled investors when it sold them
subprime-mortgage-related investments that were designed to blow
up -- will still be one small, rotten potato in a large and
smelly field. The reforms that might prevent this sort of
chicanery will still be elusive, Bloomberg Businessweek says in
its April 26 issue. And Goldman, which calls the allegations
&#8220;completely unfounded&#8221; and vows to defend itself
&#8220;vigorously,&#8221; will still be the most spectacular cash machine
that banking has ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC chose this case because it is comparatively stark.
In early 2007, at the request of Paulson  Co., the hedge fund
run by billionaire John Paulson, Goldman structured a deal
called Abacus 2007-AC1, designed to let Paulson wager that the
subprime-mortgage industry would collapse. Goldman lined up two
counterparties for a fee of $15 million: ACA, a bond-insurance
company, lost about $950 million (with the banks backstopping
it), and a German bank called IKB lost $150 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misleading Statements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s offense, according to the SEC, was telling IKB
that the portfolio of mortgage bonds used for the deal was
&#8220;selected by ACA,&#8221; when in fact Paulson was deeply involved in
the process, cherry-picking the worst bonds it could find.
Goldman didn&#8217;t tell IKB who was on the other side of the trade,
or the extent to which Paulson influenced selections. As a
result, the SEC claims, Goldman&#8217;s statement to IKB was false,
misleading, and fraudulent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abacus case is of course far more complex and nuanced
than the SEC complaint lets on. This is a cast of characters
without a single hero. Not even the supposed victims are
sympathetic. IKB sold commercial-paper IOUs to investors in mid-
2007 that were worthless by year&#8217;s end. Its former CEO, Stefan
Ortseifen, went on trial last month in Germany for allegedly
lying about IKB&#8217;s financial condition before its near-collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-rating merchants, whose incompetence cannot be
overstated, make their usual cameo, as well. And while Paulson
didn&#8217;t get sued, because the SEC said he made no
misrepresentations, he did make $1 billion on the deal. Having
his name associated with this alleged fleecing carries its own
unknowable reputational risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enforcement Issues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, trying to show that it has grown teeth after doing
nothing while Bernie Madoff looted and Lehman Brothers fell to
dust, doesn&#8217;t appear pristine either. Its enforcement chief,
Robert Khuzami, until last year was a top lawyer at Deutsche
Bank, which, like Goldman, structured transactions for hedge
funds betting against subprime bonds. While Khuzami has said he
would recuse himself from matters involving Deutsche Bank, he&#8217;s
free to probe its competitors. The SEC filed the suit the same
day its inspector general released a horrific report on the
agency&#8217;s decade-long failure to catch accused Ponzi artist Allen
Stanford. That PR trick relegated what would have been the day&#8217;s
biggest financial story to the inside pages. The IG&#8217;s report
said the enforcement chief in the Fort Worth office quashed his
staff&#8217;s efforts to investigate, then left for private practice -
- and landed Stanford as a client. The effrontery of that may
well supersede anything Goldman and Paulson are alleged to have
done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barely Regulated &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only players in this game that can&#8217;t speak up for
themselves are the synthetic collateralized debt obligations.
Their value was tied to the performance of credit-default swaps,
derivatives that can be used to protect a bondholder from
losses. They&#8217;re not evil. The problem is they&#8217;re barely
regulated. What&#8217;s needed are rules to make sure they&#8217;re used
transparently by investors with the capital to absorb losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What distinguishes the Abacus case from other doomed
subprime deals are the e-mails written by a young Goldman vice-
president and now co-defendant, Fabrice Tourre. Had he not typed
quite so effusively -- &#8220;Only potential survivor, the fabulous
Fab _ standing in the middle of all these complex, highly
leveraged, exotic trades&#8221; -- the SEC might not have had a case
and Blankfein might have avoided the hot seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-Mail Traffic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one internal Goldman e-mail sent in March 2007, Tourre,
now 31, describes the portfolio as &#8220;selected by ACA/Paulson.&#8221;
In others, he frets that the housing market might crash before
Goldman could close the transaction. Tourre&#8217;s e-mails may
buttress Goldman&#8217;s basic strategy, which is to cast the SEC&#8217;s
suit as an argument over the conduct of a single employee.
&#8220;It&#8217;s all going to be a factual dispute about what he remembers
and what the other folks remember on the other side,&#8221; Greg
Palm, Goldman Sachs&#8217;s co-general counsel, said in a call with
reporters on April 20. &#8220;If we had evidence that someone here
was trying to mislead someone _ we&#8217;d be the first one to take
action.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Tourre tells his story -- which he is expected to do
before the same Senate panel that grills Blankfein -- he can
either support or explode this argument. &#8220;If Tourre says,
&#8216;Goldman&#8217;s board knew what we were doing,&#8217; you can imagine
Goldman will want to portray him as disgruntled,&#8221; says Onnig
Dombalagian, a professor at Tulane University Law School and a
former SEC attorney. That may not help the firm itself, he
added. &#8220;Under theories of vicarious liability, if you can find
Tourre liable, it&#8217;s going to be hard for Goldman to escape.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional Grilling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Blankfein arrives in Washington, he will find a panel
of lawmakers happily getting in touch with their prosecutorial
roots. Investigations subcommittee Chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.)
has been using his subprime probe to dig into the complexities
of both financial manipulation and human motivation. If
Blankfein argues that the buck stopped with Fab, Levin will
skewer him. He is not beholden to Goldman. In addition to
Blankfein and Tourre, he is expected to call Goldman executives
Craig Broderick, the chief risk officer, and David Viniar, the
CFO. One key theme will be inconsistencies between the public
record and what Goldman people were saying in private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convenient Red Ink &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One defense Blankfein may emphasize this week could
surprise people: Goldman says it got sheared on the Abacus deal.
Palm, the co-general counsel, said the firm lost more than $100
million, but the red ink looks awfully convenient. Goldman won&#8217;t
reveal the positions in its mortgage trading book, so there&#8217;s no
way to tell what&#8217;s real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Goldman seems vulnerable to attack, so does an element
of the SEC&#8217;s case -- the notion that Tourre misled ACA into
thinking Paulson had planned to place a bullish bet when the two
were negotiating which mortgages bonds to pick for the CDO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abacus transaction closed on April 26, 2007. By then it
was a matter of public record that Paulson had begun profiting
on credit derivatives that increased in value as subprime bonds
fell. On March 15, Bloomberg News reported that one of Paulson&#8217;s
startup credit funds had gained 67 percent in eight months. In a
letter to his funds&#8217; investors quoted by Bloomberg, Paulson
wrote: &#8220;We believe we are in the early stage of a correction in
this market and that the market will eventually implode.&#8221; The
article also quoted him as saying that bad loans made to the
riskiest borrowers would &#8220;skyrocket&#8221; and that &#8220;most, if not
all, of the independent originators will go bankrupt.&#8221; Even the
most basic due diligence should have made Paulson&#8217;s trading
strategy clear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changing Public Perception &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That article and others like it can be found with a Google
search. ACA and Paulson spent weeks negotiating which bonds
would be selected. If each knew the other&#8217;s intentions, that
knocks a hole in the idea that ACA got hustled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s a legal matter. What concerns Goldman this week is
politics and public relations. It knows how to make money and
how to defend those methods in court. What it hasn&#8217;t been very
good at is getting the world to see it the way it sees itself.
When Blankfein settles into his chair in Washington, he&#8217;s hoping
what he says will mark the beginning of a long, slow process of
turning that perception around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing may not be all bad. Before the SEC&#8217;s case hit, a
certain exuberance had returned to the markets. Big bonuses were
back, as was the hot pursuit of risky assets. The spectacle of
Blankfein being called upon to explain the actions of an
impetuous young man and his bosses should be the spur Wall
Street needs to start its own genuine reform process. If ever
there were a time to relearn commonsensical standards of
behavior and weed out the Fabs before the government comes
calling, this is it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gilbert Saiz, the former head of
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s European fuel-oil desk, plans to
start an energy hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vector Commodity Fund will be based in London and trade
crude oil and refined products, John Thompson, a partner at
marketer Energy Alpha Strategies, said by e-mail. Vector will
start in the &#8220;early summer,&#8221; Thompson wrote. Saiz, 34, will
run the fund and two other traders will join him, Thompson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Gil can replicate his success on the Goldman Sachs
trading floor in a hedge fund format then investors should
benefit from another potential source of uncorrelated returns,&#8221;
said Adam Taylor, a London-based assistant portfolio manager at
Liongate Capital Management, which invests in hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP GSCI Total Return Index of 24 raw materials, in
which energy has a 72 percent weighting, fell 0.9 percent in the
first quarter. Energy hedge funds lost 0.6 percent on average
during the period, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund

&lt;p&gt;Goldman will be the fund&#8217;s clearing broker and Saiz will
have a partner overseeing risk management, according to
Thompson. He declined to provide further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vector is seeking initial assets under management of $100
million and will cap the total at $600 million, according to a
marketing document obtained separately by Bloomberg. The fund
will trade futures, swaps and options in commodities including
crude, fuel oil and gasoline in markets from the U.S. Gulf Coast
to Singapore, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin-to-Equity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund&#8217;s margin-to-equity ratio, or trading capital held
at brokerages, generally won&#8217;t exceed 40 percent, the document
showed. While commodity funds usually have a ratio of 10 to 25
percent, they can exceed or go below that for short periods,
according to Dieter Kaiser, a director at Feri Institutional
Advisors GmbH in Bad Homburg, Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saiz worked for Goldman Sachs for more than a decade in
London and New York, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds are mostly private pools of capital whose
managers participate substantially in the profit from
speculation on whether the price of assets will rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led a jump
in the cost to protect bank bonds as federal prosecutors
investigate the firm to determine whether to pursue a criminal
fraud case, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Goldman Sachs increased the most
since the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s civil lawsuit
filing on April 16, as a federal review begins by the U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, said two people familiar with the matter,
who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on condition of
anonymity. Bank of America Corp. cut its rating on the shares to
&#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy,&#8221; citing the probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps on Goldman Sachs climbed 25.8 basis points to
157.4 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. Swaps on other
banks, including Morgan Stanley to Bank of America, also rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
rose 0.98 basis point to a mid-price of 90.31 basis points as of
10:47 a.m. in New York, according to Markit Group Ltd. The index
typically falls as investor confidence improves and rises as it
deteriorates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on Morgan Stanley rose 10.2 basis points to 162.7
basis points, CMA prices show. Contracts on Bank of America
climbed 8.3 basis points to 135.7, and swaps on JPMorgan Chase 
Co. increased 8 basis points to 82.6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. hired
Atanas Djumaliev, Deutsche Bank AG&#8217;s co-head of sales and
corporate coverage in Moscow, for its Russia debt business, two
people familiar with the move said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman also recruited Albert Sagiryan, a JPMorgan Chase 
Co. vice president for debt origination in Moscow, according to
the people, who declined to be identified before the new
positions have been made official. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wall Street firms are competing for bankers as Russia&#8217;s
economy recovers from its worst contraction on record. Companies
will probably sell a record 1 trillion rubles ($34 billion) of
domestic bonds this year, according to Trust Investment Bank and
ING Groep NV. Both UBS AG and Renaissance Capital forecast
Russian companies will raise $20 billion in initial public
offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman hired Christopher Barter to head its Russian office
on Jan. 29 and recruited former OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Tav Morgan to improve its commodities
business in the former Soviet Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiring Spree &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley hired Gergely Voros and Dmitry Avdeev as co-
heads of investment banking for Russia, replacing Yan Tavrovsky,
who left the bank earlier this year, according to a statement
April 27. Avdeev will resign as chief financial officer of
Russian oilfield service company Integra Group to return to
Morgan Stanley while Voros is London-based head of emerging
equity capital markets at the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse recruited five fixed-income specialists last
month, including three from Deutsche Bank AG, while Renaissance
Capital appointed Credit Suisse&#8217;s Nikolai Yukovich to run its
emerging-markets currency team. Otkritie Financial Corp., a
local brokerage part-owned by VTB Group, in March took on 18
people for its new debt and currency market units. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the 10th biggest arranger of Eurobonds
for Russian companies in 2007-2009, organizing sales by OAO
Gazprom, OAO Transneft and Russian Agricultural Bank, according
to Bloomberg data. The company missed out on winning a role on
Russia&#8217;s first international bond sale this month since 1989
after making the shortlist of 22 banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment and Djumaliev and Sagiryan
could not be reached for comment. JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was
downgraded to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at Bank of America Corp.
because federal prosecutors are weighing criminal fraud charges
against Wall Street&#8217;s most-profitable firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America also reduced its share-price estimate on
Goldman Sachs to $160 from $220, according to a report dated
today. The stock has sunk to $160.24 from $184.27 on April 15,
the day before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
announced a civil lawsuit alleging the New York-based bank
misled investors in a mortgage-linked investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating
transactions by Goldman Sachs to determine whether to pursue a
criminal fraud case, according to two people familiar with the
matter. The review, which lawyers say is common in such a high-
profile case, is being done by the U.S. attorney in Manhattan,
said the people, who weren&#8217;t authorized to comment and spoke on
condition of anonymity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We continue to believe that GS has long-term earnings
power beyond what is discounted in the share price,&#8221; Guy
Moszkowski, an analyst at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank
of America, wrote in a report sent to clients today. &#8220;However,
it is very difficult to see the shares making further progress
until the matter has been resolved.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. named
ICICI Bank Ltd.&#8217;s Sonjoy Chatterjee as managing director and co-
chief executive officer of its Indian operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L. Brooks Entwistle, who has helmed operations in India for
the last four years, will oversee the Indian unit with
Chatterjee, New York-based Goldman Sachs said in an e-mailed
statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. lender, which offers investment banking and
research services in India, is seeking a license for commercial
banking in the world&#8217;s second-fastest growing major economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs ranks 16th in managing share sales in India
this year, lagging behind rivals such as Citigroup Inc. and
Morgan Stanley, according to Bloomberg data. On advising clients
on mergers and acquisitions, it ranks 11th, behind Barclays
Plc&#8217;s investment bank and Standard Chartered Plc, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICICI Bank, based in Mumbai, ranked 11th on managing
share sales and wasn&#8217;t among the top 20 banks in takeover
advisory, the data show. Chatterjee had been an executive
director at the company since 1997. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s second-largest lender appointed Rajiv Sabharwal to
the board, according to a filing from the Mumbai-based bank to
the Bombay Stock Exchange today. Tushaar Shah was named as a
non-executive director, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, Marti Subrahmanyam and
Anupam Puri will complete eight years as non-executive directors
of ICICI Bank and step down May 3, ICICI said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is &#8220;no guarantee&#8221; the U.K.
will retain its AAA credit rating and the election campaign has
revealed little about what the next government will do to cut
the budget deficit, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a U.K. election next week, Goldman Sachs economists
Ben Broadbent and Adrian Paul said the U.K.&#8217;s prospects for
fiscal retrenchment, economic growth and interest rates look a
&#8220;little better&#8221; in general than Spain&#8217;s. Having a free-
floating exchange rate will also benefit the U.K., they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While that probably helps to explain why the U.K. has
retained its AAA so far, it is no guarantee that it will over
the future,&#8221; the London-based economists wrote in a note to
clients late yesterday. &#8220;All three rating agencies have
expressed concern about the existing government&#8217;s fiscal plans
and the election campaign has brought us precious little clarity
about what the next government will do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. ran a budget deficit of 11.5 percent of gross
domestic product last year and has a government debt of 68.1
percent of GDP, according to the EU&#8217;s statistics office. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Money matters, even to the
idealistic Millennial generation. The recession and job market
might be causing a shift in priorities among the next wave of
Millennials to enter the workforce, according to the latest
annual survey of college students conducted by Universum USA, a
research firm based in Stockholm with U.S. headquarters in
Philadelphia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey, which asks undergraduates to identify their
dream employers, found that more than 30 percent of the 56,900
students surveyed said the market success of a company was a
preferred attribute of an employer, up from 24 percent in 2009,
Bloomberg Businessweek reports on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attractive and exciting products and services also became a
higher priority for respondents, with 28 percent of them wanting
that in an employer in 2010, up from 21 percent in 2009. &#8220;I
think the economy does have some bearing on this year&#8217;s
numbers,&#8221; says Camille Kelly, vice president for employer
branding at Universum. &#8220;Market success was a lot more important
when it came to an attractive attribute for an employer, more so
than it was in the past.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-known organizations such as Google Inc., Walt Disney
Co., the FBI, Apple Inc. and Ernst  Young round out the top
five ideal employers in the 2010 survey, with Google taking the
top spot for the fourth consecutive year. &#8220;The surprise is that
there were (no surprises),&#8221; says Kelly. &#8220;When you look at the
top 10 employers, there weren&#8217;t any major jumps.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The common thread, she says, is that these companies have
lots of market success, and students seek employers that either
offer learning opportunities, cool products or services, or an
environment that will allow them to flourish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generational Reputation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millennials, perhaps more so than any other generation
besides the baby boomers, already have a reputation. Recent
reports suggest they lack a work ethic and rely too much on
parents, some of whom have been accused of calling employers on
behalf of their job-hunting sons and daughters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a positive note, Millennials are also known for their
interest in jobs that allow them to make a difference in the
world by having them perform community service or create
projects that support sustainability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survey suggests that perhaps the generation&#8217;s interest
in saving the world goes only so far. In 2009, 37 percent of
respondents said high ethical standards were an important
attribute in an employer, whereas 27 percent said the same in
2010. Only 32 percent of 2010 respondents said inspiring
management was important, compared with 41 percent in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green, or Whatever &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the survey results indicate that Millennials aren&#8217;t
all about good deeds and rainbows. Daniel Scott Gillespie, a
senior at Southern Methodist University&#8217;s Cox School of
Business, who is majoring in finance, says he and his friends
never talk about a company&#8217;s efforts to be green, although
everyone wants to work for a reputable company. &#8220;People are
just looking to find a job,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Most of my friends
still don&#8217;t have a job.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gillespie, who will be working for Orix USA in its
leveraged finance group after graduation next month, says the
problem his generation has is uncertainty. Many Millennials
can&#8217;t find work in a job market crowded with still-unemployed
graduates from the Class of 2009, he says, adding that many
expect to live with their parents after college. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such practical matters as financial stability have to
take precedence when times are tough, Millennials haven&#8217;t
completely given up on making a difference, nor do they expect
recruiters to ignore the world&#8217;s challenges. The U.S. State
Department, Peace Corps, Teach for America, National Institutes
of Health, and the American Cancer Society all made the top 20,
which speaks to undergraduates&#8217; desire to do good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I look for a company that has values that align with my
own,&#8221; says Catherine Soler, a sophomore at Notre Dame&#8217;s Mendoza
College of Business who will be interning at the New York office
of Deloitte in auditing. Soler was introduced to Deloitte, which
came in at No. 12 in the Universum ranking, when she
participated in its Maximum Impact program, which the company
bills as an &#8220;alternative spring break.&#8221; The program sent Soler
to Houston for a week to help to clean up after Hurricane Ike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shifting sentiment among Millennials has recruiters
changing their approach. For starters, every company must have a
significant online presence, because that&#8217;s how Millennials
communicate. Ernst  Young, which ranked fifth, is considered a
pioneer in recruiting online and was among the first to have a
Facebook page. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook Milieu &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the page has 40,000 fans, says Dan Black, the Americas
director of campus recruiting for Ernst  Young. The company
offers virtual roundtable discussions with members of the firm
and communicates via Twitter, too. &#8220;We also have several radio
stations on Pandora,&#8221; says Black, &#8220;because that&#8217;s where the
students are.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most successful recruiters are creating smaller, more
intimate events on campus. Microsoft, No. 11 on the list, hosts
Xbox competitions and Guitar Hero nights in addition to its
information sessions. Many companies, including Ernst  Young,
are giving students the opportunity to volunteer with them as a
way of getting to know the culture. Disney, says Universum&#8217;s
Kelly, has been among the best at having ambassadors talk up its
internship program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Perspective &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One employer after another will say this new group of
employees is also more globally minded than any before it and
opportunities abroad strike a chord. Both the Peace Corps, No.
8, and the State Department, No. 6, offer opportunities to learn
a foreign language and live and work overseas. &#8220;It&#8217;s a life
experience. It&#8217;s not a job,&#8221; says Luis E. Arreaga, director of
the office of recruiting, examination and employment at the
State Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, work-life balance has always been important to
Millennials. New employees are looking to have well-rounded
lives. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be committed to a job,&#8221; says Soler, the student
at Mendoza. &#8220;But I need an employer to realize that there are
other things I like to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to corporate social responsibility,
recruiters say Millennials want companies with a track record.
&#8220;They want to see action,&#8221; says Holly Paul, U.S. recruiting
leader for No. 10 PricewaterhouseCoopers. &#8220;We have to show them
we&#8217;re more than just talk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive
officer of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said a &#8220;callousness&#8221;
toward clients demonstrated in some e-mails released to the
public this week is unacceptable and doesn&#8217;t represent the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were some e-mails where some people were projecting
I would say, at best indifference, and at worst a callousness,&#8221;
Blankfein, 55, said in an interview on the &#8220;Charlie Rose&#8221;
television show last night, according to a transcript. While he
said those e-mails aren&#8217;t representative of the firm, &#8220;it&#8217;s
inexcusable if 10 people think that way or thought that way.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street firm that generates more
trading revenue than any other, has lost 21 percent of its
market value since it was sued on April 16 by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission over its sale of a mortgage-
linked security. It is also under criminal investigation by
federal prosecutors, said two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The firm is guiltless and this is a big preoccupation for
me and a big preoccupation for our management group,&#8221; Blankfein
said, according to the transcript. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, who has run the company since June 2006,
defended the firm&#8217;s actions this week under interrogation from a
U.S. Senate subcommittee, which released 901 pages of documents
including e-mail that showed employees disparaging securities
they were offering to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the complex derivatives the firm developed and
traded had a &#8220;social utility,&#8221; he said, while others may have
gone too far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hindsight&#8217; Regrets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the issuants themselves are too complicated, become
too illiquid as it turns out that they were, notwithstanding the
purpose you may say, &#8216;Let&#8217;s not do those things,&#8217;&#8221; Blankfein
said, according to the transcript. &#8220;So in hindsight I wish we
had not done some of those things.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock fell 9.4 percent yesterday to $145.20, in New
York trading, its biggest drop since the SEC brought the suit on
April 16. The company has lost $21 billion in market value since
the case was filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said Goldman Sachs will survive and &#8220;thrive&#8221; in
the future. He said he would step down if his leadership damaged
the firm, calling that scenario unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here,&#8221; he said, according to the transcript.
&#8220;That&#8217;s my expectation and that&#8217;s my duty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs must improve communication with the public,
Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge challenge, I would just say it&#8217;s my
deficiency,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We can&#8217;t exist in the current state
that we&#8217;re in and we understand that. So we have a lot of work
to do.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stunning News &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;News of the SEC suit came as a shock, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was in the middle of the morning, it was stunning,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I saw it over the screen. I read it, and my -- it
just -- my stomach turned over. I couldn&#8217;t -- I was stunned.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein defended the role that Goldman Sachs, and Wall
Street as a whole, plays in making markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You could call it a casino, but if it is, it&#8217;s a very
socially important casino,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On congressional efforts to strengthen financial
regulation, Blankfein said he supports many aspects of the bill
proposed by Senator Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat.
The so-called Volcker Rule, which would require banks to exit
the business of trading for their own account, or proprietary
trading, would eliminate about 10 percent of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
revenue, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are aspects of the Volcker rule that go too far,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;I work very hard for the 10 percent of our revenue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview to be aired tomorrow on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Fareed
Zakaria GPS,&#8221; Blankfein said parts of the Volcker rule &#8220;are
warranted&#8221; and he &#8221;could&#8221; support them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it makes institutions safer, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But if it makes institutions forgo revenue opportunities, that
fact by itself is bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contributing to Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which reported record earnings last year
even as it repaid $10 billion of taxpayer bailout funds,
inadvertently helped cause the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression, Blankfein said in an interview with National
Public Radio on April 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Some of the things that Goldman Sachs did contributed to
the crisis,&#8221; Blankfein told NPR, according to a transcript of
that interview. &#8220;So, for example, Goldman Sachs did
transactions for companies that involved lending them a lot of
money, maybe too much money. We financed real estate that was
probably overleveraged.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein told CNN the firm must &#8220;regain the trust of the
public&#8221; to survive. &#8220;We have no choice,&#8221; Blankfein said,
according to a transcript of the interview. &#8220;We can&#8217;t survive
without people thinking well of us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the CNN interview, Blankfein also said former Treasury
Secretary Henry Paulson called him during the financial crisis
and that Paulson was being &#8220;very, very careful to be
appropriate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said, &#8220;the conversations would be &#8216;What are you
seeing? What are you hearing? What are your clients saying? How
are the markets?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson had been head of Goldman Sachs before going to the
Treasury Department. Paulson isn&#8217;t connected to the hedge fund
by the same name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman
Warren Buffett said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shouldn&#8217;t be blamed
for losses suffered by clients who invested in mortgage bets at
the center of a fraud suit filed by regulators against the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett said he stands behind the bank, which was sued last
month by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for
misleading clients who made wagers on home loans. The regulator
said that firms including ABN Amro Bank NV weren&#8217;t told when
they bet on collateralized debt obligations from Goldman Sachs
that the hedge fund led by John Paulson picked mortgages in the
investment and was betting on them to fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t see what difference it makes if it were Paulson
on the other side of the deal or Goldman Sachs or Berkshire
Hathaway,&#8221; Buffett said today at his company&#8217;s annual meeting
in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett said it &#8220;wasn&#8217;t so obvious&#8221; when
the investments were sold in 2007 that the housing market would
collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffett, who is also Berkshire&#8217;s chief executive officer,
invested $5 billion in Goldman Sachs in 2008 and has praised the
bank for its risk management. Berkshire makes $500 million a
year in interest on its Goldman Sachs preferred stock. The
warrants Buffett negotiated as part of the deal give Berkshire
the option to buy $5 billion of common stock for $115 a share.
The shares closed at $145.20 yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I did not hold it against Goldman Sachs that an
allegation has been made,&#8221; Buffett said. He said he&#8217;d review
the case further &#8220;if it leads to something more serious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Own Decision &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Carl Levin, who led a subcommittee that questioned
Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein on April 27, accused the bank
of conflicts of interest for selling mortgage bets to clients as
it cut its own housing exposure. Buffett said today that
Berkshire has four decades of experience with Goldman Sachs and
no expectation that the bank would offer investment advice or
disclose its own stance on trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in the business of making our own decisions,&#8221;
Buffett said. &#8220;They do not owe us a divulgence of their
position.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. must &#8220;regain
the trust of the public&#8221; to survive, Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd Blankfein said in an interview on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;Fareed Zakaria
GPS.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no choice,&#8221; Blankfein said, according to a
transcript of the interview, which will be broadcast tomorrow.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t survive without people thinking well of us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm is the target of a Securities and Exchange
Commission lawsuit that revolves around whether it should have
told investors that a hedge fund, Paulson  Co., helped select
the underlying securities for a collateralized debt obligation
and then bet against it. Paulson  Co. wasn&#8217;t accused of any
wrongdoing in the matter, which dates back to 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, Blankfein said &#8220;I could&#8221; support the
Volcker rule, which would place restrictions on investments
banks make for their internal accounts. He said parts of the
proposal, by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, &#8220;are
warranted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it makes institutions safer, that&#8217;s good,&#8221; Blankfein
said of the plan, which has been endorsed by President Barack
Obama. &#8220;But if it make institutions forgo revenue
opportunities, that fact by itself is bad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also said Goldman &#8220;made a contribution&#8221; to the
market bubble. &#8220;How did we make the contribution?&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We were a lender. We lent money to companies&#8221; and &#8220;real
estate ventures that had too much leverage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
