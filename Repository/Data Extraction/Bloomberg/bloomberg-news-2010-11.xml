<p>Abu Dhabi shortlisted Exxon Mobil
Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Occidental Petroleum Corp. as
potential partners to develop the $10 billion Shah natural-gas
project, two people familiar with the plan said. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi Gas Development Co., owned by Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co., known also as Adnoc, is pressing ahead with Shah after
the original foreign partner, ConocoPhillips, withdrew from the
project in April. The people declined to be identified by name
because the decision hasn''t been publicly announced. </p>
<p>The shortlist comes at a time when international companies
have limited opportunities to invest in gas projects in a region
dominated by state-owned counterparts. By winning the Shah
contract, Exxon Mobil, Shell or Occidental would strengthen
their presence in the United Arab Emirates, the third-biggest
oil producer in OPEC and holder of the fourth-largest gas
reserves in the Middle East. </p>
<p>For the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi, the selection of three
candidate partners marks a step toward the emirate''s goal of
producing sour, or high-sulfur, gas from Shah as fuel for power
plants facing surging demand for electricity. </p>
<p>This is an extremely vital project to be developed for
Abu Dhabi''s future that''s specifically to do with gas demand for
the power sector, said Thaddeus Malesa, an analyst in Dubai
with PFC Energy, a consulting firm based in Washington. </p>
<p>Supply Gap </p>
<p>The U.A.E. now imports gas from neighboring Qatar, and it
wants to develop nuclear power to help meet local electricity
demand, which is expected to double by 2020, according to
government studies. Construction of the first nuclear plants
won''t begin until 2017, creating a gap in the supply of fuel for
the emirate''s power stations that officials hope to fill partly
with gas from Shah. </p>
<p>By producing gas locally, Abu Dhabi hopes to save on
imported fuel and avoid the more expensive stop-gap solution of
burning crude in its power stations, as Saudi Arabia does,
Malesa said. </p>
<p>Shah poses a technical challenge because toxic hydrogen
sulfide must be separated from the raw gas. The sulfur must then
be converted into a solid and transported 250 kilometers (155
miles) to be loaded on ships and exported. </p>
<p>Shell''s Abu Dhabi country chief, John Barry, declined to
comment yesterday when asked whether the Anglo-Dutch oil company
was on the Shah gas shortlist. Hatem Shaker, an Abu Dhabi-based
vice president of public and government affairs for Irving,
Texas-based Exxon Mobil, declined to comment. </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips Withdrew </p>
<p>An Occidental public relations official in Abu Dhabi and
spokesman Richard Kline at the company''s Los Angeles
headquarters also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi originally chose ConocoPhillips for the project
in July 2008, after considering competing bids from Shell and
Exxon Mobil, among others. ConocoPhillips withdrew after
announcing last October that it planned to divest from some
assets and intensify its focus on exploring for oil and gas. </p>
<p>Shell has already studied some of the deposits at Shah and
is the most knowledgeable of the three shortlisted companies
about the geology there, Malesa said. He added that Shell would
probably be Abu Dhabi''s favorite as a partner. </p>
<p>That''s who they want to work with on Shah, he said.
But I think Shell are worried about what kind of returns
they''ll get on the project. </p>
<p>Bridging Fuel </p>
<p>Shell''s Middle East Vice President for new business Mounir Bouaziz said today in Abu Dhabi that his company had the
necessary technology to produce what he called contaminated gas. </p>
<p>Gas is a key bridging fuel for alleviating some of the
power crises we see in the region and in creating a low carbon
energy source for countries here, Bouaziz said. </p>
<p>Occidental, Shell and Exxon are all trying to intensify
their gas business in the Gulf, in part because opportunities
elsewhere in the Middle East are scarce. Gas projects in Algeria
have been delayed, Iran is off limits to Western companies due
to economic sanctions, and Iraq is still considered a dangerous
place to operate. </p>
<p>Occidental owns 24.5 percent of Dolphin Energy Ltd., an Abu
Dhabi state-controlled venture transporting gas from Qatar to
the U.A.E. Exxon Mobil is the largest investor in Qatar''s plants
that liquefy natural gas for transport by ship. Shell is
developing a $19 billion gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar and has a
venture with state-owned Saudi Aramco to explore for gas in
southern Saudi Arabia. </p>
<p>We have shortlisted three companies for Shah, said
Mohammed Sahoo, chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi Gas
Industries Ltd., another Adnoc unit, speaking in Abu Dhabi
today. We are going ahead with the project. He declined to
name the companies. </p>
<p>Shares Advance </p>
<p>Occidental shares rose 2.1 percent to $80.29, Exxon gained
0.7 percent to $66.97 and Shell increased 1.35 percent to 23.62
euros by 4.17 p.m. London time. </p>
<p>The Shah project, scheduled for completion by the third
quarter of 2014, targets processing 1 billion cubic feet of sour
gas into 540 million cubic feet a day of fuel. It may also
process 4,400 tons a day of natural-gas liquids, 35,000 barrels
a day of condensates and 9,200 tons a day of sulfur. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts lowered
their estimate for the cost to sellers of repurchasing soured
U.S. mortgages to as much as $90 billion from a range that went
as high as $120 billion. </p>
<p>JPMorgan analysts led by John Sim and Ed Reardon removed
some potential losses from their previous forecast to account
for issuers including New Century Financial Corp. and Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. having failed, they wrote. They also
fine-tuned their assumptions for how successful investors may be
in winning fights over loans underlying so-called private-label,
or non-agency, mortgage bonds, which lack government-backed
guarantees. </p>
<p>Future losses from repurchases of home loans whose quality
failed to meet sellers'' promises will probably be $40 billion,
the analysts wrote in an Oct. 29 report covering debt
securitized from 2005 through 2007. On Oct. 15, they forecast
likely losses of $55 billion to as much as $120 billion in a
stress scenario. </p>
<p>The private-label market typically has the burden to
prove, with respect to any given loan, that a breach of a
representation or warranty has materially and adversely impacted
the value of the loan, the New York-based analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Mortgage-bond analysts at Bank of America Corp., which
along with JPMorgan is among the lenders being targeted by
debtholders, said in a report that remaining repurchase losses
may total $46 billion. That figure assumes investors in private-
label securities seek buybacks on 50 percent of loans that went
delinquent in the first two years and succeed with 50 percent of
those. </p>
<p>$25.1 Billion </p>
<p>Assuming the bondholders win 25 percent of requests, those
New York-based analysts, led by Chris Flanagan, wrote in an Oct.
29 report that losses likely will total $25.1 billion. Their
figures also excluded amounts potentially owed by defunct
originators and also included mortgages sold to or guaranteed by
government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. </p>
<p>The latest JPMorgan report included an estimate that
mortgage-bond investors will seek so-called putbacks on about 25
percent of defaulted mortgages. Because investors will need to
demonstrate that misstatements about the quality of loans
inflated the debts'' apparent value, the analysts said they
adjusted the odds they used for how successful putback attempts
will be based on how quickly mortgages went bad. </p>
<p>The analysts assumed that investors'' success rate will be
50 percent for loans that went delinquent in their first 12
months, 40 percent for mortgages whose borrowers stopped paying
between one and two years, and 30 percent for loans with later
delinquencies, according to their report. </p>
<p>They are also now assuming higher success rates for
mortgages whose borrowers were required to provide full
documentation of their income and assets, because loans made
with less paperwork were stated as such, they said. </p>
<p>Even if buyers claim that fraud was more rampant for
limited/no doc loans, they will bear the burden of proving that
fraud was committed, the analysts wrote. And even if fraud
could be proved, not all deals included representations with
respect to fraud and not all representations are the same. </p>

<p>Investors should buy the Australian
dollar against its U.S. counterpart on expectation that the
Federal Reserve will step up Treasury purchases after its Nov.
2-3 meeting, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>We expect the dollar''s decline to resume should the Fed
remove uncertainty and deliver a $500 billion slug of asset
purchases next week, Paul Meggyesi, a managing director of
currency strategy at JPMorgan wrote in a research report dated
Oct. 29 and sent to journalists today. The domestic case for
further tightening in Australia is largely unanswerable. </p>
<p>Investors should buy the so-called Aussie at 97.77 U.S.
cents and abandon the trade if it weakens to 95.1 cents,
Meggyesi said. No estimate of the Aussie''s future value against
the dollar was given. </p>
<p>JPMorgan also recommended buying the euro, the Swedish
krona and the Korean won against the dollar. </p>
<p>The Australian dollar was 0.5 percent stronger at 98.81
U.S. cents as of 12:18 p.m. in London. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, reported third-quarter profit that topped analyst
estimates after price increases and workforce reductions helped
counter declining sales of the cholesterol pill Lipitor. </p>
<p>Profit excluding the costs for its purchase of Wyeth last
year and other items was 54 cents a share, beating the 51 cents
average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
income fell 70 percent to $866 million, or 11 cents a share, on
acquisition charges and costs for an asbestos lawsuit, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. </p>
<p>Revenue rose 39 percent to $16.2 billion after adding
medicines from Wyeth, missing analyst estimates by 2.9 percent.
Lipitor sales declined 11 percent to $2.5 billion as generic
copies were introduced in Canada and Spain. Pfizer is counting
on Wyeth products to offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor
faces competition from cheaper copies in the U.S. next year. </p>
<p>Pfizer has made real progress with cost synergies from
the Wyeth deal, said Marc Goodman, an analyst with UBS
Securities LLC, in a research note. Although top-line numbers
missed the mark, we think investors should like the strong
efforts in cost cutting coupled with increased 2010 earnings-
per-share guidance. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and Total SA are seeking to extend contracts for producing
oil in Abu Dhabi, company executives said. Japan agreed to lend
$3 billion to the sheikhdom in anticipation of new contracts. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil and Shell are concession-holders in Abu Dhabi
Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, the onshore unit of state-owned
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. also known as Adco, until 2014. Abu
Dhabi holds more than 90 percent of crude in the United Arab
Emirates, one of the few Middle East nations that allow foreign
companies to explore and produce oil within its borders. </p>
<p>We are working to extend our concessions, which expire
shortly, Mark Nolan, Exxon Mobil''s vice president of
production in the Middle East and Russia, said today at a
conference in Abu Dhabi. We are really looking forward to
negotiating a great future. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi is planning to spend as much as $60 billion over
the next decade to expand its oil and gas industry, including
boosting crude production capacity to 3.5 million barrels a day
from about 2.8 million now. Adnoc, as the parent company is
known, owns 60 percent of Adco with Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total,
BP Plc and Partex Oil  Gas holding the rest. Adco plans to
raise onshore output by 400,000 barrels a day to 1.8 million. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil wants to use proprietary technology to help
raise output at deposits in the concession area. The company
would prefer to operate the fields alone rather than in the
current partnership, a change that would enable Exxon Mobil to
use its new technologies without having to share them with
commercial rivals. </p>
<p>Unique Relationship'' </p>
<p>When you have a unique relationship, we can openly share
that technology, Exxon''s Nolan said. When you''re in a
competitive environment, it''s more difficult. </p>
<p>Persian Gulf oil producers are seeking to increase capacity
on expectations that demand will recover from the global
economic slowdown. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with a production
capacity of 12 million barrels a day, doesn''t allow foreign oil
companies in its upstream oil industry. </p>
<p>We''ve been here since 1939, John Barry, Shell''s Abu
Dhabi country chief, said today. I sincerely hope we are
involved in Adnoc''s plans in the future. It is much too early to
be talking about a renewal. It is for Adnoc to express its
desired structure. </p>
<p>Total is confident it will continue to be a partner
with Abu Dhabi in developing the Persian Gulf emirate''s oil
reserves after its concession expires, Jean Luc Guiziou, Total''s
vice president for production in the Middle East, said Oct. 31. </p>
<p>Partnership </p>
<p>Adnoc and government-run Japan Bank for International
Cooperation signed an accord on an 11 billion-dirham ($3
billion) loan, Emirates News Agency reported today. </p>
<p>Japan Bank signed a memorandum of understanding with Abu
Dhabi, which has the objective to mutually recognize that the
grant of new concessions to Japanese entities and the renewal of
existing concessions involving Japanese entities are significant
objectives of the JBIC mandate, the news agency said. </p>
<p>Japan Oil Development Co., a unit of Japan''s biggest energy
explorer Inpex Corp., will see its stake in Abu Dhabi''s Zakum
Development Co. expire later this decade. Zakum Development
plans a $15 billion artificial islands project to boost offshore
production by about 40 percent to 750,000 barrels a day by 2018
from the Upper Zakum oil field. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. aims to
become one of the top five underwriters of high-yield debt
because that''s more profitable than selling bonds issued by
less-risky borrowers, said a report by CreditSights Inc. </p>
<p>David Hendler, the New York-based analyst, wrote the report
after a meeting with Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar as well as Dane Holmes and Heather Miner from investor
relations. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment on the report. </p>
<p>In contrast to investment-grade debt, high-yield debt
underwriting tends to generate wider margins and more attractive
fees, Hendler wrote in the note today. As such, the company
indicated that it aims to be a top five high-yield debt
underwriter. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which makes more money than any bank from
trading, ranks sixth among managers of high-yield debt sales
worldwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The last
time Goldman Sachs was in the top five was in 2007, when the
firm ranked third after Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
the data show. </p>
<p>High-yield bond sales have reached a record $303 billion so
far this year, which already exceeds any prior year''s total,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan and Bank of
America Corp., the second-biggest and biggest U.S. banks by
assets respectively, are ranked first and second in managing
global sales of high-yield bonds this year, the data show.
Credit Suisse Group AG, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank AG are the
other banks in the top five this year. </p>
<p>Takeover Advice </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is focusing its investment-banking efforts on
takeover advice and equity underwriting, Hendler''s note said.
Goldman Sachs is the top adviser on mergers and acquisitions
announced so far this year as well as on global equity
offerings, according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>The firm played down its reliance on revenue from
proprietary trading, or making bets with its own money,
according to Hendler''s note. Those activities will be prohibited
under the new Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law. </p>
<p>The company noted that its business model is not so new
and that during the past three years it had gradually minimized
its proprietary trading operations and illiquid assets, the
note said. So while proprietary trading could be viewed as a
nice-to-have'' functionality, it is not a must have'' for its
client-focused businesses. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said the investment banking and capital
markets industry could be hampered because of slow economic
growth in the largest and most developed markets, and so the
firm''s plan is to seek growth opportunities in emerging
economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and Korea,
Hendler wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs seeks to rank among the leaders in market
share of these markets across all major categories including
equity, MA, higher-margin debt and other investment-banking
activities, Hendler wrote. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is the subject
of an investigation to determine if it failed to tell investors
in a financial product linked to subprime mortgages that hedge
fund Magnetar Capital helped select the underlying assets before
betting against them, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing
whether JPMorgan allowed Magnetar to choose assets for a $1.1
billion collateralized debt obligation known as Squared,
according to the person, who declined to be identified because
the investigation isn''t public. JPMorgan lost about $880 million
on the deal, according to ProPublica, which reported the
investigation yesterday. </p>
<p>The inquiry is part of a broader investigation of how Wall
Street firms bundled and sold mortgage-linked investments as the
housing market declined in 2007, contributing to more than $1.8
trillion in losses and writedowns worldwide. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. agreed to pay $550 million in July to resolve SEC claims it
misled investors by failing to disclose hedge fund Paulson 
Co.''s role in selecting underlying assets for a subprime-linked
investment. </p>
<p>We, like other firms, have received inquiries from the
SEC related to collateralized obligations, JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said. We are cooperating fully with
these inquiries. </p>
<p>The SEC has made similar inquiries at firms including
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp., according to company
filings. SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment. </p>
<p>Magnetar did not select the assets for the Squared
transaction or require that any specific assets be put into the
transaction, spokesman Steven Lipin said in a statement. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. Vice Chairman
Steven Black will leave the firm in early 2011, about a year
into a three-year commitment announced in January. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told employees in an e-
mail today that Black, whom he''s known for 30 years, informed
him of the departure, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg
News. Dimon told employees Jan. 28 that Black agreed to keep
working with global clients for at least three years, according
to an internal memo at the time. </p>
<p>He is one of the finest and most capable executives I
have ever met, Dimon said in today''s message. He has always
impressed me with his tremendous dedication to the firm, his
candor and his strong character. Dealbreaker.com reported the
memo earlier today. </p>
<p>Dimon replaced Black and Bill Winters, who jointly ran the
investment bank since 2004, with Jes Staley last year. Winters,
49, was fired, and Black, 58, was named the unit''s executive
chairman. Black lost all of his operational duties in January
when he was promoted to vice chairman of the entire bank. </p>
<p>The transition to Jes Staley as CEO of the investment
bank has gone smoothly and quickly, and Steve has said that he''s
ready to move on to a new role serving clients across the
firm, Dimon said in the Jan. 28 memo. </p>
<p>Black met Dimon, 54, in the mid 1980s when Black was at
Smith Barney, before the brokerage firm merged with Salomon
Brothers and later became part of Citigroup Inc. He was not
immediately available for comment. Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan, confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Staley, 53, joined JPMorgan in 1979. He started in
investment banking on the Brazil desk, later running JPMorgan''s
equity and capital markets group as well as its asset management
division. </p>

<p>Singapore Exchange''s A$8.1 billion ($7.9 billion) bid for
ASX Ltd. might not go through amid an outcry from Australian
lawmakers. It almost doesn''t matter. The point is that fast-
growing and cash-rich Asia is about to go shopping in ways that
might shock the biggest developed economies. </p>
<p>This transaction is full of chutzpah. Singapore''s stock
market is half the size of Australia''s and the deal looks
expensive. The real issue is ambition. Singapore is clearly
prepared to spend big to get economies of scale that don''t come
naturally. Expect more of this dynamic in Asia -- even from
smaller countries that get little attention globally. </p>
<p>How will the West respond when China, Japan and India go on
a mergers-and-acquisitions tear? And those are just Asia''s three
biggest economies. Executives from Seattle to London should also
expect more phone calls from acquisitive companies in South
Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and sovereign wealth fund
managers everywhere. </p>
<p>Next Wave </p>
<p>China has been scooping up energy assets around the globe,
and has $2.6 trillion of reserves to accelerate the campaign. It
seeks to leapfrog over the years needed to build domestic
corporate powerhouses. In today''s world, it''s easier to buy a
chunk of International Business Machines Corp. than create and
cultivate brands over time. As the yuan rises, tech leaders like
Nokia Oyj or Motorola Inc. become cheaper for mainland
executives. Why censor Google Inc. when you can just own it? </p>
<p>The next wave of globalization features developing nations
buying the crown jewels of developed ones, and it will be messy.
In 2005, the U.S. Congress freaked out when China''s CNOOC Ltd.
bid for oil company Unocal Corp. and scuttled the deal. Just
wait until China sets its sights on Boeing Co., Microsoft Corp.
or Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman Envy </p>
<p>This last name has long been coveted in Asia. Government
officials in Tokyo and Seoul crave having globally known, savvy
and profitable financial leaders. That tends to be code for
having their own Goldman. Now, Asia could just buy the real
thing. Well, try to at least. </p>
<p>It''s hard to believe developed-market lawmakers would let
many household names fall easily into Asian hands. Creative
attempts would be made to explain why Pacific Investment
Management Co. being acquired by foreigners poses a national-
security threat. Or why Apple Inc. or cable news network CNN
must remain American concerns. </p>
<p>Never mind how these arguments might run afoul of World
Trade Organization rules. The next few years will see a
disorienting flurry of takeover bids from Brasilia to Beijing,
putting politicians in unprecedented positions. Nationalistic
tendencies will collide with globalization as never before. </p>
<p>Singapore helped prove the point that Asia has money at a
time when others don''t. Its investment firms in recent years
took stakes in Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Barclays Plc and others,
shoring up some of capitalism''s biggest names. Bidding for
Australia''s ASX is the next logical step and a reminder that
Singapore''s long game is worth watching. </p>
<p>Bet on Gambling </p>
<p>Take casinos, which are suddenly the rage in conservative
Singapore. The government realized it had to let its hair down
to net more of the tourism dollars flowing elsewhere in Asia.
Welcoming casino-resorts run by Genting Singapore Plc and Las
Vegas Sands Corp. was a gamble that is clearly working. So was
revamping downtown to host Formula One races. Tourist arrivals
are exploding, and other Asian capitals are racing to emulate
Singapore''s success. </p>
<p>Singapore is working to reinvent itself as a biotechnology
hub with reasonably liberal immigration laws to feed its
development. Its transparent financial system has been a magnet
for hedge funds setting up shop in Asia. The ASX bid is
recognition that Singapore can''t grow much beyond its domestic
market and must look outward. </p>
<p>Opportunities Abound </p>
<p>Asia wants to avoid Japan''s arrogant and ill-considered
purchases during the bubble years. Buying Rockefeller Center and
the Pebble Beach golf course didn''t work out so well for
investors. Officials and executives in Singapore, Beijing, New
Delhi and Seoul must avoid the temptation for such vanity deals. </p>
<p>Opportunities abound, though. Several governments are
sitting on hundreds of billions of reserves and companies are
hoarding cash. Add the desire to grow economies and corporate
balance sheets and you have a clear recipe for expansion -- and
a huge one as Asia floods markets with more equity than ever
amid booming demand for initial public offerings. </p>
<p>This shopping spree will shake up the global power balance
like rarely before. Perhaps nowhere is this huge shift more
apparent than in tiny Singapore. </p>

<p>Atlantis Resources Corp., an ocean-
current turbine maker backed by Morgan Stanley, plans to expand
in China, India and South Korea after winning a bid in the U.K.
to build the world''s largest tidal-power project. </p>
<p>Atlantis Resources may start building a 50 megawatt tidal
farm by 2012 in Gujarat, a western Indian state, and conduct
commercial-scale trials in South Korea, Timothy Cornelius, the
chief executive officer, said an interview today. </p>
<p>China''s the next big market for tidal energy, Cornelius,
34, said in Singapore at the Clean Energy conference. It has
the most natural tidal resources in the world and can be home to
more than 1,000 megawatts of tidal energy. </p>
<p>Global production of electricity harnessing the ocean waves
may climb ten-fold to as much as 300 megawatts in the next
couple of years, said Cornelius, a former submersible engineer
who splits his time between Singapore and London. The potential
to produce marine power economically is about 24,000 megawatts,
he said. It costs 2.5 million pounds ($4.01 million) per
megawatt for a minimum 200 megawatt-tidal project, he said. </p>
<p>The Singapore-registered Atlantis Resources, which
outsources turbine making, is seeking a global manufacturing
site once tidal energy expands, Cornelius said. Producing
turbines in China can halve costs for Atlantis, which has been
approached by Chinese companies, he said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, International Power Plc and Atlantis
Resources won a contract to develop a tidal power project in
waters off northern Scotland. The project, if it receives
permits necessary for construction, could eventually generate
400 megawatts of electricity, the equivalent needed to power
400,000 homes, according to a statement on Oct. 27. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
12-month target for Hong Kong''s Hang Seng Index to 29,000,
saying the city has the most to gain from extra liquidity
released by quantitative easing programs and China''s growth. </p>
<p>Hong Kong will benefit most from a capital relocation away
from developed to emerging markets, Goldman analysts led by
Kinger Lau wrote in a report today. Inflation and low economic
growth are reducing the allure of developed-market assets, the
analysts said. Goldman analysts forecast in December the Hang
Seng Index may reach about 27,000 by the end of 2010. The gauge
climbed 2 percent to 24,132.38 as of today''s trading break at
12:30 p.m. local time. </p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to announce a plan today
to purchase a further $500 billion of long-term securities to
stimulate the economy in a program known as QE2, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>We suspect the resulting liquidity impact could go beyond
many investors'' expectations, the analysts wrote. The
overwhelming importance of China to the growth in Hong Kong may
mask the unfolding trend of gravitational attraction of
international capital. </p>
<p>Easy liquidity and Hong Kong''s stable regulatory
environment make the city''s real estate market attractive, and
values, which are at 13-year highs, are likely to appreciate,
the report said. Property oriented stocks provided a better
investment option than the physical market, they said. </p>
<p>Asset Bubble </p>
<p>Cheap borrowing costs are driving asset prices higher in
the city, and Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive
Officer Norman Chan said Oct. 18 that a housing bubble poses the
biggest risk to financial stability in Asia. Hong Kong''s
government has introduced higher down payment ratios since
August and pledged to increase land supply to cool the city''s
property market, where values have jumped 50 percent since the
start of 2009. </p>
<p>Emerging economies may use currency appreciation and
temporary capital controls to cope with money inflows sparked by
U.S. monetary easing, Joseph Yam, former head of the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority, said in a speech in Beijing today. </p>
<p>Also reaping gains from loose monetary policy would be Hong
Kong''s financial sector, which is already benefiting from
China''s program of yuan liberalization, the Goldman analysts
said. </p>
<p>A combination of strong domestic growth and abundant
global liquidity is how we would describe the investment thesis
for Hong Kong, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Property Stocks </p>
<p>The MSCI Hong Kong Index offers a better proxy for Hong
Kong growth than the Hang Seng Index, for which China stocks
make up 56 percent of market capitalization, the analysts said.
They raised their forecast for the MSCI gauge to 14,000 from
12,200. </p>
<p>The analysts said Hong Kong property stocks such as Sun
Hung Kai Properties Ltd., Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and MTR
Corp. would benefit from liquidity-driven real estate inflation. </p>
<p>Financial stocks such as Bank of China Ltd. and Hong Kong
Exchanges  Clearing Ltd. were well positioned to take advantage
of further liberalization of the yuan, the analysts said, giving
the two stocks a buy recommendation. </p>

<p>The cost of protecting debt issued by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dropped to the lowest in six months as
investors bet banks will benefit from a divided Congress and the
Federal Reserve plans to buy Treasuries. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the New York-based firm declined
8.6 basis points to 115.4 at 4:30 p.m. in New York, according to
data provider CMA. That''s the lowest since April 15, the day
before the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
for fraud. </p>
<p>Contracts on the debt have declined from as high as 228.5
basis points on May 6. Goldman Sachs settled the SEC''s complaint
for $550 million in July, the largest penalty the agency has
ever levied against a Wall Street firm. The Republican gains in
the Nov. 2 congressional elections combined with Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke''s $600 billion bond-buying program are boosting
the banking sector, Societe Generale''s Michael Reiner said. </p>
<p>Goldman has solid earnings power and also stands to
benefit, along with the rest of the sector, from a less
stringent regulatory environment, said Reiner, a New York-
based credit strategist with the bank. </p>
<p>Contracts on Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. fell 12 basis points to 169.5 and those on
JPMorgan Chase  Co. fell 6.3 basis points to 85.7, CMA data
show. The cost to protect Citigroup Inc.''s debt decreased 6
basis points to 135.5, and on that of San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo  Co. eased 9 basis points to 101.4, according to CMA.
Swaps on Morgan Stanley declined 11 basis points to 151.9, CMA
data show. </p>
<p>Tame Earnings </p>
<p>These large banks are not operating using the same
leverage, Adrian Miller, fixed-income strategist at Miller
Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mailed
message. Hence the earnings growth will be tame relative to
the pre-crash days. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs climbed $3.76, or 2.3 percent, to $166.39, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That''s 10 percent off
the highest level in 2010 prior to the suit. </p>
<p>Swaps on Goldman Sachs debt, which typically rise as
investor confidence deteriorates, soared 34 basis points and
shares dropped 12.8 percent on April 16. The SEC accused the
firm of defrauding investors in a CDO linked to home loans by
concealing that Paulson  Co., a New York-based hedge fund,
picked components of the CDO and bet it would collapse. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
dropped 5.3 basis points to a mid-price of 86.1 basis points,
also the lowest since April 15, according to index administrator
Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>Retailers Beat Estimates </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings decreased 4.2 basis points to 94.9, and
the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps on 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 23.6
basis points to 433.3, Markit prices show. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Limited Brands Inc. declined 19.3
basis points to 163.1, the lowest since May, CMA data show,
after the clothing retailer reported third-quarter profit that
beat the average analyst estimate. Contracts on Saks Inc.
dropped 54.2 basis points to 511.9, the biggest decline in
almost six months, the data show, following the luxury
retailer''s report that October same-store sales increased 8.1
percent, beating the 3.6 percent estimate. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.
climbed the most in seven weeks after Canada blocked BHP
Billiton Ltd.''s $40 billion hostile bid for the world''s largest
fertilizer producer. The swaps jumped 11.3 basis points to 107.7
basis points, CMA data show. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point, 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. today starts selling
Kinect, a device that lets consumers play video games with their
bodies, to help it lure casual gamers and add years to the life
of its Xbox 360 gaming console. </p>
<p>Kinect, shaped like a flat, black box, tracks a player''s
movement and voice and costs $149.99 by itself or starting at
$299.99 when purchased with an Xbox 360 console. Microsoft
yesterday boosted its forecast for Kinect sales this year to 5
million units from 3 million after the device sold out in pre-
sales at retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Best Buy Co. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is depending on
Kinect to catch Nintendo Co., which pioneered the motion-sensing
gaming market with its Wii controller, and Sony Corp., whose
Move controller hit stores in September. The product is also
designed to help Microsoft goose sales of the aging Xbox 360,
released in 2005, and improve margins of a unit that lost about
$8 billion before reaching profitability in 2008. </p>
<p>It''s a very intuitive and innovative product, said Gregg Moskowitz, an analyst at Cowen  Co. in New York, who has an
outperform rating on Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft.
It''s not ideal for every video game, but it has that potential
to tap into a new market where we haven''t seen Microsoft
before. </p>
<p>Microsoft may generate $500 million in Kinect sales this
quarter and $1 billion this fiscal year, which ends in June,
according to Moskowitz. If Microsoft can meet its new forecast
for holiday Kinect sales, the company will exceed his estimate
by about $250 million for the quarter, Moskowitz said. </p>
<p>Casual, Social Gamers </p>
<p>With Kinect, Microsoft is aiming at users of so-called
casual games, which tend to be more family-friendly than
traditional shoot-''em-up video titles, and social games, played
on social networks such as Facebook Inc. Consumers may spend
$2.4 billion on casual games this year, according to Parks
Associates, a research firm in Dallas. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which pioneered the market for online
multiplayer console games, will try to extend its advantage with
Kinect games such as Kinect Sports and Kinect
Adventures. Many of the 17 games available at introduction let
gamers snap photos of themselves playing and post them online. </p>
<p>As a company that hasn''t traditionally attracted casual
gamers with Xbox, Microsoft may need to take pains to win over
wives, mothers and teenage girls who may already have an Xbox in
the house but don''t use it, said Michael Pachter, a video-game
analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. </p>
<p>Ellen, Oprah </p>
<p>To do that, Microsoft has previewed the device on daytime
talk shows hosted by Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. A clip
of DeGeneres doing Merengue moves along with Kinect''s Dance
Central game -- from the makers of the classic title Rock
Band -- led Pachter''s non-gamer wife to ask when the family
was getting one. </p>
<p>It worked in Ballmer''s household too, the executive told a
group of students at the University of Washington last month.
His wife, Connie, had banished the Xbox from the main part of
the house, saying it was distracting the kids from homework,
until she saw Kinect, Ballmer said at the time. </p>
<p>They have a lot riding on it, Pachter said. If they
can get every Wii household to upgrade to this, they can sell
another 50 million consoles. They won''t succeed in that, of
course, but that''s the goal. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 11 cents to $27.14 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It has declined 11 percent this
year. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Confidence'' </p>
<p>Microsoft''s higher Kinect sales forecast shows a lot of
confidence, Pachter said. In that same period, Sony may sell
about 3 million Move units, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Entertainment and Devices unit, made up mostly
of Xbox sales, had a profit of $679 million for the year that
ended June 30, only the third year the business has turned a
profit. Kinect is key to expanding margins. Consoles typically
lose money for the first several years before turning profitable
and the Xbox 360 is now narrowly profitable, Microsoft has said. </p>
<p>Unlike a new console, Kinect won''t lose money from the time
of its release, according to Moskowitz. When it reaches full
sales capacity, Moskowitz expects Kinect to be more profitable
than the Xbox. Microsoft unveiled Kinect in June 2009. </p>
<p>Still, many hard-core gamers like Pachter himself won''t
really care about Kinect, he said. Pachter said he''d rather
spend the money to buy Vanquish and the latest installments of
Gears of War'' and Call of Duty, three shooting games. </p>
<p>Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft''s Interactive
Entertainment Business, said in an interview that he''s confident
Xbox and Kinect is for everyone, whether you are 8 or 80. </p>

<p>U.S. bank stocks rose the most in two
months after the Wall Street Journal said the Federal Reserve is
expected to allow lenders with satisfactory capital levels to
increase dividend payments. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the two
biggest U.S. banks by assets, led the KBW Bank Index to a 3.6
percent gain at 4:01 p.m. in New York. The increase was the
largest since Sept. 1. Eighty of the 81 companies in the

<p>Regulators are expected to soon provide banks with
requirements they must meet to raise the dividends, the Wall

JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said last month
that he hoped to increase the dividend early next year. </p>
<p>Bank of America jumped 5.2 percent to $12.12, after
climbing as much as 6.3 percent, its biggest intraday gain since
May. JPMorgan rose 5.5 percent to $39.80. SunTrust Banks Inc.,

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s Fablyn, the bone drug
that failed to win U.S. approval amid safety questions, reduced
the risk of breast cancer and fractures in postmenopausal women
with osteoporosis, a company-sponsored study found. </p>
<p>Women taking the medicine, also known as lasofoxifene, had
a 79 percent lower chance of breast cancer compared with those
on placebo, researchers said today in the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute. Pfizer is exploring strategic
options that include licensing out Fablyn or selling the
rights Pfizer now holds, in line with plans disclosed last year,
Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail yesterday. </p>
<p>Pfizer failed last year to win approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to sell Fablyn as an osteoporosis
treatment, after the medicine was linked to an increase in total
deaths from all causes. The company said in a regulatory filing
in May that it was withdrawing its requests for U.S. clearance
of the medicine in osteoporosis and in vulvar and vaginal
atrophy. The medicine may yet find a use, said Victor Vogel, a
physician not connected with the drug or the study. </p>
<p>We shall have to wait and see what the FDA decides to
do,'''' said Vogel, director of cancer services at Geisinger
Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania, in a telephone
interview on Nov. 2. He said the FDA should reexamine the drug
in light of today''s study. Vogel wrote an editorial about the
drug for the journal. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co., the world''s largest

acquiring operations from bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. </p>
<p>The company is selling 3-year notes that may be priced near
the record-low rate of 0.75 percent that Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
got in an Oct. 18 sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It also plans to issue 18-month notes, and 5- and 10-year debt,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola joins Dow Chemical Co., Harvard University and
General Electric Capital Corp. in marketing bonds today with
investment-grade company borrowing costs near record lows. Coca-
Cola assumed $8 billion of debt when it closed Oct. 3 on its
acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises'' North American operations,
of which it already owned 34 percent. The purchase followed
PepsiCo Inc. bringing its bottling in-house, as both companies
try to cut costs and turn around the U.S. market, where annual
soft-drink sales by volume have declined since 2005. </p>
<p>Rates are so low that companies are having a contest of
who''s going to issue at the lowest, said Didi Weinblatt, vice

<p>It took 51 years for General Motors

Index to being dropped after its bankruptcy last year. The
automaker may need at least another year until it returns. </p>
<p>Initial public offerings should be seasoned for six to 12

that later will become common stock. </p>
<p>A company''s inclusion in the SP 500 can be material
because index funds are required to buy the shares to minimize
tracking error, or the difference between the performance of the
fund and the index. An SP study from 2000 found that shares of
companies being added to the index increased an average of 8.5
percent from the announcement date to the effective date. </p>
<p>GM''s Bankruptcy </p>
<p>General Motors Corp. was removed from the SP 500 when it
filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2009 after posting $88
billion of losses since 2004. General Motors Co. emerged 39 days
later. </p>
<p>The last time GM was the largest company on the SP 500 by
market value was November 1958, at $13.5 billion, Silverblatt
said. GM traded the top spot throughout the 1950s with ATT Inc. </p>
<p>Ed Whitacre, who will retire as GM''s chairman at the end of
the year, was chairman and chief executive officer until 2007 of
the telephone service provider formerly known as ATT Corp. </p>
<p>At the IPO''s midpoint price of $27.50 each, GM would have a
market capitalization of $41.25 billion, based on 1.5 billion
shares that will be outstanding after the offering, according to
the company''s filing and data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>GM said separately yesterday that it had third-quarter net
income attributable to common stockholders of $1.9 billion to
$2.1 billion. The results are preliminary, and details are
scheduled to be released Nov. 10, GM said in a statement. </p>
<p>Third-Quarter Earnings </p>
<p>The company had earnings before interest and taxes of $2.2
billion to $2.4 billion on revenue of about $34 billion for the
three months ended Sept. 30, according to the statement. GM
earned $2.6 billion in the first half of the year. </p>
<p>SP has made exceptions to the index addition guidelines,
including that companies post a year of positive earnings,
Silverblatt said. Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
reported a $1.53 billion first-quarter loss last year and was
picked to join the SP 500 on Jan. 26. </p>
<p>We looked at other criteria and stated that, yes, there
was a negative item that they had in there at one point for
earnings within the last year, Silverblatt said. However,
looking at the balance sheet and using the whole methodology, it
was acceptable. </p>
<p>GM said in the regulatory filing yesterday that it would
have positive earnings before interest and taxes in the fourth
quarter. The company also said EBIT would be lower than prior
quarters because it will be building a different mix of vehicles
and engineering costs for future models will be higher. GM is
introducing the new Chevrolet Volt gas-electric car and Chevy
Cruze compact during the quarter. </p>
<p>The company''s offering may price on Nov. 17 and the shares
would begin trading the following day, people familiar with the
plans have said. </p>
<p>GM''s common shares will be listed on the New York Stock
Exchange under the ticker GM and on the Toronto Stock Exchange
under the ticker GMM. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, 3i Infrastructure Plc
and Star Capital Partners Ltd. agreed to buy HSBC Holdings Plc''s
U.K. train-leasing business for 2.1 billion pounds ($3.4
billion). </p>
<p>The deal is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter,
HSBC said today in a Regulatory News Service statement. The unit
owns about 29 percent of the British rail fleet, comprising 19
fleets of vehicles leased to seven operators. </p>
<p>The group raised about 1.4 billion pounds from loans
maturing in four and six years, and 300 million pounds of short-
term funding to be refinanced by bonds, people with knowledge of
the matter said today. The borrowing is being arranged by Lloyds
Banking Group Plc, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland
Plc, Credit Agricole CIB, HSBC, ING Groep NV, Societe Generale
SA and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., the people said. </p>
<p>HSBC bought the U.K. train-leasing company Eversholt
Holdings Ltd., one of three rolling-stock leasing companies
created in 1994 when Britain''s state-run railway was privatized,
in 1997 for 726.5 million pounds. Its sale means that all three
companies have changed hands in the past two years. </p>
<p>Angel Trains was sold by RBS in 2008 to a unit of Babcock 
Brown Ltd. and partners for 3.6 billion pounds. Following the
Australian asset-management firm''s collapse, Angel is held by a
group of private-equity investors and funds. </p>
<p>Porterbrook Leasing Co. was sold for an undisclosed sum
last year by Banco Santander SA to Antin Infrastructure
Partners, a fund backed by BNP Paribas SA, Deutsche Bank AG and
Lloyds Banking Group, after the Spanish bank inherited the
company with its purchase of U.K.-based Abbey National Plc. </p>
<p>The consortium was advised by Macquarie Capital Advisers,
BNP Paribas SA and Wyvern Partners while HSBC used its own
advisers and N.M. Rothschild  Son Ltd. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and nine other
banks may lose an estimated $120 million in advisory fees should
BHP Billiton Ltd.''s $40 billion hostile bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. fail. </p>
<p>The Canadian government yesterday blocked BHP''s offer,
saying it didn''t provide the country a net benefit. The
banks would earn as much as $140 million in advisory fees if the
deal is successful and as little as $20 million if it fails,
according to estimates by research firm Freeman Consulting. </p>
<p>For many of the bankers involved, their bonuses are
likely to be a lot less than they would have been, said Peter Hahn, professor of corporate finance at Cass Business School in
London. The loss of the fee income is hugely disappointing for
the banks. </p>
<p>The proposed takeover would be the largest deal this year.
BHP, the world''s largest mining company, in September lined up
$45 billion of loans to fund the deal. The Melbourne-based
company has 30 days to appeal the Canadian decision, at which
point the government will make its final decision. BHP said
yesterday it would review its options. </p>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Banco
Santander SA, Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are
BHP''s advisers on the deal, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Potash Corp. is advised by Bank of America Corp.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada. </p>
<p>In addition to advisory fees, financing banks can get as
much as $190 million to arrange loans, according to Freeman.
Most of the loan fees may have already been paid, Freeman said. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman in London, declined
to comment. </p>
<p>Prudential, AIA </p>
<p>While the target''s defense advisers in a hostile situation
may be paid their full fee if the deal fails, it''s unclear in a
situation where the government blocks the transaction, said New
York-based Freeman. </p>
<p>U.K. insurer Prudential Plc earlier this year failed in its
$35.5 billion bid to buy American International Group Inc.''s
Asian unit AIA Group Ltd. That deal would have generated about
$660 million in fees for advisers, according to Freeman''s
estimate at the time the deal was announced. </p>
<p>Should BHP drop the bid, it will be the third time Chief
Executive Officer Marius Kloppers, 48, has failed to consummate
a deal in the past two years after scrapping the hostile bid for
Rio Tinto Group in 2008 and an iron ore joint venture with the
same company last month. </p>
<p>These mega-deals, like Prudential, are getting a second
look for a lot of different reasons and it''s getting harder for
boards to risk their credibility by attempting these types of
transactions, Hahn said. BHP has already paid hundreds of
millions in banker and lawyer fees for the failed Rio Tinto
transaction, so it will be interesting to see how much they have
to set aside for the Potash bid. </p>
<p>Global Deals </p>
<p>There have been $1.71 trillion worth of global deals
announced this year, up 20 percent from the same period last
year, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>The government''s decision marks only the second formal
rejection of a takeover in Canada in the past 25 years. The
government came under pressure from the province of
Saskatchewan, which argued Potash Corp.''s sale would cut jobs
and tax revenue and surrender control of an important resource. </p>
<p>Under the Investment Canada Act, the federal government can
block any transaction valued at C$299 million ($296 million) or
more if it finds the deal doesn''t provide a net benefit to
the country. </p>
<p>Canada has reviewed and approved 1,637 applications between
June 30, 1985, the year the legislation was enacted, and Sept.
30 this year, according to government data. The other deal to be
rejected was Alliant Techsystems Inc.''s 2008 bid for MacDonald
Dettwiler  Associates Ltd.''s space business. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, received requests for files this
year on about $8.1 billion in outstanding loans that may be
candidates for buybacks. </p>
<p>Repurchase demands in the second and third quarter were
very high and have increased over the previous several
quarters, according to an investor presentation on the New York-
based company''s website today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan received $2.9 billion in repurchase demands this
year, compared with $3 billion for all of 2009 and $2 billion
the year before, Charlie Scharf, chief executive officer for
retail banking, said in a presentation at the BancAnalysts
Association of Boston Conference. About 90 percent of the
repurchase demands are for loans originated from 2006 through
2008, Scharf said. </p>
<p>Requests for loan files from private investors as well as
government-sponsored companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have
increased, according to the presentation. The $8.1 billion in
file requests this year compares with $9.2 billion for all of
last year and $4.6 billion in 2008. The data exclude repurchase
and loan file requests from private insurers. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has also separately stopped 127,000 foreclosures
in 40 states, up from 115,000 disclosed last month, while it
reviews those files to correct any errors in the documents,
Scharf said. JPMorgan will begin re-filing paperwork in a few
weeks, he said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer plans to sell as much as $2 billion in
stock to diversify his holdings and help with tax planning
before the end of the year. </p>
<p>The transaction would mark his first stock sale in seven
years, the Redmond, Washington-based company said today on its
website. Ballmer held about 408 million shares before the move,
which involves as many as 75 million shares, Microsoft said. At
the stock''s closing price on Nov. 5, the transaction would
amount to $2 billion. </p>
<p>Even though this is a personal financial matter, I want to
be clear about this to avoid any confusion, Ballmer said in the
statement. I am excited about our new products and the
potential for our technology to change people''s lives, and I
remain fully committed to Microsoft and its success. </p>
<p>Ballmer''s sale comes as the company steps up its use of
dividends and buybacks to reward shareholders, who have seen the
stock fall this year. Microsoft, the biggest software maker,
boosted its dividend 23 percent in September. As of June, the
company had approval to buy back $23.7 billion shares. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 29 cents to $26.85 today in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares have declined 12 percent this year. </p>
<p>Ballmer, 54, has already sold about 50 million shares of
the total 75 million, according to a regulatory filing. He took
over from Bill Gates as CEO in 2000. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. settled a
suit by a former vice president who claimed she was pushed onto
the mommy-track and eventually fired after she chose to work
part-time following her pregnancy. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed in March by Charlotte Hanna, claimed
violations of the U.S. Family Medical Leave Act, and gender and
pregnancy discrimination. The terms of the settlement are
confidential, said Douglas Wigdor, Hanna''s attorney. </p>
<p>In her complaint, Hanna said she joined Goldman as an
associate in 1998 and two years later was promoted to vice
president for Goldman Sachs University, an in-house training
program. She claimed her opportunities for advancement at
Goldman Sachs disappeared when she took maternity leave with her
first child in February 2005. </p>
<p>When Ms. Hanna decided to take the off-ramp'' provided by
the firm to devote time to her children, there was no on-ramp''
that enabled her to return to full-time employment, her lawyer
wrote in the complaint. The off-ramp'' was a direct path to a
mommy-track that ultimately derailed Ms. Hanna''s career. </p>
<p>Hanna claimed that once she began working part time for the
firm, she was channeled into lower positions that made it more
difficult for her to earn more money and advance to better
positions. She claimed she was demoted, lost her office and then
was fired in 2008, before she returned from a second maternity
leave. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs spokesman David Wells had no comment. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc., the world''s biggest
drugmaker, leads a race against three rivals to sell the first
new pill in a decade for rheumatoid arthritis, a joint disease
treated by injected drugs with $12 billion in annual sales. </p>
<p>The tablet, called tasocitinib, curbed inflammation and
stopped the disease from worsening, Pfizer reported last week.
Pfizer may edge out shots sold by Johnson  Johnson, Abbott
Laboratories, and Amgen Inc. if research to be presented Nov. 10
at the American College of Rheumatology in Atlanta suggests its
tablet is also a safe alternative. </p>
<p>Tasocitinib is the most advanced pill in a family of
experimental drugs to target a protein, called JAK, which leads
to joint destruction in 1.3 million Americans with rheumatoid
arthritis. Pfizer''s study is the first late-stage JAK trial, one
of six the company plans to complete by the end of next year.
The pill can generate peak annual sales of $2 billion, said Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. </p>
<p>Tasocitinib''s main value proposition is that it is a
first-in-class novel oral therapy launching into an area filled
with injectable products that collectively sell about $12
billion a year for rheumatoid arthritis alone, Anderson said
in a Nov. 1 research report. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 20 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $17.18 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The New York-
based drugmaker rose less than a percent in the 12 months
through today. </p>
<p>Lipitor Competition </p>
<p>Pfizer is counting on revenue from tasocitinib to help
offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol pill,
with $11.4 billion in annual sales, faces competition next year
from cheaper copies in the U.S. The company gained the arthritis
remedy Enbrel in last year''s $68 billion purchase of Wyeth. The
anti-inflammatory medicine generated $799 million in the third
quarter, making up 5 percent of Pfizer''s revenue. </p>
<p>Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease where the immune
system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing inflammation
in and around joints. Shots known as anti-TNF therapy are
standard care for the 80 percent of patients who don''t respond
to treatment with methotrexate, a generic drug that can block
cell growth in people with certain cancers and immune disorders. </p>
<p>Three biotechnology companies are trying to catch up to
Pfizer with their own JAK drugs - Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
Incyte Corp., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pfizer''s pill is
the only one in the third and final stage of tests generally
needed for U.S. approval. </p>
<p>Two-Year Lead </p>
<p>Tasocitinib appears to be in the lead by at least two
years in comparison to other JAK inhibitors, said Marc Goodman, an analyst with UBS Securities, in an Oct. 27 note to
clients. We believe that the safety issues are key to gaining
the appropriate label and could limit its use to patients with
low cardiovascular risk. </p>
<p>Investors are most concerned about whether Pfizer''s drug
will raise cholesterol levels enough to limit the number of
patients who might use it, Goodman said. The pill showed signs
of this side effect in previous study results. </p>
<p>Doctors may be slow to adopt new JAK drugs for patients who
are already getting relief from older treatments, said David Pisetsky, professor of rheumatology and immunology at Duke
University School of Medicine. While high cholesterol linked to
tasocitinib may be treatable, physicians may resist adding an
additional drug to patients'' daily treatment regimens. </p>
<p>Because it''s a new mode of action, there''s great
interest, but what''s going to happen in terms of efficacy and
safety when you really put it out there? Pisetsky said in a
telephone interview. There''s always a difference between what
happens in a trial setting and what happens in real life. </p>
<p>Enbrel, Remicade </p>
<p>The rheumatoid arthritis market is dominated by three anti-
TNF treatments: Enbrel from Pfizer and Thousand Oaks,
California-based Amgen; Humira, from Abbott Park, Illinois-based
Abbott; and Remicade, sold by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based
JJ and Merck  Co., based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.
The treatments cost as much as $20,000 a year and leave patients
susceptible to infections. </p>
<p>Summary results of the first three months of Pfizer''s six-
month study were released last week. The study''s 611 patients
took one of two doses of the drug or a placebo pill. After three
months of treatment, 66 percent of patients taking the higher
dose had at least a 20 percent improvement of symptoms, compared
with 27 percent in the placebo group. Side effects were reported
by 330 patients, with 25 seriously affected. Thirteen patients
stopped taking the drug. A 79-year-old woman with a history of
heart disease and diabetes died after developing diarrhea
followed by renal failure. </p>
<p>Complete Data </p>
<p>The complete six-month data from the trial will be released
Nov. 7 and presented Nov. 10 at the rheumatology meeting. The
presentation will include the number of patients with 70 percent
improvement and will describe side effects in greater detail. </p>
<p>Incyte Corp., based in Wilmington, Delaware, will present
the second of three stages of testing of its drug, INCB-28050,
at the rheumatology meeting. Early results of the 125-patient
trial show similar effectiveness to Pfizer''s drug and comparable
anti-TNFs, though more studies are needed, said Goodman of UBS.
Incyte is partnered with Eli Lilly  Co., of Indianapolis. </p>
<p>Rigel, of South San Francisco, California, in September
entered late-stage research for its JAK drug, called
fostamatinib, in joint development with London-based AstraZeneca
Plc. A study in July 2009 failed to show statistically
significant improvement for patients taking the drug. </p>
<p>Vertex, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is conducting a
mid-stage trial of its JAK drug, VX-509. </p>
<p>Methotrexate, now generic, was approved in 1988 and sells
for less than $1 a pill. Arava, a pill approved in 1998 for
Paris-based Sanofi-Aventis SA, is also sold as a generic. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo
 Co. are among banks most likely to increase dividends as early
as the first quarter of 2011, according to Dick Bove of Rochdale
Securities LLC. </p>
<p>Financial stocks rallied today after a person familiar with
the matter told Bloomberg News that the Federal Reserve is
preparing guidelines for supervisors to use in assessing whether
banks are strong enough to boost payouts or buy back shares.
Banks in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index climbed 3.7 percent
yesterday, leading the gauge to a two-year high. </p>
<p>It now looks highly likely that the dividends for a
number of banks will be increased, Bove, who is based in Lutz,
Florida, said in a telephone interview. Do they have the
capacity to dramatically increase their dividends? The answer is
definitely yes. They have enormous capacity to increase their
earnings from a balance sheet standpoint. </p>
<p>Earnings have topped estimates at 19 of the 24 banks in the
KBW Bank Index that have reported since Oct. 7, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home lender,
which last month reported third-quarter earnings that beat
analysts'' estimates, are among the most likely to boost their
payouts, according to Bove. </p>
<p>Bloomberg dividend forecasts show JPMorgan, based in New
York, will quadruple its quarterly payout to 20 cents in
February, while San Francisco-based Wells Fargo will double its
to 10 cents in April. </p>
<p>Top Priority'' </p>
<p>Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins, 59, said
last month that an increase is a top priority for the bank.
JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, said he
was reasonably hopeful the firm will be able to raise its
payment in 2011''s first quarter and that regulators were open to
the idea. </p>
<p>Bove said other banks that may boost their dividends are
Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Northern Trust Corp., State
Street Corp., BBT Corp., Comerica Inc., U.S. Bancorp and PNC
Financial Services Group Inc. </p>
<p>The analyst doesn''t expect the following banks to boost
their payouts: Citigroup Inc., First Horizon National Corp.,
Fifth Third Bancorp, KeyCorp, Marshall  Ilsley Corp., Regions
Financial Corp., SunTrust Banks Inc. and Zions Bancorporation.
He said it is unclear what Bank of America Corp. will do. </p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department forced Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America and Citigroup of New York to
slash their quarterly payments to no more than a penny as a
condition of receiving an additional $20 billion of bailout
money in late 2008 and early 2009. The banks had gotten $25
billion a few months earlier. </p>
<p>Europe, Regulation </p>
<p>The SP 500 Banks Index fell 28 percent from this year''s
high on May 3 through Aug. 30 on concern that widening European
deficits and U.S. financial regulation would curb lending. Since
then, the index has risen 20 percent. The gauge rallied 3.7
percent at 1:14 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>The results of Bove''s past predictions have been mixed. He
recommended selling Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. stock four
months before the securities firm collapsed, helping investors
avoid a 65 percent plunge in the shares. Bove raised it to
buy on Aug. 21, 2008. Lehman filed the world''s largest
bankruptcy three weeks later. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s advance
above its average price in the last 200 days and the likelihood
that its shares won''t fall to lows bode well for U.S. stocks,
said Christopher Verrone at Strategas Research Partners. </p>
<p>Shares of the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history climbed above the 200-day moving average this
month for the first time since March, when it stayed above the
measure until mid-April. Since its 2010 low on July 2, the stock
has risen, making higher peaks and higher valleys. </p>
<p>Goldman''s bullish trend suggests financial stocks may
rebound soon, helping extend the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index''s
best September and October performance in 12 years, said
Verrone, lead technical analyst at Strategas. Financial shares
ranked second in weightings among the benchmark''s 10 groups
after technology, and were the only loser in the past six
months. </p>
<p>When we see the trend starts to improve for bellwethers
in the financial sector like Goldman, it gives you some
confidence that the market is beginning to treat these financial
stocks a little bit better, Verrone said in a telephone
interview from his office in New York. That''s a major group
and it''s important for that group to at least participate if the
rally is going to extend into 2011. </p>
<p>The SP 500 Financials Index tracking 81 companies has
fallen 4.9 percent in the past six months after new regulations
following the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
require banks to reduce risk taking while concerns grew that the
industry face more losses from bad mortgages. During the same
period, the SP 500 added 4 percent. </p>
<p>Industry-Group Leadership </p>
<p>Goldman and other financial shares led during the first
year of the bull market. While the SP 500 jumped 69 percent
from a 12-year low on March 9, 2009, Goldman surged 128 percent
and the financials index rallied 145 percent. Since then, the
group has surrendered its leadership and become a drag on the
market. </p>
<p>There are signs that the industry''s price trend is
improving, Verrone said. The SP 500 financials index yesterday
crossed above its 200-day average after failing to sustain above
that threshold in three attempts since May. Goldman''s momentum

<p>Walt Disney Co. signed a contract
today with state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group Co. to build its
first mainland China theme park, less than a week after the
World Expo drew a record number of visitors. </p>
<p>The signing is another step forward in Disney''s goal
to open its fourth theme park outside the U.S. after being in
talks with the Shanghai city government for quite some
time, the Burbank, California-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. </p>
<p>Disney won government approval for a theme park last year.
It still needs approval for the venture from relevant
government departments, the municipal government said in a
statement on its website today. Shendi will work with the
world''s biggest theme-park operator to construct and operate
the park, according to another government statement. </p>
<p>This is a sign that restrictions on construction
projects have been lifted after the Shanghai World Expo and
work on the Disney park will speed up, Zhang Chifei, a
Nanjing-based analyst at Huatai Securities Co., said in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>The project may cost 25 billion yuan ($3.8 billion),
state-controlled Xinhua News Agency said today. The park, to be
in Shanghai''s Pudong district, will have a Magic Kingdom theme
with some elements reflecting regional flavor, Disney said last
November. Disney opened a park in Hong Kong in 2005. </p>
<p>Neither Disney nor the government divulged more details
about the arrangement with Shendi. </p>
<p>The six-month Expo attracted 73.1 million visitors,
topping the record of 64 million set in Osaka, Japan, in 1970.
It was part of an investment campaign in the city of
19.2 million people that China aims to develop into a global
financial center by 2020. The city government has spent $44
billion on construction and operating costs as well as
infrastructure including airport terminals, new roads and
tunnels and a three-year renovation of The Bund. </p>
<p>Roadbuilder Shanghai Pudong Road  Bridge Construction Co.
jumped by the 10 percent daily limit to 19.82 yuan in Shanghai
trading today. Property developer Shanghai Lujiazui Finance 
Trade Zone Development Co. gained 10 percent to 21.66 yuan.
Shanghai Construction Co. rose 9 percent to 17.35 yuan. </p>
<p>The Disney park will be built inside a 20-square-kilometer
area earmarked for tourism development, said the Shanghai
Municipal Tourism Administrative Commission. </p>
<p>The Disney project will probably be a new growth engine
for Shanghai and benefit companies that win building
contracts, Zhang of Huatai Securities said. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its
average 2011 forecast for Brent crude to $91.75 from $84.50 a
barrel, following the U.S. Federal Reserve''s announcement of
additional asset purchases, or quantitative easing. </p>
<p>Although there has already been a significant currency
and commodity price shift in anticipation of QE2, we believe
there remains a strong likelihood of further dollar weakness,
which will prove supportive to the oil price, analysts at
JPMorgan led by Lawrence Eagles in New York said in a note dated
yesterday. </p>
<p>The price of West Texas Intermediate crude will remain $2 a
barrel below Brent, the analysts said, raising their 2011 WTI
forecast to $89.75 a barrel from $82.50. JPMorgan raised its
fourth-quarter 2010 estimates to $88 a barrel from $83 a barrel
for Brent, and to $86 from $81 for WTI. </p>
<p>The forecasts for Brent implicitly target a spike to $100
over the next six months, according to the report. </p>
<p>But it is important to remember that OECD economies
remain fragile, and should the oil price spike too high, too
quickly, that could have a circular impact in terms of global
GDP growth and oil demand, the analysts said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s experimental pill for
rheumatoid arthritis reduced pain and inflammation without
unforeseen side effects in a study that may help the company
supplant injectable drugs with $12 billion in yearly sales. </p>
<p>The treatment, called tasocitinib, lessened inflammation by
20 percent or more for patients after six months, according to
Saeed Fatenejad, head of late-stage trials in inflammation and
immunology at New York-based Pfizer. While the medicine raised
bad as well as good cholesterol levels during the study, there
was no increase seen in heart attacks or strokes. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the world''s largest drugmaker, is racing three
biotechnology companies to sell the first pill in a decade for
rheumatoid arthritis, which destroys joints in 1.3 million
Americans. The drug may post annual sales of $2 billion, said
Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in San
Francisco. Pfizer plans to complete four more studies in the
first half of next year before seeking U.S. clearance. </p>
<p>We see the ability, with all of these studies, to get a
very broad label, Fatenejad said in a telephone interview.
This might be the first drug that is going for the original
filing with everything: signs and symptoms, quality of life, X-
ray data, and then really looking at the various types where the
drug could be used. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s most recent finding, in the last of three phrases
of research usually needed for U.S. marketing approval, will be
reported Nov. 10 at the American College of Rheumatology meeting
in Atlanta. Revenue from tasocitinib may help offset Pfizer
losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol pill, with $11.4
billion in annual sales, faces competition next year from
cheaper copies in the U.S. </p>
<p>Market Leaders </p>
<p>The rheumatoid arthritis market is dominated by three
injectable drugs known as anti-TNF treatments, which cost as
much as $20,000 a year and leave patients susceptible to
infections. </p>
<p>This includes Enbrel, which Pfizer gained in last year''s
$68 billion purchase of Wyeth, and is co-marketed with Thousand
Oaks, California-based Amgen. The other two are Humira, sold by
Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories, and Remicade,
sold by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson  Johnson and
Merck  Co., of Whitehouse Station, New Jersey. </p>
<p>Tasocitinib is the most advanced pill in a family of
experimental treatments targeting a protein called JAK that
leads to joint destruction. </p>
<p>Drug Works'' </p>
<p>Now we know the drug works, and we know the drug works as
a monotherapy, by itself, said Roy Fleischmann, the study''s
lead investigator and professor of internal medicine at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, in a
telephone interview. We also have a pretty good handle on the
safety profile, which has been consistent. </p>
<p>Tasocitinib raised levels of LDL, often called bad
cholesterol because it is linked to heart disease, and increased
HDL, or good cholesterol, which lessens heart disease. The ratio
between the two, a measure used by some heart doctors to gauge
risk of disease, was unchanged. The elevation occurred early in
the course of treatment and didn''t increase over time, making it
easier to treat if necessary, Fleischmann said. </p>
<p>At the mid-point point in the study, the drug didn''t reach
one of its three goals, to increase a measure of disease
remission; the results were numerically positive, though not
statistically significant, the company said in a statement. </p>
<p>In the Pfizer study, 25 of 611 patients, or 4.1 percent,
reported serious adverse events during the six months. Among
them, 6 patients had serious infections. That''s probably a
little bit better than the anti-TNF drugs, though doctors and
patients would need to be vigilant, Fleischmann said. </p>
<p>Adverse Events </p>
<p>A 79-year-old woman with a history of heart disease and
diabetes died after developing diarrhea followed by renal
failure, according to the study. </p>
<p>Even if tasocitinib isn''t safer or more effective than
anti-TNF treatments in next year''s head-to-head tests, similar
results may help the pill win patients who don''t want regular
injections or are among the 20 percent to 40 percent who don''t
respond to anti-TNF drugs, Fatenejad said. </p>
<p>The three biotechnology companies developing JAK drugs are:
South San Francisco, California-based Rigel Pharmaceuticals
Inc., Incyte Corp. of Wilmington, Delaware, and Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pfizer''s pill is
the only one with results from the third and final stage of
tests generally needed for U.S. approval. </p>
<p>Slow to Adopt </p>
<p>Doctors may be slow to adopt new JAK drugs for patients who
are getting relief from older treatments, said David Pisetsky,
professor of rheumatology and immunology at Duke University
School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. </p>
<p>While high levels of bad cholesterol linked to tasocitinib
may be treatable, physicians may resist adding a drug to
patients'' daily treatment regimens. </p>
<p>Because it''s a new mode of action, there''s great
interest, but what''s going to happen in terms of efficacy and
safety when you really put it out there? Pisetsky said in a
telephone interview. There''s always a difference between what
happens in a trial setting and what happens in real life. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, said it expects a pretax loss of $70
million on the sale of its controlling interest in FrontPoint
Partners LLC. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley expects the deal to close by the end of the
year, the New York-based firm said today in a regulatory filing.
Morgan Stanley paid about $400 million for FrontPoint when it
purchased the unit in 2006, people familiar with the terms said
at the time. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said last month that it''s giving up control
of FrontPoint to the fund unit''s managers and will retain a
minority stake. Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said on a
conference call last month that the firm may sell additional
hedge-fund stakes to free up capital. </p>
<p>FrontPoint''s managers, led by co-Chief Executive Officers
Daniel Waters and Michael Kelly, are gaining a majority stake in
the asset manager and will replace Morgan Stanley affiliates as
the unit''s investment adviser and general partner, Morgan
Stanley said last month. Terms of the agreement weren''t
disclosed. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had slightly more than $300 million of seed
capital in FrontPoint and plans to repatriate that in the
near future, CEO James Gorman said in October. Morgan Stanley
still holds minority stakes in Avenue Capital Group and
Lansdowne Partners, which it also bought in 2006. </p>
<p>Cooperating Fully'' </p>
<p>FrontPoint is the hedge fund whose employees allegedly
received nonpublic information regarding Human Genome Sciences
Inc.''s hepatitis-C Albuferon drug from Dr. Yves Benhamou, who
was charged this month with insider trading, according to a
person familiar with the matter. Benhamou, 50, of France, was
arrested this month in Boston on suspicion he tipped off a hedge
fund about negative results of Albuferon drug trials. </p>
<p>We are cooperating fully with this investigation, the
Greenwich, Connecticut-based firm said in an e-mailed statement
last week. Dr. Chip Skowron, a co-portfolio manager of
FrontPoint''s health-care funds, was placed on leave pending the
outcome of the investigation, the company said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said it may also book $274 million in
writedowns on receivables related to a Tourmaline collateralized
debt obligation. The CDO''s trustee has halted distribution of
Tourmaline''s funds pending resolution of a lawsuit, in which
Morgan Stanley was accused of failing to post collateral or take
other action as required by credit-default swaps with the CDO. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, made more than $100 million in trading
revenue on one day in the third quarter, the lowest number of
days since 2006. </p>
<p>The firm''s trading division lost money on 10 days during
the quarter, compared with five days a year earlier, according
to a filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. The New York-based firm made more than $100 million
in trading revenue on 18 days in last year''s third quarter. </p>
<p>Trading revenue at eight of the biggest Wall Street firms
declined an average 12 percent through September from the same
period a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg analysis of
company filings. Morgan Stanley saw a bigger year-over-year
decline in the third quarter than its four biggest U.S. rivals,
as trading revenue fell to less than half that of Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>Fixed-income is really the area that underperformed and
our view is that the results don''t reflect the true potential of
our franchise, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in an interview last month. There was no big bet,
it''s not that we lost a lot on anything. We didn''t lose a lot,
we didn''t make a lot, there just wasn''t much trading there. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had $1.43 billion in total sales and trading
revenue for the third quarter, the lowest since the first
quarter of 2009. Excluding losses and gains tied to its own
credit spreads, Morgan Stanley generated $1.31 billion from
trading fixed-income products, down 24 percent from the second
quarter. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which has hired about 400 new employees for
the sales and trading unit over the past 15 months, suffered
from a drop in client activity, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said last month. Morgan Stanley made money in trading on
54 of the 64 trading days in the third quarter, or 84 percent of
the time. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s trading value-at-risk, or VaR, the amount
the firm estimates it could lose from trading on any given day,
climbed to an average of $142 million for the third quarter.
That was up from $137 million for the year-earlier period. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman said Wall Street must fix a culture that
contributed to the financial crisis by idolizing individuals as
heroes and giving employees incentives to take outsized risks. </p>
<p>There are a fair number of the senior folks who actually
believe they are uniquely qualified on all issues relating to
finance, Gorman said today at a conference in New York. As we
saw, it''s just not true. </p>
<p>Gorman, speaking at the Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association conference, said some individuals who in
many cases were frankly pretty average made as much as 10
times that of people in other industries during the financial
crisis. Lawmakers and regulators, including Treasury Secretary
Timothy F. Geithner, have blamed excessive pay packages in the
finance industry for encouraging risk-taking that contributed to
the global credit contraction. </p>
<p>Fixing the culture will require creating a compensation
system that better aligns or balances shareholders'' interests
and the broader society''s interests with the individual''s
interests, and changing the perception that it''s the individual
that''s the hero, Gorman, 52, said. As an industry, we can
have larger-than-life personalities, but individuals don''t make
institutions. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley last year instituted clawbacks that allow
the New York-based bank to take back compensation if an employee
engages in conduct that hurts the firm in the years after it was
paid. The company also paid a greater portion of year-end
bonuses in stock to tie individual pay to the company''s
performance. </p>
<p>Hero'' Status </p>
<p>The more you have this hero individual status, and lots
of things written about them by journalist friends in the paper,
the more likely that they are going to act out, because they
start to believe it, Gorman said. </p>
<p>You can put on a large trade, and if it works, you make
out like a bandit, and if it doesn''t, you might get fired, but
you''re not paying back, he said. So you have asymmetric
risk, you either come out zero or you come out positive. That''s
imbalance. </p>
<p>Gorman, who became CEO this year after leading the firm''s
wealth-management unit, was paid $15.1 million in salary and
bonus for 2009. About $8.6 million of the pay can be clawed back
or is dependent on the company meeting performance measures.
Gorman declined a bonus in 2008. </p>

Artificial Islands</headline><body><![CDATA[
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. and its partners
plan to build four artificial islands in the Upper Zakum oil
field off Abu Dhabi that could result in cost savings of several
billion dollars, an Exxon executive said today. </p>
<p>Construction and use of the islands may allow for the
removal of almost 100 wellhead towers in the sea and may save
the project more than $1 billion and less than $15 billion, said
Morten Mauritzen, president of Exxon Mobil Abu Dhabi Offshore
Petroleum Co. Mauritzen was speaking at an event in Abu Dhabi,
the capital of the United Arab Emirates. </p>
<p>The cost savings would come over the 25 years remaining for
commercial production at Upper Zakum, where Zakum Development
Co. project, known also as Zadco, is pumping crude. State-run
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc, has a 60 percent stake in
Zadco, with Exxon Mobil holding 28 percent and Japan Oil, a unit
of Inpex Corp., owning the rest. </p>
<p>Zadco plans a $15 billion artificial islands project to
boost production at the field by about 40 percent to 750,000
barrels a day. Building islands is cheaper than erecting
offshore production platforms, Salah Al-Bufalah, Zadco''s
major projects manager, said last year. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. defended
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke''s decision to pump
money into the U.S. economy after officials in Germany, China
and Brazil criticized the plan. </p>
<p>The move will spur gross domestic product growth and reduce
the risk of deflation, Jan Hatzius, the New York-based chief
U.S. economist at the company, wrote in an e-mail to clients.
Because the Fed''s target for overnight loans between banks is
near zero, the central bank is doing the next best thing,
according to Goldman, one of the 18 primary dealers that are
authorized to trade directly with the central bank. </p>
<p>The widespread hostility to the Fed''s actions is
misplaced, Hatzius wrote. Downside risks to the economic
outlook have declined significantly. U.S. inflation is unlikely
to become a problem for years. </p>
<p>Bernanke on Nov. 6 defended the central bank''s decision
last week to buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries and
said he dismissed the idea that it will increase prices to
higher levels than policy makers prefer. German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said Nov. 5 in Berlin that the Fed''s move was
clueless. </p>
<p>I have rejected any notion that we are going to raise
inflation to a super-normal level in order to have effects on
the economy, Bernanke said in a panel discussion at a Fed
conference in Jekyll Island, Georgia. It''s critical for us to
maintain inflation at an appropriate level. </p>
<p>Risks for Everyone'' </p>
<p>Schaeuble said the Fed''s decision won''t revive growth. </p>
<p>It''s our problem as well if the U.S. is no longer certain
that the old recipes don''t work anymore, he said. We don''t
have the least reason for schadenfreude. We only have reason to
be worried. </p>
<p>Brazil''s central bank president, Henrique Meirelles, said
excess liquidity in the U.S. economy is creating risks for
everyone. In China, Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said
many countries are worried about the impact of the policy on
their economies. </p>
<p>Fed Board Governor Kevin Warsh today conceded that further
bond purchases risk distorting markets. </p>
<p>The Fed''s increased presence in the market for long-term
Treasury securities poses nontrivial risks that bear watching,
said Warsh, who voted for more stimulus last week, in an opinion
piece in the Wall Street Journal. As the Fed''s balance sheet
expands, it becomes more of a price maker than a price taker,
and if investors doubt the values set for the securities, risk
premiums across asset classes could shift unexpectedly around
the world. </p>
<p>Inflation Concerns </p>
<p>E. Gerald Corrigan, former Fed Bank of New York president,
said at the Georgia conference that he''s concerned the central
bank''s efforts risks causing price increases that are out of the
Fed''s control. </p>
<p>Even in the face of substantial margins of
underutilization of human and capital resources, efforts to
achieve an upward nudge in today''s very low inflation rate make
me somewhat uncomfortable, Corrigan, chairman of Goldman''s
bank subsidiary, said in prepared remarks. </p>
<p>The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities, widened to
2.13 percentage points from this year''s low of 1.47 percentage
points set in August. The five-year average is 2.10 percentage
points. </p>
<p>Next Best Thing'' </p>
<p>The Fed can''t cut its benchmark interest rate any further
after reducing it to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December
2008, Hatzius wrote in his e-mail, which he distributed
yesterday in New York. </p>
<p>Ten-year yields have declined about 18 basis points since
Sept. 20, the day before the Fed announced it was prepared to
provide additional support to the economy. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. Two-year yields fell to 0.3118 percent on Nov.
4 and five-year rates declined to 1.0148 percent, both record
lows. </p>
<p>They are doing the next best thing, aiming to lower the
bond term premium via purchases of longer-term securities,
Hatzius wrote. The strategy is known as quantitative easing
because it targets the quantity of money in the economy. Traders
have dubbed it QE2 because the Fed also tried it last year. </p>
<p>We also disagree with the criticism that the Fed is
flooding the world with money,'' Hatzius wrote. One risk of
the decision is that it will boost currencies outside the U.S.,
he said, which makes the goods of exporting nations more
expensive for their customers. </p>
<p>Divergence </p>
<p>But that is always true when regional cycles diverge, and
it has little to do with QE2 per se. </p>
<p>The difference between two- and 10-year yields was 2.16
percentage points, versus the five-year average of 1.28
percentage points. </p>
<p>Ten-year yields, a benchmark for consumer and company
borrowing costs, rose one basis point today to 2.538 percent as
of 11:49 a.m. in London, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the two-year Treasury was unchanged at
0.367 percent. </p>
<p>Michael Burry, the former hedge-fund manager who predicted
the housing market''s plunge, said Bernanke is trying to use
poison as the cure by pumping more cash into the economy. </p>
<p>The attempt to bolster growth is reminiscent of Alan Greenspan''s actions to revive the economy after 2001, Burry said
in comments published last week from a telephone interview. The
former Fed chairman helped create an unsustainable boom in U.S.
property prices with his policies, leading to the worst global
financial crisis since the Great Depression, he said. </p>
<p>Hatzius said the outlook has improved from a month ago,
when he said the U.S. economy faced two main scenarios, neither
of them good: </p>
<p>A fairly bad one in which the economy grows at a 1 1/2
percent to 2 percent rate through the middle of next year and
the unemployment rate rises moderately to 10 percent, and a very
bad one in which the economy returns to an outright recession,
he wrote to clients on Oct 6. </p>

<p>The single European currency will end the year at $1.40 and

<p>Tudor Pickering Holt  Co. hired

<p>Paul Chambers, 41, former global sector head of energy and
utility equities at Citadel, and Walker Moody, 31, previously in
the investment management division at Goldman Sachs, have joined
TPH Asset Management LLC, the new hedge fund unit of Tudor
Pickering Holt, an energy investment and merchant banker, the
company said in a statement. </p>
<p>We''re bringing very much a bottom-up stock-picking
approach to the business, said Dan Pickering, 44, co-president

is not a fund that''s going to need oil to go to $120 to make

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, said it will divest its $717 million stake
in Invesco Ltd. five months after acquiring the shares in its
sale of a retail asset-management business. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley will sell 30.9 million shares in a public
offering, the companies said today in a statement. The New York
bank acquired the stake as part of Atlanta-based Invesco''s $1.37
billion purchase of Morgan Stanley''s retail investment-
management business, which included the Van Kampen funds unit. </p>
<p>Invesco''s shares have rallied 28 percent since June 1, when
the deal closed. Morgan Stanley last month agreed to sell a
controlling stake in FrontPoint Partners LLC and said it may
sell other holdings in hedge funds to free up capital before new
minimum capital requirements go into effect. </p>
<p>This share sale is part of Morgan Stanley''s strategy to
reallocate capital, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer
James Gorman said in the statement. </p>
<p>Invesco won''t receive proceeds from the sale and Morgan
Stanley will serve as the sole underwriter for the offering, the
statement said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is likely to book a gain on the sale in the
fourth quarter, as it carried the equity stake at a value of
$568 million, according to a regulatory filing. Morgan Stanley
had previously recorded a cumulative gain of $673 million
related to the sale, the filing said. </p>
<p>Invesco''s Profit </p>
<p>Last month, Invesco posted third-quarter profit that jumped
47 percent from a year earlier, aided by the purchase. The
acquisition, Invesco''s largest in nine years, will add about 21
cents a share to earnings in the first 12 months after closing
and 23 cents in the second year, the company said in June. </p>
<p>The deal added $114.6 billion to Invesco''s assets under
management and included a distribution agreement with Morgan
Stanley''s retail-brokerage unit, which has $1.6 trillion in
client assets. </p>
<p>Invesco, manager of the AIM and PowerShares funds, boosted
the percentage of cash used to complete the deal in June after
its stock fell 18 percent from October 2009 when the deal was
announced. The company paid for the transaction with $800
million and 30.9 million shares, compared with the original
agreement of $500 million cash and 44.1 million shares. The
purchase price was still below the $1.5 billion the companies
originally estimated. </p>

<p> Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. oil company, agreed to buy Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2
billion, giving it access to the natural gas-rich Marcellus
Shale formation in Pennsylvania. </p>
<p>Shareholders will get $38.25 in cash plus units of an Atlas
pipeline affiliate, for a total of $43.34 a share, a 37 percent
premium to yesterday''s closing price, Atlas said in a statement
today. The company, based in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, had
its largest one-day share gain since it began trading in 2004. </p>
<p>The deal is worth $4.3 billion including assumed debt, the
companies said. If completed, the purchase would be the third-
largest for San Ramon, California-based Chevron and its biggest
since the 2005 acquisition of Unocal Corp. </p>
<p>Atlas has one of the premier acreage positions in the
prolific Marcellus, George L. Kirkland, Chevron vice chairman,
said in a statement. The high quality resource, competitive
cost structure in the Marcellus, strong growth potential of the
asset base and its proximity to premier natural-gas markets make
this targeted acquisition a compelling investment for Chevron. </p>
<p>The Marcellus Shale stretches from Pennsylvania into New
York, West Virginia and Ohio and may hold 262 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas, making it the largest known U.S. gas field,
according to Energy Department estimates. Marcellus gas has
averaged 11 percent more than the benchmark price over the past
year, because wells are closer to East Coast population centers. </p>

<p>The nonprofit group, Local Initiatives Support Corp., will

two years, Goldman Sachs and LISC, both based in New York, said
today in a statement. The chairman of LISC, according to the
group''s website, is Robert E. Rubin, former U.S. Treasury
secretary. </p>
<p>Charter schools are nonsectarian, public institutions that
operate independently of local boards of education in the U.S.
under special charters. Goldman Sachs''s Urban Investment Group
has committed about $150 million for charter schools in New York
and New Jersey, according to the statement. </p>
<p>By funding this facility, Goldman Sachs ensures that
thousands of low-income children will have access to innovative
local schools that also help revitalize blighted

officer of LISC, said in the statement. </p>
<p>The financing may allow the charter schools involved to
obtain as much as $100 million in additional capital, according
to the statement. </p>
<p>LISC raises money to support community organizations that
work to revitalize urban and rural areas. The organization gives
grants, invests money, and underwrites loans to low-income
communities, and has provided $127 million in financing to 130
schools in the U.S. since 1997, according to the statement. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Natixis
SA settled a London lawsuit over terminated credit-default swaps
that might have been worth as much as $530 million after a delay
in the trial that was to begin today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Natixis are pleased they''ve reached a
commercial settlement, Goldman''s lawyer, Anthony Grabiner,
said in court. The terms are confidential and Grabiner said
neither side would make any further public statements on the
agreement. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank''s London unit, Goldman Sachs International,
sued Natixis in July to stop the termination of three credit-
default swaps. Natixis, a unit of BPCE SA, France''s second-
largest lender by branches, said in July it would terminate the
swaps because Goldman didn''t comply with the contract. </p>
<p>The French investment bank countersued in September,
seeking a ruling it ended the deal lawfully, as well as breach
of contract damages. Natixis said it was ready willing and
able to pay Goldman $198.4 million on the lawfully and
validly terminated credit-default swaps. </p>
<p>Goldman, the most profitable firm in Wall Street history,
disputed Natixis''s calculation in court papers. Judge Elizabeth Gloster of the High Court of Justice agreed to a request to
postpone the start of the trial to allow for settlement talks. </p>
<p>Dozens of Cases </p>
<p>The case is among dozens in the London courts over
structured products which fell in value during the financial
crisis. Banks including Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., and
UBS AG are involved in U.K. suits to end contracts or force
counterparties to pay because of losses tied to the declining
economy. The settlement stems from the first lawsuit Goldman has
filed in London in more than a year, according to court records. </p>
<p>The swap deal between the banks included the three credit-
default swaps, and three corresponding swaps to offload the risk
between the French bank and a special-purpose vehicle
established by a bond insurer. When the insurer restructured in
2009, it left Natixis with the risk of the notes defaulting, the
bank said in court papers. </p>
<p>Goldman said Natixis knew it was at all times so exposed,
and remains exposed, under the credit derivative transactions,
according to a court filing. It isn''t entitled to hold GSI
accountable for Natixis'' failure, by its own inaction and
instructions, to achieve what it might have wanted. </p>
<p>Natixis argued in court papers that Goldman didn''t tell it
as soon as practicable that the trustee for the securities
determined in April the deal was in default. </p>
<p>The case is Goldman Sachs International v. Natixis, case
no. 10-880, High Court of Justice, Queen''s Bench Division
(London). </p>

<p>The U.K. may need two inflation-
linked bond markets as the government considers shifting
pension-fund indexing to another measure of price growth from
its existing benchmark, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The Debt Management Office should develop an inflation-
protected bond market pegged to the consumer-price index, or
CPI, once a decision is made by Prime Minister David Cameron''s
government to proceed, said Kari Hallgrimsson, head of European
inflation trading at JPMorgan in London. The existing retail-
price indexed market should be also be maintained, he said. </p>
<p>Costs for investors to protect themselves against
mismatched inflation liabilities risk becoming very
expensive should the debt agency keep issuing bonds, sometimes
called linkers, tied just to the retail price index, or RPI,
Hallgrimsson said. Unlike RPI, the CPI excludes items such as
local taxes and mortgage costs in its calculation. </p>
<p>If the Debt Management Office chooses not to issue CPI
linkers, it would cause massive volatility in inflation markets,
which in turn could dramatically increase the volatility of
liabilities, he said in an interview. We see this shift as a
potential game changer. It''s perfectly possible for the U.K. to
have two inflation markets that complement one another. </p>
<p>U.K. inflation-linked securities are all based on RPI. In
August, the coalition government said it will align state
benefits and public-service pensions to CPI, which was lower
than RPI on average for the past 20 years, and may ask some
private pensions to do the same. Hallgrimsson estimates private
pension liabilities at 1 trillion pounds ($1.6 billion). </p>
<p>100 Million Pounds </p>
<p>Demand for index-linked bonds may pick up as inflation has
stayed above the Bank of England''s upper limit of 3 percent for
seven months. Consumer prices, which anchor the central bank''s
target, rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in September. </p>
<p>Hallgrimsson estimates that a pension fund with 10 billion
pounds of CPI-linked liabilities may have to pay 100 million
pounds a year to buy hedging if RPI is one percentage point
below market expectations while CPI remains in line. </p>
<p>If the fund is forced to hedge in a relatively small CPI
market, which reflects a structural demand-supply imbalance,
hedging could end up costing even more, he said. </p>
<p>Robert Stheeman, who heads the DMO, repeated last month
that the agency will wait for clarity on the government''s plans
before asking investors whether CPI-linked bonds are needed. He
said on Sept. 7 that the debt agency is keen to avoid
fragmentation from issuing too many different products. </p>
<p>French Example </p>
<p>When investors buy inflation-protected bonds, they receive
so-called real yields, which tend to be lower than those of
nominal bonds. The advantage of index-linked bonds is that their
principal increases with inflation. </p>
<p>France is the only country that has two index-linked bonds.
It first issued bonds linked to domestic inflation in 1998,
before selling securities indexed to euro-region CPI in 2001.
Agence France Tresor maintains liquidity in both markets, which
each having outstanding debt of about 70 billion euros. Some
other nations waited until the euro''s introduction in 1999
before selling linkers, using the regional measure. </p>
<p>Hallgrimsson said he expects the government to settle on
changes next year. The Department of Work and Pensions finished
a consultation with the pension industry on Nov. 3, and the
result will be published in spring, a press officer said. </p>
<p>Liquidity Misconception'' </p>
<p>Hallgrimsson said the size of U.K. private pension
liabilities means there will be enough demand for two linker
securities. About 30 percent of those liabilities, or around 300
billion pounds, will already be in a situation where they need
to shift to CPI, he estimates. Hallgrimsson said the exact scale
of demand for CPI-linked bonds is difficult to gauge given that
pension plans'' rules on inflation linkage vary. </p>
<p>It is a misconception that CPI issuance would undermine
the RPI liquidity, he said. Investors may seek to arbitrage
between the two measures, increasing trading volume, he said.
Liquidity in one market may compliment the other. </p>
<p>U.K. index-linked bonds returned 6.6 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 10.1 percent from their U.S.

<p>Britain became the first industrialized nation to issue

same month was 4.6 percent. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Natixis
SA are in settlement talks to resolve a lawsuit over the
termination of credit-default swaps that was scheduled to go to
trial today. </p>
<p>Judge Elizabeth Gloster of the High Court of Justice in
London agreed to postpone the start of trial until 2 p.m. today
after Anthony Grabiner, a lawyer for Goldman Sachs, said the
parties were likely to resolve the dispute around lunchtime. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank''s London unit, Goldman Sachs International,
sued Natixis in July to stop the termination of three credit-
default swaps with a potential value of around $530 million.
Natixis, a unit of BPCE SA, France''s second-largest lender by
branches, said in July it would terminate the swaps because
Goldman didn''t comply with the contract. </p>
<p>Natixis countersued in September, seeking a declaration it
ended the deal lawfully, as well as breach of contract damages.
New York-based Goldman didn''t tell Natixis as soon as
practicable that the trustee for the securities determined in
April the deal was in default, Natixis said. Goldman didn''t
follow directions given by Natixis or provide information, the
French bank said in court papers. </p>
<p>Natixis remains, ready, willing and able to pay to GSI
the sum of $198,351,893.24 which is due to GSI, the French
bank said. The credit-default swaps were lawfully and validly
terminated. </p>
<p>Goldman, the most profitable firm in Wall Street history,
disputed Natixis''s calculation in court papers. </p>
<p>Dozens of Cases </p>
<p>The case is among dozens in the London courts over products
which fell in value during the financial crisis. Banks including
Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., and UBS AG are involved in
U.K. suits to end contracts or force counterparties to pay
because of losses tied to the declining economy. The trial stems
from the first lawsuit Goldman has filed in London in more than
a year, according to court records. </p>
<p>Natixis was aware, by its own admission, of the
possibility of an event of default in respect of some of the
notes, Goldman said in a court filing. It isn''t entitled to
hold GSI accountable for Natixis'' failure, by its own inaction
and instructions, to achieve what it might have wanted. </p>
<p>The swap deal between the banks included the three credit-
default swaps, and three corresponding swaps to offload the risk
between the French bank and a special-purpose vehicle
established by a bond insurer. When the insurer restructured in
2009, it left Natixis with the risk of the notes defaulting, the
bank said in court papers. </p>
<p>Goldman spokeswoman Sophie Bullock declined to comment. An
e-mail to Natixis''s press office didn''t receive an immediate
response after regular business hours. </p>
<p>The case is Goldman Sachs International v. Natixis, case
no. 10-880, High Court of Justice, Queen''s Bench Division
(London). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
that makes the most revenue trading stocks and bonds, lost money
in that business on two days in the third quarter and made more
than $100 million on seven days. </p>
<p>Losses on Goldman Sachs''s trading desks were between $25
million and zero on two days during the period that ended on
Sept. 30, according to a filing today by the New York-based
company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
firm''s traders made between $75 million and $100 million on 24
days, the filing showed. </p>
<p>Trading revenue at eight of the biggest Wall Street firms
declined an average 12 percent through September from the same
period a year ago, according to a Bloomberg analysis of company
filings. Goldman Sachs, which generated 69 percent of its
revenue this year from trading, blamed a 36 percent decline in
third-quarter trading revenue on reduced client activity. </p>
<p>Of the 66 trading days in the quarter, Goldman Sachs
traders made money on 64 days, the filing showed. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the top-
ranked manager of European stock sales this year, dismissed
Alexandre Harfouche, the co-head of European equity syndicate,
according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>Harfouche didn''t follow compliance rules at New York-based
Goldman Sachs, according to the person, who declined to be
identified because the matter is considered private. The
violations involved a failure to make certain disclosures and
didn''t break securities laws or harm clients, said the person. </p>
<p>Mr. Harfouche no longer works for the firm, New York-
based Goldman Sachs said in a statement, without giving a
reason. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman in London, said she couldn''t
comment. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is trying to repair
damage to the firm''s reputation inflicted by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission''s April fraud lawsuit, which accused
Goldman Sachs of misleading investors on a 2007 mortgage-linked
security. That was settled for $550 million in July. The firm
has also paid fines to U.K. and U.S. regulators for failing to
notify them of the SEC probe. </p>
<p>They''re going to be very careful to make sure all of
their internal policies and controls are being applied, said
Annemarie McAvoy, an adjunct professor at Fordham University
School of Law who has worked as an in-house lawyer at Morgan
Stanley and Citigroup Inc. Given what they just went through,
they''re not going to take chances. </p>
<p>Compliance Rules </p>
<p>Financial institutions create compliance rules to help them
meet regulatory requirements even when the regulations don''t
spell out exactly what the firm has to do, according to McAvoy.
For senior employees like Harfouche, monitoring junior staff and
notifying superiors about new information or problems can be
among the requirements, she said. </p>
<p>The internal policies and procedures cover just about
everything these financial firms do, she said. So if a step
wasn''t followed in whatever process was going on, or maybe they
were skipping a step -- there are all kinds of scenarios.
McAvoy said. </p>
<p>Harfouche, promoted to managing director last year along
with his co-head Daniel G. Martin, was responsible for advising
corporate clients on large sales of securities known as block
trades. Based in London, Harfouche has been listed as inactive
on the Financial Services Authority''s Register since the end of
last month. </p>
<p>FSA spokesman Chris Hamilton declined to comment on
Harfouche''s departure. Harfouche couldn''t be reached through
Goldman Sachs and isn''t listed in the London directory. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser on share sales in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based firm led Renault SA''s
sale of its 3 billion-euro ($4.1 billion) stake in Volvo last
month, the data show. </p>
<p>The Financial Times reported on Harfouche''s departure late
yesterday. </p>

<p>Walter Investment Management Corp.
may issue $220.5 million of securities backed mainly by
contracts used to finance residential construction, according to
a person familiar with the matter and a term sheet for the
transaction. </p>
<p>The sale of the securities, backed by a $324.2 million pool
of assets that also includes $61.2 million of residential
mortgages, is being managed by Bank of America Corp., according
to the person, who declined to be identified because terms
aren''t public, and to the document, which was provided to
Bloomberg by an investor. Whitney Finch, a spokesman for Walter
Investment, said the company couldn''t comment on the
securitization. </p>
<p>Contracts acquired by Walter Investment are typically tied
to stick-built structures, constructed traditionally, in the
southeastern U.S. by Jim Walter Homes and other builders
affiliated with it that extend the credit initially, said
Jeanetta M. Brown, its chief compliance officer. </p>
<p>It''s very similar to a traditional mortgage loan, but
it''s different in construct, she said today in a telephone
interview. In the event you need to foreclosure, it works
exactly like a mortgage. </p>
<p>The contracts are similar to lay-away plans used by stores.
They differ from traditional mortgages in that no money is paid
out by the creditor in the transactions, Brown said. They also
differ from so-called chattel paper in that they involve liens
on the underlying land, which is usually owned by consumers
before construction begins, she said. </p>
<p>Created Through Merger </p>
<p>Walter Investment, a real estate investment trust based in
Tampa, Florida, was created last year through a merger of the
company, which owns a mortgage lender, and Hanover Capital
Mortgage Holdings Inc. </p>
<p>Reuters reported the debt sale earlier today. </p>
<p>The most-senior $56.7 million portion of the securities
being marketed, which may receive a AAA rating from Standard 
Poor''s, may yield 200 basis points to 225 basis points more than
benchmark interest rate swaps, the person said. A $79.4 million
slice, which may be rated A, may sell at a spread of 375 basis
points to 400 basis points, the person said. </p>
<p>A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The average age of the underlying assets is 33 months and
their average interest rate is 9.1 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc., the
company that exited the largest U.S. real estate bankruptcy
yesterday, rose 6.7 percent in New York in its first day of
trading as solely a mall landlord. </p>
<p>General Growth retained its mall properties and spun off
its commercial and land-development business as part of the
reorganization. The real estate development company, Howard
Hughes Corp., began trading today on standalone basis. </p>
<p>They''re out, they''ve accomplished their near-term goal,
Bill Kavaler, an analyst at Oscar Gruss  Son Inc. in New York,
said of General Growth. We''ll see how it performs as a company
and a stock now that they''re out and on their own. </p>
<p>General Growth, the second largest U.S. shopping-mall
owner, plans to pay a regular quarterly dividend of about 10
cents a share starting next year, the Chicago-based company said
in a statement today. It will also pay a one-time dividend tied
to 2010 income, with 90 percent in shares and 10 percent in
cash. </p>
<p>The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in April 2009
after weighing itself down with $27 billion in debt that it was
unable to refinance because of the financial crisis and collapse
of the commercial mortgage-backed securities market. The
company''s restructuring plan provided a full recovery for
creditors and a rare recovery for shareholders. </p>
<p>Shopping Center Sale </p>
<p>General Growth rose 93 cents to $14.73 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading, after earlier reaching
$14.85. It was the biggest gain since July. Hughes Corp. shares
were at $36.90 on its first day of trading as an independent
company. </p>
<p>The landlord also said it agreed to sell the Gateway
Overlook Shopping Center in Columbia, Maryland. The $90 million
transaction will reduce General Growth''s debt by about $55
million. </p>
<p>General Growth said it decided to pay a $220million
settlement to the heirs of Howard Hughes in cash rather than
shares. General Growth also plans to pay off a $350 million loan
from Pershing Square Capital Management LLP in cash. </p>

<p>Robert C. Jones, who helped found
and lead Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s quantitative equity fund
management unit, is leaving after 24 years at the company,
according to an internal memo sent to employees today. </p>
<p>Jones, 54, will leave Goldman Sachs at the end of this
year, about a year after becoming an advisory director focused
on special research projects, the memo said. The contents of the
memo were confirmed by Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based bank. </p>
<p>Jones is the latest in a series of so-called quant
managers, who use mathematical models to trade securities, to
leave Goldman Sachs following losses at two funds in 2007.
Robert Litterman, who was chairman of the quantitative hedge-
fund group, left in January after 24 years at the firm. Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski, who were co-heads of the
quantitative investment group and the Global Alpha hedge fund,
quit in March 2009. </p>
<p>At the end of last year Goldman Sachs closed its Global
Equity Opportunities Fund, a quant hedge fund that required a $3
billion cash infusion in 2007, after it dwindled to $200 million
in assets from $7.5 billion, people familiar with the situation
said in January. It had been managed by Jones after Carhart and
Iwanowski left. </p>
<p>Katinka Domotorffy succeeded Carhart and Iwanowski as head
of the quatitative investment group and was assisted by Jones,
Kent Daniel and Bill Fallon. Domotorffy remains chief investment
officer and head of quantitative investment strategies and
Fallon remains co-chief investment officer of the team''s alpha
strategies and head of research, according to today''s memo. </p>
<p>Domotorffy also works alongside Don Mulvihill, co-chief
investment officer of the customized beta strategies team within
quantitative investment strategies. </p>
<p>Hired in 1987 </p>
<p>Jones was hired in 1987 into the company''s investment-
research department and became the founding head of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management''s global quantitative equity group in
1989, according to the memo. He stopped actively managing
portfolios in 2007, although he remained co-chief investment
officer of the so-called QIS equity business until the end of
2009. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported on Jones''s retirement
earlier today. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. reported third-
quarter net income of $2.16 billion, in line with preliminary
results given last week, as the largest U.S. automaker prepares
for an initial public offering. </p>
<p>Earnings before interest and taxes rose to $2.28 billion
from $2.03 billion during the previous three months of the year,
the Detroit-based company said today in a statement. Revenue was
$34.1 billion. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson, who took over from Ed Whitacre on Sept. 1, has said GM can make significant profit
even amid a U.S. auto sales rate that is running about 30
percent slower than before the financial crisis. The automaker,
61 percent owned by the U.S. government, reduced costs through
bankruptcy and is selling new cars for higher prices. </p>
<p>GM''s numbers were as advertised and they were good,
said Joe Phillippi, principal of consulting firm AutoTrends Inc.
in Short Hills, New Jersey. As they ramp up production --
assuming people like their cars -- in three to five years, they
could be hitting some much bigger numbers. </p>
<p>GM plans to raise as much as $10.6 billion by selling 365
million shares at $26 to $29 each, according to a Nov. 3 filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company also
will offer about $3 billion of preferred shares that later will
become common stock. GM has said the offering may price as soon
as Nov. 17. </p>
<p>North American Operations </p>
<p>The automaker''s North American operations had profit before
interest and taxes of $2.13 billion, a 33 percent increase from
the second quarter''s $1.59 billion. GM said production in the
region rose 33 percent to 707,000 vehicles, including a 51
percent gain in truck output. </p>
<p>They''ve grown in emerging markets and they continue to do
well in emerging markets, but North America was the anchor that
took them into bankruptcy, Dennis Virag, president of
Automotive Consulting Group in Ann Arbor, Michigan, said
yesterday in a telephone interview. How North America goes, so
goes GM. </p>
<p>GM is telling prospective investors that it can earn $19
billion before interest and taxes if U.S. vehicle sales return
to previous highs of around 17 million a year, said two people
familiar with the presentation. U.S. light-vehicle sales peaked
at 17.4 million in 2000. </p>
<p>Europe Loss </p>
<p>Earnings before interest and taxes at GM''s international
operations slipped 3.9 percent from the previous quarter to $646
million. The loss in the automaker''s European operations widened
to $559 million before interest and taxes, more than triple the
$160 million in the three months ended June 30. GM Europe lost
$1.2 billion on an Ebit basis in three quarters this year. </p>
<p>We know we have much more work to do, Akerson, 62, said
today on a conference call. We still need to fix Europe. We
continue to be vigilant in reducing cost in the enterprise, and
we have just started doing a better job in marketing our brands
to consumers. </p>
<p>The automaker generated $2.62 billion in cash from
operations and said it ended the quarter with $33.5 billion in
cash and marketable securities. </p>
<p>GM''s $34.1 billion in third-quarter revenue compares with
$25.1 billion in a year-earlier period that was nine days
shorter because the company was in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Fourth-Quarter Outlook </p>
<p>While earnings before interest and taxes will be positive
in the fourth quarter, they will be significantly lower than
the run rate in the first three quarters of the year, Akerson
said on the call. </p>
<p>GM said in its Nov. 3 regulatory filing that Ebit would be
lower than prior quarters because it will be building a
different mix of vehicles and engineering costs for future
models will be higher. GM is introducing the Chevrolet Volt gas-
electric car and Chevy Cruze compact during the quarter. </p>
<p>The company and its Chinese joint ventures are on pace to
sell 2 million vehicles this year in the world''s largest auto
market, GM said last week. GM''s partnerships, which include SAIC
Motor Corp. and Wuling Group, earned $1.1 billion of equity
income net of tax this year through Sept. 30. </p>
<p>GM will pay $51 million in cash and provide technical
services to raise its stake in Wuling to 44 percent, the company
said today in an updated filing of its IPO prospectus. </p>
<p>BRIC Share </p>
<p>The automaker emphasizes its presence in Brazil, Russia,
India and China in its IPO roadshow. GM says it has a 13 percent
consolidated market share in the so-called BRIC markets.
Volkswagen AG is second at 11.1 percent, according to GM. BRIC
markets are forecast to increase deliveries by 13.9 million by
2014, according to IHS Global Insight data. </p>
<p>From what we''re hearing, the roadshow has gone really
well, Geoffrey Tirman, president of Talisman Capital SA in
Chexbres, Switzerland, which manages $110 million, including
bonds that will convert into GM shares. My guess is there will
be a lot of secondary demand in the market, especially if they
keep the IPO priced low. </p>
<p>GM''s U.S. sales rose 6.6 percent to 1,818,274 through the
first 10 months, helped by demand for the Buick LaCrosse sedan
as well as the Chevrolet Equinox and Cadillac SRX sport-utility
vehicles, according to researcher Autodata Corp. Industrywide
sales rose 11 percent in the same period. </p>
<p>The average transaction prices on the LaCrosse, Equinox and
SRX in the third quarter increased $7,500, $3,900 and $900,
respectively, from the second quarter of 2009, GM said in a
presentation to investors related to its IPO. </p>
<p>GM has reduced U.S. hourly labor costs to an estimated $5
billion this year, from $16 billion in 2005, Chief Financial
Officer Chris Liddell said in the roadshow presentation. </p>
<p>Pensions Obligation </p>
<p>The company''s pension obligation was $29 billion as of
Sept. 30, according to a regulatory filing today. The obligation
was $26 billion as of June 30. The increase was due mostly to
lower discount rates, the company said. </p>
<p>GM dropped an underwriter for its IPO and preferred share
offering after one of the bank''s employees sent an unauthorized
e-mail to potential investors that may have violated securities
laws, according to the filing today. GM didn''t identify the
underwriter. </p>
<p>UBS AG of Zurich, listed as an underwriter in GM''s
preliminary filing on Oct. 28, was the only bank to be omitted
from its subsequent filings since the automaker set the terms of
its sale on Nov. 3. Kelly Smith, a UBS spokeswoman, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>If regulators determine that the e-mail constituted a
violation of the Securities Act of 1933, GM may be liable for
damages from buyers of the IPO or preferred offering that
received the message, today''s filing showed. </p>
<p>General Motors Financial Co., the finance unit that GM
acquired last month, said yesterday net income almost doubled to
$51.3 million in the three months through Sept. 30, from $25.8
million a year earlier. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to
pull all of its $120 million from Philip Falcone''s main hedge
fund after returns lagged behind peers and Falcone disclosed he
borrowed $113 million from a smaller fund that had suspended
redemptions, said three people briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>Falcone, 48, took the loan from the Harbinger Capital
Partners Special Situations Fund in October 2009 to pay personal
taxes, Bloomberg Markets Magazine reported in September. At the 
time, investors were barred from exiting the fund because it had 
assets tied up in the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings 
Inc. New York-based Harbinger Capital Partners disclosed the loan
in the fund''s March 12 financial statements. </p>
<p>The firm''s main Harbinger Capital Partners Fund tumbled 15
percent through Oct. 15, according to investors. As of
September, about 90 percent of the fund''s $3.4 billion in net
assets were tied up in wireless-telecommunications investments,
angering some clients who said the portfolio is too concentrated
and too skewed toward illiquid investments. </p>
<p>We are in an environment with scarce capital inflows so
if there is an additional risk factor from anywhere, including a
large client redeeming, allocators won''t take the risk of
ignoring it -- they at least have to look into it, said Howard Eisen, co-founder of New York-based FletcherBennett Group LLC, a
consultant to hedge funds. </p>
<p>Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman,
and Eliot Hoff, a spokesman for Harbinger, declined to comment. </p>
<p>$1 Billion Investment </p>
<p>Investors in Harbinger''s core fund are limited to taking
out 25 percent of their investments per quarter, so that a full
withdrawal is spread out over a year. Goldman will get back $30
million in January, and receive its final $30 million payment in
January 2012. </p>
<p>At the end of 2008, Goldman had $1 billion invested in two
Harbinger funds, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the funds are private. </p>
<p>Another investor in the core fund, the New York State
Common Retirement Fund, asked to redeem $41 million. Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for the state pension system, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Harbinger is winding down the Special Situations fund,
which had about $2 billion in assets as of September. Following
the fund''s suspension, clients representing 80 percent of assets
opted to redeem their investments earlier this year, and they
will get money back as the fund''s positions are sold. Remaining
clients will put their money into other Harbinger funds. </p>
<p>Harbinger''s Credit Distressed Blue Line Fund, started in
April 2009, has returned 12 percent this year, according to an
investor. The fund has pulled in $500 million in assets this
year, the person said. Distressed funds have jumped 8.7 percent,

<p>Citigroup Inc. won dismissal of most
claims in a shareholder lawsuit alleging that the bank lied
about its exposure to collateralized debt obligations and other
toxic assets. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein dismissed an array of
claims in the 536-page complaint against Citigroup, finding in
most cases that the plaintiffs failed to allege facts showing
the bank and its officials knew they were misleading investors. </p>
<p>The court finds that plaintiffs have stated a claim to
relief only with respect to alleged misstatements and omissions
occurring between February 2007 and April 2008 concerning
Citigroup''s collateralized debt obligation holdings, Stein
said in yesterday''s ruling in federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The plaintiffs, who sued in 2007, seek to represent all
investors who bought Citigroup stock from Jan. 1, 2004, to Jan.
15, 2009. They claim they lost money when the extent of
Citigroup''s losses on the investments became public. </p>
<p>Stein ruled that the shareholders failed to allege that the
bank and its officials knew they were acting fraudulently when
they made statements about a series of financial instruments
held by Citigroup, including residential-mortgage-backed
securities, subprime mortgages, structured investment vehicles,
collateralized loan obligations and auction-rate securities. </p>
<p>We are pleased the court has dismissed the great majority
of plaintiffs'' claims and substantially reduced the class period
at stake, Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement. She said the bank has strong
defenses to the remaining claims related to CDOs. </p>
<p>Ira M. Press, a lawyer for the investors, said he is
pleased Stein declined to dismiss claims related to Citigroup''s
CDO disclosures. The CDO claims form the lion''s share of the
allegations in the complaint, Press said. </p>
<p>Stein dismissed claims against seven of 14 current and
former Citigroup officials named in the suit. The remaining
seven, including former Chief Executive Officer Charles Prince,
attended meetings in the summer of 2007 to discuss Citigroup''s
CDO exposure, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>That defendants engaged in meetings concerning
Citigroup''s CDO risks is inconsistent with the company''s public
statements downplaying or concealing that risk, Stein wrote in
the opinion. </p>
<p>The case is In Re Citigroup Inc. Securities Litigation, 07-
cv-09901, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Icahn Seeks to Stop Lions Gate Director Voting Shares </p>
<p>Carl Icahn, who has made a hostile bid for Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp., told a judge through his lawyer he will
seek to block board member Mark Rachesky from voting his shares
at the studio''s Dec. 14 annual meeting. </p>
<p>Icahn, the billionaire chairman of New York-based Icahn
Enterprises LP, will file the motion to suspend Rachesky''s
voting power in New York state Supreme Court Nov. 15, attorney
Joseph DiBenedetto told Justice James Yates yesterday. </p>
<p>Icahn, 74, who is attempting to buy the independent film
and TV studio for $7.50 a share, sued Vancouver-based Lions Gate
in both Canada and New York in July to reverse an equity-for-
debt swap that increased Rachesky''s stake to almost 29 percent.
Icahn argues that management conspired with large shareholders
to thwart his bid. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court of British Columbia on Nov. 1 dismissed
the Canadian suit by Icahn to undo the deal. Icahn has appealed.
An appeals judge on Nov. 5 denied his request for an expedited
hearing. Lions Gate told the New York judge yesterday the
Canadian ruling supports its motion to dismiss the New York case
and said there is no reasonable basis for a court order against
Rachesky. </p>
<p>This court cannot rule in the Icahn Group''s favor without
holding that the British Columbia court got it wrong, Lions
Gate attorney William Savitt wrote in a letter yesterday to
Yates. This is precisely the situation that this court wished
to avoid when it noted at the September 17 conference that it
would drop this case like a hot potato'' in the event the
British Columbia court issued a clear ruling. </p>
<p>The case is Icahn v. Lions Gate, 651076/2010, New York state
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Toyota Lawyers Agree to Share Throttle Source Code </p>
<p>Toyota Motor Corp. agreed in court to turn over access to
technical data about its electronic throttle-control system that
is alleged to be the cause of some of the automaker''s sudden-
acceleration problems. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Toyota told a judge yesterday in federal court
in Santa Ana, California, that they will provide attorneys for
Toyota vehicle owners access to the source codes for the
system if the judge issues a confidentiality order covering the
company''s product and trade secrets. The source codes have been
at the center of disputes between the two sides during the
process of pre-trial evidence gathering. </p>
<p>We have no problem in turning this over providing we have
the proper protections in place, Toyota attorney Vincent
Galvin told U.S. District judge James V. Selna. </p>
<p>Galvin said the information already had been turned over
to the government before Congress held hearings over Toyota''s
problems earlier this year. He said it hadn''t been turned over
the plaintiffs yet because pre-trial discovery hadn''t reached
the stage in which Toyota was required to do so. </p>
<p>Mark Robinson, one of the lead plaintiffs'' lawyers, told
the judge the codes are vital in the case because they will
allow experts to analyze the throttle system and come up with
their own determination over whether flaws may have been a
factor in episodes of inadvertent acceleration. </p>
<p>We''ve been like someone standing outside a house with a
camera taking pictures of the house and knowing what it looks
like without knowing what it''s made up of inside, Robinson
told the judge. We need to analyze this data and see how it
related or didn''t relate to the recalls. </p>
<p>Toyota is facing about 400 lawsuits in which plaintiffs
claim they are due damages for injuries, death or loss of
vehicle value from sudden acceleration in several models of cars
made by Toyota. </p>
<p>The automaker is seeking dismissal of the suits at a
hearing scheduled for Nov. 19. </p>
<p>The cases are combined as In re Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,

<p>Verdicts/Settlements </p>
<p>Goldman, Natixis Settle Credit Default Swaps Lawsuit </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Natixis SA settled a London
lawsuit over terminated credit-default swaps that might have
been worth as much as $530 million after a delay in the trial
that was to begin yesterday. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Natixis are pleased they''ve reached a
commercial settlement, Goldman''s lawyer, Anthony Grabiner,
said in court. The terms are confidential and Grabiner said
neither side would make any further public statements on the
agreement. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank''s London unit, Goldman Sachs International,
sued Natixis in July to stop the termination of three credit-
default swaps. Natixis, a unit of BPCE SA, France''s second-
largest lender by branches, said in July it would terminate the
swaps because Goldman didn''t comply with the contract. </p>
<p>The French investment bank countersued in September,
seeking a ruling that it ended the deal lawfully, as well as
breach of contract damages. Natixis said it was ready, willing
and able to pay Goldman $198.4 million on the lawfully and
validly terminated credit-default swaps. </p>
<p>Goldman, the most profitable firm in Wall Street history,
disputed Natixis''s calculation in court papers. </p>
<p>The case is Goldman Sachs International v. Natixis, 10-880,
High Court of Justice, Queen''s Bench Division (London). </p>

<p>Air France, BA, Carriers Get $1.1 Billion EU Cartel Fines </p>
<p>Air France-KLM Group, British Airways Plc and SAS Group AB
were among 11 carriers fined a total of 799.4 million euros
($1.1 billion) by European Union regulators for fixing cargo
fees. </p>
<p>Air France and its units got the biggest fine of 339.6
million euros. British Airways was fined 104 million euros and
SAS Group AB got a 70.2 million-euro penalty, the European
Commission said. Cargolux Airlines International SA, Europe''s
third-biggest air-freight carrier, was fined 79.9 million euros. </p>
<p>It is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated
their pricing to the detriment of European businesses and
European consumers, EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin
Almunia said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The EU fines come three years after regulators sent
complaints to 26 airlines, following coordinated antitrust raids
across the world that led to jail terms for some executives,
fines and settlements. U.S. authorities have already fined 18
airlines at least $1.6 billion and filed criminal charges
against 14 executives for price-fixing. </p>
<p>Air France''s fine exceeds the company''s total provisions
for the case, spokeswoman Brigitte Barrand said. From 530
million euros set aside as a provision in 2008, Air France-KLM
had already paid out almost 330 million euros in fines and
class-action awards in the U.S., Canada and Australia, she said
in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>British Airways said in an e-mailed statement its fine was
within the provision made by the company in its 2006/7 report
and accounts. </p>
<p>SAS, owner of Scandinavia''s biggest airline, said that it
will appeal its fine. </p>
<p>SAS believes that it has not been involved in a global
cartel and that therefore, the fines are disproportionate, it
said in a statement to the Stockholm stock exchange. </p>
<p>Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Europe''s second-largest airline,
wasn''t fined because it was the first to inform on the cartel,
the EU''s antitrust agency said. </p>

<p>New Suits </p>
<p>Massachusetts Sues Viel  Cie. Unit for Bid-Rigging </p>
<p>Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley sued a New
York-based broker for rigging bids of municipal-bond investment
contracts, allowing banks to profit at taxpayer expense. </p>
<p>Tradition (North America) Inc., a unit of Paris-based
broker Viel  Cie., worked for the state between 2000 and 2004
and was supposed to get the highest interest rates from banks on
investments of municipal-bond proceeds, Coakley said yesterday
in a statement. Instead, Tradition ran sham auctions, allowing
favored bidders to win deals at below-market rates, she said. </p>
<p>Tradition''s conduct here is very troubling, Coakley
said. By fixing the bids, Tradition ensured that favored
providers would get business from the state while also short-
changing Massachusetts, the state said. The lawsuit parallels a
probe by federal investigators into how such investment
contracts were obtained by banks nationwide. </p>
<p>Massachusetts''s college-building authority and development
finance agency are among 160 state and local government bond
issuers that the U.S. Justice Department''s antitrust division
has said were victims of bid-rigging by 16 banks, according to
documents filed in a criminal case. </p>
<p>A former Tradition agent has pleaded guilty in the Justice
Department probe. The U.S. inquiry centers on guaranteed
investment contracts, known as GICs, which municipalities buy
with money raised by selling bonds. The investments let them
earn a return on the cash until the funds are needed for
schools, roads and other public works. </p>
<p>Tradition has acted in accordance with the law, said
Dan Webb, a lawyer for Tradition with Winston  Strawn LLP in
Chicago. The charges against Tradition are unfounded and will
be contested vigorously. </p>

<p>Ex-Glaxo Lawyer Charged With Making False Statements </p>
<p>A former in-house attorney for GlaxoSmithKline Plc was
charged with obstruction and making false statements during a
U.S. investigation into unapproved uses of its antidepressant
drug Wellbutrin SR. </p>
<p>Lauren Stevens, of Durham, North Carolina, was accused
yesterday in an indictment of impeding an inquiry in 2002 and
2003 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration into the marketing
of the drug for uses not approved by the FDA. Stevens was a vice
president and associate general counsel for London-based Glaxo. </p>
<p>Stevens signed letters to the FDA making false statements
and hid the extent of the company''s promotion of the drug for
unapproved uses, including weight loss, according to the
indictment. She withheld that the company paid a Vermont
physician to speak at 511 promotional events in 2001 and 2002 to
discuss off-label uses and also paid Michigan doctor to give 488
talks, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>There is a difference between legal advocacy based on the
facts and distorting the facts to cover up the truth, Carmen
Ortiz, U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, said yesterday in a
statement. Federal agencies such as the FDA cannot protect the
public health if entities and individuals they regulate provide
false information. </p>
<p>The indictment doesn''t identify the company or the drug by
name. Glaxo spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne confirmed in an e-mail
that Stevens worked in the legal department and is now retired,
and the drug was Wellbutrin SR. </p>
<p>Lauren Stevens is an utterly decent and honorable
woman, her lawyer, Brien T. O''Connor of Ropes  Gray LLP, said
in an e-mailed statement. She is not guilty of obstruction or
of making false statements. Everything she did in this case was
consistent with ethical lawyering and the advice provided her by
a nationally prominent law firm retained by her employer
specifically because of its experience in working with FDA. </p>
<p>Stevens told the FDA she would collect materials about
Glaxo''s promotion of the drug, which was approved only for a
single use, the treatment of a major depressive disorder in
patients age 18 or older, according to the indictment. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Stevens, 10-cr-694, U.S. District
Court, District of Maryland (Greenbelt). </p>

<p>BGC Capital Markets Sues Tullett for Misuse of Data </p>
<p>BGC Capital Markets LP sued Tullett Prebon Americas Corp.
over claims it misused proprietary U.S. Treasury data that
earned it profits of at least hundreds of millions of
dollars. </p>
<p>BGC Capital, based in New York, and Tullett Americas
operate in the competitive interdealer broker industry. BGC
accuses Tullett and its affiliates of misappropriating price
data derived from the electronic brokering eSpeed system to
generate profits in the market for historically unregulated
financial instruments, such as swaps, according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>More than $400 billion is traded daily on the eSpeed
system, which is operated by BGC affiliates, according to the
complaint filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan. Under contract, the U.S. Treasury data has been
provided to a Tullett Americas affiliate. That contract
prohibits the use of the real-time data by their brokers, who
unfairly use it to compete against BGC, according to the suit. </p>
<p>Because defendant''s brokers compete directly with
plaintiff''s brokers, profits earned by defendant by brokering
based on misappropriated data were earned improperly and at
plaintiff''s expense, BGC said in its complaint. </p>
<p>Stephanie Kuffner, an outside spokeswoman for Tullett,
didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>The case is BGC Capital Markets LP v. Tullett Prebon
Americas Corp., 651954/2010, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Sues Peak Ridge Fund Over $40.3 Million Loss </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley sued a Peak Ridge Capital Group LLC fund for
$40.3 million in losses this year tied to natural gas futures
trades. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Nov. 8 in the Manhattan federal court,
seeks damages as well as legal and other fees stemming from
Morgan Stanley''s role as the futures broker for Boston-based
Peak Ridge. </p>
<p>The Peak Ridge account lost $9.8 million in natural gas
trades on June 4, according to the lawsuit, after which Morgan
Stanley increased the amount of cash it required the firm to
post to back its trades, known as margin. The bank declared the
fund in default later in June after Peak Ridge failed to meet
its new margin requirements. During the next two weeks, Morgan
Stanley sold off the positions and incurred substantial
losses, the lawsuit said. </p>
<p>Peak Ridge was previously advised by Brian Hunter, the
former Amaranth Advisors LLC natural-gas trader who lost $6.6
billion in 2006. Hunter does not work at Peak Ridge, said
Shauna MacDonald, a spokeswoman for Hunter. She declined to
comment further on his employment at the company. Calls to
Michael McNally, Peak Ridge''s chief executive officer, and Laura
Small, a spokeswoman, weren''t returned. </p>
<p>Peak Ridge used Hunter to devise trading models and
strategies. The Peak Ridge Commodity Volatility Fund, for
example, seeks to profit from price differences in the natural-
gas market. The company also bought the assets of Solengo
Capital Advisors, a hedge-fund firm that Hunter tried to start
six months after Amaranth''s collapse in September 2006. </p>
<p>In 2006, Hunter had bet that the difference between the
price of natural gas for 2007 March and April contracts would
widen. Instead, the spread narrowed, creating losses for
Amaranth. </p>

<p>Ex-Societe Generale Employee Stole Code, Jury Told </p>
<p>A former Societe Generale SA trader stole computer code for
high-frequency trading from the company, a U.S. federal
prosecutor said in opening statements at the start of a trial in
New York. </p>
<p>The defendant, Samarth Agrawal, stole valuable, closely
guarded trading code from his employer, Societe Generale,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Brown told the jury. </p>
<p>Agrawal was charged in April with theft of trade secrets.
The government said he made copies of part of the code he had
access to and more code that he wasn''t supposed to have. He
faces as much as 10 years in prison if convicted. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff is presiding over the
trial. </p>
<p>Agrawal was hired in 2007 in New York by the Paris-based
bank to be a quantitative analyst in the high-frequency trading
group, the government said. </p>

<p>Glaxo Failed to Warn About Paxil''s Risks, Lawyer Says </p>
<p>GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the U.K.''s largest drugmaker, failed
to properly warn consumers that its antidepressant drug Paxil
could cause birth defects, a lawyer for the family of an injured
teenager told jurors. </p>
<p>Glaxo officials had research from the 1980s showing Paxil
caused deaths among the offspring of animal test subjects and
didn''t provide clear warnings about those deaths, Kimberly
Baden, a lawyer for Anna Blyth and her family, told a
Philadelphia jury. Baden said the drug caused a narrowing of the
aorta leading from the heart of Anna, now 14 years old. </p>
<p>We believe the evidence will show Paxil caused Anna''s
birth defects, Baden said in opening statements in the trial.
We believe the warnings and instructions put out in 1995
weren''t appropriate and reasonable. </p>
<p>The Blyth family''s case is the first over Paxil''s birth-
defect risks to go to trial since the company agreed in July to
pay more than $1 billion to settle 800 cases alleging the
company failed to adequately warn consumers and their doctors
about the drug''s hazards. The Blyth case wasn''t part of the
settlement. </p>
<p>Glaxo officials contend Paxil played no role in Anna''s
heart defects. They were most likely caused by genetics or the
fact that her mother became pregnant late in life, Chilton
Varner, a lawyer for the drugmaker, told jurors in her opening
statement. </p>
<p>Sarah Alspach, a Glaxo spokeswoman, didn''t return a call
for comment on how many Paxil birth-defect cases remain
outstanding. </p>

Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). </p>

<p>Consumer Arbitration Case Divides U.S. Supreme Court </p>
<p>U.S. Supreme Court justices, wrestling with an arbitration
case involving an ATT Inc. unit, debated how much ability
companies should have to prevent customers from banding together
to press legal claims. </p>
<p>In an hour-long hearing in Washington yesterday, the
justices signaled that they are likely to divide in the case,
which stems from $30.22 in sales taxes charged to two California
consumers. </p>
<p>Business groups say states are undermining the cost savings
arbitration offers by requiring that customers be allowed to
press claims as a class. In the case before the justices, a
federal appeals court invalidated the class-action ban in ATT
Mobility LLC''s customer contracts, saying the provision was
unconscionable under California law. </p>
<p>Several members of the court yesterday indicated they were
hesitant to second-guess California''s rules designed to protect
consumers from one-sided contracts. Who are we to say that the
state is wrong about that? Justice Elena Kagan asked. </p>
<p>Other justices suggested that California might be violating
a federal law that requires states to treat arbitration
agreements the same as any other contract. Chief Justice John
Roberts said the state was evaluating the fairness of
arbitration accords using a different mode of analysis than
I''m familiar with under basic contract law. </p>
<p>The case could affect tens of millions of arbitration
agreements in California alone, according to ATT. Amazon.com
Inc., Earthlink Inc., DirecTV Inc., Comcast Corp., Dell Inc. and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce all filed briefs supporting ATT in
the case. </p>

<p>Money Manager Barry Ran Ponzi Scheme, Jury Is Told </p>
<p>A money manager from Brooklyn, New York, ran a 30-year
Ponzi scheme that defrauded hundreds of investors, a federal
prosecutor told jurors at the start of his securities-fraud
trial. </p>
<p>Philip Barry, 53, a resident of the Bay Ridge section of
Brooklyn, began accepting money in 1978 from investors,
guaranteeing fictional annual profits, according to prosecutors
in the office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in Brooklyn.
Instead, he used new investors'' money to pay earlier ones,
prosecutors said. </p>
<p>This is a case about a con man, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Jeffrey A. Goldberg told jurors in his opening statement. The
Ponzi schemer simply takes money out of one investor''s pocket
and puts it into another investor''s pocket. </p>
<p>Michael Weil, a lawyer for Barry, told jurors in his
opening statement, Your house will always go up in value.''
Philip Barry bought into that same myth, that you can''t lose
money in real estate. </p>
<p>Goldberg told the jury that Barry''s business was a fake
but his victims were very real. He said victims were scheduled
to testify. </p>
<p>In a separate action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said Barry diverted some of the investor money to a
mail-order pornography business. On Sept. 7, Barry sued the SEC
for libel over the accusation. He has run Barry Publications for
30 years, selling vinyl LP records, music cassette tapes,
compact discs and DVDs, he said. </p>
<p>The criminal case is U.S. v. Barry, 09-cr-0833, the SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Barry, 09-cv-3860,
and Barry''s suit against the SEC is Barry v. United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, 10-cv-4071, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). </p>

<p>Singapore Seeks 12-Week Jail Term for U.K. Author </p>
<p>A Singapore prosecutor urged a judge to jail British author
Alan Shadrake for at least 12 weeks for disparaging the city-
state''s judiciary in a book. </p>
<p>Prosecutor Hema Subramaniam said at a sentencing hearing
yesterday that Shadrake was insincere in his half-hearted
attempt at an apology and deserved to be jailed for contempt
of court. </p>
<p>Shadrake, 76, challenged the impartiality of Singapore''s
judiciary in the book Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore''s
Justice in the Dock, accusing courts of bowing to political
and economic pressures and dispensing justice unequally to the
rich and the poor. </p>
<p>Shadrake alleged grave misconduct by the city state''s
courts, High Court Judge Quentin Loh said in his Nov. 3 decision
to convict the author for contempt. The book contained half-
truths and selective facts; sometimes even outright
falsehoods, Loh said then. </p>
<p>The judge said he would give Shadrake a final opportunity
to make amends when he convicted the author. Loh yesterday
reserved his decision on a sentence until Nov. 16. </p>
<p>The writer, dressed in a beige linen suit, showed
continued defiance of the Singapore judiciary, Subramaniam
said. She cited the writer''s comments to media that he wouldn''t
apologize and would continue fighting for freedom and democracy. </p>
<p>Shadrake declined to comment after the hearing. </p>
<p>The case is Attorney-General v. Alan Shadrake OS720/2010 in
the Singapore High Court. </p>

<p>Oil-Industry Suit on U.S. Drilling Rules Set for Trial </p>
<p>A New Orleans judge will conduct a two-day bench trial next
year in an oil industry lawsuit claiming U.S. regulators
continue to stall deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman, after a closed-door
meeting yesterday with lawyers in three lawsuits challenging the
Obama administration''s offshore drilling policy, said he would
try two of the cases next year in New Orleans federal court. </p>
<p>Trial will commence on Monday, July 25, 2011, at 9:00
a.m. without a jury, Feldman said in an order handed down
yesterday in a suit by Ensco Offshore Co. against the
administration''s second drilling ban. </p>
<p>Feldman also said he would conduct a separate two-day bench
trial Oct. 11 on remaining claims in a separate industry lawsuit
against the first U.S. drilling ban, which President Barack
Obama imposed in May after the BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico. </p>
<p>That lawsuit, by Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC., was
joined by the state of Louisiana and more than 200 regional
business and trade groups who claimed U.S. Interior Secretary
Kenneth Salazar improperly restricted exploration in waters
deeper than 500 feet. Feldman struck down the initial ban in
late June, calling it overly broad and punitive to the Gulf
Coast economy. </p>
<p>Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz and Ken
Dennard, one of Hornbeck''s attorneys, declined in e-mails to
comment on the judge''s order. Ensco Vice President Sean O''Neill
didn''t respond to a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>The cases are Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-1941,
and Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-01663,
both in U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New

<p>Investors should end bets that
Italian 10-year government bonds will rise relative to
equivalent-maturity French debt after the yield spread between
the two securities widened. </p>
<p>Sovereign spreads will, in our view, remain volatile into
year-end, and the risk-reward of our recommended trade to be
long 10-year Italy versus France has diminished,Francesco Garzarelli, chief interest-rate strategist at Goldman Sachs in
London. We would now recommend closing this position, looking
to explore opportunities in the same direction at a later
stage. </p>
<p>The Italian-French 10-year yield spread was at 115 basis
points as of 12:35 p.m. in London, compared with 117 basis
points when Goldman initiated the trade on Sept. 3. The spread
narrowed to 95 basis points on Oct. 26.    </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, recommended buying
contracts of European gasoil for settlement in January 2011 on
the basis that diesel shortages in China will continue. </p>
<p>Chinese supplies of diesel, a category of fuel that
includes gasoil, will be restricted until the end of this year
as a result of Premier Wen Jiabao''s five-year plan to reduce
energy consumption, Goldman said. China''s policy of cutting
electricity supplies in order to reach the target has led some
consumers to boost power production from diesel-fired
generators, according to the bank. </p>
<p>We expect China to export significantly less diesel and
start to import once again, analysts led by David Greely in
New York said in a report today. We expect this to tighten the
gasoil market, making it the leading edge of the oil complex. </p>
<p>Gasoil for January delivery was last at $754.50 a ton on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange, having advanced 4.7 percent in
the past month. </p>
<p>Goldman closed a separate recommendation to buy December
contracts of crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The bank
said the trade, first suggested on Feb. 5, would have given a
profit of $8.97 a barrel, or 11.5 percent, to investors. Futures
for December delivery last traded at $86.34 a barrel as of 11:16
a.m. London time. </p>
<p>Oil prices will be substantially higher by 2012 as the
global stockpile surplus shrinks and excess production capacity
drops, Goldman said in a note dated yesterday. </p>

<p>General Electric Co., which aims to
to expand its Turkish energy business as the state sells power
assets, may revive a plan developed before the 2008 credit
crisis to build wind turbines in the country. </p>
<p>Local unit General Elektrik Ticaret  Servis AS may start
manufacturing turbines and so-called nacelle casings, with half
the output likely to be sold within Turkey as the government
targets a 20-fold increase in wind capacity by 2020, said Mete Maltepe, head of GE''s local energy unit. </p>
<p>Turkish companies have been going overseas to buy wind-
generation equipment because they relied on export insurers such
as Euler Hermes SA, the world''s largest insurer of trade credit,
when financing was scarce. Generators will be more likely to buy
domestically as the global recovery takes hold and more loan
facilities become available, Maltepe said. </p>
<p>If the number of companies that need financing through
export insurers such as Hermes falls, and we do expect it to
change, then we may dust off plans to make the equipment in
Turkey, he said. We are ready for that. </p>
<p>GE will expand its energy business in Turkey and keep
overall investment in the nation the same even after the sale of
a stake in the country''s second largest bank, Kursat Ozkan, head
of GE''s Turkish operations, said Oct. 1. </p>
<p>GE agreed to sell 18.6 percent of Turkiye Garanti Bankasi
AS to Spain''s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA for $3.78
billion as part of a global effort to reduce financial assets,
The Fairfield, Connecticut-based company said Nov. 2. </p>
<p>Government Target </p>
<p>GE wants to generate significant business as Turkey
increases wind power capacity to 20,000 megawatts by 2020 from
less than 1,000 megawatts now, Maltepe said. Currently GE gets
turbine wings and poles from Turkish producers. </p>
<p>GE has provided about 8,000 megawatts, or 17 percent, of
Turkey''s power capacity, mainly with gas and steam turbines and
some wind turbines, Maltepe said. GE turbines account for about
30 percent of total generation, he said. </p>
<p>A planned government incentive of 5.5 euro cents a
kilowatt-hour to wind power producers needs to be increased to
at least 7.5 cents to justify investments, he said. The subsidy
is awaiting parliamentary approval. </p>
<p>The draft guarantees a price of 5.5 euro cents per
kilowatt-hour for wind and hydroelectric power and 10 cents for
solar energy, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said in Ankara.
Companies are already investing in wind power at those levels
and they''re investable figures, he said. </p>
<p>Wind turbine prices, which fell during the global economic
crisis, have steadied and will start rising unless other, less
costly sources of renewable energy are developed, Maltepe said. </p>
<p>Middle East </p>
<p>GE Energy Financial Services, a GE unit, bought half of
Ankara-based Gama Enerji AS in 2007 and announced plans to
invest at least $4 billion until 2015 to build 3,000 megawatts
of power plants in Turkey and the Middle East. GE will invest in
energy by itself or with a partner as Turkey expects to double
national power capacity to 90,000 megawatts in 10 years, said
Orkan, GE''s country chief. </p>
<p>The company will seek to tap a market for so-called smart
grids that may be worth $2 billion after the government sells
off electricity distribution assets, Maltepe said. The
government will raise as much as $16 billion from the sale of 20
electricity grids, due to be completed by the end of this year,
Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said Oct. 12. </p>
<p>We don''t expect new operators of the grids to immediately
start seeking smart grid systems as they will first have to deal
with the existing network improvements, Maltepe said. We are
already in talks with four or five companies on this but we
expect the real interest in smart grids within two years. </p>
<p>Smart grids use digital technology to optimize power use.
Siemens AG and Areva SA are the main competitors in this market,
Maltepe said. </p>
<p>GE''s energy unit may buy Turkish companies that make
equipment for low- and medium-voltage transmission networks,
Maltepe said. We are looking around and in talks for this but
we don''t know when the talks will conclude. </p>

<p>China is accelerating the yuan''s
appreciation as part of the grand bargain to win U.S.
support for Beijing to gain a bigger say at the International
Monetary Fund, says Goldman Sachs Asset Management''s Jim O''Neill. </p>
<p>China''s yuan, known as the renminbi, reached the strongest
level against the dollar since 1993 ahead of a Group of 20
leaders meeting this week in Seoul. The gain came after the
IMF''s executive board approved a plan that would make China the
third-strongest member in the organization, a position described
by the fund''s chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn as allowing Beijing
to take more responsibility in the global economy. </p>
<p>People forget, but the currency has risen by 3 percent
since the summer and has risen nearly 25 percent over five
years, said O''Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset, in an
interview on Bloomberg Television. It''s not a fluke that
China is given a bigger share at the Washington-based IMF, and
that''s part of the grand bargain, he said. </p>
<p>O''Neill, who was returning from a nine-day trip to Asia,
including China, also said it''s ridiculous to claim that
countries around the world are engaging in a currency war.
Brazil''s Finance Minister Guido Mantega used the war term in
September to complain that countries from the U.S., China to
Japan are pushing to weaken their currencies to gain an export
edge. </p>
<p>The whole currency war thing is ridiculous, said
O''Neill. A true currency war will surely be one where the U.S.
bought renminbi. I know this is a great term for people in the
media, but it doesn''t really make sense to me at all. </p>
<p>Yuan High </p>
<p>The yuan rose as much as 0.2 percent to 6.6330 a dollar
today, the strongest level since China unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trading System. The yuan will rise faster than
the 3 percent traders are betting on in the non-deliverable
forwards, according to O''Neill. </p>
<p>Acting on an Oct. 23 deal by finance chiefs of the G-20
nations, the IMF agreed last week to shift more than 6 percent
of voting rights to developing countries, while weakening the
clout of European members including Belgium and Germany. The
plan may have an influence on the behavior of the Chinese
authorities, Managing Director Strauss-Kahn told reporters in
Washington on Nov. 6. </p>
<p>No Banking Crisis </p>
<p>O''Neill, 53, created the BRICs acronym in 2001 to describe
the rising power of large emerging markets in Brazil, Russia,
India and China. He was named chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management in September after working as the co-head of global
economics research and chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. since 1995. </p>
<p>In the interview, O''Neill also rebuffed speculation that
China may have a banking crisis as the government boosts lending
to stimulate growth during the financial crisis. Harvard
University professor Kenneth Rogoff said in July China''s
property market had begun a collapse that would hit the
nation''s banking system. Fund managers including James Chanos
and Marc Faber also have warned of a crash if a property bubble
isn''t averted. </p>
<p>People in New York seem to be worried about some kind of
Chinese bank crisis, said O''Neill. That''s just nave. The
Chinese government owns the Chinese banks. Every time I go, I
keep searching for all these things that could go wrong
especially because people are telling me every week. But I
didn''t see much of it. </p>
<p>China is moving to reduce its current account surplus in
the share of its economy, a move that the U.S. Treasury endorses,
said O''Neill. It is the U.S. lawmakers who are intensifying the
tension between the two countries, he added. </p>
<p>The House of Representatives on Sept. 29 passed a bill to
let U.S. companies impose punitive duties on Chinese products to
compensate for a weak yuan. </p>
<p>The relations between the Treasury and China are very
good, said O''Neill. The problem is something called Congress.
The U.S. politicians need to understand that there''s plenty of
scope for another big guy on the block as well as themselves. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co., the world''s biggest
media company, said fourth-quarter profit fell 6.7 percent,
missing analysts'' estimates, after a shift in income from cable
operators whose payments were recorded earlier in the year. </p>
<p>Net income shrank to $835 million, or 43 cents a share,
from $895 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Excluding
one-time items, profit fell to 45 cents, compared with 47-cent
average of 25 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Disney recorded revenue from pay-TV services for ESPN in
the quarter ended June 30, sooner than in 2009, resulting in a
drop in the latest period. The film studio posted a profit of
$104 million, reversing a year-ago loss, on box-office sales of
Toy Story 3 and revenue from the Iron Man 2 DVD. </p>
<p>On the revenue side, the big miss was at the media
networks, with both broadcast and cable segments weaker than we
expected, said David Joyce, an analyst at Miller Tabak  Co.
in New York who recommends buying the stock. On the operating
income side, the biggest miss was at the film studio, where we
expected more based on the strength of Toy Story 3.'' </p>
<p>Sales fell 1.3 percent to $9.74 billion in the period ended
Oct. 2, missing the $10 billion average of 20 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Results included a
restructuring cost of $58 million, or 2 cents a share. </p>
<p>Disney, also the world''s biggest theme-park operator, rose
68 cents to $36.60 in extended trading. The stock dropped $1.06
to $35.93 in regular New York Stock Exchange composite trading
after the report was released early. Disney has advanced 11
percent this year. The company said it is investigating how the
information became available. </p>
<p>Cable Advertising </p>
<p>Revenue from cable networks, including ESPN and Disney
Channel, slid 6.2 percent to $3.13 billion because of the shift
in pay-TV revenue. Income dropped 28 percent to $1.07 billion,
also a result of the swing. </p>
<p>ESPN advertising sales rose 19 percent in the quarter,
Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a conference call.
Fees paid by cable operators increased 9 percent in the period
and 10 percent for the year, he said. Those fees will be higher
in fiscal 2011. </p>
<p>Operating profit at the broadcasting division, led by the
ABC network and local TV stations, jumped to $147 million from
$2 million a year earlier. Revenue slid 7.5 percent to $1.29
billion, the company said. Adjusted for the extra week, ad sales
at Disney''s ABC stations was 26 percent higher than a year ago,
the company said. </p>
<p>Toy Story'' DVD </p>
<p>Toy Story 3 and DVD revenue from Iron Man 2
contributed the bulk of the film studio''s $104 million in
operating profit, compared with a $13 million loss a year ago.
Toy Story 3, the biggest U.S. movie of the year, has
collected $1.06 billion in worldwide box-office sales, according
to Box Office Mojo, an industry website. Studio revenue
increased 6.4 percent to $1.59 billion. </p>
<p>Toy Story 3 DVD sales will do quite well, Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said on the call, without
providing a specific estimate. He said 25 percent of Toy Story
3 buyers have opted for Blu-Ray versions and of those
customers, 80 percent chose more expensive discs that come with
a digital copy of the movie, he said. </p>
<p>Theme-park revenue declined almost 1 percent to $2.82
billion as the company continued to reduce bargains used during
the U.S. recession to bolster attendance. Profit fell 8.1
percent to $316 million. </p>
<p>Attendance at U.S. theme parks fell 6 percent in the
period. Adjusted for the extra week, attendance would have risen
1 percent, Rasulo said. Advance bookings at its U.S. operations
are 5 percent higher than a year earlier, he said. </p>
<p>Capital Spending </p>
<p>The company said capital spending will rise by $1 billion
in fiscal 2011 due to theme park expansion and the addition of
new cruise ships. The company spent $2.11 billion in the year
just ended. Disney also expects retirement costs to rise by $100
million this fiscal year. </p>
<p>Disney''s consumer products unit increased profit 22 percent
to $184 million as sales grew 13 percent to $730 million. The
interactive unit narrowed its loss to $104 million as revenue
gained 20 percent to $188 million. </p>
<p>Iger said Disney is investing less in producing console
games and more in casual online video games. The company is
focused on making its interactive division profitable, he said. </p>
<p>I would be disappointed if we continue to lose a
significant amount of money in those businesses, and if we do, I
would imagine we will have to redirect in some form, Iger
said. We don''t want to be in this business if we''re not going
to be able to make money. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe''s
third-biggest insurer, said quarterly profit rose 13 percent as
earnings at its life-insurance unit increased. </p>
<p>Net income climbed to 440 million euros ($602 million) in
the third quarter from 390 million euros a year earlier, the
Trieste, Italy-based company said in a statement today. That
missed the 467 million-euro average estimate of 14 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Generali reiterated that it expects to
report higher full-year operating margins and a rise in net
income compared with 2009. </p>
<p>Operating results this year will be near 4.2 billion
euros, at the upper end of the target, Chief Financial Officer
Raffaele Agrusti said during a conference call today. The
company''s full-year target for operating profit is between 3.6
billion euros and 4.2 billion euros. </p>
<p>Earnings at European insurers are improving as bond and
equity markets rebound following the global financial crisis.
Generali Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto is trying
to expand in emerging markets and eastern Europe to boost
profitability at the insurer. </p>
<p>Generali fell 2.6 percent to 15.49 euros in Milan, giving
the company a market value of about 24.1 billion euros. The
Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index has risen 2 percent this
year, compared with Generali''s 18 percent decline. </p>
<p>Life Business </p>
<p>Generali reported a solid set of results driven by strong
growth in life inflows, said Fabrizio Croce, an analyst at
Kepler Capital Markets in Zurich who has a hold
recommendation on the stock. </p>
<p>Operating profit from life insurance rose 29 percent to 733
million euros in the period, while gross premiums in the unit
fell 1.8 percent to 10.9 billion euros. </p>
<p>The rebound of equity markets in the third quarter boosted
Generali''s capital position, with a 6 percent increase in
shareholders'' equity to 18.2 billion euros. </p>
<p>Generali doesn''t plan to change its dividend policy for
2010, Agrusti said. The insurer paid a cash dividend of 35
cents last year. </p>
<p>Non-Life Worsening </p>
<p>Agrusti expects that 2010 operating profit in the non-life
business will be at the lower part of the range of the company''s
forecast of 1.4 billion euros to 1.8 billion euros, because of
rising claims related to catastrophes. The loss ratio, or the
ratio between premiums and claims settled by a company, is about
2.2 percent, one percentage point more than the original
forecast, he said. </p>
<p>The company''s spending on claims and other costs as a
percentage of premiums, also known as the combined ratio,
worsened to 98.8 percent in the first nine months from 97.9
percent a year earlier, Generali said. A ratio above 100 percent
means an insurer''s claims and costs exceed premium income,
giving it a loss from underwriting. </p>
<p>The non-life segment was hurt this year by rising
catastrophic events, including the Xynthia windstorm, floods in
France and Eastern Europe and the earthquake in Chile, Agrusti
said. </p>
<p>The non-life business recorded gross premiums of 4.8
billion euros in the third quarter, up from 4.6 billion euros a
year earlier. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
clients exit a bet that Hong Kong-listed companies in China will
gain on concern the central bank will raise borrowing costs to
tame inflation. </p>
<p>Investors who followed the New York-based firm''s advice
would have earned a return of 11.3 percent as the Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of 40 companies rose above 14,000 from
12,616.01 since April 1, when the trade was initiated, analysts
Robin Brooks and Dominic Wilson wrote in a research note today.
The recommendation was among the nine Top Trades Goldman
Sachs made for 2010. </p>
<p>China''s annual inflation rate jumped to a two-year high of
4.4 percent in October while retail sales rose 18.6 percent from
a year earlier, the statistics bureau said today. China
increased reserve requirements for some banks twice yesterday,
taking the total increase to 100 basis points for a few lenders,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>Inflation is above policy makers'' comfort zone and more
tightening will likely occur, the New York-based analysts
wrote in the report. The near-term risk-reward for this
position also looks unappealing as we approach the year-end
roll-off,'' they said. </p>
<p>The gain of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong beat the 2.7
percent increase in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index and 10.8
percent advance in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 22
developing nations during the period. China overtook Japan to
become the second-largest economy in the world in the second
quarter. </p>
<p>Higher Reserve Requirements </p>
<p>The H-share index reached 14,204.13 on Nov. 8, the
strongest level since May 2008, and closed at 14,088.03 today.
Goldman Sachs had a target of 15,000 for the trade
recommendation. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs has closed four of the nine Top trades,
including two money-losing ones. </p>
<p>Clients following the bank''s advice would have lost 24
basis points trading interest-rate swaps for the U.K. and
Australia and lost 168 basis points in cross-currency swaps in
Turkey. The advice of buying credit-default swaps in Spain and
selling similar contracts in Ireland returned 2.9 percent. </p>
<p>Profitable Advice </p>
<p>Three of the five remaining recommendations are poised to
be profitable, including buying Russian stocks, wagering a rally
in currencies tied to growth and a trade involving U.S. stock
volatility. </p>
<p>The trade of buying the Polish zloty against the Japanese
yen has declined 12 percent since it was initiated in December
and the bet on the British pound''s gain versus the New Zealand''s
dollar has lost 10.6 percent, according to data compiled by
Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The People''s Bank of China said in a statement yesterday
banks'' reserve requirements will rise 50 basis points from Nov.
16, the first nationwide increase since May. China ordered some
lenders, including Bank of Communications Co., to raise their
reserve ratios by an additional 50 basis points, or 0.5
percentage point, from Nov. 15, a person with direct knowledge
of the matter said yesterday. </p>
<p>The long-term outlook for emerging-market stocks
remains favorable as growth in developing nations is robust
and the companies there benefit from the low interest rates in
major economies, the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. </p>
<p>It will be important to be more selective going
forward, the analysts wrote. </p>

<p>The unit, known as Process Driven Trading, or PDT, has been

that unit as well. The Volcker rule, passed as part of the Dodd-
Frank bill in July, bans banks from risking capital by wagering
for their own accounts. </p>
<p>We should not be a firm that is betting our shareholders''
capital for our own benefit, Gorman said at the Securities
Industry and Financial Markets Association conference in New
York on Nov. 8. We should be working with our shareholders''
capital for our clients'' benefit. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, said he couldn''t
comment. </p>
<p>Peter Muller </p>
<p>PDT is led by Peter Muller, a so-called quant manager who
uses mathematical models to trade securities. PDT was
responsible for a quarter of Morgan Stanley''s earnings in some
years during the late 1990s and early 2000s before losing as
much as $500 million in less than a month in the third quarter
of 2007, according to The Quants: How a New Breed of Math
Whizzes Conquered Wall Street and Nearly Destroyed It, by
Scott Patterson. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has discussed retaining a stake in the new
company, the people said. </p>
<p>PDT rebounded in 2008, returning 25 percent when the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index had its worst drop in seven decades,
according to the 2010 book. Muller has said some of the figures
in the book are inaccurate. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley scaled back its proprietary-trading
operations after posting its first quarterly loss as a public
company in 2007. The firm reported $9.4 billion of writedowns
tied to mortgage holdings in the fourth quarter of that year,
driven from bets made by a prop-trading desk in its fixed-income
unit. </p>
<p>Illiquid Ways'' </p>
<p>Gorman said Morgan Stanley hadn''t been outstanding in our
proprietary activities over time. He said the firm had too
much capital tied up in illiquid ways in its proprietary
desks before the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. already shut down an equity
proprietary-trading group, Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies,
to comply with the Volcker rule. New York-based Goldman Sachs
has lost two quant managers from its asset-management unit this
year. Robert Litterman left the firm in January and Robert C. Jones is leaving at the end of this year. </p>
<p>Muller bested 104 players earlier this year to win the
annual Wall Street Poker Night, which raised $1.5 million for
Math for America, a charitable organization dedicated to making
the math skills of public school students better by improving
instruction. </p>
<p>Muller, who is married with two children, is also a pianist
who has two folk/rock albums and plays monthly at Caf Vivaldi
in New York''s Greenwich Village. He also constructs crossword
puzzles, having written at least 10 for the New York Times. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co., the world''s biggest
media company, rose the most in six months after analysts said
fourth-quarter profit topped estimates. </p>
<p>Excluding restructuring and impairment costs of $216
million, profit amounted to 50 cents a share, according to
Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities International
Inc. in New York. That beat the 47-cent average of 25 analysts''
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Disney gained $1.82, or 5.1 percent, to $37.75 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest advance
since May. Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo fully
disclosed restructuring, programming and film studio writedowns
during the company''s conference call after U.S. markets closed
yesterday. </p>
<p>Upon scanning the press release, the results seemed
weak, Nathanson wrote in a note today. However, it turns out
that you can''t judge a quarter by a press release. </p>
<p>Yesterday the stock fell $1.06, or 2.9 percent, to $35.93
after the report was released early, before U.S. markets closed.
The company said it is investigating how the information became
available. </p>
<p>Net income fell 6.7 percent to $835 million, or 43 cents a
share, from $895 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, Burbank,
California-based Disney said yesterday. Sales slid 1.3 percent
to $9.74 billion in the period ended Oct. 2, missing the $10
billion average of 20 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Disney had a $100 million writedown of film inventory, a
$58 million charge for programming writeoffs at its Lifetime
network, and restructuring and impairment charges of $58
million, Rasulo said on the call. </p>
<p>Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Barclays Capital in New
York, also told clients in a note today that adjusted earnings
amounted to 50 cents a share excluding the above items. Disney
reported adjusted per-share earnings of 45 cents. </p>
<p>DiClemente and Nathanson recommend buying the stock. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall
Street firm that makes more money trading equities than any
other bank, stopped providing clearing services for some of its
smallest U.S. clients, three people told of the decision said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs limited clearing for accounts that manage
less than $5 million, lifting the previous $1 million threshold,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
decision was private. While the firm continues to clear trades
for some accounts below the new limit, it''s winnowing out
clients that are riskier, have lower growth prospects and are
more retail rather than institutional in focus, one of the
people said. </p>
<p>We are conducting a routine analysis of our business and
in some cases the profile of clients was not consistent with our
current standards and criteria, said Ed Canaday, a spokesman
for the New York-based bank. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s equities division generated $5.43 billion
in revenue for the first nine months of the year, down 32
percent from $7.95 billion in the same period of 2009, according
to the bank''s third-quarter earnings report. The firm handles
U.S. clearing through its registered broker-dealer subsidiary,
Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP, known as GSEC. </p>
<p>The firm started the review of the business about four or
five months ago, according to one of the people familiar with
the matter. The company notified a number of clients this week
that the changes would mean they would have to find new clearing
agents, two other people said. </p>
<p>While the decision wasn''t a reaction to any of the new U.S.
rules for Wall Street, it was partly in response to increasing
regulatory scrutiny, one of the people said. </p>

<p>Procter  Gamble Co., the world''s
largest consumer-products company, sold $1.5 billion of notes
with corporate bond issuance on pace for a record November. </p>
<p>Borrowers from Ally Financial Inc., the biggest issuer of
junk-rated debt this year, to Newark, New Jersey-based
Prudential Financial Inc. have issued or are marketing at least
$6.72 billion of the securities in the U.S. today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Corporations have sold more than $69
billion of debt this month and are on track to surpass the
$124.7 billion issued in November 2006. </p>
<p>Issuance is accelerating, surpassing the 2010 average last
week for the ninth time in 10 weeks, as yields on corporate
bonds hover near record lows. Companies will take advantage of
a great market for both investment-grade and high-yield
issuers to sell debt through the Thanksgiving holiday in the
U.S. on Nov. 25, said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and
economic research at Aladdin Capital Management LLC. </p>
<p>You''re going to see a pretty good market for new issues
as companies decide it might be time to pre-finance maturities
if they think markets are going to be choppier, said
MacDonald, who''s based in Stamford, Connecticut. </p>
<p>PG''s offering was split between $1 billion of five-year
notes that yield 47 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $500 million of two-year floating-rate debt that
pays 4 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate, according to a person familiar with the offering. </p>
<p>Three-month Libor is a lending benchmark set yesterday at
0.28 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>Crest, Old Spice </p>
<p>The offering is Cincinnati-based PG''s second in U.S.
dollars this year, following a $1.25 billion sale in February of
2.5-year notes that paid a 55 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show. </p>
<p>The maker of Crest toothpaste and Old Spice fragrances
reported profit in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30
declined 6.8 percent, exceeding some analysts'' estimates, after
it sold a pharmaceuticals unit and commodity costs rose. </p>
<p>PG fell 4 cents, or 0.06 percent, to $64.29 as of 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 6 percent during the year. </p>
<p>The company is ranked Aa3 by Moody''s Investors Service and
an equivalent AA- by Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>Ally Financial, the auto and home lender formerly known as
GMAC Inc., sold $1 billion of seven-year notes, Bloomberg data
show. The 6.25 percent debt yields 6.5 percent. The Detroit-
based company has sold $5.65 billion of notes in four sales in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Prudential Bonds </p>
<p>Prudential Financial, the second-biggest U.S. life insurer
after MetLife Inc., sold $1 billion of notes to help pay for two
overseas units from American International Group Inc. The
company sold $500 million of 4.5 percent, 10-year notes that pay
a spread of 167 basis points and $500 million of 6.2 percent,
30-year bonds that yield 185 basis points more than benchmarks,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds climbed to 3.75
percent on Nov. 12 after touching 3.53 percent, the lowest on
record, on Nov. 4, a day after the Federal Reserve announced
plans to buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries as it
tries to stimulate the economy and stave off deflation,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>Junk-debt yields climbed to 7.66 percent on Nov. 12 from
7.55 percent, the lowest since March 2005, on Nov. 9, the index
data show. </p>
<p>Real economic growth is going to be slower in Europe and
may moderate here, we don''t know what''s going to happen on the
fiscal or taxation front, and there are still sovereign
issues, MacDonald said. There''s no magic wand to make these
things all go away. </p>

<p>Microsoft is overhauling the MSN Games site to let players
compete with each other across Web properties including Bing
Games and Windows Live Messenger, the companies said today in a
statement. Players using the Microsoft Game Hub will be able to
see each others'' scores across the Microsoft platforms and
Facebook Inc.''s social network. </p>
<p>Microsoft Game Hub will compete against a crowded field of
companies moving to capitalize on consumer interest in games
that can be played for a few minutes at a time. Yahoo! Inc.,
Facebook and Apple Inc. have established social-gaming platforms
over the past few years. </p>
<p>Games on Facebook gained popularity in the U.S. last year,
leading Electronic Arts Inc. to purchase Playfish Inc., the
maker of Pet Society and Restaurant City, for as much as
$400 million. Walt Disney Co. agreed to buy Playdom Inc.,
another supplier of games on Facebook, for $563.2 million in
July. </p>
<p>MSN Games, a unit of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft,
offers more than 1,000 titles, including Bejeweled, Mah
Jong Tiles and Spades. </p>
<p>In February, San Francisco-based Zynga Game Network Inc.,
the largest maker of social games on Facebook, began letting
users of Microsoft''s game site play FarmVille. </p>
<p>Developer Rankings </p>
<p>Closely held CrowdStar, whose offerings include the virtual

tracks application use on Facebook. </p>
<p>Under the partnership, CrowdStar''s games will be featured
first on Bing Games before rolling out to other Microsoft sites,
the companies said. </p>
<p>Games on social networks such as Facebook and MySpace are
free of charge. The makers generate revenue by selling virtual

<p>Chicago''s agreement for a Morgan
Stanley partnership to run its parking meters for 75 years,
expected to cost drivers $11.6 billion, has Indianapolis,
Pittsburgh and Los Angeles rethinking their own deals. </p>
<p>Indianapolis, whose city council plans to vote tonight on a
proposal with Xerox Co.''s Affiliated Computer Services, would
rather take less money up front in favor of more total fees in
its 50-year transaction. It also wants something Chicago didn''t
get: exit clauses that let the city end the lease. </p>
<p>We have terms that are not in Chicago''s deal, Deputy
Mayor Michael Huber, who negotiated with Affiliated Computer,
said in an interview. We''ve built in a lot of flexibility. </p>
<p>Bloomberg News reported in August that Chicago''s agreement
may earn the Morgan Stanley group 10 times the $1.15 billion
lump sum Mayor Richard Daley got when he forced the City Council
to consider the deal on a few days notice in 2008, according to
documents for a planned private note sale by the Chicago Parking
Meters LLC venture. The experience shows the pitfalls of a hasty
process that doesn''t weigh all the costs, said former Chicago

<p>It''s a mistake to rush into a deal for such a long period
of time without a full public accounting of the pros and cons,

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp.''s Nigerian unit
said armed attackers boarded one of its offshore platforms on
the country''s southeast coast yesterday amid increasing violence
in the oil-rich region. </p>
<p>Exxon didn''t say whether anyone had been hurt or what
damage had been done. Relevant government and security
agencies have been informed and appropriate response measures
are under way, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Nigerian oil workers'' union, Pengassan, said eight of its
members, who are employed by Exxon, were abducted from the
company''s Oso gas and condensate platform yesterday. </p>
<p>At the time of the attack there were 74 people aboard the
platform, Pengassan said in an e-mailed statement today. We
have not been able to establish contact with the abductors, it
said in the statement. Pengassan calls on the government to
ensure they are found and released immediately. </p>
<p>The southern Niger River delta, home to Nigeria''s oil and
gas industry, has seen a new surge of violence since a
government amnesty in 2009 led to the disarming of thousands of
fighters and a period of relative quiet. Seven foreign workers
were abducted in an attack on Afren Plc''s offshore Okoro field
on Nov. 7, about a week after an Eni SpA pipeline was sabotaged
in a separate attack. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil holds a 40 percent stake in a venture it
operates for majority partner, state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. The venture produces 720,000 barrels a day of
crude, condensate and natural gas liquids from 90 offshore
platforms in the country, according to its website. </p>
<p>Armed Groups </p>
<p>Attacks by armed groups in the delta region cut Nigeria''s
oil production by more than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Though the violence declined following last year''s amnesty,
the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, the main
militant group in the region, refused to disarm, saying its
demands for local control of oil revenue weren''t met. MEND
claimed responsibility for the attack on Afren. </p>
<p>Another armed group, which identified itself as the Niger
Delta Liberation Force under the leadership of General John
Togo, said in an e-mailed statement to reporters yesterday it
was no longer part of the fraudulent amnesty and will target
oil installations in fresh attacks. </p>
<p>This time, we will operate on both land and sea, the
group said. Oil installations are our target. </p>
<p>Nigeria is Africa''s biggest oil producer and the fifth-

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. advised
investors to buy European equities for the coming 6 to 12
months, while Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc forecast stocks
may rise potentially very strongly in 2011. </p>
<p>We are very bullish on equities on a rolling 6-12 months
horizon, with the potential for a ''99 type of extreme upward
move not to be dismissed, JPMorgan strategists Mislav Matejka
and Emmanuel Cau wrote in a report today, adding that returns on
a 5- to 10-year period will be poor. RBS strategists Ian Richards and Graham Bishop in London forecast gains of 20
percent for European stocks. </p>
<p>Rarely has the valuation of the equity market appeared so
anomalous in the context of other asset classes, Richards and
Bishop wrote. But another dose of liquidity, normalising
inflation expectations, and a corporate sector that is at last
showing signs of using the exceptionally low cost of debt to
drive shareholder return, all bode well for an aggressive
valuation re-appraisal. </p>
<p>The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index has climbed 17 percent
since May as the U.S. Federal Reserve boosted its asset-
purchases plan to stimulate growth, offsetting concern that
Greece and Ireland may struggle to reduce their budget deficits.
The index is still trading at 12 times its companies'' estimated
earnings, down from a ratio of almost 16 at the end of 2009. </p>
<p>Appear Cheaper'' </p>
<p>In the short term, we still see stocks as the asset class
offering the best risk-reward, the JPMorgan strategists wrote.
They are at the right stage of the earnings upcycle, asset
reflation favours equities, they are relatively underowned and
appear cheaper than other assets. </p>
<p>While valuations appear attractive in the short term
relative to profits and compared with bonds, when analyzed
against historical earnings cycles, they are starting to look
stretched, Matejka and Cau wrote. The Grand Experiment
of quantitative easing may end result in a bear market for both
bonds and equities after an initial rebound in stocks, the
strategists wrote, as policymakers'' credibility declines. </p>
<p>The Stoxx 600 surged 36 percent in 1999, capping five years
of gains, as investors bet new technologies would boost
earnings. </p>

which acquired Paragould, Arkansas-based Wellsco Inc. in August,
plans to buy an engineering services provider, Reddy said. </p>
<p>Two purchases, including the acquisition of Daxcon
Engineering Inc. in January, helped the company boost sales by
25 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30. The buyouts will
help Infotech maintain revenue growth in the next two years,
according to Angel Broking Ltd. </p>

size and typically demanding 100-200 people instead of 30-40
billable resources a few quarters back, Srishti Anand, an
analyst at Angel Broking, wrote on a October 14 report. </p>
<p>Infotech''s shares, which have gained 2.1 percent compared
with a 16 percent increase in the Bombay Stock Exchange''s
benchmark Sensitive Index, fell 0.4 percent to 156.7 rupees at
12:28 p.m. in Mumbai. </p>
<p>Some of the company''s new projects from clients including
Hamilton Sundstrand Corp. and Westinghouse Electric Co., are
expected to yield strong revenue for Infotech, according to
Anand, who has a buy recommendation on the stock. </p>
<p>Revenue is forecast to grow 25.7 percent to 1.2 billion
rupees ($26.7 million) this fiscal year, Reddy said. North
America accounts for 55 percent of the sales while Europe

phone programs to Hotmail Web e-mail services. </p>
<p>A breakup doesn''t make sense because the computer industry
is consolidating, Ballmer said. I don''t think it would be
useful, he said. It creates economic dis-synergies. </p>
<p>In October, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. suggested that
Microsoft might spin off some consumer businesses, including the
Xbox division, so that it could better focus on its main
products. Microsoft''s shares have tumbled 15 percent this year,
hurt by concern that it''s losing ground to mobile software from
Apple Inc. and Google Inc. A slow recovery among corporate
customers also is weighing on sales, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 23 cents to
$25.81 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. plans to raise as
much as $12 billion in the second-largest U.S. initial public
offering on record after increasing the asking price by 14
percent, according to a regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>GM, 61 percent owned by the U.S. Treasury, is now selling
365 million shares at $32 to $33 each, today''s filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission said. The IPO was already
multiple times oversubscribed at the original range of $26 to
$29 apiece, according to two people familiar with the deal. GM''s
underwriters also plan to exercise an option to buy 54.8 million
more shares, the people said. </p>
<p>The IPO, scheduled for tomorrow, will help Chief Executive
Officer Dan Akerson return some of the $49.5 billion GM received
in a taxpayer bailout last year. The Treasury, which is taking a
loss on its portion of the sale, will break even only if the
shares climb at least 50 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. At $33 each, the sale would give the Detroit-based
automaker a market value of almost $50 billion, compared with
Ford Motor Co.''s $57.3 billion. </p>
<p>There''s much more demand for the shares they''re
offering, said Josef Schuster, the Chicago-based founder of 
IPOX Capital Management LLC, which oversees $3 billion.
They''ve done an extremely good job in marketing this IPO. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, was asked by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission to explain why it waited until this year to
recognize losses on an unfinished New Jersey casino. </p>
<p>The bank, which has held a majority stake in the project
since 2007, was asked to explain how it classified the holding
and how a downturn in Atlantic City affected attempts to
sell it, according to letters between the SEC and the New York-
based bank released today. Morgan Stanley said it thought a
strategy for the holding would help it recover the carrying
value and that it booked a charge after deciding to sell. </p>
<p>This year, Morgan Stanley has written down about 97 percent
of the $1.2 billion investment in Revel Entertainment LLC, a
project that originally called for two towers with 3,800 hotel
rooms and 150,000 square feet of gambling space. The bank took a
$932 million loss on the stake in the first quarter, and another
$229 million in the third quarter. It has about $40 million of
value left, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said last month. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said that before its decision to sell the
stake, it had consolidated Revel and compared the book value of
the investment with undiscounted cash flows to check whether a
charge was warranted. The bank said it recognized there were
impairment indicators before the first quarter of 2010. </p>
<p>The SEC''s letters were sent by the agency''s corporation
finance unit, which reviews disclosures to ensure investors are
kept informed during stock offerings and in financial reports.
If the division suspects misconduct, it can refer matters to the
agency''s enforcement arm for further investigation. </p>
<p>Following Morgan Stanley''s response, the SEC said in a
letter that it had no further comments. It didn''t indicate it
may take any further action. Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan
Stanley, and John Heine, an SEC spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Planned as the biggest casino resort in Atlantic City,
Revel is partly built on 20 acres at the north end of the
beachfront boardwalk. Morgan Stanley owned more than 90 percent
of the project after contributing the land as an equity
investment in 2007 and financing part of the construction. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world''s
largest company by market value, and ConocoPhillips said
drilling costs in Norway need to be reduced to improve recovery
from aging oil fields. </p>
<p>Costs are a real challenge for oil and gas production
in Norway, Jan Aage Hansen at Exxon in Norway, said today in a
presentation in Oslo to Oil Minister Terje Riis-Johansen as part
of hearings on how to raise recovery from dwindling deposits. </p>
<p>Hansen and Steinar Vaage, head of ConocoPhillips in Norway,
called for greater mobility of rigs between Norway and the U.K.
to lower costs and improve availability. Norway''s regulatory
requirements for rigs differ from those in the U.K. </p>
<p>What''s important is that we open up the market, Vaage
said at the meeting. This opening of the market would be very
important to get access to rigs that are more cost effective and
reduce costs. </p>
<p>The government has urged producers such as state-controlled
Statoil ASA and ConocoPhillips to improve recovery from the
country''s deposits. Output in the world''s seventh-biggest oil
exporter has almost fallen more than 40 percent in the past
decade after 40 years of pumping from fields such as Ekofisk,
Oseberg and Troll. </p>
<p>Costs for the oil industry in Norway are forecast to climb
3 percent to 4 percent annually in the coming years, after
surging 80 percent from 2004 to 2008, Bjoern Harald Martinsen,
an economist at the Norwegian Oil Industry Association, said in
an interview last week. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to pay $25
million to settle a lawsuit over a decades-old oil spill and
related environmental contamination in Brooklyn, New York, state
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said. </p>
<p>The settlement includes a payment of $19.5 million for
environmental projects, the largest single payment of its kind
in New York''s history, according to Cuomo''s statement. </p>
<p>The settlement also requires Exxon to pay for the cleanup
of the spill of at least 17 million gallons of oil in Brooklyn''s
Greenpoint area discovered in 1978, according to the statement.
At least 55 acres of the Brooklyn community are now
contaminated, Cuomo''s office said. </p>
<p>For far too long, residents of Greenpoint have been
forced to live with an environmental nightmare lurking just
beneath their homes, their businesses and their community,
Cuomo said. With this settlement, Exxon Mobil will be held
accountable for fully cleaning up this environmental disaster. </p>
<p>The settlement was filed today in federal court in
Brooklyn. It includes $500,000 in civil penalties and damages,
$1.5 million to compensation the state for past cleanups
associated with the spill, and $3.5 million for future oversight
costs, Cuomo said. </p>
<p>The settlement also resolves a 2004 complaint by the
environmental watchdog group Riverkeeper, which was consolidated
with Cuomo''s case, and a lawsuit by Brooklyn Borough president
Marty Markowitz, according to Kristen Hellmer, an Exxon
spokeswoman. </p>
<p>We''re pleased to reach a mutually agreeable resolution to
the lawsuit, and our focus will continue to be our cleanup
efforts in Greenpoint, Hellmer said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>Class Actions </p>
<p>Two class-action, or group, suits representing residents
for property value losses and potential health costs related to
the spill remain unresolved. </p>
<p>The Greenpoint neighborhood previously was home to
refineries and storage tanks owned by Standard Oil, an Exxon
predecessor. </p>
<p>The spill was two-thirds larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez
spill that released 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska''s
Prince William Sound. </p>
<p>The agreement obligates Exxon to address soil, groundwater
and air concerns, according to the company. </p>
<p>Exxon Cleanup </p>
<p>Exxon has been working since 1979 to remediate the site,
according to a statement by the Irving, Texas-based company.
More than 11 million gallons have been removed, the company
said. Hellmer declined to discuss cleanup costs. </p>
<p>The Cuomo suit sought to have the company clean oil from
the soil and groundwater in the Greenpoint neighborhood and
prevent it from leaking into Newtown Creek, a 3.5-mile waterway
that separates the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. </p>
<p>The settlement doesn''t incorporate the investigation and
cleanup of Newtown Creek because it is a Superfund site being
dealt with by the federal government, Cuomo said. </p>
<p>The Exxon settlement and the recent Superfund listing of
Newtown Creek will make it possible for Riverkeeper and local
residents to realize our vision of a Greenpoint that is free of
historic pollution, Riverkeeper executive director Paul Gallay
said in a statement. </p>
<p>Erin Brockovich </p>
<p>A 2005 suit filed Brooklyn state Supreme Court on behalf of
more than 400 Greenpoint residents by Los Angeles law firm
Girardi/Keese is unresolved. The firm''s founder, Thomas Girardi,
was lead counsel in Erin Brockovich''s suit against Pacific Gas 
Electric, a unit of PGE Corp. </p>
<p>Our suit is simply pending, Girardi said in a phone
interview. </p>
<p>Marc Bern, a partner at Napoli Bern Ripka LLP, sought
federal class action status in a lawsuit on behalf of residents
for a $58 billion claim against Exxon, BP Plc and other
companies. </p>
<p>Hopefully we will be entering negotiations with Exxon in
the very near future to resolve this matter, Bern said. The
Greenpoint controversy has been pending too long, particularly
in light of New York''s desire to reclaim the water views. </p>
<p>In the late 1800s, the Greenpoint area housed more than 50
refineries, and the contamination may have begun then, Exxon has
said. By 1892, most of the facilities were owned by Standard
Oil. Leaking gasoline caused a sewer explosion in 1950 that sent
manhole covers flying. The site was identified as an
environmental hazard in 1978 when a Coast Guard patrol spotted
an oily plume in Newtown Creek. </p>
<p>Exxon has had no active refinery operations in Greenpoint
since 1963 and no terminal operations since 1993, Hellmer said. </p>
<p>The state''s case is State of New York v. Exxonmobil Corp.,
07-cv-02902, and the Riverkeeper case is Riverkeeper v. Exxon
Mobil 04-cv-02056, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New
York (Brooklyn). </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. selected
110 people to become partners, up from 94 in the last round two
years ago, as Wall Street rebounds from the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Among the employees named this year were David Kostin,
chief U.S. equity strategist, Andre Laport Ribeiro, the Sao
Paolo-based head of Latin America equities, and Colin Coleman,
who runs the firm''s South Africa business, according to an
internal memo (see full list below) obtained by Bloomberg News.
The appointments take effect Jan. 1. David Wells, a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The elections are a vestige of the firm''s days as the last
major investment bank partnership, before the company ended 130
years of private ownership with its 1999 initial public
offering. Partners, who get a $600,000 salary, share in a
special compensation pool and typically receive most of their
yearend bonuses in restricted stock. </p>
<p>There are no partners in a corporation, this is an
honorary designation that enables people in it to participate in
a bonus pool, said Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York
University''s Stern School of Business who was a partner at
Goldman Sachs before it went public. This is a promotion for
most of them in terms of how much they get paid. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs had 443 partners after the 2008 class was
elected and 402 after the 2006 round. Wells wouldn''t say how
many partners there will be after the latest round of
promotions. The New York-based company employed 35,400 people at
the end of September. </p>
<p>New Partners </p>
<p>New partners included Donald J. Casturo from the
commodities unit, Dina H. Powell, the firm''s head of corporate
engagement, London-based credit trader Wayne M. Leslie, and
Peeyush Misra, a former Bear Stearns Cos. mortgage trader.
Massimo Della Ragione, a Milan-based merger specialist, also
made the cut, as did China portfolio strategist Christopher Eoyang, Shin Horie, the Tokyo-based head of Japan investment
research, and Jonathan M. Penkin, co-head of equity capital
markets in Asia. </p>
<p>Wells wouldn''t say how many of the new partners are women.
The firm was sued in September by three women, former employees,
who alleged that they faced discrimination in pay and fewer
opportunities for promotion than men. Goldman Sachs has called
the suit without merit. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s profit through the first nine months of
2010 dropped 29 percent to $5.97 billion from the same period
last year. The company has set aside $13.1 billion for
compensation and benefits this year, 21 percent less than at the
same time in 2009. The stock dropped 21 cents to $164.89 as of
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, and is
down 2.3 percent this year. </p>
<p>Record Pay </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs set a Wall Street pay record in 2007 when it
doled out more than $20 billion, or 44 percent of revenue, to
30,522 employees at the time. Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, was awarded a $67.9 million bonus
that year, the highest ever for a securities industry CEO. </p>
<p>Since the 2008 financial crisis led governments around the
world to supply taxpayer money to keep banks afloat, Goldman
Sachs has cut compensation. Last year the firm slashed the ratio
of revenue paid to employees to 36 percent, the lowest since the
firm went public. </p>
<p>This year Goldman Sachs has set aside 43 percent of revenue
to pay employees, or 45 percent when the cost of a U.K. tax on
bonuses is included. In a presentation yesterday at a New York
conference hosted by Bank of America Corp., Blankfein said the
firm''s decisions on compensation depend on what the market
requires us to do in most cases, and I think that that is a bit
of an evolving picture. </p>
<p>Before the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs published its
list of partners in a press release. The firm has since stopped
making the list public. </p>
<p>I can''t imagine why they want to call attention to what
is in essence not an appointment of managers but a transfer of
people into a different compensation category, Smith said. </p>
<p>The following is a list of the 2010 partner class at
Goldman Sachs: </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. has lined up
customers such as Boeing Co. and France Telecom SA for new
software that handles Web-based calling and videoconferencing,
advancing an effort that may add $1 billion in annual sales. </p>
<p>The software, called Lync, debuted at an event today,
before going on sale Dec. 1. It has the potential to generate
sales on par with Microsoft''s SharePoint business, which makes
about $1.3 billion a year, Kurt DelBene, president of the
Redmond, Washington-based company''s Office unit, said yesterday. </p>
<p>DelBene''s unit has revamped Web-calling and conferencing
software to gain more of the $50 billion market for products
that help companies replace traditional phone networks with
systems that send communications over the Internet. The new
software is a bid to parlay Microsoft''s personal-computer know-
how in the networking realm dominated by Cisco Systems Inc. </p>
<p>Microsoft had a very strong offering in all areas except
the place where they were weakest: the telecom area, said Bern
Elliot, an analyst at Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner Inc.
With this release, they''ve used their experience to improve
that. Now, if you wanted to, you could get rid of your existing
phones. </p>
<p>It will take until the middle of next year to see whether
Lync will be a serious contender, Elliot said. Lync is the third
iteration of Microsoft''s software for Internet-based calling and
teleconferencing, which was introduced in 2003. </p>
<p>Tracking Down Co-Workers </p>
<p>The idea is to put Internet messages, video chats and phone
calls on the same platform -- a concept called unified
communication -- and make it easier to reach people wherever
they are. </p>
<p>For instance, if you call a co-worker''s office but he''s
traveling, Lync will try the person in his hotel room in Kuala
Lumpur, DelBene said. Microsoft Office users can right-click on
contact names to call them. If they need a third person to join,
they can drag and drop the name to create a conference call. </p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Plc has been using the previous versions
of the software and plans to upgrade to the new one as part of
its effort to switch out traditional phone systems, DelBene
said. Other Lync customers include Estee Lauder Cos., Nikon
Corp. and Marquette University, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard Co., whose services business helps
customers install Lync, has orders to deploy Lync to more than
300,000 workers at Fortune 500 companies, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>Microsoft fell 24 cents to $25.57 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined 16
percent this year. </p>
<p>Cisco Showdown </p>
<p>When Microsoft bids for customers, it often squares off
with Cisco, International Business Machines Corp. and Avaya
Inc., said Gurdeep Singh Pall, a Microsoft vice president. </p>
<p>Cisco''s unified-communications business, which has more
than 1,000 customers, includes Internet phones and call-center
products, as well as social-networking tools and mobile
applications. </p>
<p>The unit, which posted revenue growth of 45 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, counts the Abu Dhabi Police and
Bulgarian Ministry of Transport as customers. It sold its 30
millionth Internet phone last month to HSBC Holdings Plc. </p>
<p>DelBene says he isn''t worried about the competition. </p>
<p>I''m usually a person that is overly fixated on what could
go wrong, but in this space I feel we''re the leaders, he said.
There''s not a vendor I''m particularly worried about. </p>
<p>Cisco built its technology by buying other companies, which
may give Microsoft an edge, Gartner''s Elliot said. </p>
<p>Cisco has all the pieces -- they don''t have as strong
integration across the pieces, he said. </p>
<p>Mix of Technologies </p>
<p>While Skype Technologies SA leads the market for consumer
Internet calling, it isn''t as big a competitor in the corporate
arena. Skype lacks the kind of tools many companies need for
security and auditing purposes, Pall said. </p>
<p>Microsoft has replaced its own phones and conferencing
services with its technology, resulting in $215 million in
annual savings in the U.S., DelBene said. For now, many
customers are using the software alongside traditional phones.
Eventually, they''ll phase out the older approach, he said. </p>
<p>Besides linking up with Office software, the program can be
embedded in a company''s other applications. For example,
Schlumberger Ltd., the world''s largest oilfield-services
contractor, integrated the software with its programs for
monitoring oil rigs. That lets the company quickly call staff on
the affected rig if it notices a problem, Pall said. </p>
<p>Dark Ages </p>
<p>The software stems from more than seven years of work,
beginning with a group assembled by Chairman Bill Gates. The
team included Pall and Gates''s former technical assistant, Anoop Gupta, who ran the business before Pall. </p>
<p>Gates was interested because he felt the telecommunications
industry was stuck in the Dark Ages, instead of being
transformed by the PC and the Internet, Pall said. Microsoft
came close to buying a large business in the telecommunications
field in order to jump-start its efforts, he said. </p>
<p>The company discarded that plan in 2005 to focus on
building its own software, Pall said. He declined to say which
company Microsoft came close to buying. </p>
<p>We started building this platform six years ago, Pall
said. It takes a long time to build it right. </p>

University''s Stern School of Business who was a partner at
Goldman Sachs before it went public. This is a promotion for
most of them in terms of how much they get paid. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s profit through the first nine months of
2010 was $5.97 billion, down 29 percent from the same period
last year. The company has set aside $13.1 billion for
compensation and benefits this year, 21 percent less than at the
same time in 2009. The stock, up 11 cents to $165.21 at 2:14
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, is down less
than 3 percent this year. </p>
<p>Record Pay </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs set a Wall Street pay record in 2007 when it
doled out more than $20 billion, or 44 percent of revenue, to
30,522 employees at the time. Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, was awarded a $67.9 million bonus
that year, the highest ever for a securities industry CEO. </p>
<p>Since the 2008 financial crisis led governments around the
world to supply taxpayer money to keep banks afloat, Goldman
Sachs has cut compensation. Last year the firm slashed the ratio
of revenue paid to employees to 36 percent, the lowest since the
firm went public. </p>
<p>This year Goldman Sachs has set aside 43 percent of revenue
to pay employees, or 45 percent when the cost of a U.K. tax on
bonuses is included. In a presentation yesterday at a New York
conference hosted by Bank of America Corp., Blankfein said the
firm''s decisions on compensation depend on what the market
requires us to do in most cases, and I think that that is a bit
of an evolving picture. </p>
<p>Before the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs would publish
its list of partners in a press release. Since the crisis, the
firm has stopped making the list public. </p>
<p>I can''t imagine why they want to call attention to what
is in essence not an appointment of managers but a transfer of
people into a different compensation category, Smith said. </p>

Goldman Sachs: </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, promoted a
record number of employees to managing director, boosting their
pay and status as investment banks recover from the financial
crisis. </p>
<p>The 321 appointments, up from 272 last year and 259 in
2008, were detailed in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News. The announcement came a day after the New York-based
company selected 110 people to become partners, a designation
that means they share in a special pool of compensation. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, has presided over an expansion of the firm, with
the total number of employees rising to 35,400 from about 24,000
when he took over in mid-2006. In promoting more employees this
year, the company is rewarding people who stayed through the
financial crisis, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC. </p>
<p>It''s a function of trying to regain loyalty after
turbulent times, said Peabody, who is based in New York and
recommends investors buy Goldman Sachs stock. </p>
<p>Managing directors are one level below the highest rank of
partner. While they typically receive higher pay than more
junior employees, they don''t share in the special bonus pool
reserved for partners. </p>
<p>Most Women Ever </p>
<p>Yesterday''s promotions include the largest group of women
ever, making up 24 percent of the new class, said Lucas van Praag, a spokesman in New York. Women make up 19 percent of all
managing directors, including the new class, he said. Van Praag
said over 10 percent of this year''s new partners are women
and declined to give a more specific figure. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was sued in September by three former
employees who alleged that they faced discrimination in pay and
fewer opportunities for promotion than men. Goldman Sachs has
said the suit is without merit. </p>
<p>While half of the new managing directors are based in the
Americas, 28 percent are in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
and 22 percent are in Asia, van Praag said. He said the figures
represent a marginal increase in the number outside the
Americas. </p>
<p>About 45 percent of the new partners are based in the
Americas, with 29 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
and 26 percent in Asia. </p>
<p>That, I think, is reflective of where their growth is
going to be, Peabody said of the hires outside the Americas. </p>

the internal memo: </p>

<p>General Motors Co., which went
bankrupt last year after almost a century on the New York Stock
Exchange, advanced in its return to public trading following an
initial public offering that raised more than $20 billion. </p>
<p>GM gained 3.6 percent to $34.19 today, after climbing 9.1
percent in the first hour of trading. Its owners, including the
Treasury, sold $15.8 billion of common shares at $33 each in the
second-largest U.S. IPO on record. The automaker''s $4.35 billion
offering of preferred shares and an overallotment option may
boost the total to $23.1 billion, more than the $22.1 billion
raised by Beijing-based Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. in the
biggest IPO of common stock in history. </p>
<p>The offering by GM came 16 months after it emerged from
bankruptcy and brings Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson closer
to his goal of returning the $49.5 billion the automaker
received in a taxpayer bailout last year. The Treasury, which
will get as much as $13.6 billion from the IPO, will have to
sell its remaining GM shares at an average of about $53 each to
make back its total investment, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>You want to have some improvement, because that shows
there was strong demand for the shares, said Peter Jankovskis,
who helps manage $2.2 billion as co-chief investment officer at
Oakbrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois. But the bigger
that jump, it''s really a sign that the offering left some money
on the table. That''s a very large deal in dollar terms. </p>

<p>General Motors Co., which raised
more than $20 billion an initial public offering yesterday, will
be more aggressive marketing its brands now that it is publicly
traded again, the automaker''s top marketer said. </p>
<p>There were things we would have tried or done that we did
not do during the pre-IPO quiet period, Joel Ewanick, GM''s
vice president of U.S. marketing, said today in an interview in
Los Angeles. Now, you''ll start seeing more and more. </p>
<p>GM will be more active in advertising during the National
Football League''s Super Bowl championship game, and Chevrolet is
planning monthly marketing efforts for its new Cruze compact car
even after the traditional introduction period, he said. </p>
<p>As part of the increased marketing, GM''s Chevrolet brand
said today it would spend $40 million on clean-energy projects
through the U.S. to reduce 8 million metric tons of carbon
dioxide. GM said the reduction equals the 2011 emissions of the
Chevrolet vehicles it expects to sell in the next year. </p>
<p>The spending in the next three to five years may help
install energy sensors and solar panels at schools and support
wind-energy projects, GM said. Chevrolet has a growing lineup of
fuel-efficient vehicles, including the electric Chevy Volt. </p>
<p>The automaker will seek projects that wouldn''t be able to
take place without the funding, Ewanick said. </p>
<p>GM, which has sought environmental experts'' help in
defining project criteria, said it will make the investments
through third-party organizations, such as the Portland, Oregon-
based Bonneville Environmental Foundation. </p>
<p>Ewanick said last month that GM would spend slightly more
on advertising next year than the $2.5 billion the company spent
in 2008. </p>

<p>OAO Mobile TeleSystems, Russia''s
largest mobile-phone company, said third-quarter profit fell 5.7
percent as foreign-exchange gains declined. </p>
<p>Net income dropped to $475.5 million from $504.1 million,
Moscow-based MTS said today in a statement. That beat an average
estimate of $458.8 million from nine analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News. Sales gained 11 percent to $2.91 billion. </p>
<p>Earnings were hurt by higher borrowing costs as well as by
currency shifts, Chief Financial Officer Alexey Kornya told
reporters in Moscow. MTS cut its capital-expenditure plan this
year to 20 percent of sales from 24 percent, he said. </p>
<p>Russia''s economy grew 2.7 percent in the third quarter, the
slowest pace this year following record heat that triggered crop
losses, forced manufacturers to halt output and crimped consumer
demand. The ruble rose 2.3 percent against the dollar during the
quarter while slumping 9.1 percent against the euro. </p>
<p>Operational income before depreciation and amortization
rose 8.2 percent to $1.3 billion. Earnings on that basis
narrowed to 45 percent of sales from 46 percent. Gains from
exchange-rate changes totaled $18.8 million, a drop 69 percent
from $61.4 million a year earlier, according to documents
distributed at the press conference. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley has sold structured
notes collateralized by U.K. government bonds, the second-ever
issue of its kind in Britain, as Ireland''s bank-led debt crisis
reignites investor concern about counterparty risk. </p>
<p>The six-year autocallable notes, which start trading in
January, offer the potential for a 7.25 percent annual return if
the FTSE 100 stock index is above set levels. The return is at
least 1 percentage point below similar notes without government
debt backing, according to Sophie Barnett, a vice president for
retail structured products at Morgan Stanley in London. </p>
<p>The collateralized notes are being sold as European Union
and International Monetary Fund officials start talks with
Ireland on a potential rescue package for its banks. The
country''s potential bailout comes two years after Lehman
Brothers Holding Inc.''s collapse left holders of the bank''s
principal-protected notes with near-worthless paper. </p>
<p>You don''t know what''s going to happen next and any
feature offering counterparty risk mitigation can be attractive
to investors who have that uncertainty and nervousness, Morgan
Stanley''s Barnett said. </p>
<p>Using government debt as collateral provides extra
protection to noteholders'' principal in case of a default. New
York-based Morgan Stanley is rated A2 by Moody''s Investors
Service, the sixth-highest investment grade, and an equivalent A
by Standard  Poor''s. </p>
<p>The concerns over counterparty risk are being felt in
Ireland, where there are about 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) of
outstanding structured notes, according to Barry Mcloughlin,
head of structured product sales at Bank of Ireland Plc, the
country''s largest lender. </p>
<p>Irish Risk </p>
<p>People are frightened by what they''re reading and their
investment decisions are reflecting that, said Niall Duggan,
managing director at Duggan Asset Management, a Dublin-based
structured products distributor that oversees 325 million euros
of assets. Things have intensified over the last two weeks. </p>
<p>About 80 percent of structured products in Ireland are
issued in deposit form, which means they are covered by the
country''s Deposit Guarantee Scheme up to 100,000 euros, Duggan
said. With the threat of not getting their money back, many
investors have cut holdings to below that threshold, he said. </p>
<p>Even with the guarantees, investor fear is so great that
sales are falling, Duggan said, without providing specific
figures. Not only has the overall amount of money being
invested fallen but the average amount per investor has also
fallen. </p>
<p>Dramatic Dynamic </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s notes are the latest issue of securities
devised by banks to protect against counterparty failure. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. issued securities in February that are
collateralized by the debt of G-7 countries. Investec Plc, the
South African private bank, has used guarantees from third-party
banks including Spain''s Banco Santander SA to provide more
protection against the issuer''s risk. </p>
<p>The dynamic has changed dramatically, said Jim
Shiggins, a director of pension and investment services at
Dolmen Stockbrokers in Dublin. Previously people were looking
at the underlying and payoff of the product. Now the first
question they ask is who is providing the guarantee. </p>
<p>About 107 million pounds ($171 million) of structured
products issued by Lehman Brothers were held by 5,620 investors
in the U.K. before the bank''s collapse, Financial Services
Association data show. The FSA ruled last year that 10 of the
structured plans were missold due to their use of phrases such
as guaranteed and 100 percent capital secure, prompting
about 20 million pounds of compensation payments. </p>

<p>Exxon and partners approved the development of the project
almost a year ago. The venture may double the size of Papua New
Guinea''s economy, Port Moresby-based Oil Search has said. </p>
<p>First exports are due in 2014. A third plant may begin in
2016, McCullagh said in the report today. </p>
<p>We are increasingly confident Oil Search has additional
growth opportunities that may boost earnings, she said. </p>
<p>Oil Search rose 2.3 percent to A$6.67 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney, compared with a 0.3 percent increase for the
benchmark SP/ASX 200 Index. </p>
<p>An additional unit, or train, producing 3.5 million tons of
LNG annually, may cost about $5 billion, Citigroup''s Mark Greenwood in Sydney wrote in his report dated yesterday. </p>

<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., whose
$11 billion suit against Barclays Plc is drawing to a close, is
going after JPMorgan Chase  Co. as the next deep pocket to pay
creditors in the biggest U.S. bankruptcy. </p>
<p>Lehman sued JPMorgan for $8.6 billion in collateral and
tens of billions in damages, claiming the bank and Chairman
James Dimon helped cause its collapse. The second-biggest U.S.
bank twice asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. It said it was
protected by a law governing the $467 trillion market for swaps
and repurchase agreements when it lent Lehman''s failing
brokerage $100 billion a day during the 2008 financial crisis. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s defense hinges on so-called safe harbor
laws, which allow clearing banks handling securities trades to
take collateral from dealers without getting sued if a
bankruptcy occurs later. Debtors can undo some transfers of
assets done close to a bankruptcy filing. Banks invoke safe-
harbor laws to oppose return of the money. </p>
<p>Lehman has some viable claims here, so the real question
is going to be the scope of the safe-harbor provisions, said
Stephen Lubben, a bankruptcy professor at Seton Hall University
School of Law in Newark, New Jersey. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, has argued in court papers
that safe-harbor laws present an insurmountable legal obstacle
to Lehman''s lawsuit. Losing that argument may hurt confidence
in the market for swaps, repos and securities contracts, lawyers
said. </p>

<p>States'' tax revenue grew about 6
percent in the three months ended in Sept. 30, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. estimated, the third consecutive quarterly increase
as the U.S. climbed out of the longest recession since the Great
Depression. </p>
<p>The firm said its economists examined receipts from 16
states accounting for more than half of nationwide collections.
The year-over-year gain in the period appeared to continue into
the fourth quarter, it said. </p>
<p>The outlook for the state and local sector has improved
over the last several months, as revenues have picked up or at
least stabilized in most states, Alec Phillips said in the
note to clients today. </p>
<p>The gain may help states close budget deficits that will
likely total $140 billion in fiscal 2012, the Washington-based
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report on Oct.
7. An 18-month recession that was declared over in June 2009
shrunk state tax collections by 8.4 percent in fiscal 2009 and
3.1 percent in fiscal 2010, the report said. </p>
<p>The third-quarter gain in tax collections would be the
third consecutive after five quarters of decline, based on a
report by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. </p>
<p>Revenue grew by 2.5 percent in the first quarter and 2.3
percent in the second, according to the Albany, New York-based
institute. Rockefeller estimated on Oct. 19 that revenue rose
2.8 percent in the first two months of the third quarter. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. said it may enter
the World Rally Championship for the first time in more than 20
years and boost its presence in touring-car races to bolster the
image and selling prices of European brands Opel and Vauxhall. </p>
<p>Success in motor sport would increase the appeal of GM''s
models to younger buyers after its image was tarnished by a $50
billion government bailout, Nick Reilly, president of the U.S.
company''s European operations, said in a briefing in last night. </p>
<p>Sport is an important area, and to me, a car company ought
to be able to compete, Reilly said in London. It''s very
significant to us, the brand image, and in our view it''s not as
strong as the product. We''re winning lots of awards but Opel and
Vauxhall probably don''t command the prices they deserve. </p>
<p>GM Europe is looking most seriously at touring-car events,
in which standard sedans compete on racing circuits and where
the U.S.-based Chevrolet unit has just clinched its first world
championship, the executive said. A return to rallying, which
takes place on public roads and gravel tracks, would cost more. </p>
<p>Carmakers have been exiting racing in recent years. Subaru
and Suzuki Motor Corp. quit the World Rally Championship in 2008
as the slump crimped sales, while Honda Motor Co., Bayerische
Motoren Werke AG and Toyota Motor Corp. have withdrawn from
Formula One, the world''s richest and most-watched motor sport. </p>
<p>No decision has been taken on which events to enter, but
the preference is for those featuring cars that customers can
buy from the showroom, Reilly said. GM has no interest in F1,
which features purpose-built autos not available for purchase. </p>
<p>Very Excited'' </p>
<p>I get very excited by touring car racing and I think it''s
done the Chevrolet brand quite a bit of help in some places,
Reilly said. GM secured its first World Touring Car Championship
last month with a Chevrolet Cruze driven by Yvan Muller. The
model also won the 2010 British Touring Car Championship, in
which U.K.-based Vauxhall last entered a company team in 2009. </p>
<p>Opel, based in Ruesselsheim, Germany -- where Reilly said
raising prices poses a big challenge -- is considering
entering that country''s touring-car championship, the Deutsche
Tourenwagen Masters, spokeswoman Uta Deutsch said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Competing in the World Rally Championship is another
possibility, though a more expensive option, Reilly said. </p>
<p>For the past two years the WRC has had only two competing
manufacturers, Ford Motor Co. and France''s PSA Peugeot Citroen.
The 2010 championship ended on Nov. 14 with Frenchman Sebastien Loeb lifting the title for the seventh time in a Citroen C4.
Finn Jari-Matti Latvala finished second in a Ford Focus. </p>
<p>GM Europe has a chance of making money in 2011, excluding
reorganization costs, after a loss of about $1.9 billion this
year, and the division won''t risk extending losses through a
premature return to motor sport, Reilly said. </p>

<p>Tushar Poddar, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. economist who correctly predicted how high India''s
central bank would raise interest rates this year, forecasts
further increases are needed to curb inflation. </p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India may lift the repurchase rate as
much as 75 basis points in the first half of 2011 to 7 percent,
according to Poddar. That''s three times the median estimate of
25 basis points in a survey of 10 economists by Bloomberg News
yesterday. Only HSBC Holdings Plc. shared his forecast. Poddar
estimated in January 150 basis points of increases in 2010, a
call fulfilled by the bank''s Nov. 2 move. </p>
<p>There is a concern inflation may remain persistent
despite the RBI''s rate action, Poddar said in the interview in
his office a day after the RBI''s meeting. Ideally, both the
fiscal and the monetary policy should be tighter than where they
are right now to address inflation and the current-account
deficit. </p>
<p>Asia''s fastest round of monetary policy tightening
threatens to slow expansion in the $1.3 trillion economy and
push up government borrowing costs. While higher rates would
bolster the rupee by enhancing the premium over the near-zero
borrowing costs in the U.S., a widening current-account deficit
may limit gains and increase exchange-rate swings, Poddar said. </p>
<p>Inflation, IDBI </p>
<p>India''s annual consumer-price inflation was 9.82 percent in
September, more than twice China''s and the highest among Group
of 20 nations after Argentina. China, the fastest-growing major
economy, raised its main one-year lending rate for the first
time since 2007 last month. Brazil raised benchmark borrowing
costs by 200 basis points this year, while Russia cut by 100. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in India''s credit markets, state-owned lender
IDBI Bank Ltd. obtained a $125 million dollar-denominated loan.
GAIL India Ltd., the nation''s biggest natural gas distributor,
plans to raise about $420 million borrowing from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank and selling local-currency debt to fund
projects. The nation''s government bonds gained yesterday. </p>
<p>IDBI''s three-year loan will pay interest at 145 basis
points, or 1.45 percentage points, more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, Executive Director
Melwyn Rego said in an interview yesterday. The loan was
arranged by 12 banks, including BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Standard Chartered Plc, he said. </p>
<p>Government Bonds </p>
<p>GAIL, a state-run company that recently got approval for a
$100 million loan from Exim Bank, has applied for another $100
million, Finance Director R.K. Goel said in a telephone
interview. The utility plans to raise 10 billion rupees ($220
million) in the year ending March 31 selling bonds, commercial
paper and raising funds from other state-run companies. </p>
<p>India''s 10-year bond yield rose one basis point to 8.03
percent as of 11:53 a.m. local time today. The bonds gained the
most in more than two weeks yesterday, driving the yield on the
7.80 percent note due May 2020 down five basis points to 8.02
percent, according to the central bank''s trading system. That
was the biggest decline since Nov. 2. </p>
<p>While India''s benchmark 10-year rupee bond yield has risen
44 basis points this year, Poddar predicted it will remain at
about 8 percent through March. </p>
<p>The premium compared with similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries
has advanced to 517 basis points from 375 on Jan. 1, helping to
attract an unprecedented $10 billion of inflows into rupee debt
this year, bringing foreigners'' holdings to $17.6 billion. </p>
<p>Rupee Forecast </p>
<p>Goldman forecasts the rupee will strengthen 4.2 percent to
43.40 per dollar in six months, adding to a 2.8 percent gain
this year to 45.25 as of today. It may lag behind some emerging-
market currencies because of India''s current-account deficit,
which may be 2.9 percent of gross domestic product for the year
through March, according to Goldman. The firm advised buying
South Korea''s won versus the rupee. </p>
<p>RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao raised the repurchase rate,
used to inject money into the financial system, to 6.25 percent
this year from 4.75 percent, and the reverse repurchase rate,
used to withdraw funds, to 5.25 percent from 3.25 percent. </p>
<p>With inflation slowing, and the RBI concluding in September
that monetary policy had already returned close to normal,
India''s central bank said Nov. 2 that it probably wouldn''t boost
borrowing costs for at least three months. </p>
<p>Immediate future rate action is unlikely barring some
shocks, Subbarao said in a press conference in Mumbai Nov. 2.
He said in a Nov. 3 interview that it may take one or two years
to bring inflation firmly under control. </p>
<p>Wait and Watch'' </p>
<p>Standard Chartered Plc predicted he will keep rates
unchanged through June to safeguard growth. Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh''s government wants the nation to achieve a
sustained 10 percent expansion pace. The International Monetary
Fund raised its 2010 economic growth forecast for India on Oct.
6 to 9.7 percent from 9.4 percent, the fastest pace among major
economies after China. </p>
<p>The RBI will wait and watch, said Samiran Chakraborty,
a Mumbai-based economist at Standard Chartered who previously
taught at the Delhi School of Economics. </p>
<p>The cost of fixing rates on money for a year has surged a
record 166 basis points this year to 6.72 percent in India''s
interest-rate swaps market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates, increased
24 points this quarter as the Federal Reserve announced plans to
pump $600 million into the U.S. economy by buying Treasuries. </p>
<p>Taking a Risk'' </p>
<p>The RBI is definitely taking a risk not hiking rate
further, Edwin Gutierrez, a money manager who helps invest $6
billion in emerging market-debt at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc
in London, said in a Nov. 16 interview. If stronger commodity
prices do indeed feed through from the Fed''s easing, that risk
will prove to be foolhardy. </p>
<p>India''s wholesale inflation rate will reach 6.5 percent in
the year through March, a percentage point higher than the RBI''s
forecast, said Poddar, who researched the monetary systems of
Jordan and Lebanon while an economist at the International
Monetary Fund before joining Goldman in 2006. </p>
<p>The pause in the interest-hiking cycle may be temporary
and RBI will resume raising rate in early 2011, said Poddar,
37. The native of Kolkata earned his doctorate in economics from
the London School of Economics and his bachelor''s degree at
Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. </p>
<p>Poddar predicted in January the central bank would announce
a shift in its main policy tool to the repurchase rate from the
reverse repo, resulting in monetary tightening to the extent of
another 150 basis points. The RBI did that in July as the
banking system faced a shortage of liquidity. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. underestimated in January the amount
of increases, predicting 0.75 to 1 percentage point before March
2011. Nomura Holdings Inc. the same month forecast a rise of
1.25 percentage points in the repo rate by December, as did HSBC
and Credit Agricole SA. Morgan Stanley correctly predicted the
year-end 6.25 percent level. </p>
<p>Making forecasts in India is very difficult and can''t be
compared with advanced economies, given the inefficiencies in
the data compilation, such as for inflation, Poddar said.
After his forecasting success in 2010, he said, the stakes and
challenges have increased to get the next rate call right. </p>

<p>Michael England, the chief executive
officer of Geo Minerals Ltd., was surprised when Canada''s junior
stock exchange offered him the ticker symbol GM before his
mining company went public in 2007. Now he says the other GM
wants it back. </p>
<p>General Motors Co., which used the GM ticker in Canada from
1972 until it delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2005,
has offered to pay Vancouver-based Geo Minerals to change its
ticker, England said. </p>
<p>They did call a few times, asking about the symbol as
recently as last month, England said in an interview yesterday
as GM resumed trading following its $20 billion IPO. We never
really came to anything out of it. </p>
<p>GM trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the GM
ticker, as it did before going through bankruptcy protection. In
Canada, it settled for the symbol GMM. </p>
<p>We would have liked to have used that symbol, but it was
already taken, said Jason Easton, a spokesman for GM Canada.
I don''t think it''s a problem. Our ticker symbol here is GMM,
and we know our investors are informed. </p>
<p>It would be hard to confuse the two companies. General
Motors is one of the world''s largest manufacturers, with $105
billion (GM) in sales last year, 209,000 employees and a market value
of $51.3 billion. </p>

million ($3.68 million) and paid its chief financial officer
C$17,500 last year. Its IPO raised less than one-20,000th the
amount of GM''s, and the stock closed yesterday at 7 cents.
General Motors closed at $34.01 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. </p>
<h2>Warranty Calls </h2>
<p>Still, the ticker symbol does mix up a few people, said
England, whose company owns a zinc, gold and copper project in
northern British Columbia and parts of four copper projects in
Arizona. </p>
<p>Over the years, we do get random calls, people calling
about warranties and stuff, down south in the States, England
said. We have to tell them, No, we''re not them.'' </p>
<p>When Geo Minerals listed on the TSX Venture Exchange, the
symbol GEO was in use by Polaris Geothermal Inc., which was
purchased by Ram Power Corp. last year. </p>
<p>When we were IPO''ing, they asked me for what symbols
would I like to have, England said. They got me to send them
a couple of choices in case they were taken. I thought Oh, GM!
Wouldn''t that be funny!'' And I got it! I was so surprised! </p>
<p>No rules prevent a company from choosing a ticker symbol
that is another firm''s name, as long as the symbol hasn''t been
used in Canada for at least a year, said Carolyn Quick, a
spokeswoman for the Toronto exchange. </p>
<h2>Not GE </h2>
<p>In Canada, the symbol GE belongs to Granville Pacific
Capital Corp., which owns three residential care facilities in
British Columbia. CBS is the symbol of Bard Ventures Inc., an
oil and gas explorer formerly called Consolidated Bard Silver 
Gold Ltd. Unique Broadband Systems Inc. (UBS), which has no active
operations, trades under the symbol UBS. </p>
<p>The exchange owns the symbols, Quick said. A company can
request a new symbol for C$1,000, according to the TSX Company
Manual. </p>
<p>Easton declined to comment on England''s statement that GM
has inquired about buying the rights to the GM symbol. </p>
<p>England said he''s still willing to make a deal. </p>
<p>The door is open, definitely, he said. </p>

<p>Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, a former
central banker, is set to win re-election as mayor of Warsaw
without a runoff, one of the best results for her Civic Platform
party in local-government elections throughout Poland yesterday. </p>
<p>Gronkiewicz-Waltz won 53 percent support, compared with 24
percent for her closest rival, Czeslaw Bielecki of the Law 
Justice party, according to official returns from 53 percent of
precincts. Civic Platform won 31 percent of the vote for
assemblies in Poland''s 16 provinces, compared with 23 percent
for Law  Justice, the biggest opposition party, the State
Election Commission said on its website today, citing returns
from 84 percent of precincts. </p>
<p>Civic Platform''s performance nationwide falls short of the
party''s expectations, said Wawrzyniec Konarski, a political
scientist at Krakow''s Jagiellonian University. Prime Minister
Donald Tusk''s party, which supports euro adoption and state
asset sales, had been counting on a result closer to 40 percent
after its main rival Law  Justice lost a half dozen members of
parliament to internal squabbles in recent weeks, he said. </p>
<p>The Platform has to ask itself why it didn''t do better,
Konarski said by phone. For the two main parties, the results
show that they must work very hard to win voters before
general elections next year. </p>
<p>Peasants Third </p>
<p>The Polish Peasants Party, Civic Platform''s partner in the
ruling coalition, ran third in elections to provincial
assemblies with 15.7 percent, followed by the opposition
Democratic Left Alliance, with 15.3 percent. </p>
<p>Civic Platform is leading in nationwide opinion polls a
year before parliamentary elections are due, with 38 percent in
to an SMG/KRC poll for TVN24 television on Nov. 18. The party''s
candidate Bronislaw Komorowski won the presidency in July. </p>
<p>Gronkiewicz-Waltz will face a runoff if her final tally is
below 50 percent. The incumbent mayor, elected in 2006 after
serving as a vice president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, campaigned on pledges to
continue building transportation facilities such as the
underground Metro network, after more than doubling the city''s
investment budget to 9 billion zloty ($3.1 billion) a year. </p>
<p>I''ll say, rather immodestly, that Warsaw needs a good
financial manager, she said in an interview before the
election. These are huge investments. You need to be able to
find funds, to create sophisticated financial architecture. </p>
<p>Radoslaw Markowski, a sociology professor at the Polish
Academy of Sciences, said her popularity was due largely to the
effect of a low base. </p>
<p>Nothing Happened'' </p>
<p>Nothing happened for years and investments were
paralyzed under Gronkiewicz''s predecessor, Lech Kaczynski,
he said by phone. </p>
<p>In voting elsewhere, independent candidates won or were
leading mayoral elections in nine of Poland''s 18 largest cities.
Civic Platform candidates were ahead in six cities, the
Democratic Left Alliance in two, while Law  Justice''s candidate
won the first round in Lublin, in eastern Poland. </p>

Inc. to allow more time to seek regulatory approval. </p>
<p>The $14.25-a-share offer announced last month will now

<p>Pfizer has yet to submit the paperwork needed to secure

<p>Investors that helped companies from
Microsoft Corp. to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. sell bonds at record-low
borrowing costs are being punished on concern Federal Reserve
efforts to stave off deflation will drive up yields. </p>
<p>You kind of have come up to a buyers'' strike or buyers''
sensitivity, in terms of low-coupon debt, said Thomas Chow, a
money manager at Philadelphia-based Delaware Investments, which
oversees $120 billion of fixed-income assets. Higher yield and
higher coupons offer some protection from rising rates. </p>
<p>Debt from Wal-Mart, Microsoft and Coca-Cola Co. sold in the
past two months with relative yields as low as 25 basis points
is trailing investment-grade credit that pays an average spread
of 175 basis points. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is urging
investors to buy bonds with spreads at least 200 basis points
above U.S. Treasuries as the Fed seeks to purchase $600 billion
of government debt to avert deflation and expand the economy. </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft''s $1 billion of 10-
year, 3 percent notes have fallen 1.95 cents on the dollar from
their Sept. 22 issue to 97.19 cents as of Nov. 18, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The 2 percent loss on the top-ranked debt
compares with a 0.2 percent decline for investment-grade bonds
since Sept. 23, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>Buying Opportunity </p>
<p>Price declines in the bonds of some of the world''s highest-
rated companies are an opportunity to buy the securities as a
hedge against contagion from Europe''s debt crisis, which may
weaken the Treasury market, said Jason Weiner, a senior fixed-
income fund manager in Milwaukee at MI Investment Management
Corp. </p>
<p>At some point, what''s going on in Ireland, Greece,
Portugal and other sovereign-risk countries out there could
infect the U.S. Treasury market on the basis we issued too much
debt and we''re no longer a safe haven, he said. </p>
<p>Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own company bonds instead of similar-maturity
government debt rose 1 basis point to 166 basis points, or 1.66
percentage point, down from this year''s high of 201 basis points
on June 11, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s Global
Broad Market Corporate Index. Yields averaged 3.63 percent. </p>
<p>Relative yields on U.S. investment-grade bonds were
unchanged yesterday at 175 basis points, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch''s U.S. Corporate Master Index. Spreads
have declined 2 basis points this month. </p>
<p>Default Swaps Rise </p>
<p>The cost of protecting bonds from default in the U.S. rose
for a second day to the highest level in a week. The Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, increased 2.8 basis points to a mid-price of
93.8 basis points as of 12:56 p.m. in New York, according to
index administrator Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, ended Nov. 19 at 89.8
basis points. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a
borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>Performance Food Group Co., the food distributor owned by
Blackstone Group LP, pulled its proposed $550 million note sale
citing adverse market conditions, according to a person
familiar with the transaction. The company was marketing seven-
year notes, said the person, who declined to be identified
citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. </p>
<p>National Amusements </p>
<p>National Amusements Inc., the movie theater company
controlled by Sumner Redstone, plans to sell $390 million of
seven-year senior secured notes, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. The debt may be issued as soon as next
week, said the person, who declined to be identified because
terms aren''t set. The bonds may be sold through the company''s
NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC unit with proceeds used to
refinance a credit facility, the person said. </p>
<p>Since July, companies from McDonald''s Corp., the world''s
largest restaurant chain, to drugmaker Johnson  Johnson, sold
debt at record low borrowing costs as investors priced in a
slower economic recovery and the Fed held interest rates near
zero. </p>
<p>Microsoft, rated Aaa by Moody''s Investors Service and AAA
by SP, obtained the second-lowest borrowing costs for 10-year
debt, after Johnson  Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive Co.,
Bloomberg data show. Investor demand and record-low yields on
investment-grade debt helped the world''s largest software maker
issue the securities in its second bond offering. </p>
<p>Wal-Mart </p>
<p>Wal-Mart, the world''s largest retailer, sold $750 million
of 0.75 percent bonds on Oct. 18 at the lowest borrowing cost
for three-year notes, according to Bank of America Corp., which
helped manage the offering. The notes lost 0.41 cent on the
dollar to trade at 99.24 cents as of Nov. 18, Trace data show. </p>
<p>Their 0.4 percent decline since they were sold compares
with the 0.02 percent gain on investment-grade corporate bonds
due in one to three years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data show. </p>
<p>Bonds with low coupons are suffering because too many hedge
funds and fast-money flippers purchased the securities,
instead of investors who typically buy and hold the debt, said
Tim Doubek, a portfolio manager who helps oversee more than $22
billion of investment-grade credit at Columbia Management in
Minneapolis. </p>
<p>Lumber Around'' </p>
<p>You''re just finding people want to sell them right around
where they were issued, and they really can''t interest any
buyers because a large portion of the buyer base of that new
issue is trying to do the same thing, he said. It''s going to
be one of those markets where the high-quality new issues lumber
around where they came or widen and you''ll see really, really
good deep bids for lower-quality names. </p>
<p>Spreads in 2011 are likely to tighten most on debt from
high-quality financials, low-quality non-financials and bonds
maturing between five and seven years, Goldman strategists
Charles Himmelberg, Alberto Gallo, Lotfi Karoui and Annie Chu
wrote in a Nov. 19 report. </p>
<p>Our rates team expects long-dated Treasuries to move
higher on economic recovery, both in the U.S. and globally, and
the normalization of U.S. inflation expectations, with yields on
the 10-year rising to 3.3 percent by the end of 2011, the
strategists wrote. We expect total returns on tight-spread
credit to underperform accordingly, with high-quality names
suffering the most. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Bonds </p>
<p>Coca-Cola''s 0.75 percent, 3-year notes issued on Nov. 4 at
99.953 cents on the dollar, tying Wal-Mart''s record, traded at
99.382 cents as of 12:06 p.m. in New York, Trace data show. The
$1.25 billion of debt from the world''s largest soft-drink maker
has lost 0.8 percent since issue, compared with the 0.28 percent
decline on investment-grade corporate bonds due between one and
three years during the same period, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>Weiner, whose firm oversees about $32 billion, including
the Microsoft securities issued in September, says he will
consider purchasing some of the low-coupon debt from companies
such as International Business Machines Corp. of Armonk, New
York, and Microsoft, if they continue to decline. </p>
<p>People are willing to buy IBM and Microsoft and other
corporations that have really solid balance sheets and adds
diversification away from Treasuries, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $17.8
million of notes with returns based on the performance of the
MSCI AC World Index, the first offering linked to the benchmark
in three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The three-year structured notes, sold Nov. 17, pay about
1.2 times any gains in the index of world stocks, according to a
prospectus filed yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Investors will receive their principal back when the
notes mature, provided the MSCI doesn''t fall more than 10
percent. A greater decline would mean they lose money. </p>
<p>The offering is the first linked to the benchmark index
since Aug. 20, when Goldman Sachs sold $2.6 million of 18-month
notes, the data show. The MSCI AC World Index measures share
prices of companies in both emerging and developed countries. It
rose 6.3 percent this year through yesterday, while the SP 500
Index of U.S. stocks climbed 7.4 percent. </p>
<p>Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. </p>
<p>Derivatives are financial instruments used to hedge risks

<p>Mobile advertising revenue will
rise tenfold to about $24.1 billion by 2015, with much of that
growth coming from China and India, according to Informa
Telecoms  Media. </p>
<p>Informa believes that the global mobile-advertising
market was worth $2.3 billion in 2009, Shailendra Pandey, a
senior analyst with London-based consultant Informa, said in an
report today. The Asia Pacific Developing region will account
for the largest share by 2015, at 30.9 percent, driven by
strong growth from China and India, Pandey said. The Asia
Pacific Developed region, including Japan and South Korea, will
fall to 21.7 percent from about 43.6 percent this year. </p>
<p>Google Inc. and Apple Inc. have both bought mobile
advertising businesses in the past year to take advantage of
consumers'' increasing use of mobile devices to buy goods and
services. Google bought Admob in May for $750 million and Apple
paid more than $200 million for Quattro Wireless in January. </p>
<p>Successful companies that have unique and attractive
technology for mobile advertising, will become takeover
targets for companies such as Google, Apple, Nokia Oyj and
Yahoo! Inc, Pandey said. Apple''s iAd network, which was started
in July, will force its rivals to speed up their own mobile
advertising strategies, particularly Google, which has
completed its acquisition of AdMob, he said. </p>
<p>North America will account for 18 percent of the market in
2015, with Latin America at 6.4 percent and Western Europe 8.6
percent, according to the report. </p>
<p>The mobile advertising industry has now moved beyond the
trial and experimental phase and many advertisers and brands
are now spending significant sums on running mobile campaigns
each month, Pandey said. </p>

federal prosecutor and lawyer with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. It has opted not to issue grand jury subpoenas but
instead use the search warrant process. </p>
<p>Steve Bruce, a spokesman for Diamondback, and Andy Merrill,
a spokesman for Level Global, confirmed the FBI had searched
their offices and said they are cooperating. Timothy McSweeney
of Boston-based Loch Capital didn''t respond to a phone message
seeking comment. </p>
<p>Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Bharara, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Diamondback, based in Stamford, Connecticut, owned U.S.-
listed stocks in 706 companies at the end of the third quarter,
with a market value of $4.13 billion, most of it in energy
companies and financial services, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Level Global, with offices in Greenwich and New York,
owned stocks in 77 companies valued at $3.08 billion, with 34
percent of that in consumer discretionary stocks and 31 percent
in information technology companies. </p>
<p>Its biggest U.S. stock holding by market value is a 5.8
percent stake in Virgin Media Inc., the U.K.''s second-largest
pay-television company, according to regulatory filings for the
third quarter. Diamondback has about 215 employees as of Aug. 1,
according to an investor letter. </p>
<p>Frenkel, the former prosecutor, said that it''s likely the
government has cooperating witnesses providing information to
help it obtain the warrants from federal judges. </p>
<p>The availability of those tools is very fact and
cooperator intensive, he said. In order to get a warrant,
the government has to have information that would enable it to
get court authorization. </p>

<p>JPMorgan, Ex-Asia Private Equity Head Settle Dispute </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. settled a dispute with Varun Bery, who
had sued the bank in Hong Kong for breaching an agreement that
allowed him to leave with the private equity team and platform
he managed. </p>
<p>Bery will provide private equity consulting services to
JPMorgan, they said in a joint statement announcing the
amicable resolution. </p>
<p>Bery, who co-founded private equity firm TVG Capital
Partners Ltd., sued JPMorgan Private Capital Asia Corp. in
April, claiming damages in the region of $30.8 million. Bery
joined JPMorgan in 2008 to head the bank''s Asian private equity
business and was told in 2009 that the bank wouldn''t commit more
capital to it, or allow it to be spun out, according to the
lawsuit. He left the bank in November 2009. </p>
<p>Bery continues to operate as managing director of TVG and
JPMorgan wishes him every success in the future, according to
the statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan spokesman Ray Bashford and TVG spokeswoman Emily
Chow declined to comment on whether the spinout will be allowed. </p>
<p>Enron Broadband''s Shelby Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading </p>
<p>Former Enron Broadband Services executive Rex Shelby
pleaded guilty to one insider trading count as prosecutors
dropped more serious charges stemming from the collapse of the
world''s largest energy trader nine years ago. </p>
<p>Shelby, 58, agreed to serve as long as six months in a
federal halfway house, plus as long as six months'' house arrest,
and forfeit about $2.5 million to end the final prosecution
linked to what the government claimed was a conspiracy to
overstate the capabilities and performance of Enron Corp.''s
Internet unit. </p>
<p>This ends Enron, because Rex was the very last Enron
defendant standing from prosecutions that resulted from the
company''s bankruptcy, Ed Tomko, Shelby''s lawyer, said in a
telephone interview before yesterday''s plea hearing. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore accepted Shelby''s plea
in her Houston courtroom yesterday. A retrial for Shelby, the
Internet unit''s former senior vice president of engineering
operations, had been set for January. He will remain free on $1
million bond until sentencing, scheduled for Feb. 28. </p>
<p>More than 5,000 jobs and $60 billion in shareholder value
were wiped out when Enron plunged into bankruptcy in December
2001 after widespread accounting fraud was revealed. Enron''s
former chief executive officers Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay
were convicted of conspiring to mislead investors about the
company''s performance, including the broadband division''s
prospects. </p>
<p>Rex was conflicted about pleading guilty, but we got a
deal that was fair considering the passage of time and the risk
involved, Tomko said in the interview. It ensures that Rex
won''t have to go through the uncertainty of another trial like
the last one, which so confused the jury. </p>

<p>Morris Pleads Guilty in New York State Pension Probe </p>
<p>Henry Hank Morris pleaded guilty to a single count of
securities fraud stemming from New York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo''s probe of corruption in the state pension fund. </p>
<p>You''re pleading guilty? New York state Supreme Court
Justice Lewis Stone asked yesterday at a hearing in Manhattan.
Yes, your honor, Morris said. The judge said the crime
carries a sentence of 1 1/3 to four years in prison or no jail
time at all. </p>
<p>Morris is the eighth person to plead guilty in connection
with the New York corruption probe. Former state Comptroller
Alan Hevesi in October admitted to receiving a reward for
official misconduct. Last week, Cuomo sued Steven Rattner,
former head of Quadrangle Group LLC, accusing him of arranging
kickbacks to Morris. </p>
<p>Morris, chief political adviser to Hevesi, was accused of
corrupting the investment process at the pension fund, recently
valued at $132.8 billion, to favor deals that would benefit
himself, his associates and contributors to Hevesi''s campaign. </p>
<p>Ellen Biben, a prosecutor from Cuomo''s office, told Stone
that Morris''s plea yesterday established once and for all that
his conduct wasn''t just unethical, but was criminal. Morris
had faced more than 70 charges. </p>
<p>Morris reaped $19 million in fees for himself through 23
state pension-fund investments for which he acted as an
undisclosed placement agent, or middleman, according to Cuomo. </p>

<p>Novartis Told by Jury to Pay $12.8 Million Over Bone Drugs </p>
<p>Novartis AG must pay $12.8 million to a North Carolina
woman''s family over claims that the company''s bone-strengthening
drugs Aredia and Zometa caused irreplaceable bone damage, a jury
ruled. </p>
<p>The award will be reduced to about $1.1 million under state
law. Jurors in federal court in Winston-Salem, North Carolina,
deliberated about 12 hours over three days before finding today
that Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis failed to adequately warn
Rita Fussman about the drugs'' risks. Fussman''s family alleged
the drugs ate away her jaw while she struggled through
treatments for breast cancer before dying last year. </p>
<p>We''re pleased that the jury saw fit to award punitive
damages because the evidence produced more than justified such
an award, Robert Germany, Fussman''s lawyer, said in an
interview after jurors returned the verdict. </p>
<p>The Fussman family''s lawsuit was the third product-
liability case to go to trial over the bone-strengthening
treatments. Last month, a New Jersey jury rejected a woman''s
claims that Aredia and Zometa caused her jaw deterioration. In
October 2009, a Montana jury ordered Novartis to pay $3.2
million in damages to a cancer patient who made the same claims
over the medicines. </p>
<p>Novartis is facing about 700 suits over the bone-
strengthening medicines, according to court filings. Some of the
cases have been consolidated before a federal judge in
Tennessee. Others, like Fussman''s, have been sent back to their
home courts for trial. Still other cases have been heard in
state courts around the country. </p>
<p>Julie Masow, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Novartis, said
the company was disappointed with the jury''s verdict. We are
reviewing our appellate options, she said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>

<p>Siemens Agrees on Payment to Settle Nigerian Case </p>
<p>Siemens AG, Europe''s largest engineering company, agreed to
pay 7 billion naira ($46.5 million) to settle charges of illegal
payments to officials in Nigeria, Justice Minister Mohammed
Adoke said. </p>
<p>The federal government has agreed to discontinue the
criminal prosecution it instituted against Siemens, Adoke told
reporters in Abuja, the capital, yesterday. The company agreed
to be of good conduct in future business dealings in the
West African nation, he said. </p>
<p>In December 2008, Siemens agreed to pay $800 million to
settle U.S. charges that it violated anti-corruption laws by
funding bribes to governments around the world, including in
Nigeria. Siemens''s payment to Nigeria is about three times
higher than the alleged bribes, Adoke said, without providing
further details. </p>
<p>Siemens''s agreement with the Nigerian government is the
last step toward improving relationships with Nigeria, Joern
Roggenbuck, a spokesman for the company, said in a phone
interview from Munich yesterday. </p>

<p>Valero Shareholder Sues to Stop Stock Incentive Plan </p>
<p>Valero Energy Corp.''s stock incentive plan is wasteful
and exposes the company to excessive taxes, a shareholder said
in a lawsuit that seeks to throw out the oil refiner''s
compensation program. </p>
<p>Valero shareholder Milton Pfeiffer said that the stock plan
is worth as much $20 million per participant, according to a
complaint filed Nov. 19 in U.S. District Court in Wilmington,
Delaware. Pfeiffer sued the company''s board of directors,
Valero''s chief executive officer and chairman William R. Klesse
and four other executives. </p>
<p>These excessive payments are not justified in light of
the fact that the company suffered a loss of net income of
almost $2 billion for the fiscal year ending 2009, Pfeiffer
said in the complaint. </p>
<p>The San Antonio-based refiner will lose millions of dollars
of tax benefits because the compensation program is defective,
according to the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Company spokesman Bill Day said he couldn''t comment because
he hasn''t yet seen the lawsuit. </p>

<p>Lawsuits </p>
<p>Ex-Goldman Programmer Asks Judge to Admit Statements </p>
<p>Sergey Aleynikov, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
programmer charged with stealing secret computer-trading
software, wants to tell jurors about exaggerated claims he says
the government made, then took back, in his case. </p>
<p>The government once believed that Sergey Aleynikov had
stolen Goldman Sachs''s entire high frequency trading platform,
worth millions of dollars, and that unless he was detained he
would sell it to the highest bidder and throw the world''s
financial markets into turmoil, he said in court papers filed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>Prosecutors now claim Aleynikov stole only parts of the
trading system, he claimed. The change in the government''s
position will help him prove he didn''t have the necessary intent
to violate the two laws he''s charged with breaking, he claimed. </p>
<p>Aleynikov is charged with violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is presiding over the trial
set to begin Nov. 29, dismissed a third criminal count of
unauthorized computer access against Aleynikov in September. </p>
<p>Jessie Erwin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney''s office
in New York, declined to comment on Aleynikov''s request. </p>
<p>Aleynikov was arrested in July 2009 and charged with
stealing computer trading code from Goldman Sachs on his last
day of work with the bank the month before. He''s seeking to
admit into evidence a series of statements made at a July 4,
2009, detention hearing by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph
Facciponti. </p>

<p>Chiesi Claims FBI Delayed Advising Her of Rights </p>
<p>Danielle Chiesi, accused with Raj Rajaratnam in the largest
insider-trading case involving hedge funds, testified that U.S.
agents questioned her before advising her of her right to remain
silent and to seek a lawyer''s advice. </p>
<p>Chiesi, testifying for the first time in a hearing
yesterday, told U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in New York
that a group of five federal agents who woke her up and arrested
her in her apartment Oct. 16, 2009, asked her questions and
tried to get her to cooperate with their investigation before
giving her a so-called Miranda warning. </p>
<p>Absolutely not, Chiesi said, in reply to a question
from her attorney asking whether she had any doubt about her
claim that she wasn''t told her rights until after she was
arrested. </p>
<p>Chiesi, a former New Castle Funds LLC consultant, and
Rajaratnam, Galleon Group LLC''s co-founder, are charged
with profiting from tips from company executives, hedge-fund
employees and other insiders. Yesterday''s hearing comes in
response to court papers filed by Chiesi asking Holwell to bar
the government from using any statements she made that morning
to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. </p>

<p>Ex-Madoff Employee Bongiorno Must Remain in Custody </p>
<p>Annette Bongiorno, Bernard Madoff''s longtime secretary
indicted this month in his Ponzi scheme, lost her bid for bail
and was ordered by a federal magistrate in Florida to be taken
to New York to face charges. </p>
<p>Bongiorno, 62, who started working for Madoff in 1968,
shortly after she graduated from high school, is charged in a
federal indictment with conspiracy, securities fraud and tax
evasion. U.S. Magistrate Judge Ann E. Vitunac in West Palm Beach
yesterday denied Bongiorno''s request to be released with
electronic monitoring or under house arrest. </p>
<p>Bongiorno worked as Madoff''s personal secretary in the
1980s. She also had clerical duties at Bernard Madoff Investment
Securities LLC. Clients who discovered the wrong Social Security
numbers on their statements were told to call Bongiorno,
according to a copy of one such notice. </p>
<p>She took $14.4 million out of the investment fund by
creating sham trades in her own account, where she deposited a
total of $920,000 from 1975 to 2008, the government charged. </p>
<p>She also received $325,000 in off-the-books payments from
the firm, prosecutors charged. </p>
<p>She faces a prison sentence of as long as 75 years if
convicted of all charges, the U.S. said. </p>
<p>Maurice Sercarz, Bongiorno''s lawyer, said in court that he
was continuing to work with federal prosecutors and agents in
New York to come up with at least five family members or friends
of Bongiorno''s who can post $2 million in assets to secure a $5
million bond. </p>
<p>The case is USA v. Bongiorno, 10-mj-08361, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (West Palm Beach). The New

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>Lehman Asks Judge to Reverse Barclays'' Windfall'' </p>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. asked a judge to reverse
billions of dollars in unauthorized transfers of assets to
Barclays Plc when it bought the defunct investment bank''s
brokerage in the 2008 financial crisis, according to a court
filing. </p>
<p>Lehman has accused the U.K. bank of making an $11 billion
windfall on the purchase. </p>
<p>The sale transaction that was disclosed to the court was
based upon false premises from the very outset, Lehman''s
lawyer, Robert Gaffey, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James in a
court filing yesterday that is his last chance to sway the
judge. Peck may rule on Lehman''s yearlong lawsuit against
Barclays in January or February, said lawyers in the case. </p>
<p>The fight in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan pits the
U.K.''s third-biggest bank against Lehman, which wants money to
pay off creditors. Peck said after more than 30 days of
witnesses that he was in uncharted territory. He asked both
sides to advise him --in filings due yesterday -- how to apply
the law. </p>
<p>Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history
on Sept. 15, 2008, got a strong push from the U.S. Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the Securities and Exchange
Commission to declare itself bankrupt, according to yesterday''s
filing. The regulators Lehman''s board the day before it knows
what our opinion is on this, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Peck must decide whether to alter a deal sealed in a week
of financial turmoil, or let all or part of it stand. He said in
court last month he had been leaning toward Barclays'' view,
expressed by lawyer David Boies, that he would have approved the
sale even if he''d known everything he knows now. </p>
<p>Contracts are usually final under federal law. Judges can
reopen a contract to correct mistakes or, under so-called Rule
60(b), if new evidence or fraud is discovered. Still, University
of California, Los Angeles professor Lynn LoPucki said he knows
of no emergency bankruptcy sale in his 898-case database that
has been reopened. </p>
<p>In yesterday''s filing, Gaffey said essential aspects of the
sale to Barclays were either misrepresented to the court, or,
worse, never disclosed at all. They included Barclays'' profit
on the deal, which the judge was told would be a balanced
transaction, and obligations it said it would assume and didn''t,
he said. </p>
<p>Barclays'' lawyer David Boies has told Peck in court that
federal law doesn''t allow him to rewrite the sale contract. </p>

<p>Oracle Asks Jurors to Find SAP Owes $1.7 Billion </p>
<p>An Oracle Corp. attorney told a federal jury yesterday that
SAP AG should pay at least $1.7 billion in damages for copyright
infringement even though SAP''s plans to use the copyrights
didn''t fully work out. </p>
<p>David Boies, Oracle''s lawyer at a three-week trial in
Oakland, California, said the damage award that the jury will
decide should be based on SAP''s business plans in 2005 to
capture thousand customers from Oracle and not the smaller
number of customers that actually left Oracle for SAP. </p>
<p>The board and top executives expected the infringement
would be worth billions of dollars, Boies said in closing
arguments yesterday. When they take it, they own it and they
have to pay for it regardless of whether they did well or didn''t
do well.'''' </p>
<p>Oracle, the second-largest maker of business application
software behind Walldorf, Germany-based SAP, sued its competitor
in 2007, claiming SAP''s TomorrowNow software maintenance unit
made hundreds of thousands of downloads and several thousand
copies of Redwood City, California-based Oracle''s software to
avoid paying licensing fees and to steal customers. </p>
<p>SAP has agreed that the infringement occurred. The
downloads enabled TomorrowNow to fix bugs and provide updates to
software customers who otherwise would have had to pay Oracle
for maintenance or do the work themselves. </p>

<p>Ex-PM Group Manager Says No Sensitive Data Used in Share Sales </p>
<p>A former PM Group Plc manager on trial for insider trading
told a London jury that he didn''t use price-sensitive
information. </p>
<p>Neil Rollins, 46, testified that he didn''t believe it would
be illegal to trade shares of the company in 2006 prior to PM
Group announcing it was experiencing a decline in sales. He said
that while he was aware of the figures and knew the company
planned to cut jobs, the information didn''t influence his
decision. </p>
<p>I was not using the price-sensitive information to make
my decision, he said. </p>
<p>Rollins sold 74,000 shares in the company in August and
September 2006, prosecutors said in the indictment. He
transferred 120,000 pounds ($191,000) to his father, prosecutors
said. He is also charged with laundering the proceeds of the
share sale. </p>
<p>Bradford, England-based PM Group, which was bought by
Vishay Intertechnology Inc. in 2007, makes scales used in the
waste-management industry. In December 2006, PM Group discovered
that Rollins had sold the shares and fired him, prosecutors said
at the trial earlier this month. </p>

<p>Lehman Pays Advisers $1.1 Billion in 25 1/2 Months </p>
<p>Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. paid its lawyers and managers
$42.1 million in October, bringing total advisers'' fees to $1.1
billion after 25 1/2 months in bankruptcy, according to a court
filing. </p>
<p>Restructuring firm Alvarez  Marsal LLC, which runs the
defunct investment bank through its co-founder, Bryan Marsal,
led recipients with $369.8 million in fees through October for
interim management, according to yesterday''s filing in U.S.

collected $245.8 million for acting as the lead bankruptcy law
firm. </p>
<p>Jones Day, which is handling Lehman''s $11 billion lawsuit
against Barclays Plc and other litigation, made $40.8 million
through October. </p>
<p>Advisers'' fees haven''t faced major challenges from the
bankruptcy judge or trustee who monitor such payments. </p>
<p>Lehman became the most expensive bankruptcy to administer
in U.S. history in April, when it topped the $757 million cost
of energy trader Enron Corp.''s three-year liquidation,
according to the database of Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy-law
professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, didn''t reply to an
e-mail seeking comment, </p>
<p>Lehman, once the world''s fourth-biggest investment bank,
filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008
with assets of $639 billion. Creditors include Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., UBS AG, the New York Giants professional football
team and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority as well as individuals
who hold Lehman bonds. </p>

<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission expanded its complaint against Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. trader Fabrice Tourre, accusing him of giving the company
substantial assistance as it misled investors in a product
linked to subprime mortgages. </p>
<p>The SEC, which reached a $550 million settlement with
Goldman Sachs in July, included the new claim against Tourre in
an amended complaint filed Nov. 22 at U.S. District Court in New
York. The London-based trader, accused of helping the Wall
Street firm defraud investors in a product known as Abacus, may
face trial after failing to win dismissal of the SEC''s case. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Tourre were sued April 16 by the SEC,
which accused them of failing to tell investors that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities for the
collateralized debt obligation and planned to bet against them. </p>
<p>The SEC is clearly preparing for this case to go the
distance, said Jacob Frenkel, a partner at Potomac, Maryland-
based law firm Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker. They want
to make sure that their allegations are sufficiently broad so
that a jury could still find him responsible for aiding fraud
even if they determine he wasn''t the primary violator, he said. </p>
<p>A phone call to Pamela Chepiga, Tourre''s attorney at Allen
 Overy LLP in New York, wasn''t returned. Goldman Sachs
spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment. </p>
<p>Tourre played a principal role in the offer and sale of
the securities to Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG, and was aware of marketing materials that
omitted Paulson''s role in selecting underlying securities for
Abacus, the SEC said. </p>

money has been allocated on an asset-allocation basis to the new
markets. </p>
<p>Mack said his view on emerging markets comes from recent
trips abroad to countries including China, and urged investors
to take similar trips. </p>
<p>The MSCI Emerging Market Index has climbed 28 percent since
May 25 in a six-month rally that has more than doubled returns
on the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index in the period, helped by fast
economic growth in countries such as Brazil and India. </p>
<p>Asked about Europe''s debt troubles, Mack said he''s still
willing to make investments tied to banks on the continent. </p>
<p>I think some of the banks will come out of this very
strong, Mack said. I would be cautious in the smaller banks.
I''d be cautious in the U.K. But I think there are great
opportunities in some of these banks. It''s a risky trade. </p>
<p>Ireland''s government is in talks with the European Union

<p>Portugal will need a bailout and
investors will then focus on Spain as there''s little to stop
the contagion from Europe''s sovereign-debt crisis, said
Joachim Fels, co-chief global economist at Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>I think investors have lost confidence in the ability of
Portugal to turn around its situation, so it looks like Portugal
will be forced into the EFSF, Europe''s bailout fund, Fels said
today in an interview on Bloomberg Television''s Inside Track
with Erik Schatzker. I think the focus is now on Portugal and
then I think the markets will turn to Spain. </p>
<p>Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado said today the
country won''t need a bailout as borrowing costs surged for
Europe''s so-called peripheral countries after Ireland''s request
for aid prompted speculation that other nations may need help.
The difference in yield, or spread, between Spanish 10-year
bonds and German bunds surged to a euro-era high of 249 basis
points today. Portugal''s spread was at 434 basis points. </p>
<p>Ireland this week became the first nation to tap the
European Financial Stability Facility, the euro region''s 750
billion-euro ($1 trillion) rescue fund set up in May after
Greece''s near-default. It asked for help after the cost of
saving its financial industry swelled the budget deficit to an
estimated 32 percent of gross domestic product this year, 10
times the European Union''s limit. </p>
<p>Enough is Enough'' </p>
<p>There will come a point when governments will say enough
is enough, and we will rather borrow from the EFSF at a sensible
rate,'' which is lower than the market rate, Fels said.
Portugal is already there. Portuguese three-year bonds trade
at a five and a half percent yield -- that''s higher than the
yield at which Portugal could borrow from the fund. </p>
<p>Spanish yields would have to approach 6 percent to 7
percent in the short end of the curve for the country to be
close to needing aid, Fels said. So we''re not there for
Spain, he said. </p>
<p>Bonds in Ireland, Portugal and Greece have slumped since EU
leaders agreed on Oct. 29 to consider Germany''s proposal for a
permanent rescue mechanism as of 2013 that would involve debt
restructuring with losses for bondholders. German Chancellor
Angela Merkel wants buyers of new euro-region bonds to accept
liability clauses starting in 2011, two years before a revamped
crisis-management system kicks in, according to a Finance
Ministry document obtained by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Merkel''s comments have clearly made the crisis much
worse, Fels said. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., the world''s
biggest oil company, invested 17 billion kroner ($2.8 billion)
in Norway in 2009 and expects the same levels for 2010 and 2011,
as it works to maintain production in the Scandinavian country. </p>
<p>Exxon, which has a daily output of 410,000 barrels of oil
equivalent in Norway, invested 6 billion kroner in 2008 and last
year estimated investments would stay at about 10 billion
kroner. </p>
<p>It''s driven by the Ringhorne drilling, the ramp-up in
drilling activity, the ramp-up in new projects, John Whelan,
operations manager for North Sea production at Exxon in Norway,
said today in an interview. A lot of the drilling and the
activity we''re doing now is to keep production. </p>
<p>Norway''s oil output peaked in 2000 and is forecast to drop
6 percent this year to about 1.87 million barrels a day,
according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. The industry
has urged the government to open up more of the northern areas
to exploration. </p>
<p>Exxon is not seeking to reduce its presence in the country,
Whelan said. Norway accounts for 10 percent of Exxon''s worldwide
production and it has participated in about one-third of all
Norwegian discoveries since 2007. </p>
<p>Norway is very important for us, he said. We still
see significant life in our existing operating assets. </p>
<p>Whelan declined to comment on a report by the Sunday Times
that it has started a $2 billion auction of North Sea oil
assets, including its Beryl field. </p>
<p>We don''t comment on speculation around our assets,
Whelan said. We''re a long-term investor in the U.K. and we''re
going to continue to be a major investor in the U.K. </p>

<p>China''s sway in the global commodity

<p>When we look into 2011, the story is not going to be
China, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman
Sachs, said today at a conference in London. It is going to be
Europe and the U.S. </p>
<p>China is late in its cycle of economic growth, Currie said.
They are raising rates. They are battling inflation. In
Europe and the U.S., it''s still early cycle, he said. </p>
<p>Crude oil may reach $100 a barrel next year, Currie said.
That''s our forecast 12 months out, he said. </p>
<p>Currie wants to be short on metals and long on energy at
the start of 2011, he said. Later in the year, as demand begins
to push back up, oil will start again to look like the non-
energy space, he said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
North Sea Forties oil from Royal Dutch Shell Plc. Russia''s two
largest ports will increase crude shipments next month. </p>
<p>The bank purchased a Forties shipment due to load on Dec.
10 to Dec. 12 at a discount of 95 cents to the cash cost of
North Sea oil in February, according to traders involved in
transactions of the region''s crude. </p>
<p>Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
a trading window that ends daily at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior
to the window, Forties loading from 10 to 21 days in the future
cost 23 cents less than Dated Brent compared with a 30-cent
discount yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Brent crude for January settlement traded at $86.38 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the
close of the window, up from $85.15 a barrel at the same time
yesterday. The February contract traded at $86.53 a barrel,
narrowing the contango, or price spread, between the two
nearest-term contracts to 15 cents from 19 cents. </p>
<p>Russia''s two largest crude export facilities will bolster
their combined shipments by 2.4 percent in December, according
to a loading schedule. </p>
<p>Primorsk shipments will jump 8.9 percent to 1.49 million
barrels a day, more than offsetting a decline in exports from
Novorossiysk, which will drop 7.9 percent to 791,000 barrels a
day. That means total cargoes from the two ports will rise to
2.28 million barrels a day, from an original schedule for this
month of 2.23 million. </p>
<p>Sudan Petroleum Corp., the country''s state oil company,
offered to sell 1.2 million barrels of Nile Blend crude for
loading in January, said two traders who participate in the

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA, Europe''s
third-biggest insurer, plans to increase its real-estate
holdings and boost asset-management in central and eastern
Europe and Asia to raise profitability. </p>
<p>The insurer seeks to expand its real-estate portfolio to 30
billion euros ($40 billion) in the medium term from 24.2
billion euros as of Sept. 30, the Trieste, Italy-based company
said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Generali will focus its new investments not only to take
advantage of the market cycle in European countries, but also to
diversify the portfolio into areas offering attractive returns
like the U.S., Generali said in the statement. In China, it
will begin investing the resources generated locally by the
insurance business. </p>
<p>Generali aims to boost its assets under management in Asia,
focusing on China, and in central and eastern Europe to
enhance support for its local operations. In China, the Hong
Kong-based joint venture with Guotai AMC will begin operations
in early 2011, Generali said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Giovanni Perissinotto, who led the
purchase of 30 percent of Chinese asset manager Guotai last
year, is trying to expand in emerging markets and eastern Europe
to boost profitability following the global financial crisis. </p>
<p>Generali aims to triple assets managed in Asia through its
BSI private banking unit, targeting $15 billion of assets under
management by 2013 from the current $5 billion, Perissinotto
said during a speech at the company''s investor day in Venice
today. They also plan to hire staffers in Hong Kong to boost
inflow. </p>
<p>The insurer fell as much as 3.2 percent in Milan trading,
and was down 36 cents to 14.10 euros by 1:38 p.m., giving the
company a market value of about 22 billion euros. The Bloomberg
Europe 500 Insurance Index fell 3.4 percent this year, compared
with Generali''s 25 percent decline. </p>
<p>Generali''s third-quarter profit rose 13 percent to 440
million euros as earnings at its life-insurance unit increased,
the company said on Nov. 11. Generali reiterated that it expects
to report higher full-year operating margins and an increase in
net income compared with 2009. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court will consider
making some patents more vulnerable to legal challenge, agreeing
to hear Microsoft Corp.''s appeal in a case that forced changes
in the company''s Word software and may cost it $300 million. </p>
<p>Microsoft, fighting a verdict won by closely held I4i LP,
says the federal appeals court that handles patent cases is
making it too hard for those accused of infringement to argue
that a patent never should have been issued and is invalid. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software maker has support in its
appeal from more than a dozen publicly traded companies,
including Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Apple told the justices
that the patent system is tilting out of balance, giving
disproportionate power to people who secure patents of
questionable legitimacy. </p>
<p>The award stood as the largest ever upheld by an appeals
court in a patent case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in Washington concluded that Microsoft didn''t
prove that the disputed patent was based on technology that was
already in the marketplace. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which had $5.41 billion in profit in the most
recent quarter, hasn''t yet paid any damages to I4i. The unit
that sells Office is Microsoft''s biggest, with $5.13 billion in
sales in the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Microsoft rose six
cents to $25.31 at 4 p.m. in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. </p>
<p>Traditional Presumption </p>
<p>In its ruling, the appeals court said Microsoft needed to
offer clear and convincing evidence to overcome the
traditional presumption that patents approved by the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office are valid. </p>
<p>Microsoft contends that a less-demanding standard should
apply when a jury is presented with evidence about pre-existing
technology that the patent examiner didn''t consider. In such a
case, there is no factual determination with respect to
patentability that warrants deference in the form of a clear-
and-convincing-evidence standard, the Redmond, Washington-
based company argued. </p>
<p>Toronto-based I4i urged the Supreme Court not to hear the
appeal, arguing that the clear and convincing standard is a
longstanding rule that has encouraged innovation. </p>
<p>The heightened burden benefits the public by increasing
inventors'' incentive to commit the resources required for
innovation and then to disclose their inventions, I4i argued. </p>
<p>Markup Language </p>
<p>The case concerns a method developed by I4i for editing
some documents using XML, a so-called markup language that tells
the computer how text should appear. I4i created a way to store
the content and the XML codes separately, making it easier for
users to work alone with either the content or the codes. </p>
<p>The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. Customers including drugmakers Merck 
Co. and Bayer AG use I4i''s software to make sure that people get
the correct and most up-to-date information on the labels of
their medicine. </p>
<p>In its 2007 lawsuit, I4i accused Microsoft of incorporating
the invention into the larger company''s Word program, which is
used by 500 million people worldwide. </p>
<p>Microsoft argued in defense that I4i had included its
innovation in a product it sold to a client more than a year
before it filed its patent application. That prior use would
have rendered the invention ineligible for patenting under
federal law. </p>
<p>$200 Million Award </p>
<p>A jury agreed with I4i and awarded $200 million. The judge
overseeing the case increased that sum because of misconduct by
Microsoft''s trial lawyer, and the figure has continued to grow
with interest. The court also ordered Microsoft to stop using
the invention, forcing the company to update the Word software. </p>
<p>Microsoft also has support in its appeal from trade groups
representing the financial services and wireless industries. The
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the
Clearing House Association told the justices that suits based on
questionable patents are a plague upon the financial
industry. </p>
<p>The court''s decision to hear the case is a clear
affirmation that the issues raised in this case are critical to
the integrity of our patent system, David Howard, Microsoft''s
deputy general counsel for litigation, said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>Simplistic Appeal'' </p>
<p>I4i Chairman Loudon Owen said in a telephone interview that
Microsoft''s argument has a simplistic appeal that does not
take into consideration at all what the patent office actually
does. If Microsoft wins, he said, inventors would inundate the
already overburdened patent office with data and examiners would
have to fill out more paperwork to explain their decisions. </p>
<p>What it''s going to result in is tremendous uncertainty
for anyone who owns a patent, he said. It would be a sea
change in the operations of the patent office and would be a
dramatic body blow to the health of the U.S. patent industry and
the value of patents. </p>
<p>The case, which the court will consider in the first half
of 2011, is Microsoft v. I4i Limited Partnership, 10-290 </p>

<p>Pasquale Diana, an economist at
Morgan Stanley in London, comments on today''s rate decision in
Hungary and the outlook for rates and inflation. </p>
<p>Hungarian rate setters almost unanimously voted to raise
interest rates today to 5.5 percent from a record-low 5.25
percent, Magyar Nemzeti Bank President Andras Simor said in
Budapest. </p>
<p>Diana made the comments in an e-mailed note. </p>
<p>On the rate outlook: </p>
<p>"We still think the" central bank "will not embark on an
aggressive hiking cycle unless it has to. That said, we continue
to think that a measured tightening pace that shows a 25 basis
point hike every three months, to coincide with the inflation
report, makes sense. A compression in spreads, a benign wage
settlement and a forint rally are all factors that may make us
reconsider our view." </p>
<p>On today''s decision: </p>
<p>"The only real surprise today was the comment that the
decision was near-unanimous'' according to the governor, whereas
we expected a fairly close vote. Simor was vocal in arguing that
the bank thinks it is important to cap expectations, and was
very critical of recent media reports suggesting that the
government wants to raise the inflation target. Simor argued
that these are exactly the sort of news that would affect
expectations." </p>
<p>On inflation: </p>
<p>Inflation "has more of a hump,'' as we expected, largely
connected to the recent crisis taxes. With this forecast, it is
clear why a central bank whose inflation-targeting track record
is not impeccable would want to hike rates to keep CPI
expectations in check." </p>

<p>General Motors Co., the maker of the
Chevrolet Volt gasoline-electric car, will hire 1,000 engineers
in Michigan to help expand the automakers'' lineup of electric-
drive vehicles. </p>
<p>The hiring will increase GM''s workforce of electric-vehicle
engineers to about 3,000, Rob Peterson, a company spokesman,
said today at an event to mark the start of production of the
$41,000 car. Detroit-based GM plans to sell 10,000 Volts next
year and 45,000 in 2012. </p>
<p>The Volt, begun under former Chief Executive Officer Rick Wagoner, is the centerpiece of GM''s effort to position the
company as innovative and environmentally friendly. Dan Akerson,
who took over as CEO in September, has said he wants GM to be
at the forefront of electric-car development. </p>
<p>GM is going to lead the industry in the adoption of
various vehicle-electrification technologies, Akerson said
today in a statement. We want to give our customers energy
choices other than petroleum and to make the automobile part of
the solution when it comes to the environment. </p>
<p>GM rose 40 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $34.20 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 3.6 percent from their $33 sale price in an initial
public offering earlier this month. </p>
<p>Volt Requests </p>
<p>More than 200,000 people have requested more information
about the Volt, said John Hughes, the car''s marketing manager. </p>
<p>GM could raise output by 25 percent to 50 percent of the
Volt''s 10,000-unit plan for 2011 if demand increases, said Tom Stephens, vice chairman of global product operations. Limited
capacity for batteries and other key components would restrict
GM from increasing much more, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>GM is auctioning off the first for-sale Volt and donating
the proceeds to Detroit''s public schools system. The high bid as
of 5:11 p.m. was $105,000, according to a website GM set up for
the auction. </p>
<p>The Volt can drive for 35 miles solely on electric power
and an additional 340 miles on the gasoline engine, GM said
today in a statement. </p>
<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated the
Volt''s energy use as the equivalent of 93 miles per gallon in
electric-only mode and 60 mpg in gasoline-electric driving, GM
said. In gasoline-only mode, when the battery is drained, the
car would get 37 mpg, GM said. </p>
<p>Chrysler Group LLC is hiring 1,000 engineers and high-tech
workers for its small and midsize vehicles, Mike Palese, a
company spokesman, said today. </p>
<p>About 40 percent of those workers will be contract
employees, he said in an e-mail. The Wall Street Journal
reported Auburn Hills, Michigan-based Chrysler''s hirings earlier
today. </p>

<p>A prospective customer enters a high-end jewelry store and
sinks into a leather couch. A sales rep hands her a glass of Champagne and an iPad
packed with images of jewels for her to choose from to make a custom piece. She flips
through them and, with the help of a wireless connection, flicks her creation onto an
iVIP, a small table fitted with a touch screen. There, she rotates or enlarges the image.
As soon as she sends it to the iVIP, it also automatically emerges on a V-Cube, a
triangular display device mounted at eye level next to the table. From the luxury of the
couch, she watches the V-Cube rotate 3D images of her creation. Using the iPad or
iVIP, she tries it on, using an avatar instead of waiting for the real piece to be crafted. </p>
<p>It sounds complex, but this is Zhongjie Sunny Jiang''s vision of the jewelry store of the
future. It''s a model that has intrigued Chinese jewelers looking to cut retail-space costs
and online jewelry outlets seeking to distinguish themselves. The former head of
consumer operations and search quality for Google China, Jiang founded his
information technology company, Waltz, in Wuxi, China, in 2009 to sell luxury retailers
technology to display and sell their wares better. Today, Waltz designs software and
hardware (including the iVIP and V-Cube), renders 3D animation of products, and
customizes and installs its display gadgets for clients. Mainland and Hong Kong
jewelers, such as Yuehao Jewelry, TTF Jewelry, and Chow Tai Fuk, use iVIP and V-
Cubes, and Celinni in France, ZS Diamonds in the U.K., and Dimend SCAASI in the
U.S. use Waltz for their websites'' 3D animation. </p>
<p>Jiang says the 47-employee company had $38,000 in revenue in 2009, is on track for
$1.5 million this year, and could hit $15 million in 2011, when he aims to double its
workforce. As part of its overseas returnee incentive program, the Wuxi city government
invested $700,000 in Waltz and pays the rent on its 13,000-square-foot office. Up next:
bagging bigger international brands. Jiang says Waltz just secured a deal to provide
the French luxury cell phone company Hanmac in-store display technology in China and
set up a Paris sales office to showcase Waltz''s technology and services. Jiang, 36,
spoke recently with Bloomberg.com contributor Megan Shank about Waltz''s traditional
sales model, introducing new technologies to old industries, and why American
companies fail in China. Edited excerpts of their conversation follow. </p>
<p>Megan Shank: What made you think the Chinese market was ready for 3D images of
consumer products? </p>
<p>Zhongjie Sunny Jiang: After Avatar came out, 3D technology became very popular in
China and around the world. I believe it''s only the beginning. Unlike other industries, the
high-end consumer retail market has not yet taken advantage of technology. At the
same time, shoppers have demonstrated their willingness to buy in a new way. Take the
rise of Bluenile.com in the U.S.: This business model has become popular in China only
during the past two or three years. Now hundreds of such websites are emerging. The
fashion industry is aggressively looking for new ways to use multimedia and information
management systems to sell their products and track their inventories. China is the
second-largest luxury consumer market in the world and the fastest-growing one. My
old Google China colleagues started their own businesses, but as far as I know, I am
the only former Google China employee who started a business in a traditional industry. </p>
<p>Q: Who are your competitors? </p>
<p>A: For V-Cube, we have some competition in Denmark, though their price is 10,000
euros [$13,340] and ours is 38,000 renminbi [$5,700], so it''s a completely different
dynamic. For 3D design, we have competitors in Israel and France. They have better
technology but higher prices. Considering price and quality, we''re still the best choice. In
the domestic market, we don''t yet have a direct competitor. </p>
<p>Q: How have the technologies you''re using and adapting been used traditionally? </p>
<p>A: Multi-touch screen technology has been in existence since the 1990s, but Apple only
recently popularized it. Now Apple holds patents for its multi-point touch screen, but
many companies are out there with similar patents and products as cool as iPad. As
soon as an Apple product is launched in China, a copycat enters the market in
Shenzhen. The technology behind V-Cube is not a secret, though we do hold
intellectual property rights, including a pending patent. Holographic technology has
been extensively used in museums, in large-scale exhibitions, and on television. It has
rarely been applied in the commercial world, however, especially in the retail market.
There are a couple of reasons why. First, there''s been little consideration for how to
create small holographic machines for in-store display. Second, learning how to mass-
produce lifelike images of 3D jewelry and other luxury products at low cost has been a
challenge. [On a consumer level,] it''s not meaningful to display only a few images, as
the museums do. </p>
<p>Q: How have you met this challenge? What''s your process? </p>
<p>A: For example, we''ll have clients take three pictures of a diamond ring from different
angles, so our technicians can see details. The 3D design team has a three-step
process. First they use 3D modeling software to create the image. Then they render it
according to the shape and color. Finally, they animate the image in a way that
highlights the details. So it might turn, zoom in or out, or pause on a certain component.
My technicians are highly skilled art school graduates. The reason we''re more efficient
and cost-effective than other market players is that we are extremely specialized. We
cut this three-step process down into smaller steps. And as with car manufacturers,
each of my technicians focuses on only one of those divided steps within a process, so
we can affordably process hundreds of models in a day. </p>
<p>Q: What is your sales model? </p>
<p>A: For the domestic market, we are using agents who are resourceful and strong at
sales. Most American companies fail in China because they don''t use agents. For
example, Dell is famous for its direct sales business model, but two years after the
company entered the Chinese market, it had to change its strategy because it couldn''t
reach local customers without agents. Now its model is similar to Lenovo''s -- using a
whole network of agents. Baidu became the No. 1 search engine in China simply
because it relied on agents rather than its own sales and marketing team. These agents
are powerful either geographically or within an industry. Many times, they have strong
connections with the local government, which is difficult for newcomers to manage. </p>
<p>Q: How will you deal with possible IP infringement? </p>
<p>A: This is China. As long as you have cool stuff, people will copy it. If they don''t, it
means you have a poor product. You have to think ahead. We have our first generation
V-Cube, but we''re already at work on our second and third generation, which we''ll
launch as soon as the future competition shows up. We don''t want to engage in price
wars. We want to attract clients because of our advanced innovations. </p>
<p>Q: You''ve received a lot of support from the Wuxi city government. What influence does
it have on you? </p>
<p>A: They''re playing the role of angel, but they''re not intending to be a portion of my
company forever. They promised me I can purchase their portion of the stock back
within two years at a low interest rate. It''s a good partnership, and it''s good for them,
because we provide jobs and pay taxes. </p>
<p>Q: You''ve said you want to be the Apple of China. What do you mean? </p>
<p>A: Apple is good at generating cool stories, designs, and ideas. Apple is successful
because of its marketing and advertising capabilities. That''s what I admire and hope to
emulate with Waltz. I''d also like to create a diversity of Waltz products, as Apple has
done with MacBook, iPod, iTunes, iPad. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. will give its
investment bankers iPads to provide an additional mobile tool as
Apple Inc. expands its domain to Wall Street, threatening
Research in Motion Ltd. in a market it traditionally dominated. </p>
<p>We believe there are real benefits in our working
environment that can be realized using this device - as well as
the personal productivity and enjoyment that come as part of the
package, two managing directors at New York-based JPMorgan
said in an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>Apple is building on its momentum in the tablet business,
leveraging its 95 percent market share to expand from its
traditional consumer base into the corporate market as RIM
readies a rival device, the BlackBerry PlayBook. The Canadian
maker of smartphones is trying to catch up with Apple as banks
including Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG unveil
applications for the iPad and Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America
Corp. consider letting employees use iPhones instead of Wall
Street''s 11-year-old device of choice, the BlackBerry. </p>
<p>Apple represents a clear and present danger for RIM going
forward, said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher  Co.
For the first time you have a viable alternative to secure
mobile communications and by and large we see people moving away
from the BlackBerry platform in droves in favor of the iPhone
and the iPad. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent said multiple international accords, not a
single treaty, are needed to fight climate change. </p>
<p>I don''t think one treaty can work for the world, Kent,
58, said in an interview in Cancun, Mexico, where delegates from
more than 190 countries are gathered for United Nations-led
talks on setting rules to limit global warming. </p>
<p>The world''s largest soft-drink maker is among companies in
the Mexican resort lobbying envoys on the shape of an eventual
accord that may restrict emissions from burning fossil fuels,
channel up to $100 billion to poor nations and protect forests. </p>
<p>A year ago in Copenhagen, delegates failed to draft a
treaty, leaving in limbo the 1997 Kyoto accord that mandated
cuts in carbon-dioxide emissions until the end of 2012. While
envoys aim to replace that agreement with new commitments, UN
officials say a treaty is unlikely to be drafted this year. </p>
<p>Comments by India''s environment minister and Kent add
strength to suggestions from climate envoys that working for a
single binding treaty may not be the best way forward for the
negotiations set to end Dec. 10. </p>
<p>An international agreement is not anywhere on the
horizon, Jairam Ramesh said today in New Delhi. Action has to
be domestic. That''s what the last 15 months has shown. </p>
<p>Rich, Poor Divide </p>
<p>Since the Copenhagen round of talks concluded with a non-
binding agreement, negotiators have been unable to bridge the
divide between richer nations bound by the Kyoto treaty and
poorer countries led by China and India that reject similar
rules for their industrializing economies. Indian and Chinese
leaders say their priorities are economic growth and ending
poverty. </p>
<p>We''ve been at it for 18 years on climate change but
that''s not unique, said Duncan Hollis, an associate professor
at Temple University''s Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia and
editor of the Oxford Guide to Treaties to be published next
year. Breaking this up into smaller pieces and trying to knock
off one piece at a time is certainly worth trying. </p>
<p>Momentum is building instead for extending national and
regional plans to limit greenhouse gases, from domestic carbon
markets to renewable-energy standards, in which utilities are
forced to include a fixed percentage of clean energy in the mix
they sell to consumers. </p>
<p>Indian Viewpoint </p>
<p>The UN talks in their second day today in Mexico are moving
away from a global treaty, Ramesh said. Meetings instead should
focus on domestic actions, the minister said, adding that
India won''t accept limits on growth set by other nations. </p>
<p>While executives from 400 companies including Tesco Plc and
Unilever NV released a statement saying they''d work to end
deforestation and use of refrigerants that harm the atmosphere,
the Coca-Cola executive went further, delving into the politics
of treaty-making. </p>
<p>There can''t be just one framework, Kent said, adding
that you can''t judge India''s progress with the same metrics as
U.S. progress. </p>
<p>The UN framework needs to become more flexible and
allow countries to have different timelines for moving ahead
with efforts to curb fossil-fuel emissions, Kent said. </p>
<p>Government Incentives </p>
<p>While companies can accomplish much on their own to reduce
emissions and protect the environment, only governments can set
a price on carbon and provide the incentives needed to spur
shifts in energy use, he said. </p>
<p>President Barack Obama failed to win passage in Congress
this year of legislation to cap carbon emissions linked to
global warming. Prospects for action will grow slimmer next year
when Republicans take control of the House of Representatives
and expand their minority in the Senate. Dozens of Republican
lawmakers elected this month have expressed skepticism about
global warming or action to curb it. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said he is incredibly impressed by the
opportunities in South Africa and the rest of the continent. </p>
<p>The growth rate of banking in emerging markets is set to
be two to three times faster than that of the United States and
Western Europe where most of our investment banking is currently
focused, he said in a statement today after visiting South
Africa with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, an adviser
to the New York-based bank. </p>
<p>The lender is seeking to expand in emerging markets
overseas as greater regulation of businesses like derivatives
squeezes revenue in the U.S. The lender generates about 25
percent of revenue outside the U.S. and about 62 percent of net
profit. Citigroup Inc. has also announced plans to grow in
Africa, while Barclays Plc owns a stake in Absa Group Ltd.,
South Africa''s third-largest bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has hired bankers from rivals like Morgan Stanley
and sent employees from Geneva and London to Johannesburg and
Cape Town to bring the number of employees in the country to
about 450. The bank ranks tenth in arranging stock offerings in
the region, and 14th on mergers and acquisitions, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Growth in South Africa is set to outpace that in the U.S.
in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund''s World
Economic Outlook, published in October. Sub-Saharan African
economies may expand by 5.5 percent next year, compared with
2.3 percent growth in the U.S., according to the IMF. </p>
<p>The lender, which has slipped down the rankings for equity
offerings, is committed to growing its businesses in Africa,
according to John Coulter, chief executive officer of JPMorgan''s
Johannesburg-based sub-Saharan Africa unit. Coulter, 49, who
left the company in 2005, returned last year and said in an
interview on Nov. 10 he wants JPMorgan to be in a top-tier
position in any business it pursues. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley moved closer to
selling its stake in China International Capital Corp., ending a
15-year relationship with the first Sino-foreign investment bank
and freeing the Wall Street firm up to find a new local partner. </p>
<p>The China Securities Regulatory Commission said in a
statement on its website that it approved CICC''s application for
a shareholding change involving a more than 5 percent stake. The
official China Securities Journal said the change very
likely involved Morgan Stanley''s proposed sale of its 34.3
percent holding in CICC. </p>
<p>We wouldn''t deny the media report saying this approval is
related to Morgan Stanley, said Yang Guang, a spokesman for
Beijing-based CICC, in an interview. Morgan Stanley spokesman
Nick Footitt declined to comment. </p>
<p>KKR  Co. and TPG Inc. are in final talks to buy Morgan
Stanley''s stake in CICC for more than $1 billion, people with
knowledge of the matter said in February. Morgan Stanley
Chairman John Mack said the same month that the firm is selling
its Chinese venture because the country''s government won''t allow
it to take majority control. </p>
<p>Feilo Acoustics Co., which owns a 24 percent stake in China
Fortune Securities Co., said today in a statement it approved
plans by the Chinese brokerage to set up a venture with Morgan
Stanley. Fortune Securities will invest 680 million yuan ($96
million) to take a two-thirds stake in the venture, according to
the release. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG
are among foreign investment banks that have underwriting
ventures in China, the world''s biggest market for initial public
offerings. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc got regulatory
approval for a venture with Guolian Securities Co., according to
a CSRC statement dated Nov. 9. </p>

<p>The sale will end Morgan Stanley''s 15-year involvement in
CICC, the first Sino-foreign investment bank and the top-ranked

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
rebounded from the financial crisis to post record profit last
year, was a regular borrower from two emergency Federal Reserve
programs in 2008 and early 2009, new data show. </p>
<p>The firm borrowed from the Fed''s Term Securities Lending
Facility most weeks from March 2008 through April 2009, data
released by the Fed today show. Two units of the New York-based
firm borrowed as much as $24.2 billion from the Fed''s Primary
Dealer Credit Facility in the weeks after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.''s bankruptcy in September 2008, the data show. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, was quoted by
Vanity Fair last year as saying the company might have survived
the credit crisis without government help. The firm''s president,Gary Cohn, was more definitive, according to the magazine: I

rescue of Bear Stearns Cos. At the time, spokesman Michael DuVally said his firm was testing the facility and would use
it if doing so makes sense from an economic and funding
diversification point of view. </p>
<p>The firm didn''t borrow any more from the PDCF until Sept.
15, the day that Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in
U.S. history. On that day Goldman Sachs borrowed $2.5 billion at
a 2.25 percent interest rate and furnished the Fed with $2.68
billion of collateral. The firm doubled the amount it borrowed
to $5 billion on Sept. 19 and doubled it again to $10 billion on
Sept. 22, when Goldman Sachs''s London subsidiary also took its
first PDCF loan of $250 million. </p>
<p>Peak Borrowing </p>
<p>At the peak, Goldman Sachs borrowed $24.2 billion on Oct.
15, which included $18 billion for the firm''s U.S. broker-dealer
and $6.2 billion for the firm''s London division, the data show.
The peak borrowing came two days after the U.S. Treasury
Department assembled executives from nine of the country''s
biggest financial firms and told them they''d be provided with
capital injections from the government, with Goldman Sachs
receiving $10 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. </p>
<p>In its quarterly filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, Goldman Sachs didn''t disclose that it
borrowed from the PDCF. </p>
<p>The firm also borrowed from the Term Securities Lending
Facility, which offered longer-term funding than the PDCF''s
overnight loans. On March 28, 2008, Goldman Sachs borrowed $7
billion from the Fed''s TSLF in exchange for $8.42 billion of
collateral that included $3.5 billion in agency-backed mortgage
debt and $4.9 billion of non-agency backed mortgage debt. Before
the loan was scheduled to mature on April 25, Goldman Sachs
borrowed an additional $4 billion on April 11 and $223 million
on April 18. </p>
<p>Largest Loans </p>
<p>The two largest TSLF loans to Goldman Sachs were $7.5
billion on Dec. 4, 2008, and the same amount on Dec. 31, 2008,
the data show. The firm also didn''t disclose its TSLF borrowing
in its quarterly SEC filings, although it provided data on its
borrowing to the U.S. Treasury. </p>
<p>When the loans from the PDCF and the TLSF are combined, the
firm''s total borrowing from the Fed peaked at $35.39 billion on
Oct. 21 and Oct. 22, 2008, the data show. </p>
<p>DuVally, the spokesman in New York, declined to discuss the
borrowing and the firm''s decision not to disclose it, beyond a
statement responding to today''s release of Fed data. </p>
<p>In late 2008, many of the U.S. funding markets were
clearly broken, he said. The Federal Reserve took essential
steps to fix these markets and its actions were very
successful. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs didn''t borrow as much as some of its rivals,
while it borrowed more than others. Morgan Stanley, which was
the second-biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs
before the two firms converted into banks in September 2008,
borrowed as much as $100.5 billion at its peak on Sept. 29,
2008, the data show. That includes $61.3 billion of loans from
the PDCF and $39.2 billion from the TSLF, the data show. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase </p>
<p>The borrowing occurred during a time of immense financial
turmoil throughout the banking sector and the broader market,
Morgan Stanley said in a statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, borrowed $3 billion from the Primary Dealer Credit
Facility on Sept. 15 and as much as $5 billion from the TSLF on
Oct. 17, the data show. </p>
<p>We did not need the liquidity or funding on the day of
Lehman''s bankruptcy, said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan
spokeswoman. As Lehman''s collapse triggered broader financial
turmoil, we had been encouraged by our regulators to use their
facilities when it was helpful to the marketplace and to remove
any stigma, she said. </p>
<p>Even as JPMorgan borrowed less from those two programs than
Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, it was borrowing from a
different Fed program that neither Goldman Sachs nor Morgan
Stanley tapped. JPMorgan Chase and its Chase Bank USA subsidiary
borrowed from the Term Asset Facility, which was established in
December 2007 to provide term loans to depositary institutions. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has previously said that it borrowed from the
Fed''s discount window without disclosing how much. Data on
discount window borrowing isn''t public. </p>

<p>JPMorgan wants U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath in
Wilmington, Delaware, to rule that investors got preferred stock
in WaMu in exchange for the debt-like, trust-preferred
securities when WaMu''s bank was seized by regulators. The Office

bank kept control of the securities, according to court records. </p>
<p>Walrath said she will rule on whether that exchange
actually took place when she decides to approve or reject

<p>The judge today questioned one of the arguments of hedge
funds claiming to own $1.1 billion of the securities. The funds
said they still own the debt-like investments because WaMu
didn''t create, register and deliver the stock they were supposed
to get in exchange for the trust-preferred securities. </p>
<p>That makes no sense, Walrath told attorney Robert J.
Stark, who is representing hedge fund managers including Black
Horse Capital LP and Lonestar Partners LP. </p>

<p>Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the most profitable Wall Street firm, increased their
forecasts for U.S. and global growth in 2011, predicted an
acceleration in 2012 and recommended investors buy banks. </p>
<p>The U.S. economy will grow at a 2.7 percent rate next year,
up from a previous forecast of 2 percent, and 3.6 percent in
2012, economists led by Jan Hatzius in New York said in a report
today. The global economy will grow 4.6 percent in 2011 and 4.8
percent in 2012, Dominic Wilson, senior global economist, said
in a separate report. </p>
<p>They recommended U.S. bank stocks, junk bonds, commodities,
Japanese stocks and China''s currency as the first of the firm''s
top trades for 2011. The forecasts are a departure from the
pessimism that characterized Goldman Sachs'' projections since
2006. </p>
<p>This outlook represents a fundamental shift in the
thinking that has governed our forecast for at least the last
five years, Hatzius said in the report. The hand-off from
policy stimulus to private demand -- which seemed elusive just a
couple of months ago -- now appears to be developing. </p>
<p>U.S. stocks started what is historically their best month
with a rally today after ADP Employer Services data showed
companies added 93,000 jobs last month, the Federal Reserve said
the economy gained strength across most of the nation and
manufacturing in China expanded at the fastest pace in seven
months. The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index advanced as much as 2.3
percent, the most since Sept. 1. </p>
<p>Underlying Demand </p>
<p>The Goldman Sachs economists said underlying demand, a
measure of growth that excludes the effects of fiscal stimulus
and inventory restocking, has strengthened and is on track to
expand at a 5 percent rate in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>On average, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the
U.S. economy to grow 2.5 percent next year and 3.1 percent in
2012. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
lowered its forecast for global growth last month to 4.2 percent
for 2011 from 4.5 percent, and predicted 4.6 percent for 2012. </p>
<p>Even as growth accelerates, U.S. unemployment will remain
elevated by historical standards, declining to 8.5 percent by
the end of 2012 from 9.6 percent in October, the economists
said. The jobless rate increased to 10.1 percent in October
2009, the highest monthly figure since 1983. </p>
<p>Inflation, Unemployment </p>
<p>Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is
likely to be 0.5 percent in each of the next two years, Goldman
Sachs said. The combination of high unemployment and low
inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve from raising
interest rates, the economists said. </p>
<p>Conditions will be positive for risky assets, they
wrote. The SP 500, the main benchmark for American equities,
will likely end next year at 1,450, up 20 percent from 1,206.07
at 4 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>The SP 500 has gained 8.2 percent this year and recouped
three-fifths of its decline from a record in October 2007.
Concerns about the economic fallout from government debt
reduction by some European countries caused rallies to stall in
April and November and are the principal risk to Goldman''s
outlook, the economists said. </p>
<p>Growth in emerging markets may slow next year as
acceleration in the U.S. prompts China, other Asian economies
and Brazil to tighten monetary policy, the economists said. </p>
<p>For its top trades, Goldman recommended betting on a
decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Chinese
renminbi via two-year non-deliverable forwards for an expected
return of 6 percent. </p>
<p>Bets on the KBW Bank Index will return 25 percent, and
selling protection on high-yield corporate bonds via credit-
default swaps will return 8.7 percent, they predicted. </p>
<p>Japan''s Nikkei 225 Stock Average is likely to return 20
percent next year, while a basket of crude oil, copper, cotton,
soybeans and platinum will gain 28 percent, they said. </p>

<p>Oil futures traded in New York will
average $110 a barrel in 2012, up from a forecast of $100 a
barrel next year, according to Goldman, Sachs  Co. analysts led
by David Greely in New York. </p>
<p>Looking toward 2012, the stage is set for a return to a
structural bull market in oil, the analysts said in the report
dated today. The 2012 forecast is based on the better
prospects for continued robust world economic growth. </p>
<p>A 2.4 million-barrel-a-day increase in global oil demand in
2010 will be sustainable at more than 2 million barrels a day in
2011 and 2012 and require OPEC to tap into its spare capacity,
the Goldman analysts said. </p>
<p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had spare
capacity of 5.64 million barrels a day in November, according to
Bloomberg estimates. That compares with 2 million barrels a day
in July 2008, when New York-traded oil futures reached a record
$147.27 a barrel. </p>
<p>Oil for January delivery gained $2.64, or 3.1 percent, to
settle at $86.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the highest closing price since Nov. 11. Crude has averaged
$78.72 a barrel so far this year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley bought a cargo of
North Sea Forties oil from Royal Dutch Shell Plc. </p>
<p>The bank paid 20 cents above the Dated Brent benchmark for
a cargo due to load on Dec. 14 to Dec. 16, according to traders
involved in North Sea transactions. Morgan Stanley bid for
another cargo loading Dec. 19 to Dec. 23 at a 10-cent discount,
while Total SA and Occidental Petroleum Corp.''s Phibro bid for
shipments at minus 35 cents and minus 20 cents, respectively. </p>
<p>The last time Forties traded at a premium was on Oct. 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
a trading window that ends daily at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior
to the window, Forties crude loading from 10 to 21 days in the
future cost 19 cents less than Dated Brent, from 22 cents from
the previous day. </p>
<p>Brent crude for January settlement traded at $87.59 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the
close of the window, up from $86.79 a barrel at the same time
yesterday. The February contract traded at $87.60 a barrel,
narrowing the contango, or price spread, between the two
nearest-term contracts to 1 cent from 7 cents. </p>
<p>The share of North Sea Buzzard crude in the Forties blend
fell to 30 percent last week, from 32 percent in the week to
Nov. 21, BP Plc said on its website, potentially increasing the
value of the benchmark grade of oil. </p>
<p>Sudan Petroleum Corp., the country''s state oil company,
sold 1.2 million barrels of Nile Blend crude for loading in
January to Arcadia Petroleum Ltd. and China National United Oil
Co., or Chinaoil, said two traders who participate in the
market. </p>

<p>Tradeweb LLC, the bond- and
derivatives-trading network partly owned by Wall Street''s
largest banks, created an electronic method to reduce failed
trades in the agency mortgage-bond market two weeks after the
volume of incomplete agreements reached record highs. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. collaborated with Tradeweb on the technology, the New
York-based firm said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>The system will allow brokers'' clients to pair off
trades with different dealers, enabling more efficient
resolution of round-robin fails between dealers, according to
the statement. Tradeweb says it runs the industry''s largest
execution venue for buying and selling in the so-called To Be
Announced market. </p>
<p>Primary dealers'' failure to deliver or receive mortgage
bonds guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae at
agreed-upon times totaled a record $2.37 trillion in the week
ended Nov. 17, compared with a weekly average of $150 billion in
the five years through 2009, Federal Reserve data show. The
tally repeatedly counts failures that linger for multiple days. </p>
<p>The volume of incomplete deals jumped after the U.S.
central bank purchased $1.25 trillion of securities in the $5.3
trillion market in a program designed to bolster the economy and
keep short-term interest rates near zero. </p>
<p>Next Step: Penalties? </p>
<p>In July, an industry group that advises on transactions in
U.S. debt recommended measures to cut incomplete agreements.
Analysts including those at Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG
have said in reports that penalizing sellers who fail to
complete trades may be the next step in reducing them. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. shut down a crude oil
pipeline after a leak was detected near a creek in Salt Lake
City, according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for the
mayor''s office. </p>
<p>Chevron workers reported the spill at 11:23 p.m. local time
yesterday, said Captain Michael Harp of the Salt Lake City Fire
Department. Firefighters were able to contain the fuel before it
reached Red Butte Creek, he said. </p>
<p>This pipeline happens to cross a lot of our watershed
areas, so it literally could affect, if there is a spill, a
million people''s drinking-water supply, Mayor Ralph Becker
said in a telephone interview today. </p>
<p>The San Ramon, California-based company does not anticipate
any impact on Salt Lake City refineries, Justin Higgs, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>At this time, we are uncertain when the pipeline will be
back in service, Higgs said. </p>
<p>It was the second leak in six months on the 10-inch line,
Harrison Smith said. The pipe was shut from June 12 to June 21
and the mayor''s office reported an estimated 800 barrels of
crude leaked. </p>
<p>Sean Comey, another company spokesman, said at the time
that an electrical arc may have caused the June spill. </p>
<p>Tesoro Corp.''s 58,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Salt Lake
City receives a small volume of crude from the common carrier
Chevron pipeline, Mike Marcy, a Tesoro spokesman, said in an e-
mail. </p>
<p>Tesoro doesn''t expect any difficulty supplying customers
and meeting contractual obligations while the line is out of
service, Marcy said. </p>
<p>The cause of the leak is under investigation while the
cleanup continues, Harp said. </p>
<p>Over the last few months we''ve been in the process of
evaluating this line and others in the area, Becker said.
This obviously creates a whole new sense of urgency. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and credit-
ratings companies lost a bid to throw out lawsuits over the sale
of $2.8 billion of mortgage-backed securities to the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania state Judge R. Stanton Wettick Jr. in
Pittsburgh said some claims could proceed against JPMorgan and
ratings companies Moody''s Corp., Fitch Group Inc. and McGraw-
Hill Cos., which owns Standard  Poor''s Financial Services LLC,
according to a Nov. 29 court order. The judge dismissed other
claims against the companies. </p>
<p>We are very pleased with the judge''s ruling and we look
forward to stating our viewpoints as the case goes forward in
court, Neil Cotiaux, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Pittsburgh, said today in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The decision affects four lawsuits filed by Federal Home
Loan Bank over the purchase of mortgage-backed securities,
according to the judge''s ruling. The bank claims it wouldn''t
have bought the bonds if JPMorgan, which sold them, and the
ratings companies had provided complete and accurate
information regarding the risks of nonpayment, the judge said
in his description of the complaint. </p>
<p>The defendants in the cases are the three ratings
companies, JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp.''s Countrywide
Financial unit, according to the decision. </p>
<p>Dana Yealy, general counsel for the Federal Home Loan Bank
of Pittsburgh, said in a phone interview that the bank spent
$2.8 billion for the mortgage-backed securities involved in the
four cases. He declined to comment about their value now. </p>
<p>One of the lawsuits involves $1.7 billion of mortgage-
backed securities bought by the Federal Home Loan Bank from May
2006 to December 2007, the judge wrote. </p>
<p>Predictions'' Protected </p>
<p>We''re pleased that the court has dismissed all but one of
the claims against SP, Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for the
company, said today in an e-mailed statement. In doing so, the
court has reaffirmed the protection afforded to ratings because
they are predictions about future creditworthiness. </p>
<p>The remaining claim against SP is without any factual or
legal merit, Sweeney said. </p>
<p>Wettick said the Federal Home Loan Bank''s fraudulent
misrepresentation claims against the ratings companies could
proceed. The judge dismissed claims against them for negligent
misrepresentation and violations of the Securities Act of 1933,
according to the decision. </p>
<p>Fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims were
dismissed against a group of JPMorgan units except J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. Claims based on the Securities Act of 1933 were
dismissed against some JPMorgan units. They can proceed against
the parent company and J.P. Morgan Securities. </p>
<p>Lawyers for the other ratings companies and JPMorgan didn''t
immediately return calls seeking comment. Bill Halldin, a Bank
of America spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The case is Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh v. J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, GD09-016892, Court of Common Pleas of
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc.''s Wyeth unit
properly warned a Virginia woman''s doctors about the risks of
its Prempro menopause drug, a jury ruled today in rejecting her
claim for damages. </p>
<p>Jurors in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia,
deliberated about four hours over two days before finding that
Georgia Torkie-Tork couldn''t show that Wyeth officials
downplayed the breast-cancer risks associated with Prempro, a
hormone-replacement drug. The decision was Wyeth''s fourth
straight victory in a Prempro suit weighed by a jury. </p>
<p>We believe the verdict in this case affirms that Wyeth
communicated the risks and benefits of Prempro, Chris Loder, a
spokesman for New York-based Pfizer, said in an e-mailed
statement. </p>
<p>More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth''s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women''s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. </p>
<p>Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth''s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer''s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. </p>
<p>Zoe Littlepage, one of Torkie-Tork''s lawyers, didn''t return
calls for comment on the jury verdict. </p>
<p>Litigation Record </p>
<p>Pfizer''s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now won seven of the
14 Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out after trial
or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the verdicts
through settlements, while other decisions are on appeal. </p>
<p>Wyeth also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, according to court filings. Pfizer, the world''s
largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
last year. </p>
<p>Nevada''s Supreme Court last week upheld a $57.6 million
jury award to three women who alleged Prempro caused their
cancers. That award included $35 million in punitive damages the
panel handed down in 2007 over Wyeth officials'' mishandling of
the drug. </p>
<p>Torkie-Tork, 65, took Prempro for at least three years
before being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, her lawyers
contended in court papers. The Reston, Virginia, resident works
at a Starbucks Corp. coffeehouse. </p>
<p>Records Destroyed </p>
<p>Pfizer''s lawyers argued that Torkie-Tork couldn''t prove she
and her doctors received inadequate warnings about Prempro''s
cancer risks because she couldn''t show which of her doctors
prescribed the menopause drug. </p>
<p>Evidence in the case showed that some of her physicians
destroyed their records as part of normal business practices and
couldn''t remember prescribing the drug for the woman. </p>
<p>The case is Torkie-Tork v. Wyeth, 04-cv-945, U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). </p>

<p>It''s rare that a technological innovation creates debate both in the Anthony household and among my colleagues, but Microsoft''s Kinect had done just that. The core issue: did Microsoft over-stretch in its effort to transform the gaming market?</p>

<p>For those who haven''t seen the ubiquitous commercials, Kinect is a new way to interface with Microsoft''s Xbox video game console. Instead of a traditional controller, Kinect uses a range of motion sensing technology to allow motions like arm waves, kicks, and jumps to control the action.</p>

<p>Microsoft hopes the $150 device one-ups Nintendo, which created a new market of gamers with its simple-to-use Wii system and console. Nintendo''s strategy substantially changed the video gaming market and created billions of dollars of profits for the company.</p>

<p>My wife saw a commercial for Kinect, and said, "I assume you''ll want that for Christmas." 
Later that week, a colleague who knows that I''ve written extensively (and, largely positively) about the Wii said, "I assume you are a big fan of the Kinect."</p>

<p>In both cases, the questioner was surprised by my ambivalence. I told them that I absolutely loved what Microsoft was trying to do, and I have little doubt that motion-based interfaces will open up amazing new applications in the coming years. But I''m worried that Kinect isn''t quite ready to pass the Charlie test.</p>

<p>Let me explain.</p>

<p>The Charlie test involves giving a new technology to a child under the age of four, and seeing if they can start using it within a minute. When my son Charlie was two, the gap between him first holding the Wii remote and playing baseball was about three seconds. </p>

<p>Apple''s iPad passed the Charlie test as well; my two-year-old daughter Holly very quickly figured out how to use the device.</p>

<p>But over the weekend Charlie (who is now five) and I wandered over to the Kinect demonstration unit at Selfridges department store on Oxford Street in London to try out bowling. The screen told him to move to the left. Then back. Then left again. Then he had to raise his hand. I had to explain to him how to pick up the ball. I could see his frustration growing. </p>

<p>Now, this was an in-store demonstration unit, and I think the odds remain high that Kinect will be under my tree. But I suspect that Kinect will only be a true breakout hit if it turns out that it can in fact pass the Charlie test.</p>

<p>Perhaps Microsoft could have explored a different commercialization strategy. Maybe it could have positioned the first generation Kinect as something for hard core gamers who don''t mind dealing with quirky interfaces before introducing a more streamlined version for the mass market. The risk in trying to introduce a revolutionary technology in the mass market is that Microsoft could potentially poison the market, limiting Kinect''s long-term potential. </p>

<p>I have little doubt that Microsoft is on to something huge with motion as a transformational way to interact with games, data, and a whole range of other applications. However, I think there might just be enough rough edges around Kinect that it might not live up to the hype.</p>

<p>One Equity Partners LLC, the buyout
arm of JPMorgan Chase  Co., plans to sell U.S. carbon black
manufacturer Columbian Chemicals Co., said two people with
direct knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>India''s Aditya Birla Group is among potential bidders for
the world''s third-largest maker of the material used in tires
and synthetic rubber, said one of the people, declining to be
identified because the matter is confidential. A transaction may
be valued at more than $500 million, the person said. </p>
<p>Columbian Chemicals, based in Marietta, Georgia, may
compete for bidders with the carbon black unit of Germany''s
Evonik Industries AG. Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla''s company
and India''s Phillips Carbon Black Ltd. are considering making
offers for Evonik, the world''s No. 2 maker of carbon black, in a
deal likely to be valued at more than $700 million, two people
familiar with the matter said earlier this week. </p>
<p>Pragnya Ram, a Birla Group spokeswoman in Mumbai, declined
to comment on market speculation. JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Columbian Chemicals is the world''s third-largest maker of
carbon black behind Cabot Corp. and Evonik, according to a
Standard  Poor''s report in October. The closely held company
has a market share of about 9 percent, and the three biggest
companies jointly account for about one-third of worldwide
capacity, the ratings company said. </p>
<p>Columbian Chemicals operates 11 plants in nine countries
including U.S, Canada, Brazil, Germany, Spain, South Korea and
China, according to its website. Carbon black is a material used
to increase durability of tires, paints and plastics. </p>
<p>Four Nations </p>
<p>The Birla Group is the world''s fourth-largest producer of
carbon black with operations spread across four units including
Alexandria Carbon Black Co. in Egypt; Hi Tech Carbon, a division
of Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd. in India; Thai Carbon Black Public Co.
in Thailand and Liaoning Birla Carbon Co. in China, according to
its website. </p>
<p>DC Chemical Co., a South Korean maker of petrochemicals and
solar-power components, and One Equity Partners jointly bought
Columbian Chemicals for about $600 million from Phelps Dodge
Corp. in 2006. One Equity agreed to acquire DC Chemical''s 67
percent stake for about $150 million in January 2009. </p>
<p>One Equity, established in 2001, manages $8 billion of
investments for New York-based JPMorgan in direct private-equity
transactions, according to its website. </p>
<p>Evonik, which has operations in 12 countries, said its
global production capacity will reach more than 1.4 million
metric tons a year by end of 2010, according to a statement in
June. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. is completing the

<p>The San Ramon, California-based company doesn''t anticipate

day Salt Lake City refinery, Mickey Driver said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Today we will be inspecting the leak site with all the
appropriate officials and government agencies, Driver said. </p>
<p>Chevron workers reported the spill at 11:23 p.m. local time
Dec. 1, Captain Michael Harp of the Salt Lake City Fire
Department said yesterday. Firefighters were able to contain the
fuel before it reached Red Butte Creek, he said. </p>
<p>It was the second leak in six months on the 10-inch line,
according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for the mayor''s
office. The pipe was shut from June 12 to June 21 and the
mayor''s office reported an estimated 800 barrels of crude
leaked. </p>
<p>The company doesn''t have a restart date for the pipeline,

<p>Walter Energy Inc., a southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal, agreed to buy Canada''s
Western Coal Corp. for C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) to add
reserves and boost production of the commodity as prices rise. </p>
<p>Walter Energy offered C$11.50 a share in cash or 0.114 of a
Walter Energy share, the companies said today in a joint
statement. The deal, which has unanimous approval from both
boards, follows a Nov. 18 announcement that they were in
exclusive talks. </p>
<p>Mergers and acquisitions in the coal industry are
increasing as demand from steelmakers in China, the biggest
producer of the alloy, drives up prices for the raw material.
Prices for coking, or steelmaking, coal sold to Asia will rise 8
percent next quarter, according to UBS AG. </p>
<p>We do love coking coal, said Ian Henderson, who manages
about $7 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. including Western Coal
shares. We were long-term investors in this particular
project, but we thought the company was too lowly valued. We are
not expecting anybody else to come in and counter bid. </p>
<p>Walter previously agreed to pay C$630 million for a 19.8
percent stake in Western Coal from largest shareholder Audley
European Opportunities Master Fund Ltd., it said Nov. 18. </p>
<p>Shares Rise </p>
<p>Western Coal soared $1.03, or 10 percent to C$11.33 in
Toronto trading. The stock jumped as much as 51 percent on Nov.
18. Walter Energy rose 84 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $106.44 at
9:48 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>
<p>The offer price is a 26 percent premium to the 20-day
average price of Vancouver-based Western Coal through Nov. 17.
That''s in line with the average premium for coal-industry deals
announced this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The offer price is a decent premium to where it was
trading beforehand, JPMorgan''s Henderson said. For
shareholders it''s probably the best that they can get. </p>
<p>Rising coal consumption has prompted Rio Tinto Group, the
world''s third-largest mining company, to team up with Aluminum
Corp. of China on coking-coal projects in China. In the U.S.,
Massey Energy Co., the largest coal producer in Central
Appalachia, has received bids from companies including Alpha
Natural Resources Inc., two people with knowledge of the matter
said last month. </p>
<p>The outlook for coking coal is good, Richard Knights,
an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd., said by telephone from
London. The big picture is all about China''s move to become a
net importer. </p>
<p>Financing Committed </p>
<p>The total amount of cash paid to Western Coal holders is
expected to be about C$2.1 billion, with an estimated 9 million
shares to be issued, according to today''s statement. Financing
for the offer is fully committed, the companies said. </p>
<p>This is a transformative transaction at a time when
global demand for metallurgical coal is surging, Joe Leonard,
interim chief executive officer of Tampa, Florida-based Walter
Energy, said in the statement. Western Coal has an attractive
high-quality metallurgical coal asset base and has embarked on
an organic growth strategy that is expected to increase
production more than 60 percent by fiscal 2013. </p>
<p>Shareholder Audley said other parties, including
steelmakers, were interested in its Western Coal stake. </p>
<p>Walter is the best match because there were a lot of
synergies, geographically, in terms of customers and
management, Julian Treger, managing partner of Audley Capital,
said in an interview. It''s likely the other shareholders will
follow in accepting Walter''s offer in due course. In the absence
of another alternative I don''t see why they wouldn''t approve. </p>
<p>Deal Completion </p>
<p>Walter Energy plans to maintain its listing on the New York
Stock Exchange and will apply to sell shares in Toronto. The
company expects the deal to be completed by the second quarter
of 2011. Morgan Stanley is advising Walter, and RBC Capital
Markets is advising Western Coal. </p>
<p>With its size and financial strength, the combined
business will have future growth opportunities that neither one
of us would have on our own, Keith Calder, president and CEO
of Western Coal, said in the statement. </p>
<p>The combined entity will have total coal reserves of about
385 million tons and be the world''s largest publicly traded
pure-play metallurgical coal producer, according to the
statement. The company expects to produce more than 20 million
tons a year by 2021. </p>
<p>Strategically, this kind of fits, said Jim Rollyson, an
analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. in Houston. I like it.
They now have access into Asia that they didn''t have before. </p>
<p>Rollyson said barring another global economic setback,
prices for metallurgical coal will remain strong and the
combined company will be poised to benefit. </p>
<p>Western Coal will hold a shareholder vote to approve the
transaction, according to the statement. </p>

<p>Oil will advance to $120 a barrel
before the end of 2012 as consumption grows in emerging
economies, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is
responsible for about 40 percent of global supplies, is unlikely
to increase production in the first half of next year unless
prices surge through $100 a barrel, the bank said in a report
today. Futures traded around $87 a barrel in New York today,
near their highest price in two years. </p>
<p>Strong emerging oil demand growth over the next 24 months
is very likely to lift the call on OPEC production to levels
last seen at the peak of the oil price spike in 2008, analysts
led by Lawrence Eagles in New York said. We expect oil
inventories to continue their drawing trend over the first
quarter. </p>
<p>JPMorgan boosted 2011 price forecasts for oil contracts in
New York and London. West Texas Intermediate on the New York
Mercantile Exchange will average $93 a barrel next year, up 3.6
percent from a previous estimate of $89.75, it said. Brent crude
traded in London will average $95 a barrel next year, up from an
earlier assessment of $91.75. </p>
<p>The bank said the North Sea benchmark, used to price two-
thirds of global crude, will average $105 in 2012. It expects
futures to reach $100 a barrel in the first half of 2011. </p>
<p>Brent crude for next month is trading at a 4-cent premium
to the February future, a price situation known as backwardation
that suggests immediate supplies are more in demand than later
deliveries. This is a structure that is likely to remain in
place for much of 2011 and 2012, JPMorgan said. </p>

for Canada''s Western Coal Corp., according to Julian Treger,
managing partner of Audley Capital Advisors LLP. Treger spoke in
a phone interview from London. </p>
<p>There were several interested parties; some were coal,
some were steel producers. They were very close and very keen to
make a bid. They didn''t publicly make a competitive bid. Walter
is the best match because there were a lot of synergies,
geographically in terms of customers and management. </p>
<p>It''s likely the other shareholders will follow in
accepting Walter''s offer in due course. In the absence of
another alternative, I don''t see why they wouldn''t approve. </p>
<p>It will be very accretive to Walter earnings and its
shares will reflect that. And Western shareholders can capture
benefits by owning Walter shares. I expect every Western
shareholder, including us, will opt for the Walter shares
because the shares will be worth about C$12, more than the cash
offer of C$11.50. But Walter offers only about 30 percent of the
transaction as shares and the rest as cash, so we''ll likely end
up with no more than 30 percent of our share. </p>
<p>The timetable for the whole deal to be completed is about
three months. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bernard
Madoff''s primary banker, was sued for $6.4 billion by the
trustee liquidating the imprisoned con man''s former firm. </p>
<p>Irving H. Picard, the lawyer appointed as trustee by a New
York bankruptcy court, said in a statement that he sued JPMorgan
yesterday over claims the bank aided and abetted Madoff''s fraud.
Picard said his suit seeks $1 billion in fees and $5.4 billion
in damages. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was willfully blind to the fraud, even after
learning about numerous red flags surrounding Madoff, David J.
Sheehan,'''' counsel to Picard, said in the statement. JPMC was
at the very center of that fraud, and thoroughly complicit in
it. </p>
<p>Any money recovered from JPMorgan will be returned to
Madoff''s victims on a pro rata basis, said Picard, who has so
far recovered about $1.5 billion for Madoff creditors. </p>
<p>The complaint filed today by the trustee for the Madoff
estate blatantly distorts both the facts and the law in an
attempt to grab headlines, JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank, said in a statement. JPMorgan did not know about or in
any way assist in the fraud orchestrated by Bernard Madoff. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, based in New York, said it has assisted Picard in
his investigation of Madoff''s firm and called his claims
irresponsible and over-reaching. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed under seal in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Manhattan, according to Picard''s statement. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has designated virtually all of their
information as confidential, Picard said. We intend to move
to have the complaint made public as soon as possible. </p>
<p>The suit is the second-biggest filed by Picard in the
Madoff bankruptcy, after a $7.2 billion claim he filed against
investor Jeffry Picower in May 2009. Picower died in October
2009. </p>
<p>The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-ap-4932,

<p>Gundlach''s DoubleLine Trust Faces New Lawsuit by TCW </p>
<p>A trust created by DoubleLine Capital LP''s Jeffrey
Gundlach was sued by TCW Group Inc., which already sued its
former investment chief after he brought more than half of its
fixed-income professionals to his new firm. </p>
<p>DoubleLine Funds Trust was started to market DoubleLine
Capital''s mutual funds and to generate fees and profit for
Gundlach and the money management firm he had formed, TCW said
in a new complaint filed Nov. 1 in state court in Los Angeles.
TCW provided a copy of the complaint to Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>TCW, a Los Angeles-based money management firm, accuses the
trust and its trustees of misappropriation of trade secrets and
unfair competition, among other allegations, and seeks
unspecified damages. </p>
<p>Jeffrey Gundlach and his co-conspirators built a business
based on the wholesale theft of huge amounts of TCW''s
proprietary data and analytical systems, and that business
includes DoubleLine Funds Trust, Steve Madison, a lawyer for
TCW, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. When DoubleLine
Funds was launched last spring, TCW notified the funds and their
trustees of TCW''s intent to name the trust as a defendant. </p>
<p>TCW, a unit of Societe Generale, in January accused
Gundlach and several former employees who joined DoubleLine of
breach of fiduciary duty, unfair competition and
misappropriation of confidential information and demanded more
than $200 million in damages. </p>
<p>TCW has made false claims against DoubleLine for 11
months, Lew Phelps, a spokesman for DoubleLine, said
yesterday. Their case is going not at all well. This latest
legal action by TCW is redundant and meaningless. </p>
<p>The case is Trust Company of the West v. DoubleLine Funds
Trust, BC450413, Los Angeles County Superior Court. </p>
<p>Hypercom Sued Over $485 Million VeriFone Bid </p>
<p>Hypercom Corp., the maker of electronic-payment software
being acquired by VeriFone Systems Inc. for $485 million, was
sued in Delaware Chancery Court by an investor who contends the
shares are undervalued in the deal. </p>
<p>The companies said in a Nov. 17 statement that Hypercom
shareholders will receive 0.23 share of VeriFone stock for each
of their shares, or about $7.32 a share -- a 19 percent premium
at the time. </p>
<p>The offer price reflects an inadequate premium to the
trading price of the company''s common stock given that Hypercom
continues to have record revenue growth, said shareholder Chad
Small in a complaint filed yesterday in Wilmington. </p>
<p>San Jose, California-based VeriFone, with $844.7 million in
revenue for fiscal 2009, said it''s buying Hypercom, based in
Scottsdale, Arizona, to help expand in European markets.
Hypercom reported $406.9 million in 2009 sales. </p>
<p>Small asks a judge to grant the lawsuit class or group
status, on behalf of outside shareholders, and to halt the
transaction as structured, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Hypercom spokesman Pete Schuddekopf didn''t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is Small v. Hypercom, CA6031, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). </p>
<p>Infineon Sued for Damages by Qimonda Administrator (Update1) </p>
<p>Infineon Technologies AG was sued by the insolvency
administrator of Qimonda AG who filed an action in a Munich
court seeking a liability judgment for an unspecified amount. </p>
<p>The suit asserts Infineon made a filing mistake when
transferring its memory business to a shell company that was to
become Qimonda. The administrator, Michael Jaffe, seeks a
judgment that Infineon needs to refund the difference between
Qimonda''s assets and its capital at the time insolvency
proceedings began, Infineon said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. </p>
<p>Infineon regards the action as without merit, the
company said. The contribution of the memory business to
Qimonda was carried out in compliance with all requirements.
Infineon intends to defend itself vigorously against this action
through all stages of the proceedings. </p>
<p>Qimonda filed for insolvency in 2009 after being hurt by
sliding memory-chip prices. Infineon completed an initial public
offering of Qimonda in August 2006 to reduce its dependence on
businesses with volatile demand and prices. Infineon was itself
a unit of Siemens AG, Europe''s largest engineering company,
until an IPO in March 2000. </p>
<p>Munich Regional Court spokesman Tobias Pichlmaier confirmed
the suit was filed yesterday. Sebastian Brunner, a spokesman for
Jaffe didn''t immediately return a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>The case is LG Muenchen, 3 O 22476/10. </p>

<p>Lawsuits/Pretrial </p>
<p>Massey''s Blankenship Must Face Mine Widows'' Lawsuits </p>
<p>Massey Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Don Blankenship
must face two lawsuits holding him personally responsible for a
West Virginia mine explosion that killed 29 people, a judge
ruled. </p>
<p>The widows of William Griffith and Ronald Maynor, who were
killed in the April 5 blast at Massey''s Performance Coal unit,
claim the Richmond, Virginia-based company and Blankenship were
responsible for violations of federal and state safety
regulations that led to the explosion. The CEO was willfully
negligent in his direction of the company subsidiaries
operating the mine, they said in separate complaints. </p>
<p>Blankenship asked to be dismissed from the lawsuits,
contending they failed to state a valid claim. West Virginia
Circuit Court Judge William Thompson denied the motion in a Nov.
24 order. He didn''t rule on the merits of the widows'' claims. </p>
<p>Plaintiff''s complaint provides fair notice to defendant
Blankenship of the plaintiff''s claim made against him, one that
states a valid claim under West Virginia law, Thompson wrote
in his order in the Maynor case. He entered an identical
decision in the Griffith suit. </p>
<p>The explosion at Performance Coal''s Upper Big Branch
operation in Montcoal, West Virginia, the worst U.S. mine
disaster in 40 years, set off federal and state investigations
into its cause. </p>
<p>The lawsuits were filed by Marlene Griffith, the widow of
William Griffith, 54, who had worked at the mine since 1992, and
Helen Maynor, widow of Ronald Maynor, 31, who started there in
2006. </p>
<p>The claims against the Massey CEO are a judicial lynching
of Don Blankenship, his lawyer, Thomas Flaherty, said at an
Oct. 20 hearing on the motion to dismiss the lawsuits. </p>
<p>Flaherty and Jeff Gillenwater, Massey spokesman, didn''t
return calls yesterday for comment. </p>
<p>The cases are Griffith v. Performance Coal Co., 10-C-91,
and Maynor v. Performance Coal Co., 10-C-122, Circuit Court,
Boone County, West Virginia (Madison). </p>
<p>Ensco Asks Judge to Reinstate Claim Over Drilling Ban </p>
<p>Ensco Offshore Co. asked a judge to revive its challenge to
the Obama administration''s deep-water oil drilling rules,
claiming regulators are preventing rigs from returning to work
even after lifting a ban in October. </p>
<p>None of the work that was being done by the 33 rigs
suspended when the initial moratorium was issued has been
allowed to resume, no permits for previously suspended
activities have been issued, and there are no indications that
defendants will unfreeze the permit process in the near
future, Ensco said in a Nov. 30 court filing. </p>
<p>Ensco asked U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman of New
Orleans to reinstate dismissed claims and enjoin the government
from enforcing the drilling moratorium by any means. Ensco
also asked the judge to require regulators to act within 30 days
on all pending applications for permits to drill in waters
deeper than 500 feet. </p>
<p>The Obama administration initially banned deep-water
drilling in May, after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded while
drilling for BP Plc off the Louisiana coast. Interior Secretary
Kenneth Salazar said regulators needed time to study
improvements to drilling safety and spill containment after the
worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. </p>
<p>Ensco lawyer George Fowler didn''t immediately respond to
requests for comment. Kendra Barkoff, Salazar''s spokeswoman,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>The case is Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-01941,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans). </p>

<p>Trials/Appeals </p>
<p>U.S. May Appeal Sugar Beet Crop Destruction Order </p>
<p>The U.S. may appeal a court order requiring the destruction
of sugar beet crops engineered to be resistant to Monsanto
Co.''s herbicide Roundup, according to a court filing. </p>
<p>The U.S. Justice Department said it is seeking the
Solicitor General''s permission to appeal a Dec. 1 order by a San
Francisco federal judge in a lawsuit brought by organic farmers
and a food safety group. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White found
that plaintiffs have made a strong showing that they and the
environment are likely to suffer irreparable harm if this court
does not issue an injunction. He put his order on hold to
allow an appeal to be filed by Dec. 7. </p>
<p>The use of seeds engineered to resist St. Louis-based
Monsanto''s weed killer was deregulated by the Bush
administration''s U.S. Agriculture Department five years ago,
according to court filings. Today more than 90 percent of the
U.S. sugar beet crop comes from the genetically engineered
seeds. </p>
<p>The case is Center for Food Safety v. Schafer, 3:08-
cv-0484, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). </p>
<p>Deutsche Post May Lose Bid to Block Belgian Post Aid </p>
<p>Deutsche Post AG should lose its bid to block 297.5 million
euros ($391 million) in state aid to Belgium''s La Poste SA, an
adviser to the European Union''s top court said. </p>
<p>A ruling in favor of Deutsche Post last year should be
canceled and the challenge be declared inadmissible,
Advocate General Niilo Jaeaeskinen of the EU''s Court of Justice
said in a non-binding opinion yesterday. The Luxembourg-based
court follows such advice in a majority of cases. </p>
<p>Belgium appealed after Deutsche Post, the world''s biggest
transporter of air and sea freight by volume, won a lower-court
ruling to annul EU backing for the aid. The February 2009 ruling
triggered an in-depth review by the European Commission, the 27
nation EU''s antitrust regulator, into all state aid received by
Belgium''s state-controlled postal service. </p>
<p>The case is one of the hurdles La Poste has to clear before
it can proceed with a planned initial public offering. CVC
Capital Partners Ltd., which owns almost 50 percent of La Poste,
in June hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. to
advise on a possible stock sale. </p>
<p>Deutsche Post sued the commission in November 2003 after
the regulator approved the capital injection by the Belgian
government. A ruling by the court usually follows within six
months after an opinion. </p>
<p>Deutsche Post must study the reasoning of the advocate
general before it can comment, Uwe Bensien, a spokesman for the
company, said by telephone. </p>
<p>The case is C-148/09 P, Belgium v Deutsche Post and Others. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>Ex-UBS Municipal-Bond Banker Charged in Bid-Rig Probe </p>
<p>A former co-head of UBS AG''s municipal-derivatives group
was arrested on a fraud charge connected to a nationwide bid-
rigging probe of contracts used by states and local governments
to invest municipal-bond proceeds. </p>
<p>Peter Ghavami, a Belgian national living in Moscow, was
charged with one count of wire fraud in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan after being arrested Dec. 1 at a New York airport.
Ghavami worked at UBS from 1999 until 2007, according to records
filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He ran a
sham auction of a municipal investment contract in exchange for
a $100,000 kickback, according to a federal complaint. </p>
<p>Pernicious fraud schemes like the one alleged in this
complaint undermine the public''s confidence and trust in the
municipal bond and derivatives markets, Christine Varney, the
head of the Justice Department''s antitrust division, said
yesterday in a statement posted on its website. </p>
<p>The conspiracy included more than 200 deals involving state
agencies, local governments and nonprofits across the country,
according to documents filed in federal court. </p>
<p>At his arraignment yesterday, Ghavami didn''t enter a plea
and is being held, according to Alisa Finelli, a Justice
Department spokeswoman. She said he is due back in court Jan. 3. </p>
<p>James Mitchell, a lawyer with Stillman, Friedman 
Shechtman representing Ghavami, didn''t return a call to his
office after regular business hours seeking comment. </p>
<p>Kelly Smith, a UBS spokeswoman in New York, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Perelman Owes Ex-Wife Barkin''s Company $4.3 Million </p>
<p>Billionaire Ronald Perelman must pay $4.3 million to his
ex-wife Ellen Barkin''s Applehead Pictures LLC after reneging on
an agreement to invest in the film production company, a New
York appeals court ruled. </p>
<p>Barkin, an actress who starred in Palindromes (2004)
and The Big Easy (1987), founded New York-based Applehead
Pictures with her brother George Barkin in November 2005. The
decision by the Appellate Division, First Department affirmed a
trial court''s January ruling on the 2007 suit. </p>
<p>Perelman, the chairman of cosmetics maker Revlon Inc.,
agreed to make capital contributions to Applehead Pictures in
2006 and 2007, totaling $3.4 million, according to the decision.
Perelman didn''t approve of Barkin''s acting career, and they
agreed the company would let her continue working in film, the
decision said. The couple married in 2000 and entered into a
separation agreement and divorce in February 2006. </p>
<p>The primary issue presented is whether two separately
executed agreements -- a marital separation agreement and a
business operating agreement -- can be deemed to be one
integrated contract, Justice Eugene Nardelli wrote in the
unanimous opinion. We hold in the negative. </p>
<p>The court rejected Perelman''s argument that Barkin''s
alleged breaches of the separation agreement relieved him of his
obligations in the business agreement. </p>
<p>This is an unfortunate decision, Christine Taylor, a
spokeswoman for Perelman, said in an e-mail. We still maintain
Ms. Barkin should not be entitled to any additional money beyond
the enormous settlement she received five years ago. She said
Perelman had moved on'''' and left it to his attorneys to handle
the still-pending claims against Ms. Barkin and others based
on their misconduct in managing and controlling Applehead
Pictures.'''' </p>
<p>Perelman had countersued in New York state Supreme Court,
alleging Barkin misappropriated Applehead funds to finance
personal expenses. </p>
<p>New York attorney Jacob Buchdahl, who represents Applehead,
said his clients were thrilled'''' with the appeals court
decision. The $4.3 million award includes more than $900,000 in
interest. </p>
<p>The case is Applehead Pictures LLC v. Ronald O. Perelman,
602606/2007, New York Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). </p>
<p>Tyco Ex-CEO Kozlowski Can''t Get Benefits, Court Says </p>
<p>Ex-Tyco International Ltd. Chief Executive Officer L.
Dennis Kozlowski, imprisoned for stealing from the company,
can''t collect tens of millions of dollars in benefits he claims
Tyco owes him, a judge said. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa in New York ruled Nov.
1 that Kozlowski''s 2005 state-court conviction on 22 criminal
counts shows that he was disloyal to Tyco and isn''t entitled to
any pay he claims he earned from September 1995 to June 2002,
when he was forced out. </p>
<p>Kozlowski''s multiple breaches of his fiduciary duty over
several years clearly demonstrate his faithless service,
Griesa wrote. Kozlowski must therefore forfeit all
compensation and benefits, deferred or otherwise, earned during
his period of disloyalty. </p>
<p>The ruling comes in a suit Tyco filed against Kozlowski in
2002. Griesa ruled in favor of several Tyco claims before trial,
while dismissing all of Kozlowski''s counterclaims for pay and
benefits after 1995. </p>
<p>As of October 2008, the value of Kozlowski''s retirement
account was $75.9 million, according to court papers in the
suit. </p>
<p>Kozlowski and former Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz
were convicted in 2005 of securities fraud, grand larceny and
falsifying business records. A jury in New York State Supreme
Court found they stole about $137 million from Tyco through
unauthorized bonuses and the abuse of company loans. </p>
<p>Kozlowski was sentenced to a prison term of eight years and
four months to 25 years. </p>
<p>The case is Tyco v. Kozlowski, 02-cv-07317, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>RBS Cleared by U.K. FSA in Probe of Taxpayer Bailout </p>
<p>The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and former executives,
including ex-Chief Executive Officer Fred Goodwin, were cleared
by U.K. regulators in a report that faulted the bank for a
series of bad decisions before the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The U.K. Financial Services Authority said it won''t take
any enforcement action and has closed the probe into conduct by
RBS executives, the acquisition of ABN Amro Holding NV in 2007
and a 2008 rights offering, the regulator said in a statement
yesterday. The FSA didn''t publish the contents of the review. </p>
<p>The review confirmed that RBS made a series of bad
decisions in the years immediately before the financial
crisis, the FSA said. The review concluded that these bad
decisions were not the result of a lack of integrity by any
individual and we did not identify any instances of fraud or
dishonest activity. </p>
<p>It is unacceptable to suggest that the behavior of the
management in this iconic U.K. bank did not lack integrity''
when they brought RBS to its knees, Rob MacGregor, a national
officer at Unite, said in an e-mailed statement. By failing to
bring any formal charges against the RBS executives they have
allowed some of the biggest villains of the financial crisis to
go on enjoying their millionaire lifestyles. </p>
<p>Michael Strachan, a spokesman for the bank, said it
welcomed the conclusion of the review. </p>
