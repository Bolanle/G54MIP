&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader
Fabrice Tourre&#8217;s request to throw out the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission&#8217;s lawsuit against him was rejected by a
federal judge in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones today dismissed
Tourre&#8217;s motion seeking a judgment in the case. He had argued
that the SEC can&#8217;t sue him over a Goldman Sachs deal involving
collateralized debt obligations because the transaction didn&#8217;t
take place in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same order, Jones said the SEC can file an amended
complaint by Nov. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendant Tourre&#8217;s motion for judgment on the pleadings
is dismissed without prejudice and with leave to renew after
plaintiff has filed its amended complaint,&#8221; Jones wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a call seeking comment. SEC spokesman John Heine declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that U.S. securities
laws don&#8217;t apply to claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S.
securities on foreign exchanges, lawyers for the Goldman
executive director said in a court filing in September. The
collateralized debt obligations, known as Abacus, at issue in
the SEC&#8217;s complaint weren&#8217;t listed on any exchange and the sole
investor in the notes was a foreign bank that bought them
overseas, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones said that, because the SEC sued before the Supreme
Court decision came out in June, the agency can file an amended
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual Inc.&#8217;s settlement
with JPMorgan Chase  Co. and federal regulators is reasonable
because it will end their court battles over the failure of the
biggest U.S. bank, a court-appointed examiner found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyer Joshua R. Hochberg said fighting JPMorgan and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. in court would put at risk
billions of dollars in tax refunds and other assets that could
be used to pay creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing to fight, as shareholders have urged, would be
&#8220;gambling with currently guaranteed recoveries,&#8221; Hochberg
wrote in a report made public today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington, Delaware. &#8220;The ultimate resolution of many of the
claims could take years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaMu, based in Seattle, has designed a reorganization plan
around the settlement, which would bring $7 billion to
creditors. Shareholders would be paid nothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shareholders oppose the settlement, arguing that
lawsuits could bring enough money to pay off all of WaMu&#8217;s debts
and still leave something for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath appointed Hochberg
and asked him to analyze the proposed settlement. Under WaMu&#8217;s
reorganization plan, all of the company&#8217;s remaining assets would
be liquidated and only a reinsurance company would exit
bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WaMu filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 26, 2008, the day after
its banking unit was taken over by regulators and sold to
JPMorgan for $1.9 billion. Before it failed, Washington Mutual
Bank had more than 2,200 branches and $188 billion in deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Washington Mutual Inc., 08-12229, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc., owner of the world&#8217;s
most popular search engine, sued the U.S. Interior Department,
claiming it didn&#8217;t provide a &#8220;full and open&#8221; competition for a
messaging-service contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the complaint filed in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims,
Google and Onix Networking Corp., a licensed Google seller, seek
an order barring the department from proceeding with Microsoft
Corp. software without conducting a fair procurement proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, claims it
didn&#8217;t have the opportunity to compete for the contract. The
Interior Department had been seeking to acquire a single
communications service for the agency&#8217;s 88,000 users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Notwithstanding Google&#8217;s efforts and DOI&#8217;s assurances to
Google representatives that DOI would conduct a full and open
competition for its messaging requirements,&#8221; the bid request
&#8220;specified that only the Microsoft Business Productivity Online
Suite-Federal could be proposed,&#8221; Google wrote in the complaint
filed Oct. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contract is worth $49.3 million over five years,
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Interior Department spokesman didn&#8217;t immediately return
a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating a transaction between JPMorgan Chase
 Co. and the Magnetar Capital hedge fund, ProPublica reported,
citing people familiar with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency is examining whether the hedge fund improperly
chose assets for a $1.1 billion deal backed by subprime
mortgages, ProPublica said. The deal, known as Squared, was
completed in May 2007 and was a collateralized debt
obligation comprised of pieces of other CDOs, ProPublica
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan earned $20 million creating the Squared
transaction, ProPublica said, citing an unidentified person
involved in the deal. The bank kept portions of Squared
on the lender's books and lost about $880 million on the
transaction, ProPublica said, without citing a source.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Capmark Financial Group Inc., the
bankrupt commercial lender, won court permission to use most of
its remaining cash to pay $835 million to lenders, including
affiliates of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment is part of a settlement between the company and
the lenders over a $1.5 billion loan that had been challenged by
lower-ranking creditors. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher Sontchi approved the settlement today in an order issued in
Wilmington, Delaware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Capmark is delighted that this settlement was approved by
the bankruptcy court,&#8221; said Chief Restructuring Officer Mo Meghji. &#8220;I believe this will pave the way for the company to
emerge from bankruptcy in the near future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unsecured creditors opposed the settlement, claiming in
court papers that the company didn&#8217;t fight hard enough to get
better terms from the lenders, in part because Capmark is co-
owned by New York-based Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creditors also had sought permission to sue the
lenders, claiming the loan wasn&#8217;t legitimate. Sontchi denied
that request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capmark, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, has proposed
ending its year-old bankruptcy in part by using almost all of
its cash to repay the disputed loan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the loan already has been repaid, Capmark General
Counsel Tom Fairfield said in an interview last week. The
company planned to use $750 million in cash, plus another $85
million held in escrow to pay off the loan. Under the
settlement, Capmark agreed not sue the lenders over the loan and
the lenders agreed to cut as much as $135 million of the
principal balance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower-ranking creditors wanted to sue over the loan because
they claimed it wrongly swapped unsecured debt for secured debt,
giving the lenders a higher repayment priority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Capmark Financial Group Inc., 09-13684,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi shortlisted Exxon Mobil
Corp., Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Occidental Petroleum Corp. as
potential partners to develop the $10 billion Shah natural-gas
project, two people familiar with the plan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi Gas Development Co., owned by Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co., known also as Adnoc, is pressing ahead with Shah after
the original foreign partner, ConocoPhillips, withdrew from the
project in April. The people declined to be identified by name
because the decision hasn&#8217;t been publicly announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shortlist comes at a time when international companies
have limited opportunities to invest in gas projects in a region
dominated by state-owned counterparts. By winning the Shah
contract, Exxon Mobil, Shell or Occidental would strengthen
their presence in the United Arab Emirates, the third-biggest
oil producer in OPEC and holder of the fourth-largest gas
reserves in the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi, the selection of three
candidate partners marks a step toward the emirate&#8217;s goal of
producing sour, or high-sulfur, gas from Shah as fuel for power
plants facing surging demand for electricity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an extremely vital project to be developed for
Abu Dhabi&#8217;s future that&#8217;s specifically to do with gas demand for
the power sector,&#8221; said Thaddeus Malesa, an analyst in Dubai
with PFC Energy, a consulting firm based in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supply Gap &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. now imports gas from neighboring Qatar, and it
wants to develop nuclear power to help meet local electricity
demand, which is expected to double by 2020, according to
government studies. Construction of the first nuclear plants
won&#8217;t begin until 2017, creating a gap in the supply of fuel for
the emirate&#8217;s power stations that officials hope to fill partly
with gas from Shah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By producing gas locally, Abu Dhabi hopes to save on
imported fuel and avoid the more expensive stop-gap solution of
burning crude in its power stations, as Saudi Arabia does,
Malesa said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shah poses a technical challenge because toxic hydrogen
sulfide must be separated from the raw gas. The sulfur must then
be converted into a solid and transported 250 kilometers (155
miles) to be loaded on ships and exported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell&#8217;s Abu Dhabi country chief, John Barry, declined to
comment yesterday when asked whether the Anglo-Dutch oil company
was on the Shah gas shortlist. Hatem Shaker, an Abu Dhabi-based
vice president of public and government affairs for Irving,
Texas-based Exxon Mobil, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips Withdrew &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Occidental public relations official in Abu Dhabi and
spokesman Richard Kline at the company&#8217;s Los Angeles
headquarters also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi originally chose ConocoPhillips for the project
in July 2008, after considering competing bids from Shell and
Exxon Mobil, among others. ConocoPhillips withdrew after
announcing last October that it planned to divest from some
assets and intensify its focus on exploring for oil and gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell has already studied some of the deposits at Shah and
is the most knowledgeable of the three shortlisted companies
about the geology there, Malesa said. He added that Shell would
probably be Abu Dhabi&#8217;s &#8220;favorite&#8221; as a partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That&#8217;s who they want to work with on Shah,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But I think Shell are worried about what kind of returns
they&#8217;ll get on the project.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bridging Fuel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shell&#8217;s Middle East Vice President for new business Mounir Bouaziz said today in Abu Dhabi that his company had the
necessary technology to produce what he called contaminated gas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Gas is a key bridging fuel for alleviating some of the
power crises we see in the region and in creating a low carbon
energy source for countries here,&#8221; Bouaziz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occidental, Shell and Exxon are all trying to intensify
their gas business in the Gulf, in part because opportunities
elsewhere in the Middle East are scarce. Gas projects in Algeria
have been delayed, Iran is off limits to Western companies due
to economic sanctions, and Iraq is still considered a dangerous
place to operate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occidental owns 24.5 percent of Dolphin Energy Ltd., an Abu
Dhabi state-controlled venture transporting gas from Qatar to
the U.A.E. Exxon Mobil is the largest investor in Qatar&#8217;s plants
that liquefy natural gas for transport by ship. Shell is
developing a $19 billion gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar and has a
venture with state-owned Saudi Aramco to explore for gas in
southern Saudi Arabia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have shortlisted three companies&#8221; for Shah, said
Mohammed Sahoo, chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi Gas
Industries Ltd., another Adnoc unit, speaking in Abu Dhabi
today. &#8220;We are going ahead with the project.&#8221; He declined to
name the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Advance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Occidental shares rose 2.1 percent to $80.29, Exxon gained
0.7 percent to $66.97 and Shell increased 1.35 percent to 23.62
euros by 4.17 p.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shah project, scheduled for completion by the third
quarter of 2014, targets processing 1 billion cubic feet of sour
gas into 540 million cubic feet a day of fuel. It may also
process 4,400 tons a day of natural-gas liquids, 35,000 barrels
a day of condensates and 9,200 tons a day of sulfur. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index may
rise 10 percent by the end of the year if the Federal Reserve
announces plans to buy more bonds to inject money into the
economy, a tactic known as quantitative easing, said Thomas J. Lee, chief U.S. equity strategist at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve already seen some of it in pushing up asset prices
or risky assets,&#8221; Lee, Wall Street&#8217;s most optimistic
strategist, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview today with Tom
Keene. &#8220;QE2 is going to ultimately be very effective. For now,
it&#8217;s very good for equity markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has risen 14 percent since Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke indicated during an Aug. 27 speech in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, that he may be willing to pump more money into the
economy. The Fed, which begins a two-day policy meeting
tomorrow, has been weighing more monetary injections as its
Beige Book business survey released Oct. 20 reported that the
economy grew at a &#8220;modest pace&#8221; in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s Lee said that he favors economically sensitive
industries because businesses are gaining more confidence and
that should help lift corporate earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s sort of an upside-to-GDP bet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We think
there&#8217;s at least a 9 to 10 percent upside until year end.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy grew at a 2 percent annual rate in the
third quarter as consumer spending climbed the most in almost
four years, a sign the expansion is developing staying power. A
separate report last week showed business activity unexpectedly
accelerated in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings have beaten analysts&#8217; per-share estimates at 259
of the 321 companies in the SP 500 that have reported results
since Oct. 7, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg predict an average 28 percent gain in
third-quarter profit from a year earlier for all SP 500
companies, and a 36 percent advance for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee increased his combined earnings-per-share forecast for
SP 500 companies for 2010 and 2011 to $85.50 and $91,
respectively, according to a report dated Oct 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan strategist has the highest SP 500 estimate
for 2010 among 11 Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg,
with a year-end forecast of 1,300. That&#8217;s 9.9 percent higher
than last week&#8217;s closing level, and compares with the average of
1,210. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts lowered
their estimate for the cost to sellers of repurchasing soured
U.S. mortgages to as much as $90 billion from a range that went
as high as $120 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analysts led by John Sim and Ed Reardon removed
some potential losses from their previous forecast to account
for issuers including New Century Financial Corp. and Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. having failed, they wrote. They also
fine-tuned their assumptions for how successful investors may be
in winning fights over loans underlying so-called private-label,
or non-agency, mortgage bonds, which lack government-backed
guarantees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Future losses from repurchases of home loans whose quality
failed to meet sellers&#8217; promises will probably be $40 billion,
the analysts wrote in an Oct. 29 report covering debt
securitized from 2005 through 2007. On Oct. 15, they forecast
likely losses of $55 billion to as much as $120 billion in a
&#8220;stress&#8221; scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The private-label market typically has the burden to
prove, with respect to any given loan, that a breach of a
representation or warranty has materially and adversely impacted
the value of the loan,&#8221; the New York-based analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond analysts at Bank of America Corp., which
along with JPMorgan is among the lenders being targeted by
debtholders, said in a report that remaining repurchase losses
may total $46 billion. That figure assumes investors in private-
label securities seek buybacks on 50 percent of loans that went
delinquent in the first two years and succeed with 50 percent of
those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$25.1 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming the bondholders win 25 percent of requests, those
New York-based analysts, led by Chris Flanagan, wrote in an Oct.
29 report that losses likely will total $25.1 billion. Their
figures also excluded amounts potentially owed by defunct
originators and also included mortgages sold to or guaranteed by
government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest JPMorgan report included an estimate that
mortgage-bond investors will seek so-called putbacks on about 25
percent of defaulted mortgages. Because investors will need to
demonstrate that misstatements about the quality of loans
inflated the debts&#8217; apparent value, the analysts said they
adjusted the odds they used for how successful putback attempts
will be based on how quickly mortgages went bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts assumed that investors&#8217; success rate will be
50 percent for loans that went delinquent in their first 12
months, 40 percent for mortgages whose borrowers stopped paying
between one and two years, and 30 percent for loans with later
delinquencies, according to their report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are also now assuming higher success rates for
mortgages whose borrowers were required to provide full
documentation of their income and assets, because loans made
with less paperwork were &#8220;stated as such,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even if buyers claim that fraud was more rampant for
limited/no doc loans, they will bear the burden of proving that
fraud was committed,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;And even if fraud
could be proved, not all deals included representations with
respect to fraud and not all representations are the same.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy the Australian
dollar against its U.S. counterpart on expectation that the
Federal Reserve will step up Treasury purchases after its Nov.
2-3 meeting, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the dollar&#8217;s decline to resume should the Fed
remove uncertainty and deliver a $500 billion slug of asset
purchases next week,&#8221; Paul Meggyesi, a managing director of
currency strategy at JPMorgan wrote in a research report dated
Oct. 29 and sent to journalists today. &#8220;The domestic case for
further tightening in Australia is largely unanswerable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy the so-called Aussie at 97.77 U.S.
cents and abandon the trade if it weakens to 95.1 cents,
Meggyesi said. No estimate of the Aussie&#8217;s future value against
the dollar was given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also recommended buying the euro, the Swedish
krona and the Korean won against the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar was 0.5 percent stronger at 98.81
U.S. cents as of 12:18 p.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bain Capital LLC, a Boston-based
leveraged-buyout firm, asked banks to finance its bid for
Priory Group Ltd., an operator of mental-health and addiction
clinics whose clients have included Kate Moss and Susan Boyle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bain spoke to banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Morgan Stanley about the deal, which will include a high-yield
bond, according to four people familiar with the matter. Bank of
America Corp. and Priory&#8217;s owner, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc, are also negotiating roles, said three of the people, who
declined to be identified because the talks are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraged-buyout companies announced $51 billion of
acquisitions Europe this year, compared with $15 billion a year
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. LBO debt is
raised in the name of the target company and repaid with its
cash flow, triggering a fall in its credit rating to junk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is improved interest&#8221; in LBO debt, &#8220;albeit more on
a name-by-name basis versus the carte-blanche approach of a few
years back,&#8221; said Jonathan Moore, a high-yield analyst at
Evolution Securities Ltd. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bain is the frontrunner to buy Priory after RBS&#8217;s talks
with other private-equity firms including Cinven Ltd., Advent
International Corp. and Blackstone Group LP failed. Priory
attracted offers of less than 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion),
though Edinburgh-based RBS had been seeking about 1.1 billion
pounds, people familiar with the matter said in September. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ONGC Videsh Ltd., a unit of India&#8217;s
biggest energy exploration company, is studying a proposal from
bankers offering Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s stake in a field in Angola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s too early to comment,&#8221; Managing Director R.S. Butola said in New Delhi today, responding to an Economic Times
report that Oil  Natural Gas Corp. may buy Exxon Mobil&#8217;s 25
percent stake in a deepwater field in Angola for $2 billion. No
decision has been taken on pricing or bidding, he said, without
identifying the bankers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-owned ONGC leads India&#8217;s push to secure energy
supplies overseas for the world&#8217;s third-fastest-growing major
economy. India&#8217;s demand for oil and gas will increase 40 percent
in the next 10 years, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said at a
conference in New Delhi today. In its quest for supplies, India
has lost out to China in at least $12.5 billion of contracts in
the year ended June 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A deal like this will be positive for ONGC,&#8221; said Vinay Nair, a Mumbai-based analyst with Khandwala Securities Ltd.
&#8220;They need to add to their oil and gas resources especially
since they haven&#8217;t been too successful domestically.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC shares rose 1.3 percent to 1,320.90 rupees at 1:59
p.m. in Mumbai trading. The stock has climbed 12 percent this
year compared with a 17 percent advance in the benchmark
Sensitive Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC Videsh is expected to submit a bid soon, the Economic
Times reported, citing two unidentified people with direct
knowledge of the matter. The field may produce 300,000 barrels a
day by 2012, according to the report, which cited the website of
the U.S. Energy Information Administration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Block Partners &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc is the operator of the Block 31 field, and its
partners include Statoil ASA, Total SA and Angola&#8217;s state-run
oil company, Sonangol SA, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In Block 31, some of the companies are leaving, and
Sonangol has the responsibility to find other partners,&#8221;
Angolan Oil Minister Jose Maria Botelho de Vasconcelos told
reporters in New Delhi today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s prime minister said his government is encouraging
national oil companies to invest in foreign oil and gas
projects. &#8220;We seek to build strong economic partnerships with
other countries and their oil and gas industries to the mutual
benefit of each other,&#8221; Singh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sovereign Fund &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation has proposed a sovereign wealth fund
to bid for reserves and has told ONGC and its smaller state-
owned rival Oil India Ltd. to make one major acquisition each
this year. Both companies have a mandate to raise the amount
they can spend without government approval to 50 billion rupees
($1.1 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC is working with Vietnam Oil  Gas Group, also known as
PetroVietnam, for the purchase of BP&#8217;s assets in Vietnam. The
British company&#8217;s stake in projects has been offered to its
Russian oil venture, Moscow-based TNK-BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is in talks for its state explorers to form a
partnership with the winner of development rights to the Trebs
and Titov fields, Russia&#8217;s largest undistributed oil assets, Oil
Secretary S. Sundareshan said in an interview Oct. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ONGC bought Imperial Energy Plc, which has oil fields in
Siberia, for about 1.4 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ResMed Inc. fell the most in more
than 17 months in Australian trading after Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. cut its rating on the stock to &#8220;hold,&#8221; citing a weaker-
than-expected sales outlook for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ResMed, the world&#8217;s second-biggest maker of machines to
overcome night-time breathing disorders, declined 4.1 percent to
A$3.27 as of the 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney, the most since May
11 last year. The benchmark SP/ASX 200 Index rose 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slower industry growth and softer economic conditions have
prevented the Poway, California-based company from achieving the
same sales growth with new products as it had previously, Ian Abbott and Andrea Chong, health-care analysts at Goldman in
Melbourne, wrote in a note today. They cut their rating from
&#8220;buy&#8221; and maintained a 12-month stock-price estimate of A$4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ResMed said Oct. 29 that fiscal first-quarter net income
jumped 35 percent on sales of its S9 Autoset and Elite products
that regulate breathing for people with sleep apnea. While sales
of the devices have &#8220;not yet reached full momentum,&#8221; revenue
growth of 20 percent or more is &#8220;unrealistic in the near
term,&#8221; Abbott and Chong said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s sales growth averaged 21 percent in the five
years ended June 30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Pudong Road  Bridge
Construction Co. jumped by the maximum 10 percent limit on
speculation it will benefit from construction on Walt Disney
Co.&#8217;s theme park in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai Pudong gained 10 percent to 16.36 yuan at 1:06

14.68 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two stocks surged probably because of speculation
that construction on Shanghai Disney park will start soon and
the companies stand to win project contracts,&#8221; Luo Guo, an

&lt;p&gt;Pudong Road said one of its units won two contracts valued
at 1 billion yuan to build roads in Pudong district, according
to an exchange filing on Sept. 29. The Oriental Morning Post
reported on Sept. 30 the contracts are part of Shanghai Disney
park construction projects. Theme park construction starts this
month after the conclusion of the World Expo, the Shanghai
Securities News reported on Oct. 18,   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian software executives plan to
press President Barack Obama to avoid further tightening of U.S.
visa requirements for foreign workers that threatens the growth
of the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nasscom, the group representing Indian software companies
such as Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. and Infosys Technologies
Ltd., will meet with Obama during his India visit this weekend
to lobby against legislation to add additional fees and
penalties to working visas for non-U.S. citizens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s outsourcing industry has swelled 15-fold over the
last ten years as U.S. companies including General Electric Co.
and Citigroup Inc. have used it to cut costs. With U.S.
unemployment near a 26-year high, Obama has doubled the fees for
working visas, costing the industry as much as $250 million
annually. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The visa issue is significant for a very simple reason --
it indicates a mindset of protectionism,&#8221; said T.V. Mohandas Pai, head of human resources development at Bangalore-based
Infosys, India&#8217;s second-biggest software maker. &#8220;You want the
markets to be open. The only way for the world economy to grow
is to keep them open.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pending immigration legislation in the U.S. Congress
includes a bill sponsored by Illinois Senator Dick Durbin and
New Jersey Representative Bill Pascrell, to make it harder for
employers to obtain the skilled worker visas by adding new
requirements, fees and penalties to the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On-site Staff &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India-based companies that win outsourcing contracts need
U.S. visas as some clients ask for on-site staff to work as
coordinators and provide technical support. Apart from the visa
program, the Indian I.T. industry has created 35,000 jobs for
U.S. residents in the last five years, according to Nasscom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are many data points that say Indian I.T. is the
wrong target, but it&#8217;s just a very visible one and a good
whipping boy for job loss and bringing jobs back,&#8221; said Partha Iyengar, head of research at Gartner Inc. in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian government has described the additional visa
costs as &#8220;highly discriminatory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding to the industry&#8217;s concerns, Ohio issued an executive
order banning the use of public funds for outsourced services on
Aug. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must do everything within our power to prevent
outsourcing jobs because it undermines our economic development
objectives, slows our recovery and deprives Ohioans and other
Americans of employment opportunities,&#8221; the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other States &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s some level of concern that that should not
spread,&#8221; said P.R. Chandrasekar, chief executive officer of
Hexaware Technologies Ltd., an Indian software developer backed
by private equity firm General Atlantic LLC. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want
other states to do that, other sectors to do that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE founded a back-office in Gurgaon, India in 1997 to serve
its finance unit. In 2004, it sold 60 percent of the unit, now
called Genpact, for $500 million to General Atlantic and Oak
Hill Capital Partners LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup also owned a back-office unit in India that it
sold to Tata Consultancy in 2008 for $505 million and orders
worth $2.5 billion over 9 1/2 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian technology companies used approximately 4,800 new H-
1B visas in fiscal year 2009, which equals to 0.003 percent of
the U.S. civilian labor force, according to an Aug. 12 report
from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Contracts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry is still winning contracts in North America,
according to Chandrasekar. The company added its first
government contracts in North America, two &#8220;small&#8221; deals with
a state government, in the September quarter, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight of the company&#8217;s 13 new customers added in the
quarter were based in North America, and the share of North
America revenue increased to 67 percent in the quarter, from
64.5 percent a year earlier, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian executives say the U.S. unemployment rate, which
stood at 9.6 percent as of the end of September, makes it
unlikely their views will prevail. Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg last month said U.S. gross domestic product growth
rate will be 2.7 percent in 2010. India&#8217;s government expects the
economy to expand 8.5 percent in the year through March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The rhetoric has been worsening,&#8221; said Pai of Infosys.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a function of the economic environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Jamie Dimon wanted Washington Mutual
Inc. and he wanted it bad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Chase  Co. chief executive officer was
determined to expand on the West Coast, and Seattle-based WaMu,
as it was called, was a prime target. Dimon had a team of
auditors poring over WaMu&#8217;s books in March 2008, at the same
moment the Treasury Department was pressing him to acquire
struggling investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While he initially couldn&#8217;t make a deal for the Seattle
lender, JPMorgan did buy WaMu in September 2008 after it was
seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which meant the
assets came at a bargain price of $1.9 billion, Bloomberg
Markets magazine reports in its December issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2,200 WaMu branches in California, Washington and 12
other states gave JPMorgan&#8217;s consumer bank, Chase, a total of
5,410 branches -- the second-biggest network in the nation. And
it moved Chase to first from third in deposits, with $905
billion after the deal closed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 54, got what he wanted -- and a lot that he didn&#8217;t
want. JPMorgan is now saddled with $74.8 billion in
nonperforming home loans inherited from WaMu, a third of the
$230.7 billion in mortgages on its books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WaMu losses are just one of the afflictions besetting
the man who, in the midst of the recession two years ago, was
dubbed the world&#8217;s most powerful financial executive by the New
York Times and labeled President Barack Obama&#8217;s &#8220;favorite
banker.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King Jamie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York magazine called him &#8220;Good King Jamie,&#8221; while a
biography of Dimon by author Duff McDonald is entitled Last Man
Standing (Simon  Schuster, 2009). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in 2008, Douglas Ciocca, managing director of St.
Louis-based asset manager Renaissance Financial Corp., compared
Dimon with J. Pierpont Morgan himself, who helped rescue the
financial system in the crash of 1907. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s been a voice of reason throughout the industry
pretty much throughout the financial crisis,&#8221; Ciocca said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has gone wrong for Dimon since those halcyon days.
Both the WaMu mortgages and JPMorgan&#8217;s own home-equity loans are
spilling red ink. Dimon&#8217;s commodities-trading team, led by
Blythe Masters, has suffered a big setback. Dimon complains that
hundreds of millions of dollars in profits will be lost to the
Obama administration&#8217;s new financial regulations, which he
fought unsuccessfully to derail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basel Costs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still more potential profits will be lost to the new Basel
rules, which will increase capital requirements for banks
worldwide beginning in 2013. The Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision pushed back the date the capital rules would take
effect because of the fragility of most of the big banks in the
U.S. and Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In consumer banking -- JPMorgan&#8217;s biggest revenue source --
the bank is pushing against a regulation limiting it to 10
percent of national deposits. With more than $2 trillion in
total assets, JPMorgan is now the second-biggest U.S. financial
institution by assets, after Bank of America Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s the biggest U.S. credit card company, with $137.4
billion in outstanding loans, followed by Bank of America and Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest bad news is that the Securities and Exchange
Commission is investigating whether JPMorgan failed to tell
investors that an Evanston, Illinois-based hedge fund called
Magnetar Capital helped select subprime mortgages for a
collateralized debt obligation, or CDO, that the bank created, a
person familiar with the matter said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cooperating Fully&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetar later bet against the security, the person said.
JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said the company, &#8220;like
other firms, has received inquiries from the SEC related to
collateralized debt obligations. We are cooperating fully with
these inquiries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s shares dropped as much as 1.4 percent after the
investigative Web site ProPublica disclosed the probe yesterday,
closing down 21 cents, at $37.42. They fell 46 cents or 1.2
percent more today to a close of $36.96. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has ambitious plans for overseas expansion, yet is
hemmed in by banks with big international franchises, especially
in the so-called BRICs: Brazil, Russia, India and China. Just a
quarter of JPMorgan&#8217;s total revenue comes from outside the U.S.,
compared with more than half for Citigroup, says Anthony Polini,
an analyst at investment bank Raymond James Financial Inc.
International business, however, accounted for 61.6 percent of
JPMorgan&#8217;s net income in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overseas Expansion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon is likely to expand overseas through acquisitions,
Polini says -- the New York banker&#8217;s approach since he linked up
right out of Harvard Business School in 1982 with Sanford Weill
and helped Weill build the financial conglomerate that became
Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Dimon has made only one major acquisition since WaMu.
He&#8217;s been too busy putting out fires. In addition to the WaMu
losses, Dimon has to deal with $113 billion in risky subprime,
home-equity and adjustable-rate loans that JPMorgan originated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the bank halted foreclosures on thousands of
homes when lawyers for homeowners said that JPMorgan, Bank of
America, Ally Financial Inc. and other big banks had been
&#8220;robo-signing&#8221; foreclosure documents without verifying their
accuracy. JPMorgan temporarily stopped foreclosures in the 23
states where they are processed through the courts, later
expanding the number to 41. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the nation&#8217;s biggest mortgage holder,
stopped selling off homes in all 50 states before reversing
course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation Blues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Dimon&#8217;s standing in Washington has declined
since he lobbied against parts of Obama&#8217;s financial regulation
law, which imposes new capital requirements on banks, forbids
proprietary trading and imposes new regulations on the trading
of derivatives, of which JPMorgan is the U.S.&#8217;s biggest dealer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon wasn&#8217;t included in the photo op when the bill was
signed, and he was absent from a May White House state dinner
attended by American Express Co. CEO Kenneth I. Chenault, Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s James Gorman and Bank of America&#8217;s Brian T. Moynihan,
among other Wall Street leaders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a shareholder asked Dimon during JPMorgan&#8217;s annual
meeting in May whether he was still Obama&#8217;s favorite banker, he
replied, &#8220;I heard he has a new one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, a Queens, New York, native, is well-known for his
refusal to mince words. When he dresses down subordinates,
politicians or the media, he uses profanity liberally, according
to people who have heard him. In June, students at Syracuse
University protested when he was invited to give the school&#8217;s
commencement address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lap Dogs and Sycophants &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went ahead with the speech and congratulated them for
speaking their minds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Throughout my life and throughout this crisis, I&#8217;ve seen
many people embarrass themselves by failing to stand up, being
mealy-mouthed and acting like lemmings by simply going along
with the pack,&#8221; he told the graduates. &#8220;Along the way, you&#8217;re
going to face a lot of pressure -- pressure to go along, to get
along, to toe the line. Have the fortitude to do the right
thing, not the easy thing. Don&#8217;t be somebody&#8217;s lap dog or
sycophant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to make Dimon available for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon anticipated that his crown was likely to be knocked
askew. In 2009, he told attendees at a meeting, &#8220;I know exactly
what the headline will say when I make a mistake: &#8216;Dimon Loses
Luster,&#8217;&#8221; according to two people who heard the comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best Big Bank &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Dimon&#8217;s bank is still the brightest star in a dim
firmament. While JPMorgan&#8217;s stock lost 14.4 percent in the three
years through today, investors did far worse buying the shares
of its competitors. Citigroup shares were down 89 percent in the
same three years, while Bank of America&#8217;s return was minus 74.7
percent and Wells Fargo  Co.&#8217;s stock fell 19.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Revenue headwinds such as slow loan growth, slim profit
margins and higher regulatory costs should continue to hammer
bank revenue not only next year but for the decade,&#8221; says Mike Mayo, an analyst at Credit Agricole Securities USA Inc. in New
York. &#8220;We think 2011 will be indicative of a year in a decade
for banks that has the worst revenue growth since the
Depression.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debacle in the housing market is still the biggest
headache for U.S. banks. Payments on some 8 million U.S.
mortgages were delinquent in late September, and almost 7
million of those may end up in foreclosure, says Laurie Goodman,
a senior managing director at Austin, Texas-based Amherst
Securities Group LP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11.5 Million Seizures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those projections exclude the 200,000 additional borrowers
that become delinquent each month for the first time, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, Goodman estimates that 11.5 million homes could
be repossessed by banks during the next five years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profits are also being squeezed by the Federal Reserve&#8217;s
policy of keeping interest rates persistently low, which had
helped boost bank earnings during the worst of the credit
crisis, says Matthew O&#8217;Connor, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in
New York. The Fed&#8217;s near-zero target rate for interbank
overnight lending is compressing banks&#8217; net interest margins,
the difference between what they pay to borrow money and what
they get for loans and securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a massive issue,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor says. &#8220;As you look out
over the next few quarters, it&#8217;s a potentially very dire
situation for the overall industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s results for the third quarter confirmed
O&#8217;Connor&#8217;s pessimism. Margins fell by 31 basis points to 3.01
percent at JPMorgan from March 31 to Sept. 30. (A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.) Combined with lower lending volumes, the
reduced margins translated to a decrease in net interest income
of $1.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue Drops &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While third-quarter profit rose 23 percent from 2009 to
$4.42 billion, the company generated 11 percent less revenue, at
$23.8 billion. The profit included $1.5 billion the bank took
out of its reserves against bad credit card loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are still trying to figure out where revenue is
going to come from when they stop being able to release
reserves,&#8221; says Jason Tyler, a senior vice president at Ariel
Investments LLC in Chicago. &#8220;That&#8217;s not clear yet.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There may be more bad news hidden in JPMorgan&#8217;s books. The
bank set aside $30 billion against bad WaMu loans when it
acquired the thrift in 2008. Dimon predicted that number could
rise by $24 billion if unemployment hit 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unemployment was 9.6 percent in October, yet JPMorgan had
only upped its reserves by an additional $3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;WaMu was a top-to-bottom subprime lender,&#8221; says Paul Miller, a bank analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in
Arlington, Virginia. And its branch network outside California
is not worth much, he says. &#8220;They were very expensive branches,
not well placed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Performing Better&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company told analysts last month that the WaMu mortgage
portfolio could cost $3 billion more if losses continued at
current rates. &#8220;The portfolio is performing better than
expected in this type of environment,&#8221; says Joe Evangelisti, a
JPMorgan spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon says he doesn&#8217;t expect profits to be dented much by
the foreclosure scandal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will cost us some money to go back and make sure it&#8217;s
done right,&#8221; he told analysts on the Oct. 13 earnings
conference call. &#8220;It will delay some foreclosures. But the
whole mortgage issue costs us so much money now, to me it will
be incremental.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that no one had been evicted who shouldn&#8217;t have
been. JPMorgan is the third-largest mortgage servicer in the
U.S., with 13 percent of the market as of June 30, according to
industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50-State Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the same day Dimon made his statement, attorneys general
in all 50 states announced a joint investigation into whether
banks and loan servicers used false documents and signatures to
foreclose on hundreds of thousands of homeowners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, lawyers for defaulting borrowers disclosed
that a mortgage executive at Chase Home Finance in Florida said
in a May 17 deposition that she was among eight managers who
together signed about 18,000 affidavits a month attesting to
facts in foreclosure cases without personally checking loan
records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said on Oct. 13 that it was reviewing the
documents for 115,000 loans. Nancy Bush, an analyst at
Annandale, New Jersey-based NAB Research LLC, says JPMorgan
can&#8217;t rid itself of the foreclosure mess so easily. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dimon was putting a happy face on this issue,&#8221; she says.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll review 115,000 foreclosures now in process. But what
about the rest that have already occurred?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Long-Term Problem&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Battle, vice president of trading at Performance
Trust Capital Partners LLC in Chicago, says the bank&#8217;s
foreclosure flaws are just becoming apparent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That can be a big long-term problem, very expensive,&#8221; he
says. &#8220;The whole can of worms is wide open.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as Dimon swims through a sea of trouble, he can brag
that JPMorgan remains the strongest big bank in the nation. It&#8217;s
the only major bank to have turned a profit in every quarter
since the crisis erupted in late 2007. Per-share earnings have
grown 14-fold since hitting a six-year low of 7 cents in the
fourth quarter of 2008. They were $1.01 in the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank has generated $29.9 billion in net income since
taking over Bears Stearns in March 2008 -- an acquisition that
has been a huge boon to JPMorgan&#8217;s investment banking franchise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns and WaMu, Dimon &#8220;had
the strongest balance sheet in the industry,&#8221; says Robert Willumstad, a former Citigroup chief operating officer who has
known Dimon since they both worked at Baltimore-based Commercial
Credit Co. in the 1980s. &#8220;That&#8217;s the exact position you want to
be in: You want to be the strongest player in the marketplace
when the government turns to you and says: &#8216;We&#8217;ve got a problem.
Can you take it off our hands?&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient Integrator &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s surpassing skill is his ability to hold down costs,
efficiently integrate new acquisitions and minimize risk,
Willumstad says. During his four years as CEO of Chicago-based
Bank One Corp., from 2000 to 2004, Dimon engineered a dramatic
turnaround that took the bank from a $511 million loss in 2000
to a $3.5 billion profit in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bank One merged with JPMorgan in 2004 in a $58 billion
deal, CEO William Harrison named Dimon president and chief
operating officer. Dimon overhauled management, shuttered
lagging businesses and instituted monthly management reviews in
local branches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon was named JPMorgan CEO on Dec. 31, 2005. He largely
avoided investing in the subprime housing loans that crippled
Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch  Co. -- at least until he bought
WaMu. Since 2006, JPMorgan has generated $59.7 billion in profit
at a compounded annual growth rate of 22 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fees Double &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-banking fees, including those from trading and
extending credit lines to clients, were $20 billion during the
first nine months of 2010, up from $9.4 billion for the same
period in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon honed his cost-cutting skills while managing the
serial acquisitions that he and Weill used to build Citigroup.
The two men worked together for 16 years, starting at American
Express. The list of institutions Weill and Dimon then took
control of reads like a history of modern finance: Travelers
Group Inc., Shearson, Smith Barney, Salomon Brothers, Citicorp
and Primerica, to name the largest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the time Dimon was fired from Citigroup in November 1998
by Weill and his co-CEO John Reed, Dimon and Weill had created a
banking, trading and insurance behemoth of unprecedented size
and scope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Fools Invited &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his various jobs under Weill, &#8220;Dimon didn&#8217;t suffer
fools,&#8221; says former Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. CEO Frank Zarb,
now chairman of consulting firm Promontory Financial Group LLC
in Washington. Zarb, 75, met Dimon in 1987 at Commercial Credit,
and they have remained close ever since. &#8220;He was young but
struck me as really smart and he called them like he saw them,&#8221;
Zarb says. Some called the young banker brash, Zarb adds. &#8220;I
call it intellectually honest,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan, Dimon hasn&#8217;t deviated from the management
practices that have brought him this far. JPMorgan&#8217;s acquisition
of Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest U.S. securities firm at the
time, has gone far smoother than that of WaMu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank ended up paying roughly $1.5 billion in stock to
close the deal. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York agreed to
take $30 billion of the struggling investment bank&#8217;s mortgage-
backed securities, collateralized debt obligations and other
illiquid assets. JPMorgan assumed the first $1 billion in
losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan got billions of dollars in new investment-banking
revenue and a prime-brokerage business serving hedge-fund
clients out of the deal. The acquisition boosted 2008 second-
quarter profits by $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faltering Economy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank carried the bank&#8217;s earnings
through 2008 and 2009. Fees and trading revenue began to falter
in 2010 due to the persistently weak economy and high
unemployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s commodities division, run by Masters, was rocked in
the second quarter by an undisclosed loss in its coal
investments, when trader Chan Bhima took a position in the fuel
just before prices plunged. Masters sought to reassure her team
in an internal conference call on July 22, after what she called
&#8220;extremely difficult&#8221; dismissals, defections and a 2010 first
half in which some results were as much as 20 percent below
expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t panic,&#8221; Masters said in the 35-minute call, a
recording of which was obtained by Bloomberg News. &#8220;No one&#8217;s
going to get screwed. We&#8217;re not going to do crazy things on
compensation at the end of the year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities Firings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company let go about 10 percent of the commodities
front-office staff in the third quarter. JPMorgan also shuttered
its commodities proprietary trading desk, affecting roughly 20
traders, most of them in London. They had to reapply for jobs
elsewhere in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it cut the desk to comply with the Dodd-
Frank law, which limits banks&#8217; ability to trade for their own
account. Other proprietary traders are being moved to JPMorgan&#8217;s
asset management division, where they will trade for clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon doesn&#8217;t want to hear excuses for his executives&#8217;
failures. He has a sign in his office in big bold type that
reads &#8220;No Whiners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a looking-forward mentality: Don&#8217;t whine about it;
just get it done,&#8221; says Ron Seiffert, whom Dimon hired from
Huntington Bancshares Inc. to run Bank One&#8217;s small-business
lending in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seiffert is now vice president of Ohio Dominican
University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doubling Down &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seiffert says Dimon displayed his philosophy when United
Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2002,
after being weakened by the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Bank One was
one of the airline&#8217;s biggest creditors. Instead of scaling back
his exposure, Dimon decided to extend even more credit to the
airline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a risky bet that eventually paid off, Seiffert says.
&#8220;He said: &#8216;We made this decision. If we made the wrong
decision, I&#8217;ll go home, I&#8217;ll have a couple of martinis, I&#8217;ll
wake up the next day and we&#8217;ll come back,&#8217;&#8221; Seiffert says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon doesn&#8217;t always play the role of F-word-slinging tough
guy. Executives, including junior managers, whose work catches
his attention might get invited to sip wine in his office after
markets close on Friday afternoon, current and former employees
say. It&#8217;s a tradition begun under Weill, when Dimon was his
chief of staff at American Express. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Executive Shakeups &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has been both the victim and author of executive
suite shakeups. After Harrison left the bank in 2006, Dimon
replaced many of his top staff with former colleagues from Bank
One and Citigroup. The most recent executive shuffle took place
in September 2009, when Bill Winters, now 48, a co-CEO of
JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank, was fired and Dimon named James
&#8220;Jes&#8221; Staley CEO of the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steven Black, the other investment bank co-CEO, was moved
up to vice chairman; he has no operational departments reporting
to him, people familiar with the matter say. Black and Winters
declined to comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley, 53, joined JPMorgan in 1979. He started out in
investment banking on the Brazil desk, later running JPMorgan&#8217;s
equity and capital markets group as well as its asset management
division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon&#8217;s brain trust -- the people he gathers around him in
times of crisis -- are a mix of new and old bankers, people
familiar with his decision making say. Dimon said in March that
he planned to rotate senior executives with an eye toward
picking a successor. He&#8217;s been grooming a handful of long-time
loyalists for the spot for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain Trust &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among them, besides Staley, are Heidi Miller, who was
promoted in June to head of international operations after
having started as Dimon&#8217;s assistant at Travelers Group in 1992;
Charlie Scharf, head of retail services, who first worked with
Dimon at Commercial Credit; Mike Cavanagh, head of treasury and
security services, who was hired by Dimon at Salomon Smith
Barney in 1993 and then again at Bank One in 2000; and Jay Mandelbaum, whom Dimon hired away from consulting firm McKinsey
 Co. in the mid-1990s and who now runs JPMorgan&#8217;s strategy and
business development division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon has also grown close to Stephen Cutler, the
enforcement chief of the Securities and Exchange Commission
under President George W. Bush who joined JPMorgan as general
counsel in 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the inner circle&#8217;s challenges is to deal with the
raft of financial regulations passed by the Obama administration
in July. Dimon told investors on Sept. 14 that the bank will
lose about $750 million in profits just as a result of new
restrictions on the fees and interest it can charge on credit
cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives Hit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No bank has more to lose with the new financial service
rules than JPMorgan,&#8221; says Joshua Rosner, a bank analyst at
independent research firm Graham Fisher  Co. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is especially vulnerable because it&#8217;s the U.S.&#8217;s
biggest creator and trader of derivatives, securities whose
value is derived from the price of stocks, bonds or commodities,
Rosner says. The notional value of the bank&#8217;s outstanding
derivatives contracts -- that is, the value of the securities
underlying them -- was $75.6 trillion as of June 30, according
to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan team led by Masters was among the first sellers
of the most controversial form of derivative, the credit-default
swap, which provides insurance against a security&#8217;s default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1 Billion Lost &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act requires banks to move derivatives
trading to separately capitalized subsidiaries, which Dimon is
in the process of doing at what he says is a cost of $1 billion
in lost revenue. Standard derivatives must be traded on
exchanges, rather than over the counter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an operational nightmare,&#8221; Dimon said on a July
conference call with analysts, of the bill&#8217;s restrictions on
derivatives trading. &#8220;In my opinion, it&#8217;s highly ill-conceived,
doesn&#8217;t reduce risk at all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon says he is looking for ways to pass on all of the
extra regulatory costs to consumers and corporate clients. Fewer
borrowers will get loans and credit cards, he says. He estimates
that the passing on of costs will reduce the bank&#8217;s retail
customer base by about 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are going to earn it all back, whatever the number
is,&#8221; Dimon told investors at a Sept. 14 conference hosted by
Barclays Capital in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank hopes to replace some of its lost profits by
expanding overseas, particularly in the booming BRIC countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwing BRICs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These emerging markets, primarily in Latin America and Asia, offer much better economic prospects than the U.S. or
Western Europe,&#8221; Raymond James&#8217;s Polini says. &#8220;JPMorgan is
ramping up to go head-to-head with Citigroup.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Miller says JPMorgan needs to expand internationally
because that&#8217;s where its corporate customers are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Multinationals operate in sometimes more countries than
we do,&#8221; Miller said at the time she took her new job. &#8220;We
increasingly see our clients look to us to provide services and
solutions throughout the world. We want to make sure we can do
it for them seamlessly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment bank head Staley laid out ambitious plans in
February to double the bank&#8217;s market share in Asia in the next
few years. U.S. banks, however, could have a difficult time
widening their footprint there, Peter Sands, CEO of London-based
Standard Chartered Plc, told Bloomberg News in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Blockade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered gets 90 percent of its revenue from
Asia, Africa and the Middle East, and he says both international
banks like his and local competitors could block new foreign
intrusions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The best of the competition probably comes from the best
of the local banks in most of our markets rather than from the
international class,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One sector where JPMorgan already has global stature is
commodities. Under Masters, JPMorgan has acquired a half dozen
international concerns, including UBS AG&#8217;s global agriculture
and Canadian commodities divisions in 2009. Buying Bear Stearns
gave the bank a business trading natural gas, coal and weather
contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the company completed a $1.7 billion deal to buy
parts of commodities trader RBS Sempra, a joint venture between
Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and Sempra Energy. And in March
2008, the bank made itself a big player in European carbon
trading when it bought Oxford, England-based ClimateCare, which
sponsors projects that help reduce carbon emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities Leader &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we have pulled off over the last three years is
unbelievable,&#8221; Masters said during the July internal call. &#8220;We
now, post-merger and post-all the other work we&#8217;ve done over the
last few years, have a phenomenal physical capability that&#8217;s
global, that involves storage, transportation across the
world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, like his counterparts at other banks, is waiting
impatiently for the housing crisis to ease so the bank can rid
itself of its huge portfolio of bad loans. In addition to the
WaMu writedowns, the bank faces an avalanche of litigation over
allegedly predatory and fraudulent WaMu mortgages and has set
aside a total of $3.5 billion in reserves to cover the cost of
mounting lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon blames the continuing home-loan losses on house
prices that keep falling, unemployment that remains high and an
economy that&#8217;s recovering at a snail&#8217;s pace. He predicted in
April 2008 that home prices would fall by a maximum of 9 percent
over the rest of that year; they fell by 16.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiking Reserves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the company set aside $34.5 billion in reserves
against potential losses on its mortgage, credit card and auto
loans in 2009, up from $20.4 billion the year before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is just going to take a little bit of time before the
mortgage losses are run off and things normalize,&#8221; Dimon told

the question of whether buying Washington Mutual was that rarest

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy VIX puts because
the benchmark measure of U.S. options prices will probably fall
should today&#8217;s elections and tomorrow&#8217;s Federal Reserve
announcement meet expectations, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chances that Democrats will lose the U.S. House are 95
percent, according to bets placed on Intrade, a Dublin-based
online prediction market. The Fed will probably begin a new
round of unconventional monetary easing by announcing a plan to
buy at least $500 billion of long-term securities, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists Krag &#8220;Buzz&#8221; Gregory and David Park recommended buying December 21 puts on the VIX, or Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index. The gauge fell 1.2
percent to close at 21.57, snapping a six-day streak of
advances, the longest since January 2008. The index measures the
cost of using options as insurance against declines in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, which rose 0.8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Risk metrics in the SP 500 options market are down
dramatically, pointing to a less anxious investor community,&#8221;
the New York-based strategists wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, reported third-quarter profit that topped analyst
estimates after price increases and workforce reductions helped
counter declining sales of the cholesterol pill Lipitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit excluding the costs for its purchase of Wyeth last
year and other items was 54 cents a share, beating the 51 cents
average estimate of 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net
income fell 70 percent to $866 million, or 11 cents a share, on
acquisition charges and costs for an asbestos lawsuit, the New
York-based company said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 39 percent to $16.2 billion after adding
medicines from Wyeth, missing analyst estimates by 2.9 percent.
Lipitor sales declined 11 percent to $2.5 billion as generic
copies were introduced in Canada and Spain. Pfizer is counting
on Wyeth products to offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor
faces competition from cheaper copies in the U.S. next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer &#8220;has made real progress with cost synergies from
the Wyeth deal,&#8221; said Marc Goodman, an analyst with UBS
Securities LLC, in a research note. &#8220;Although top-line numbers
missed the mark, we think investors should like the strong
efforts in cost cutting coupled with increased 2010 earnings-
per-share guidance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., Royal Dutch Shell
Plc and Total SA are seeking to extend contracts for producing
oil in Abu Dhabi, company executives said. Japan agreed to lend
$3 billion to the sheikhdom in anticipation of new contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil and Shell are concession-holders in Abu Dhabi
Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, the onshore unit of state-owned
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. also known as Adco, until 2014. Abu
Dhabi holds more than 90 percent of crude in the United Arab
Emirates, one of the few Middle East nations that allow foreign
companies to explore and produce oil within its borders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are working to extend our concessions, which expire
shortly,&#8221; Mark Nolan, Exxon Mobil&#8217;s vice president of
production in the Middle East and Russia, said today at a
conference in Abu Dhabi. &#8220;We are really looking forward to
negotiating a great future.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi is planning to spend as much as $60 billion over
the next decade to expand its oil and gas industry, including
boosting crude production capacity to 3.5 million barrels a day
from about 2.8 million now. Adnoc, as the parent company is
known, owns 60 percent of Adco with Exxon Mobil, Shell, Total,
BP Plc and Partex Oil  Gas holding the rest. Adco plans to
raise onshore output by 400,000 barrels a day to 1.8 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil wants to use proprietary technology to help
raise output at deposits in the concession area. The company
would prefer to operate the fields alone rather than in the
current partnership, a change that would enable Exxon Mobil to
use its new technologies without having to share them with
commercial rivals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Unique Relationship&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you have a unique relationship, we can openly share
that technology,&#8221; Exxon&#8217;s Nolan said. &#8220;When you&#8217;re in a
competitive environment, it&#8217;s more difficult.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Persian Gulf oil producers are seeking to increase capacity
on expectations that demand will recover from the global
economic slowdown. Saudi Arabia, the largest producer in the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries with a production
capacity of 12 million barrels a day, doesn&#8217;t allow foreign oil
companies in its upstream oil industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been here since 1939,&#8221; John Barry, Shell&#8217;s Abu
Dhabi country chief, said today. &#8220;I sincerely hope we are
involved in Adnoc&#8217;s plans in the future. It is much too early to
be talking about a renewal. It is for Adnoc to express its
desired structure.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total is &#8220;confident&#8221; it will continue to be a partner
with Abu Dhabi in developing the Persian Gulf emirate&#8217;s oil
reserves after its concession expires, Jean Luc Guiziou, Total&#8217;s
vice president for production in the Middle East, said Oct. 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Partnership &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adnoc and government-run Japan Bank for International
Cooperation signed an accord on an 11 billion-dirham ($3
billion) loan, Emirates News Agency reported today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Bank signed a memorandum of understanding with Abu
Dhabi, which &#8220;has the objective to mutually recognize that the
grant of new concessions to Japanese entities and the renewal of
existing concessions involving Japanese entities are significant
objectives of the JBIC mandate,&#8221; the news agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan Oil Development Co., a unit of Japan&#8217;s biggest energy
explorer Inpex Corp., will see its stake in Abu Dhabi&#8217;s Zakum
Development Co. expire later this decade. Zakum Development
plans a $15 billion artificial islands project to boost offshore
production by about 40 percent to 750,000 barrels a day by 2018
from the Upper Zakum oil field. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. aims to
become one of the top five underwriters of high-yield debt
because that&#8217;s more profitable than selling bonds issued by
less-risky borrowers, said a report by CreditSights Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Hendler, the New York-based analyst, wrote the report
after a meeting with Goldman Sachs Chief Financial Officer David Viniar as well as Dane Holmes and Heather Miner from investor
relations. Michael DuVally, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New
York, declined to comment on the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In contrast to investment-grade debt, high-yield debt
underwriting tends to generate wider margins and more attractive
fees,&#8221; Hendler wrote in the note today. &#8220;As such, the company
indicated that it aims to be a top five high-yield debt
underwriter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which makes more money than any bank from
trading, ranks sixth among managers of high-yield debt sales
worldwide, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The last
time Goldman Sachs was in the top five was in 2007, when the
firm ranked third after Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-yield bond sales have reached a record $303 billion so
far this year, which already exceeds any prior year&#8217;s total,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan and Bank of
America Corp., the second-biggest and biggest U.S. banks by
assets respectively, are ranked first and second in managing
global sales of high-yield bonds this year, the data show.
Credit Suisse Group AG, Citigroup and Deutsche Bank AG are the
other banks in the top five this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeover Advice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is focusing its investment-banking efforts on
takeover advice and equity underwriting, Hendler&#8217;s note said.
Goldman Sachs is the top adviser on mergers and acquisitions
announced so far this year as well as on global equity
offerings, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm played down its reliance on revenue from
proprietary trading, or making bets with its own money,
according to Hendler&#8217;s note. Those activities will be prohibited
under the new Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company noted that its business model is not so new
and that during the past three years it had gradually minimized
its proprietary trading operations and illiquid assets,&#8221; the
note said. &#8220;So while proprietary trading could be viewed as a
&#8216;nice-to-have&#8217; functionality, it is not a &#8216;must have&#8217; for its
client-focused businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs said the investment banking and capital
markets industry could be hampered because of slow economic
growth in the largest and most developed markets, and so the
firm&#8217;s plan is to seek growth opportunities in emerging
economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and Korea,
Hendler wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs seeks to rank among the leaders in market
share of these markets across all major categories including
equity, MA, higher-margin debt and other investment-banking
activities,&#8221; Hendler wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The judge presiding over the trial of
Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd.&#8217;s lawsuit against Citigroup
Inc. said he won&#8217;t let jurors consider punitive damages in the
case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said in a hearing after
yesterday&#8217;s testimony that punitive damages aren&#8217;t appropriate
in the case, which he called &#8220;a cat-fight between two rich
companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Punitive damages, in most jurisdictions, involve some
threat to the public,&#8221; Rakoff told lawyers in the hearing.
&#8220;This case doesn&#8217;t have that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the trial, which is set to go to a jury this week, Guy
Hands&#8217;s Terra Firma private-equity firm claims Citigroup banker
David Wormsley misled Hands in a May 2007 auction of EMI Group
Ltd., causing it to overbid for the London-based music company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff, who last week barred Terra Firma from asking jurors
for lost profits damages, said yesterday that he was inclined to
rule against permitting jurors to consider a claim for the
$112.2 million Terra Firma says it was forced to invest in June
to keep EMI from breaching debt covenants. Rakoff said he will
give the question one more look and rule today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hands claimed in testimony during the trial that Wormsley
falsely told him in three telephone calls the weekend before the
Monday, May 21, 2007, auction that Cerberus Capital Management
LP planned to submit a competing bid for EMI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerberus had decided not to bid, leaving Terra Firma
without competition in the auction. Terra Firma claims that if
it had known the truth, it would have sought more information
about EMI&#8217;s business and finances and negotiated a better price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup claims Wormsley said nothing to mislead Hands.
Citigroup said Terra Firma only claimed it was defrauded in 2009
after unsuccessful negotiations to restructure the debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Terra Firma Investments (GP) 2 Ltd. v.
Citigroup, 09-cv-10459, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Seeks $2.3 Billion in SAP Download Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp., in a trial that began yesterday against SAP
AG, wants at least $2.3 billion in damages for what its German
rival acknowledges were a now-defunct unit&#8217;s &#8220;inappropriate&#8221;
downloads of Oracle materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial in federal court in Oakland, California, may
feature testimony by former SAP Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker and Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. Apotheker, who Oracle
says oversaw the TomorrowNow unit&#8217;s conduct, began his new job
yesterday as CEO of another Oracle rival, Hewlett-Packard Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP, the world&#8217;s biggest maker of business-management
software, says its executives were unaware of the downloading at
its TomorrowNow software maintenance unit, which was closed in
2008. Oracle&#8217;s damage estimates are &#8220;grossly exaggerated&#8221; and
the lawsuit is aimed at harassing competitors, SAP&#8217;s lawyers
said in court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole goal here is humiliation,&#8221; said Joshua
Greenbaum, a software industry analyst at Enterprise
Applications Consulting. In saying it might call Apotheker as a
witness, Oracle &#8220;has now extended that to Hewlett-Packard,&#8221;
Greenbaum said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle&#8217;s attorneys said in court filings that TomorrowNow
illegally copied software code needed to support customers
without buying licenses to access it. TomorrowNow made thousands
of duplicates of copyrighted software obtained by illegally
accessing electronic materials from Oracle&#8217;s customer-support
websites, the lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apotheker went to Hewlett-Packard after Mark Hurd resigned
as CEO amid a scandal over a personal relationship with a
company contractor. Ellison, 66, hired Hurd, saying in a letter
to the New York Times that Hewlett-Packard&#8217;s board had made
&#8220;the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple
board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle is seeking damages for lost business, copyright
infringement, disgorgement of SAP&#8217;s profits and payment for
costs SAP avoided by not having to develop its own software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle Corp. v. SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enron&#8217;s Skilling Seeks Retrial; U.S. Asks to Uphold Verdicts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Skilling, the former Enron Corp. chief executive
officer convicted of leading a fraud that destroyed the world&#8217;s
largest energy trader, is seeking a new trial over government
objections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the New Orleans appellate court is
reviewing verdicts yesterday against Skilling after the U.S.
Supreme Court determined in June that prosecutors used an
invalid legal theory to convict him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilling is serving a 24-year sentence in a Colorado
federal prison after he and former Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay
were found guilty of deceiving investors about the company&#8217;s
true financial condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The convictions cannot stand,&#8221; Daniel Petrocelli,
Skilling&#8217;s lead lawyer, said in papers filed in advance of
yesterday&#8217;s hearing in Houston federal court. &#8220;Skilling must be
retried before a jury not exposed to, and not invited to convict
on, an invalid fraud theory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors, who obtained 19 verdicts against Skilling at a
2006 jury trial in Houston federal court, told the appellate
court that jurors likely convicted Skilling under an alternate
legal theory presented during the trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Skilling and his co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy
to manipulate Enron&#8217;s earnings to satisfy Wall Street&#8217;s
expectations,&#8221; Paul Pelletier, Principal Deputy Chief of the
Justice Department&#8217;s criminal fraud section, said in court
papers. &#8220;No rational jury could have failed to find that
Skilling conspired to commit securities fraud.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 5,000 jobs and $1 billion in employee retirement
funds were wiped out when Enron plunged into bankruptcy in
December 2001 after widespread accounting fraud was uncovered.
Investors sued to recover more than $60 billion in market
losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilling and Lay were convicted of using off-balance sheet
entities to hide billions in debt and losses, which prosecutors
claimed allowed Enron to report falsely inflated earnings. Lay
died before he had a chance to appeal, and his conviction was
erased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skilling&#8217;s lawyers have consistently argued that he didn&#8217;t
commit any crimes and relied upon the advice of his accountants
and lawyers, who approved Enron&#8217;s accounting and shareholder
disclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Skilling, 06-20885, U.S. District
Court, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New
Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MGA Wins New Trial, Mattel&#8217;s $100 Million Award Voided &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MGA Entertainment Inc. said it won a new trial on all
issues decided in a 2008 trial that gave Mattel Inc. rights to
most of MGA&#8217;s Bratz dolls products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge David Carter in Santa Ana, California, on Oct. 29
granted MGA&#8217;s request for the new trial, and invalidated the
$100 million damages verdict awarded to Mattel in the case, MGA
said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, a three-member appeals court panel overturned a
December 2008 order that gave Mattel rights to most of MGA&#8217;s
Bratz products. A jury in the case found that the designer who
created the dolls was working at Mattel when he conceived of the
idea and the name and made the initial drawings for the pouty
and multiethnic dolls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco last month
denied Mattel&#8217;s petition for rehearing and review by a larger
panel of judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;MGA is gratified that the prior erroneous rulings and
jury instructions have been corrected,&#8221; the company said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jules Andres, a  spokeswoman for El Segundo, California-
based Mattel, didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment
after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The district court case is Bryant v. Mattel, 04-09049, U.S.
District Court, Central District of California (Riverside). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissel Seeks to Halt Retrial for Murdering Husband &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy Kissel, who claimed she killed her Merrill Lynch 
Co. banker husband in self-defense in 2003, asked a Hong Kong
court to stop her retrial for murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 46-year-old mother of three, who remains in custody
after having been sentenced to life in prison, would be freed
immediately if the application for a permanent stay of
proceedings is successful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Andrew Macrae yesterday ordered the media not to
report on the details of the hearing, which is expected to last
five days. The retrial is scheduled to begin on Jan. 10 if
Kissel&#8217;s lawyers fail to win a halt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s top court in February overturned Kissel&#8217;s 2005
conviction, ruling the judge wrongly allowed hearsay evidence
and prosecutors improperly questioned her during the trial.
Jurors heard in the three-month trial that she drugged her
husband with a milkshake, bludgeoned him to death and hid his
body in a carpet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Kissel moved to Hong Kong from New York in 1998 with
his wife and worked as co-head of Asian special situations for
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Merrill hired him in 2000 to head its
distressed-assets business in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy Kissel testified in her original trial that her
husband was a cocaine addict and that she suffered years of
abusive sex. She admitted to killing him and said it was in
self-defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said that the banker had intended to divorce
his Michigan-born wife after discovering she was having an
affair with an electrical technician in Vermont. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissel&#8217;s lawyers had said a manslaughter charge, which
would carry a sentence of eight to 12 years, was more justified,
before prosecutors indicted her again for murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nancy Ann Kissel and HKSAR, HCCC55/2010, Hong
Kong Court of First Instance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPL May Get U.S. High Court Review of $50 Million Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court signaled it may review a decision
that would require a PPL Corp. unit to pay more than $50 million
to Montana for the use of riverbeds under the company&#8217;s
hydropower facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday sought advice on PPL&#8217;s appeal from
acting U.S. Solicitor General Neal Katyal, the Obama
administration&#8217;s top courtroom lawyer. The high court usually
takes the solicitor general&#8217;s recommendations on pending
petitions for review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PPL Montana is appealing a Montana Supreme Court ruling
that said the state owns the riverbeds and is entitled to demand
rent payments. The company argues that the riverbeds are owned
either by private parties or the federal government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Montana state trial court ordered the company to pay $40
million in past rent, plus an unspecified amount for rent
starting in 2008. PPL Montana earlier this year recorded a
pretax charge of $56 million to cover estimated payments through
the first quarter of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute centers on dams on the upper Missouri, Madison
and Clark Fork rivers. PPL is based in Allentown, Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is PPL Montana v. Montana, 10-218, U.S. Supreme
Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Judge Rejects Move by Goldman&#8217;s Tourre to Toss Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader Fabrice Tourre&#8217;s request to
throw out the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s lawsuit
against him was rejected by a federal judge in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Barbara S. Jones yesterday dismissed
Tourre&#8217;s motion seeking a judgment in the case. He had argued
that the SEC can&#8217;t sue him over a Goldman Sachs deal involving
collateralized debt obligations because the transaction didn&#8217;t
take place in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the same order, Jones said the SEC can file an amended
complaint by Nov. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendant Tourre&#8217;s motion for judgment on the pleadings
is dismissed without prejudice and with leave to renew after
plaintiff has filed its amended complaint,&#8221; Jones wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre, didn&#8217;t return a call
seeking comment. SEC spokesman John Heine declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that U.S. securities
laws don&#8217;t apply to claims of foreign buyers of non-U.S.
securities on foreign exchanges, lawyers for the Goldman
executive director said in a court filing in September. The
collateralized debt obligations, known as Abacus, at issue in
the SEC&#8217;s complaint weren&#8217;t listed on any exchange and the sole
investor in the notes was a foreign bank that bought them
overseas, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones said that, because the SEC sued before the Supreme
Court decision came out in June, the agency can file an amended
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &#8216;Robo-Signer&#8217; Draws Dismissal Motion in Maryland &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Maryland homeowner asked a court to dismiss any Wells
Fargo  Co. foreclosure actions in the state that involve
affidavits given by a bank employee who said she signed
documents without completely checking their accuracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Saidman asked a Montgomery County court to recognize
as a class all defendants in Maryland cases with foreclosure
papers signed by Xee Moua for Wells Fargo. In a March deposition
in a Florida case, Moua said she didn&#8217;t verify all the
information in filings she signed, sometimes processing as many
as 500 in two hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To permit &#8220;foreclosure actions to proceed based upon these
false and fraudulent papers would be to accept dishonest and
bogus behavior in Maryland courts,&#8221; Saidman said in a motion
filed Oct. 29. &#8220;Such a result would be an assault on the rule
of law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saidman raised the defense against members of Shapiro 
Burson LLP, a law firm that she said brings foreclosure actions
on behalf of Wells Fargo and other secured lenders. The law firm
couldn&#8217;t be reached by telephone yesterday after regular
business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, the biggest U.S. home lender, said last week
that it will file supplemental foreclosure affidavits to courts
in about 55,000 proceedings after finding some statements &#8220;did
not strictly adhere to the required procedures.&#8221; The San
Francisco-based bank has said it chose to resubmit the documents
out of &#8220;an abundance of caution&#8221; and that none of &#8220;these
instances led to foreclosures which should not have otherwise
occurred.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Maryland case is Burson v. Saidman, 323096V, Circuit
Court, Montgomery County (Rockville); the Ohio case is Piwinski
v. Wells Fargo Bank, 2010-CV-1373, Fairfield County Court of
Common Pleas (Lancaster). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohmad, Principals Settle SEC&#8217;s Madoff-Related Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohmad Securities Corp. and three of its principals have
settled a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit over
what the firm told and didn&#8217;t tell investors whom they referred
to Bernard L. Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm, Chairman Maurice J. Cohn, daughter and Chief
Operating Officer Marcia B. Cohn and Vice President Robert M. Jaffe agreed to an order barring them from violating securities
laws governing material misrepresentations and omissions,
resolving a case filed in June 2009. The agreement requires the
approval of U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said New York-based Cohmad -- which shared offices
with Madoff&#8217;s firm -- and the individual defendants fed investor
funds to Madoff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theirs is the only firm to face U.S. regulator claims that
it solicited money for him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Cohns have decided that resolving this matter with
the SEC and avoiding lengthy litigation is in the best interest
of their family,&#8221; defense attorney Steven Paradise said in an
e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They neither admitted nor denied the claims, Paradise and
the SEC said separately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cohmad defendants &#8220;referred hundreds of investors and
billions of dollars to Madoff, according to a revised complaint
filed by the SEC yesterday at the U.S. courthouse in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year federal prison term after
pleading guilty to running the biggest Ponzi scheme in history
through his Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Cohmad
Securities Corp., 09-cv-5680, U.S. District Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Renews Wiretap Objections in Insider Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galleon Group hedge-fund firm co-founder Raj Rajaratnam
renewed his objections to the use of government wiretaps in his
insider-trading prosecution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a brief filed in Manhattan federal court yesterday,
Rajaratnam called papers filed by the prosecution on the subject
last week &#8216;&#8216;a model of misdirection.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam claims the judge who authorized the wiretaps,
U.S. District Judge Gerald Lynch, wouldn&#8217;t have done so if he
had been told that investigators had been gathering evidence for
a year before asking for a wiretap warrant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The wiretaps are a key part of the evidence against
Rajaratnam, 53, who&#8217;s accused of using tips from company
executives, hedge-fund employees and others in a multimillion-
dollar insider-trading scheme. He&#8217;s the central figure in an
investigation in which 21 were charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-cr-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Aide Bongiorno, Husband Fight U.S. to Keep Homes, Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Bernard Madoff aide Annette Bongiorno and her
husband asked a federal judge to halt the U.S. government from
seizing homes in Florida and New York and more than $2 million
in cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bongiorno, who worked for Madoff for 40 years, and her
husband Rudy, a former electrician with the New York City
Department of Transportation, filed papers yesterday in
Manhattan federal court contesting the government&#8217;s seizure
attempt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;This is simply procedurally the first step to challenge
the government&#8217;s forfeiture action,&#8221; Roland Riopelle, a lawyer
for the couple, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their court filing, the couple asserts ownership to cash
held in several bank accounts, homes in Boca Raton, Florida, and
Manhasset, New York, two Mercedes Benzes, and a Bentley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government lawyers sued in June seeking to seize assets
allegedly tied to Madoff&#8217;s fraud. She hasn&#8217;t been criminally
charged in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annette Bongiorno knowingly aided Madoff&#8217;s fraud by
communicating with clients, answering questions about their
investments and overseeing the preparation of phony account
statements, trade confirmations and other records, prosecutors
said in a complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year federal prison term in
North Carolina after pleading guilty to running the biggest
Ponzi scheme in history from his firm, Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. $304,041.01 on Deposit at Citibank
N.A., 10-cv-04858, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lions Gate Deal to Boost Rachesky&#8217;s Stake Is Upheld &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.&#8217;s deal to increase the
number of shares held by board member Mark Rachesky, a move
challenged by hostile suitor Carl Icahn, was upheld by a
Canadian court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn&#8217;s petition to undo the deal was dismissed, the
British Columbia Supreme Court said in a ruling yesterday
provided by Lions Gate&#8217;s attorneys. Icahn, who is attempting to
buy the independent film and TV studio for $7.50 a share, argued
management conspired with large shareholders to thwart his bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn, 74, was seeking to reverse an equity-for-debt swap
that hindered his hostile bid for the studio by putting more
shares in the hands of Rachesky, who has backed management in
the takeover fight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In my view, the Icahn Group complains of conduct which
affects it not as a shareholder but as a bitter bidder,&#8221; Judge
John Savage wrote in the 70-page judgment. &#8220;I have found that
the Lions Gate Board did not act in a manner that was oppressive
or unfairly prejudicial to the petitioners&#8217; interests.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Wins U.K. Appeal Over Russian Securities Investments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the third-biggest U.S. bank, won a
London lawsuit brought by a private banking client seeking
hundreds of millions of dollars over investments in Russian
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal in London rejected a suit filed by the
Polemis family, one of Greece&#8217;s oldest shipping clans. A lower
court was right to dismiss allegations of professional
impropriety made against the bank, the three-judge panel ruled
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Polemis family had sued the bank for more than $700
million over claims JPMorgan steered them into &#8220;poor quality&#8221;
corporate bonds and notes linked to Russian government
securities. They claim they lost about half their portfolio in
August 1998, when Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on its
debts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reynolds Porter Chamberlain, the London law firm that
represented the Polemis family business that filed the lawsuit,
declined to immediately comment. JPMorgan&#8217;s law firm, Clifford
Chance, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is JPMorgan Chase  Co. v. Springwell Navigation
Corp., A3/2009/0702, Court of Appeal, Civil Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is the subject
of an investigation to determine if it failed to tell investors
in a financial product linked to subprime mortgages that hedge
fund Magnetar Capital helped select the underlying assets before
betting against them, a person familiar with the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is probing
whether JPMorgan allowed Magnetar to choose assets for a $1.1
billion collateralized debt obligation known as Squared,
according to the person, who declined to be identified because
the investigation isn&#8217;t public. JPMorgan lost about $880 million
on the deal, according to ProPublica, which reported the
investigation yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry is part of a broader investigation of how Wall
Street firms bundled and sold mortgage-linked investments as the
housing market declined in 2007, contributing to more than $1.8
trillion in losses and writedowns worldwide. Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. agreed to pay $550 million in July to resolve SEC claims it
misled investors by failing to disclose hedge fund Paulson 
Co.&#8217;s role in selecting underlying assets for a subprime-linked
investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We, like other firms, have received inquiries from the
SEC related to collateralized obligations,&#8221; JPMorgan
spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau said. &#8220;We are cooperating fully with
these inquiries.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC has made similar inquiries at firms including
Morgan Stanley and Bank of America Corp., according to company
filings. SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Magnetar did not select the assets for the Squared
transaction or require that any specific assets be put into the
transaction,&#8221; spokesman Steven Lipin said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. Vice Chairman
Steven Black will leave the firm in early 2011, about a year
into a three-year commitment announced in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon told employees in an e-
mail today that Black, whom he&#8217;s known for 30 years, informed
him of the departure, according to a copy obtained by Bloomberg
News. Dimon told employees Jan. 28 that Black agreed to keep
working with global clients for at least three years, according
to an internal memo at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He is one of the finest and most capable executives I
have ever met,&#8221; Dimon said in today&#8217;s message. &#8220;He has always
impressed me with his tremendous dedication to the firm, his
candor and his strong character.&#8221; Dealbreaker.com reported the
memo earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon replaced Black and Bill Winters, who jointly ran the
investment bank since 2004, with Jes Staley last year. Winters,
49, was fired, and Black, 58, was named the unit&#8217;s executive
chairman. Black lost all of his operational duties in January
when he was promoted to vice chairman of the entire bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The transition to Jes Staley as CEO of the investment
bank has gone smoothly and quickly, and Steve has said that he&#8217;s
ready to move on to a new role serving clients across the
firm,&#8221; Dimon said in the Jan. 28 memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black met Dimon, 54, in the mid 1980s when Black was at
Smith Barney, before the brokerage firm merged with Salomon
Brothers and later became part of Citigroup Inc. He was not
immediately available for comment. Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan, confirmed the contents of the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staley, 53, joined JPMorgan in 1979. He started in
investment banking on the Brazil desk, later running JPMorgan&#8217;s
equity and capital markets group as well as its asset management
division. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. boosted its forecast
for the Kinect motion-control device for the Xbox gaming system
to 5 million units this quarter, predicting the most successful
Xbox product debut by sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on pre-sales, retail orders and consumer interest,
the company expects to exceed a previous forecast of 3 million
units, Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft&#8217;s Interactive
Entertainment Business, said in an interview today. The device,
which lets players control games with motion and voice, goes on
sale tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Sony Corp., with its Move controller, are
competing against Nintendo Co., whose Wii machine set the
standard for motion-controlled gaming. Microsoft, based in
Redmond, Washington, is using Kinect to attract a larger slice
of the market for casual gamers, while extending the life of its
Xbox 360 console, which went on sale in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony has been selling Move since mid-September. Michael Pachter, a video-game analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. in Los
Angeles, predicted Sony will sell about 3 million units by the
end of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft dropped 36 cents to $27.03 at 4 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have fallen 11
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leave it to tiny Singapore to tell
us where the global economy is heading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used to look to the gargantuan U.S. economy for guidance
on financial trends. After Wall Street&#8217;s collapse, we turned to
the Group of 20 nations. More insight might be gleaned looking
at an island nation with 5 million people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that a place with no natural resources and a
state-capitalism model is a global bellwether will strike many
as absurd. Yet Singapore Exchange Ltd.&#8217;s attempted takeover of
Australia&#8217;s stock exchange shows how Asia&#8217;s money is changing
the face of finance and geopolitics as we know it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Exchange&#8217;s A$8.1 billion ($7.9 billion) bid for
ASX Ltd. might not go through amid an outcry from Australian
lawmakers. It almost doesn&#8217;t matter. The point is that fast-
growing and cash-rich Asia is about to go shopping in ways that
might shock the biggest developed economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This transaction is full of chutzpah. Singapore&#8217;s stock
market is half the size of Australia&#8217;s and the deal looks
expensive. The real issue is ambition. Singapore is clearly
prepared to spend big to get economies of scale that don&#8217;t come
naturally. Expect more of this dynamic in Asia -- even from
smaller countries that get little attention globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How will the West respond when China, Japan and India go on
a mergers-and-acquisitions tear? And those are just Asia&#8217;s three
biggest economies. Executives from Seattle to London should also
expect more phone calls from acquisitive companies in South
Korea, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong and sovereign wealth fund
managers everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Wave &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China has been scooping up energy assets around the globe,
and has $2.6 trillion of reserves to accelerate the campaign. It
seeks to leapfrog over the years needed to build domestic
corporate powerhouses. In today&#8217;s world, it&#8217;s easier to buy a
chunk of International Business Machines Corp. than create and
cultivate brands over time. As the yuan rises, tech leaders like
Nokia Oyj or Motorola Inc. become cheaper for mainland
executives. Why censor Google Inc. when you can just own it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next wave of globalization features developing nations
buying the crown jewels of developed ones, and it will be messy.
In 2005, the U.S. Congress freaked out when China&#8217;s CNOOC Ltd.
bid for oil company Unocal Corp. and scuttled the deal. Just
wait until China sets its sights on Boeing Co., Microsoft Corp.
or Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Envy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This last name has long been coveted in Asia. Government
officials in Tokyo and Seoul crave having globally known, savvy
and profitable financial leaders. That tends to be code for
having their own Goldman. Now, Asia could just buy the real
thing. Well, try to at least. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s hard to believe developed-market lawmakers would let
many household names fall easily into Asian hands. Creative
attempts would be made to explain why Pacific Investment
Management Co. being acquired by foreigners poses a national-
security threat. Or why Apple Inc. or cable news network CNN
must remain American concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind how these arguments might run afoul of World
Trade Organization rules. The next few years will see a
disorienting flurry of takeover bids from Brasilia to Beijing,
putting politicians in unprecedented positions. Nationalistic
tendencies will collide with globalization as never before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore helped prove the point that Asia has money at a
time when others don&#8217;t. Its investment firms in recent years
took stakes in Citigroup Inc., UBS AG, Barclays Plc and others,
shoring up some of capitalism&#8217;s biggest names. Bidding for
Australia&#8217;s ASX is the next logical step and a reminder that
Singapore&#8217;s long game is worth watching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bet on Gambling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take casinos, which are suddenly the rage in conservative
Singapore. The government realized it had to let its hair down
to net more of the tourism dollars flowing elsewhere in Asia.
Welcoming casino-resorts run by Genting Singapore Plc and Las
Vegas Sands Corp. was a gamble that is clearly working. So was
revamping downtown to host Formula One races. Tourist arrivals
are exploding, and other Asian capitals are racing to emulate
Singapore&#8217;s success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore is working to reinvent itself as a biotechnology
hub with reasonably liberal immigration laws to feed its
development. Its transparent financial system has been a magnet
for hedge funds setting up shop in Asia. The ASX bid is
recognition that Singapore can&#8217;t grow much beyond its domestic
market and must look outward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunities Abound &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia wants to avoid Japan&#8217;s arrogant and ill-considered
purchases during the bubble years. Buying Rockefeller Center and
the Pebble Beach golf course didn&#8217;t work out so well for
investors. Officials and executives in Singapore, Beijing, New
Delhi and Seoul must avoid the temptation for such vanity deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opportunities abound, though. Several governments are
sitting on hundreds of billions of reserves and companies are
hoarding cash. Add the desire to grow economies and corporate
balance sheets and you have a clear recipe for expansion -- and
a huge one as Asia floods markets with more equity than ever
amid booming demand for initial public offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shopping spree will shake up the global power balance
like rarely before. Perhaps nowhere is this huge shift more
apparent than in tiny Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand&#8217;s dollar is set to rally
to a two-and-a-half year high versus its U.S. counterpart,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. said, citing technical indicators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kiwi, as the South Pacific island nation&#8217;s currency is
known, broke through an October 2009 high of 76.37 U.S. cents
last week and has stayed above it this week. The &#8220;breakout&#8221;
could lead the New Zealand dollar as high as 79.20, a level last
reached in May 2008, technical analyst Niall O&#8217;Connor wrote in a
note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trending bias is back on track suggesting new highs
on the way,&#8221; New York-based O&#8217;Connor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kiwi rose 0.6 percent to 77.59 U.S. cents at 9:07 a.m.
in New York, from 77.15 U.S. cents yesterday. It earlier reached
77.71 U.S. cents, the highest level since June 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next key resistance level is the 77.60-77.80 level,
where the New Zealand dollar could &#8220;pause,&#8221; O&#8217;Connor wrote.
Drops will be supported at 76.30-76.35 and at 75.55 U.S. cents.
Resistance is a level where sell orders may be clustered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The currency has added 7.3 percent so far this year for the
fifth strongest performance against the dollar among the 16
major currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benchmark interest rates are 3 percent in New Zealand,
compared with as low as zero in the U.S. and Japan, attracting
investors to the South Pacific nation&#8217;s higher-yielding assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is expected by economists to announce
another round of large-scale asset purchases today, a measure
that analysts say may debase the U.S. dollar. Policy makers
completed $1.7 trillion of debt purchases in March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s patent-infringement
claims targeting Motorola Inc.&#8217;s Android smartphones will be
investigated by the U.S. International Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade agency in Washington, which has the power to
block U.S. imports of products that violate patents, made the
announcement on its website yesterday. Microsoft, which is
overhauling its mobile-phone operating system, filed the
complaint last month, as well as a civil suit in federal court
in Seattle seeking unspecified cash compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute is part of the fight for a share of the growing
smartphone market, including cases filed by Oracle Corp. against
Google Inc. and Apple Inc. against HTC Corp. and Nokia Oyj.
Apple filed an ITC complaint against Motorola on Oct. 29, and,
like Microsoft, is seeking to block imports of phones made by
Schaumburg, Illinois-based Motorola. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, claims Motorola is
infringing nine patents, including ones for monitoring memory in
flash-memory devices, a way to update contact databases, and a
program interface for mobile phones. The complaint seeks to bar
imports of the Motorola Droid 2, Droid X, i1, Cliq XT, Devour,
Backflip, Charm and Cliq, along with associated software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, which wasn&#8217;t named in the lawsuit, said last month
it would &#8220;stand behind&#8221; its Android system and the partners
who helped with its development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s share in the global mobile-phone market fell to
5 percent in the second quarter, from 9.3 percent a year
earlier, according to market-research firm Gartner Inc. Android
climbed to 17 percent from 1.8 percent, while the iPhone rose to
14 percent from 13 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC case is In the Matter of Certain Mobile Devices,
Associated Software and Components Thereof, 337-744, U.S.
International Trade Commission (Washington). The federal case is
Microsoft Corp. v. Motorola Inc., 10cv1577, U.S. District Court,
Western District of Washington (Seattle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Beers Infringement Suit Against Adwar Casting Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York-based jewelry casting company won the dismissal
of a patent-infringement lawsuit brought by diamond producer De
Beers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Beers sued Adwar Casting Co. and three other defendants
for infringing design patents for its Everlon Love Knot
Collection. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Kansas City
Missouri, on Aug. 25, alleged that &#8220;love knot&#8221; jewelry
castings made by Adwar infringed the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adwar and Dinaro Creations LLC, also of New York, were both
dismissed from the case, according to a Nov. 1 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jewelry caster said in an e-mailed statement that it
had been selling &#8220;love knot&#8221; castings for 30 years, and has
the right to continue to manufacture and sell the line. Gregg
Adwar, Adwar Casting&#8217;s president, said that even though the suit
pertained to &#8220;only a small handful&#8221; of his company&#8217;s products,
&#8220;we are please the De Beers decided to dismiss this case so
quickly, after we provided evidence of our long-standing
production of the pieces.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is De Beers UK Ltd. v. Adwar Casting Co, 4:10-cv-
00843-GAF, U.S. District Court, Western District of Missouri
(Kansas City). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Challenges $1.67 Billion Patent Loss to JJ Over Humira &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories urged a U.S. appeals court to throw out
a $1.67 billion patent-infringement verdict, the largest in U.S.
history, set after a jury found the company used Johnson 
Johnson&#8217;s technology to develop the rheumatoid arthritis drug
Humira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott is focusing its appeal on the validity of its patent
7,070,775, co-issued to New York University and JJ&#8217;s Centocor
unit. Humira, Abbott&#8217;s biggest drug, includes human antibodies
that aren&#8217;t covered by the patent, a lawyer for the Abbott Park,
Illinois-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was Abbott who invented the first fully human
antibody&#8221; used to treat arthritis, William Lee of WilmerHale in
Boston told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington yesterday. Abbott also contends that even if the
verdict is upheld, the damage award is excessive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal jury in Marshall, Texas, in June 2009 said the
company owed $504 million in patent royalties to JJ based on
sales of Abbott&#8217;s Humira arthritis drug, plus $1.17 billion to
compensate JJ for decreased sales of its competing treatments.
The trial judge later added $175.6 million in interest, bringing
the total to $1.84 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humira generated $4.67 billion in sales in the first nine
months of the year, 19 percent of Abbott&#8217;s total revenue, the
company reported Oct. 20. That includes $2 billion in U.S.
sales, a jump of 14 percent from the year-ago period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The damage award was as large as it was because the
infringing product, Humira, is as big as it is,&#8221; Dianne
Elderkin, a Centocor lawyer at Akin Gump in Philadelphia, told
the three-judge panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humira, which costs about $19,000 a year, blocks action of
tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, which is linked to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott said the patent doesn&#8217;t cover the human antibodies
that are used in Humira, and they are invalid because scientists
couldn&#8217;t make fully human antibodies against TNF in a laboratory
in 1994, the date set by the court as the time of the invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, &#8220;no one anywhere on the face of the earth had a
fully human antibody&#8221; that would work against TNF, Lee said.
&#8220;A lot of people tried and they had failed. How can you have a
written description that says you have something that you don&#8217;t
even know exists?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JJ sells the competing medicine Remicade, made with a
combination of mouse and human antibodies. JJ and NYU contend
the patent covers both the combination and fully human
antibodies against TNF. When the body produces too much TNF, it
can cause the immune system to attack healthy tissue and leads
to inflammation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What was invented here was a specific class of
antibodies,&#8221; Elderkin said. Abbott&#8217;s expert witness at trial
made the same arguments as Lee and the jury &#8220;rejected his
testimony,&#8221; Elderkin said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott has filed its own lawsuit against Centocor, claiming
JJ&#8217;s arthritis drug Simponi, made with human antibodies and
first sold last year, is infringing an Abbott patent. Abbott
also claims a JJ psoriasis medicine, Stelara, violates two
other patents. Those cases are pending in federal court in
Worcester, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Centocor Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories, 10-1144,
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The
lower court case is Centocor Inc. v. Abbott Laboratories,
07cv139, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas
(Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Design Patent for 12-Can Beer Holster Issued to Hops Holster &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hops Holster, a Chicago-based company that makes drinking
accessories, received a design patent for a holster that will
hold 12 cans of beer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Patent D625,514, issued Oct. 19, covers a device with
a 16-inch wide strap and adjustable waistband. According to a
company statement, the holster can &#8216;hold and insulate 12 beer
cans at a time &#8220;to enable continuous access and consumption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application for the patent was filed in March with the
assistance of Allen Dyer Doppelt Milbrath  Gilchrist PA of
Orlando, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L.A. Printex, Cato Trade Copyright-Infringement Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.A. Printex, which has filed more than 20 copyright
infringement suits this year, sued a North Carolina company for
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cato Corp. of Charlotte, North Carolina, is accused of
selling fabric and designs that are knockoffs of nine L.A.
Printex copyrights, according to the complaint filed Oct. 29 in
federal court in North Carolina. L.A. Printex is a Los Angeles-
based textile printing mill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Carolina company filed suit in the same court in
September, seeking a declaration of non-infringement. Cato said
it doesn&#8217;t infringe any valid and enforceable copyrights
belonging to the printing mill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.A. Printex&#8217;s complaint included photos of its copyrighted
designs and of garments it claims are sold by Cato. In its
complaint, the company asked the court to bar Cato from
importing, manufacturing, distributing and selling any product
that infringed its designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also seeks awards of money damages and of Cato&#8217;s profit
attributable to the alleged infringement. Additionally, it asked
for awards of litigation costs and attorney fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;L.A. Printex is represented by Nathan M. Hull of
Charlotte&#8217;s Hull  Chandler PA and Stephen M. Doniger of Doniger
Burroughs APC of Culver City, California. Cato&#8217;s lawyer is J.
Mark Wilson of Moore  Van Allen PLLC, also of Charlotte. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case against Cato is L.A. Printex Industries Inc. v.
Cato Corp., 3:10-cv-00543-FDW-DCK, U.S. District Court, Western
District of North Carolina (Charlotte). Cato&#8217;s case against the
print mill is Cato Corp. v. L.A. Printex, 3:10-cv-00462-RLV-DSC,

&lt;p&gt;Hasbro Objects to Angle&#8217;s &#8216;Harry Reid Amnesty Game&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasbro Inc., the toymaker second in size only to Mattel
Inc., complained that Nevada&#8217;s Republican senatorial candidate
infringed the trademarks of its Monopoly game, Huffington Post
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharron Angle, who lost to Democratic Senate Majority
Leader Harry Reid in yesterday&#8217;s election, was sent a cease-and-
desist letter complaining that her &#8220;Harry Reid Amnesty Game&#8221;
website used the marks without permission, according to
Huffington Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based company told Angle that
aside from protecting its IP rights, it was anxious &#8220;to avoid
associations of toys and games with partisan politics,&#8221; the
news site reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in her campaign, Angle ran afoul of the Las Vegas
Review-Journal, and was sued for infringement for allegedly
reprinting two articles on her website without authorization,
according to Huffington Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat Society Sues &#8216;Founding Queen Mum&#8217; for Infringing Marks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat Society, a membership organization aimed at
bringing women over 50 &#8220;life meaning and fulfillment&#8221; sued the
head of one of its chapters for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary J. Rausch, who served as &#8220;Founding Queen Mum&#8221; of the
Phoenix-based &#8220;Decadent Dames&#8221; chapter, quit paying her Queen
membership dues in June 2010, according to the complaint filed
Oct. 28 in federal court in Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Red Hat &#8220;hatquarters&#8221; in Fullerton,
California, that is included in court filings, Rausch said
although she would quit paying her Queen dues, she would
continue to hold meetings and wear the red hat and purple dress
that is a sign of membership in the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rausch said the society&#8217;s move to charge $20 annual dues
for each individual members was harmful to the women in her
community, &#8220;many on fixed incomes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The society said Rausch infringes its marks by continuing
to use the domain name azredhats.com, and keeping links to
official society events on the site. It also objects to a letter
Rausch sent to Red Hat Society members inviting them to a Red
Hat convention she would be hosting in March 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rausch&#8217;s actions have caused the society &#8220;irreparable
harm&#8221; and confused the public, according to court papers. The
society asked the court to order Rausch to quit infringing the
marks and surrender her azredhats.com website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the society seeks money damages, including
extra damages &#8220;in a sum sufficient to punish and make an
example&#8221; of her, and for awards of attorney fees and litigation
costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat Society is represented by Judith Beth Gitterman of
Seattle&#8217;s Perkins Coie LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Red Hat Society Inc., v. Mary J. Rausch, 8:10-
cv-01659-CJC-VBK, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong stocks rose, pushing the
benchmark index to its highest close in more than two years,
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said the city will benefit from
extra liquidity released by central banks and China&#8217;s growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., the city&#8217;s No. 1 developer by
market value, jumped 6.6 percent after Goldman Sachs named the
stock as a possible beneficiary of liquidity. Cosco Pacific
Ltd., a container-terminal unit of Asia&#8217;s largest shipping
company by market value, surged 5.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Index climbed 2 percent to 24,144.67, its
highest close since June 2008, with developers posting the
biggest gains. Stocks rose ahead of the conclusion of a U.S.
Federal Reserve policy meeting which economists reckon will lead
to further purchases of securities to stimulate growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are expectations of quantitative easing in the
U.S., which I don&#8217;t believe the U.S. government can afford not
to extend to the maximum amount given the economy&#8217;s lack of
momentum,&#8221; said Castor Pang, Hong Kong-based research director
at Cinda International Holdings Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of so-called H shares
of Chinese companies jumped 2.2 percent to 13,820.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main Hang Seng Index has gained 10 percent this year on
expectation that growth in corporate earnings will weather
concerns about the pace of the U.S. economic recovery and
China&#8217;s steps to curb rising property prices. Shares in the
gauge trade at an average 15.3 times estimated earnings,
compared with about 17.2 times at the start of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity-Driven Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs raised its 12-month target for the Hang Seng
Index to 29,000. Hong Kong will benefit most from a structural
capital relocation away from developed markets to emerging ones,
according to a Goldman Sachs report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cosco Pacific surged 5.6 percent to HK$13.26. China
Merchants Holdings (International) Co., which has stakes in
ports that move about a third of the nation&#8217;s container traffic,
climbed 5.1 percent to HK$29.10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sun Hung Kai rallied 6.6 percent to HK$144.50, the biggest
gain on the Hang Seng Index. Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd., the
city&#8217;s No. 2 developer by market value, rose 2.6 percent to
HK$126.10. Property stocks such as Sun Hung Kai and Cheung Kong
would benefit from liquidity-driven real estate inflation, the
Goldman Sachs report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Land Auction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hang Seng Property Index&#8217;s 3.4 percent increase was the
biggest among the four industry groups tracked by the Hang Seng
Index. New World Development Co., a Hong Kong-based developer,
advanced 2.9 percent to HK$16.22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks advanced even after the Hong Kong government sold a
building site in Kowloon Tong to Chinachem Group for HK$2.17
billion ($280 million) at an auction today. That was below the
HK$2.7 billion median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. rose 4.6
percent to 69 Hong Kong cents after China&#8217;s biggest chipmaker
reported a second straight quarter of profit. Net income was
$30.4 million in the third quarter, compared with a loss of
$69.3 million a year earlier, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world&#8217;s
largest lender by market value, climbed 4.5 percent to HK$6.69
after telling analysts that three-quarters of loans to local-
government finance vehicles are backed by sufficient cash flows
to cover payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme Town &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of China Ltd., the nation&#8217;s third biggest by market
value, advanced 2.3 percent to HK$4.96. The lender won&#8217;t need
additional fund-raising over the next three years based on
current conditions, President Li Lihui said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMI Corp. climbed 3.2 percent to 49 Hong Kong cents. The
company, which produces television dramas and invests in
property, said it has signed a letter of intent to buy a 90
percent stake in a Beijing &#8220;theme town&#8221; project for no more
than 930 million yuan ($139 million). The target project will
contain film-production, hotel, shopping and entertainment
facilities, SMI said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Hang Seng Index increased 1.6 percent to
24,065. All but four stocks rose among the measure&#8217;s 45
constituents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. raised its
12-month target for Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng Index to 29,000,
saying the city has the most to gain from extra liquidity
released by quantitative easing programs and China&#8217;s growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong will benefit most from a capital relocation away
from developed to emerging markets, Goldman analysts led by
Kinger Lau wrote in a report today. Inflation and low economic
growth are reducing the allure of developed-market assets, the
analysts said. Goldman analysts forecast in December the Hang
Seng Index may reach about 27,000 by the end of 2010. The gauge
climbed 2 percent to 24,132.38 as of today&#8217;s trading break at
12:30 p.m. local time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is likely to announce a plan today
to purchase a further $500 billion of long-term securities to
stimulate the economy in a program known as QE2, according to
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We suspect the resulting liquidity impact could go beyond
many investors&#8217; expectations,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;The
overwhelming importance of China to the growth in Hong Kong may
mask the unfolding trend of gravitational attraction of
international capital.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy liquidity and Hong Kong&#8217;s stable regulatory
environment make the city&#8217;s real estate market attractive, and
values, which are at 13-year highs, are likely to appreciate,
the report said. Property oriented stocks provided a better
investment option than the physical market, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asset Bubble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheap borrowing costs are driving asset prices higher in
the city, and Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Executive
Officer Norman Chan said Oct. 18 that a housing bubble poses the
biggest risk to financial stability in Asia. Hong Kong&#8217;s
government has introduced higher down payment ratios since
August and pledged to increase land supply to cool the city&#8217;s
property market, where values have jumped 50 percent since the
start of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging economies may use currency appreciation and
temporary capital controls to cope with money inflows sparked by
U.S. monetary easing, Joseph Yam, former head of the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority, said in a speech in Beijing today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also reaping gains from loose monetary policy would be Hong
Kong&#8217;s financial sector, which is already benefiting from
China&#8217;s program of yuan liberalization, the Goldman analysts
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A combination of strong domestic growth and abundant
global liquidity is how we would describe the investment thesis
for Hong Kong,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Property Stocks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Hong Kong Index offers a better proxy for Hong
Kong growth than the Hang Seng Index, for which China stocks
make up 56 percent of market capitalization, the analysts said.
They raised their forecast for the MSCI gauge to 14,000 from
12,200. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analysts said Hong Kong property stocks such as Sun
Hung Kai Properties Ltd., Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. and MTR
Corp. would benefit from liquidity-driven real estate inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks such as Bank of China Ltd. and Hong Kong
Exchanges  Clearing Ltd. were well positioned to take advantage
of further liberalization of the yuan, the analysts said, giving
the two stocks a &#8220;buy&#8221; recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting debt issued by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dropped to the lowest in six months as
investors bet banks will benefit from a divided Congress and the
Federal Reserve plans to buy Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the New York-based firm declined
8.6 basis points to 115.4 at 4:30 p.m. in New York, according to

before the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs
for fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on the debt have declined from as high as 228.5
basis points on May 6. Goldman Sachs settled the SEC&#8217;s complaint
for $550 million in July, the largest penalty the agency has
ever levied against a Wall Street firm. The Republican gains in
the Nov. 2 congressional elections combined with Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke&#8217;s $600 billion bond-buying program are boosting
the banking sector, Societe Generale&#8217;s Michael Reiner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman has solid earnings power and also stands to
benefit, along with the rest of the sector, from a less
stringent regulatory environment,&#8221; said Reiner, a New York-
based credit strategist with the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts on Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of
America Corp. fell 12 basis points to 169.5 and those on
JPMorgan Chase  Co. fell 6.3 basis points to 85.7, CMA data
show. The cost to protect Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s debt decreased 6
basis points to 135.5, and on that of San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo  Co. eased 9 basis points to 101.4, according to CMA.
Swaps on Morgan Stanley declined 11 basis points to 151.9, CMA
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tame Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These large banks are not operating using the same
leverage,&#8221; Adrian Miller, fixed-income strategist at Miller
Tabak Roberts Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mailed
message. &#8220;Hence the earnings growth will be tame relative to
the pre-crash days.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs climbed $3.76, or 2.3 percent, to $166.39, in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. That&#8217;s 10 percent off
the highest level in 2010 prior to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swaps on Goldman Sachs debt, which typically rise as
investor confidence deteriorates, soared 34 basis points and
shares dropped 12.8 percent on April 16. The SEC accused the
firm of defrauding investors in a CDO linked to home loans by
concealing that Paulson  Co., a New York-based hedge fund,
picked components of the CDO and bet it would collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the Markit CDX North America
Investment Grade Index, which investors use to hedge against
losses on corporate debt or to speculate on creditworthiness,
dropped 5.3 basis points to a mid-price of 86.1 basis points,
also the lowest since April 15, according to index administrator
Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers Beat Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings decreased 4.2 basis points to 94.9, and
the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps on 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 23.6
basis points to 433.3, Markit prices show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Limited Brands Inc. declined 19.3
basis points to 163.1, the lowest since May, CMA data show,
after the clothing retailer reported third-quarter profit that
beat the average analyst estimate. Contracts on Saks Inc.
dropped 54.2 basis points to 511.9, the biggest decline in
almost six months, the data show, following the luxury
retailer&#8217;s report that October same-store sales increased 8.1
percent, beating the 3.6 percent estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.
climbed the most in seven weeks after Canada blocked BHP
Billiton Ltd.&#8217;s $40 billion hostile bid for the world&#8217;s largest
fertilizer producer. The swaps jumped 11.3 basis points to 107.7
basis points, CMA data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point, 0.01 percentage point, equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. today starts selling
Kinect, a device that lets consumers play video games with their
bodies, to help it lure casual gamers and add years to the life
of its Xbox 360 gaming console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinect, shaped like a flat, black box, tracks a player&#8217;s
movement and voice and costs $149.99 by itself or starting at
$299.99 when purchased with an Xbox 360 console. Microsoft
yesterday boosted its forecast for Kinect sales this year to 5
million units from 3 million after the device sold out in pre-
sales at retailers such as Amazon.com Inc. and Best Buy Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer is depending on
Kinect to catch Nintendo Co., which pioneered the motion-sensing
gaming market with its Wii controller, and Sony Corp., whose
Move controller hit stores in September. The product is also
designed to help Microsoft goose sales of the aging Xbox 360,
released in 2005, and improve margins of a unit that lost about
$8 billion before reaching profitability in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a very intuitive and innovative product,&#8221; said Gregg Moskowitz, an analyst at Cowen  Co. in New York, who has an
&#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft.
&#8220;It&#8217;s not ideal for every video game, but it has that potential
to tap into a new market where we haven&#8217;t seen Microsoft
before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may generate $500 million in Kinect sales this
quarter and $1 billion this fiscal year, which ends in June,
according to Moskowitz. If Microsoft can meet its new forecast
for holiday Kinect sales, the company will exceed his estimate
by about $250 million for the quarter, Moskowitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Casual, Social Gamers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kinect, Microsoft is aiming at users of so-called
casual games, which tend to be more family-friendly than
traditional shoot-&#8217;em-up video titles, and social games, played
on social networks such as Facebook Inc. Consumers may spend
$2.4 billion on casual games this year, according to Parks
Associates, a research firm in Dallas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which pioneered the market for online
multiplayer console games, will try to extend its advantage with
Kinect games such as &#8220;Kinect Sports&#8221; and &#8220;Kinect
Adventures.&#8221; Many of the 17 games available at introduction let
gamers snap photos of themselves playing and post them online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a company that hasn&#8217;t traditionally attracted casual
gamers with Xbox, Microsoft may need to take pains to win over
wives, mothers and teenage girls who may already have an Xbox in
the house but don&#8217;t use it, said Michael Pachter, a video-game
analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen, Oprah &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To do that, Microsoft has previewed the device on daytime
talk shows hosted by Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. A clip
of DeGeneres doing Merengue moves along with Kinect&#8217;s &#8220;Dance
Central&#8221; game -- from the makers of the classic title &#8220;Rock
Band&#8221; -- led Pachter&#8217;s non-gamer wife to ask when the family
was getting one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It worked in Ballmer&#8217;s household too, the executive told a
group of students at the University of Washington last month.
His wife, Connie, had banished the Xbox from the main part of
the house, saying it was distracting the kids from homework,
until she saw Kinect, Ballmer said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have a lot riding on it,&#8221; Pachter said. &#8220;If they
can get every Wii household to upgrade to this, they can sell
another 50 million consoles. They won&#8217;t succeed in that, of
course, but that&#8217;s the goal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 11 cents to $27.14 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. It has declined 11 percent this
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s &#8216;Confidence&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s higher Kinect sales forecast &#8220;shows a lot of
confidence,&#8221; Pachter said. In that same period, Sony may sell
about 3 million Move units, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Entertainment and Devices unit, made up mostly
of Xbox sales, had a profit of $679 million for the year that
ended June 30, only the third year the business has turned a
profit. Kinect is key to expanding margins. Consoles typically
lose money for the first several years before turning profitable
and the Xbox 360 is now narrowly profitable, Microsoft has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a new console, Kinect won&#8217;t lose money from the time
of its release, according to Moskowitz. When it reaches full
sales capacity, Moskowitz expects Kinect to be more profitable
than the Xbox. Microsoft unveiled Kinect in June 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, many hard-core gamers like Pachter himself &#8220;won&#8217;t
really care&#8221; about Kinect, he said. Pachter said he&#8217;d rather
spend the money to buy &#8220;Vanquish&#8221; and the latest installments of
&#8220;Gears of War&#8217; and &#8220;Call of Duty,&#8221; three shooting games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don Mattrick, president of Microsoft&#8217;s Interactive
Entertainment Business, said in an interview that he&#8217;s confident
&#8220;Xbox and Kinect is for everyone, whether you are 8 or 80.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. bank stocks rose the most in two
months after the Wall Street Journal said the Federal Reserve is
expected to allow lenders with satisfactory capital levels to
increase dividend payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co., the two
biggest U.S. banks by assets, led the KBW Bank Index to a 3.6
percent gain at 4:01 p.m. in New York. The increase was the
largest since Sept. 1. Eighty of the 81 companies in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Financial Index also advanced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are expected to soon provide banks with
requirements they must meet to raise the dividends, the Wall
Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.
JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said last month
that he hoped to increase the dividend early next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America jumped 5.2 percent to $12.12, after
climbing as much as 6.3 percent, its biggest intraday gain since
May. JPMorgan rose 5.5 percent to $39.80. SunTrust Banks Inc.,
BBT Corp. and US Bancorp all climbed more than 4.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Fablyn, the bone drug
that failed to win U.S. approval amid safety questions, reduced
the risk of breast cancer and fractures in postmenopausal women
with osteoporosis, a company-sponsored study found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women taking the medicine, also known as lasofoxifene, had
a 79 percent lower chance of breast cancer compared with those
on placebo, researchers said today in the Journal of the
National Cancer Institute. Pfizer is &#8220;exploring strategic
options&#8221; that include licensing out Fablyn or selling the
rights Pfizer now holds, in line with plans disclosed last year,
Victoria Davis, a spokeswoman, said in an e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer failed last year to win approval from the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration to sell Fablyn as an osteoporosis
treatment, after the medicine was linked to an increase in total
deaths from all causes. The company said in a regulatory filing
in May that it was withdrawing its requests for U.S. clearance
of the medicine in osteoporosis and in vulvar and vaginal
atrophy. The medicine may yet find a use, said Victor Vogel, a
physician not connected with the drug or the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We shall have to wait and see what the FDA decides to
do,&#8217;&#8217; said Vogel, director of cancer services at Geisinger
Health System in Danville, Pennsylvania, in a telephone
interview on Nov. 2. He said the FDA should reexamine the drug
in light of today&#8217;s study. Vogel wrote an editorial about the
drug for the journal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s largest
soft-drink maker, plans to sell $4.5 billion of bonds in its
biggest offering to cut interest costs from debt it took on
acquiring operations from bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is selling 3-year notes that may be priced near
the record-low rate of 0.75 percent that Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
got in an Oct. 18 sale, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It also plans to issue 18-month notes, and 5- and 10-year debt,
according to a person familiar with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola joins Dow Chemical Co., Harvard University and
General Electric Capital Corp. in marketing bonds today with
investment-grade company borrowing costs near record lows. Coca-
Cola assumed $8 billion of debt when it closed Oct. 3 on its
acquisition of Coca-Cola Enterprises&#8217; North American operations,
of which it already owned 34 percent. The purchase followed
PepsiCo Inc. bringing its bottling in-house, as both companies
try to cut costs and turn around the U.S. market, where annual
soft-drink sales by volume have declined since 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rates are so low that companies are having a contest of
who&#8217;s going to issue at the lowest,&#8221; said Didi Weinblatt, vice
president of mutual fund portfolios at USAA Investment
Management in San Antonio, where she helps oversee about $45
billion. &#8220;First we had Johnson  Johnson, then Microsoft, maybe
now Coca-Cola&#8217;s going to issue even lower.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tea Party wave that swept
Republicans to a U.S. House majority may also be shielding
Bristol Palin from elimination on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Dancing With the
Stars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palin, the daughter of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin,
survived a seventh week on the Walt Disney Co. network&#8217;s show
Nov. 2, the night Republicans gained at least 60 House seats.
The 20-year-old was saved by viewers&#8217; votes after her Viennese
waltz received the judges&#8217; worst score. Ex-Los Angeles Laker
Rick Fox got the hook, based on the lowest combined tally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s a strong popular movement behind Sarah Palin at
the moment and she&#8217;s receiving a lot of support from the Tea
Party,&#8221; Conrad Green, executive producer of the program, said
in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s entirely possible some of those people
are behind Bristol for political reasons.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Dancing With the Stars,&#8221; ABC&#8217;s most-watched show, pairs
celebrities with professional dancers in weekly elimination
rounds that weigh the public&#8217;s votes and judges&#8217; scores equally.
The program, airing Monday and Tuesday nights in the U.S.,
consists of a performance night and a results night. The format
allows weaker participants with a fan base to advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we know, the Tea Party can get out the vote,&#8221; said
Brad Adgate, research director at New York advertising company
Horizon Media Inc. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got to suspect there is a lot of
grass-roots support pulling her up from the bottom rung.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and nine other
banks may lose an estimated $120 million in advisory fees should
BHP Billiton Ltd.&#8217;s $40 billion hostile bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian government yesterday blocked BHP&#8217;s offer,
saying it didn&#8217;t provide the country a &#8220;net benefit.&#8221; The
banks would earn as much as $140 million in advisory fees if the
deal is successful and as little as $20 million if it fails,
according to estimates by research firm Freeman Consulting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For many of the bankers involved, their bonuses are
likely to be a lot less than they would have been,&#8221; said Peter Hahn, professor of corporate finance at Cass Business School in
London. &#8220;The loss of the fee income is hugely disappointing for
the banks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed takeover would be the largest deal this year.
BHP, the world&#8217;s largest mining company, in September lined up
$45 billion of loans to fund the deal. The Melbourne-based
company has 30 days to appeal the Canadian decision, at which
point the government will make its final decision. BHP said
yesterday it would review its options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Banco
Santander SA, Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are
BHP&#8217;s advisers on the deal, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Potash Corp. is advised by Bank of America Corp.,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to advisory fees, financing banks can get as
much as $190 million to arrange loans, according to Freeman.
Most of the loan fees may have already been paid, Freeman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brian Marchiony, a JPMorgan spokesman in London, declined
to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential, AIA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the target&#8217;s defense advisers in a hostile situation
may be paid their full fee if the deal fails, it&#8217;s unclear in a
situation where the government blocks the transaction, said New
York-based Freeman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. insurer Prudential Plc earlier this year failed in its
$35.5 billion bid to buy American International Group Inc.&#8217;s
Asian unit AIA Group Ltd. That deal would have generated about
$660 million in fees for advisers, according to Freeman&#8217;s
estimate at the time the deal was announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should BHP drop the bid, it will be the third time Chief
Executive Officer Marius Kloppers, 48, has failed to consummate
a deal in the past two years after scrapping the hostile bid for
Rio Tinto Group in 2008 and an iron ore joint venture with the
same company last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These mega-deals, like Prudential, are getting a second
look for a lot of different reasons and it&#8217;s getting harder for
boards to risk their credibility by attempting these types of
transactions,&#8221; Hahn said. &#8220;BHP has already paid hundreds of
millions in banker and lawyer fees for the failed Rio Tinto
transaction, so it will be interesting to see how much they have
to set aside for the Potash bid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been $1.71 trillion worth of global deals
announced this year, up 20 percent from the same period last
year, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government&#8217;s decision marks only the second formal
rejection of a takeover in Canada in the past 25 years. The
government came under pressure from the province of
Saskatchewan, which argued Potash Corp.&#8217;s sale would cut jobs
and tax revenue and surrender control of an important resource. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Investment Canada Act, the federal government can
block any transaction valued at C$299 million ($296 million) or
more if it finds the deal doesn&#8217;t provide a &#8220;net benefit&#8221; to
the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada has reviewed and approved 1,637 applications between
June 30, 1985, the year the legislation was enacted, and Sept.
30 this year, according to government data. The other deal to be
rejected was Alliant Techsystems Inc.&#8217;s 2008 bid for MacDonald
Dettwiler  Associates Ltd.&#8217;s space business. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, received requests for files this
year on about $8.1 billion in outstanding loans that may be
candidates for buybacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Repurchase demands in the second and third quarter were
&#8220;very high&#8221; and have increased over the previous several
quarters, according to an investor presentation on the New York-
based company&#8217;s website today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan received $2.9 billion in repurchase demands this
year, compared with $3 billion for all of 2009 and $2 billion
the year before, Charlie Scharf, chief executive officer for
retail banking, said in a presentation at the BancAnalysts
Association of Boston Conference. About 90 percent of the
repurchase demands are for loans originated from 2006 through
2008, Scharf said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requests for loan files from private investors as well as
government-sponsored companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have
increased, according to the presentation. The $8.1 billion in
file requests this year compares with $9.2 billion for all of
last year and $4.6 billion in 2008. The data exclude repurchase
and loan file requests from private insurers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has also separately stopped 127,000 foreclosures
in 40 states, up from 115,000 disclosed last month, while it
reviews those files to correct any errors in the documents,
Scharf said. JPMorgan will begin re-filing paperwork in a few
weeks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

you have the ambition to build a world beating company here in
the U.K., we want you,&#8221; Prime Minister David Cameron said in a
speech in east London today. &#8220;With our new entrepreneur visa we
want the whole world to know that Britain wants to become the
home of enterprise and the land of opportunity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move is designed to allay business concerns over a
planned cap on immigration from next year. Companies say a
temporary limit currently in force is preventing them from
bringing in staff. Business Secretary Vince Cable, a Liberal
Democrat in the Conservative-led government, has warned the
limit will hamper economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entrepreneurs will have to have &#8220;serious investment from a
leading investor&#8221; to qualify for the visa, Cameron said.
Further details of how the visa will work will be announced next
year, Cameron&#8217;s office said. The Conservatives fought the May
election on a pledge to introduce a limit on immigration, while
the Liberal Democrats opposed the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron said yesterday that intra-company transfers, which
in 2009 accounted for 60 percent of &#8220;tier 2&#8221; visas for skilled
workers, will not be included in the cap. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ireland faces a &#8220;messy&#8221; four weeks
as the government prepares its 2011 budget and tries to reassure
investors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief European Economist
Erik Nielsen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a &#8220;real risk&#8221; that the government won&#8217;t be able
to get the budget on Dec. 7 passed, Nielsen said in an e-mailed
note late yesterday. Still, Ireland is &#8220;fully funded through
mid-2011, so we are not talking about an imminent liquidity
crisis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A selloff in Irish bonds continued today, pushing the extra
yield that investors demand to hold the country&#8217;s debt rather
than German bunds to a record. The yield premium has more than
doubled in the last three months on investor concern that
Ireland won&#8217;t be able to manage its fiscal problems without
external aid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government last month said it needs 15 billion euros
($21 billion) of savings over the next four years to reduce the
deficit. It will announce its 2011 target this week. It will
still have a &#8220;very substantial&#8221; borrowing requirement next
year even with a 6 billion-euro budget package for 2011, John
Curran, a government spokesman, said in an interview with
Dublin-based broadcaster RTE today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government will publish new economic forecasts for the
period through 2014 at 4:30 p.m. in Dublin today, the Finance
Ministry said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer plans to sell as much as $2 billion in
stock to diversify his holdings and help with tax planning
before the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction would mark his first stock sale in seven
years, the Redmond, Washington-based company said today on its
website. Ballmer held about 408 million shares before the move,
which involves as many as 75 million shares, Microsoft said. At
the stock&#8217;s closing price on Nov. 5, the transaction would
amount to $2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even though this is a personal financial matter, I want to
be clear about this to avoid any confusion,&#8221; Ballmer said in the
statement. &#8220;I am excited about our new products and the
potential for our technology to change people&#8217;s lives, and I
remain fully committed to Microsoft and its success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer&#8217;s sale comes as the company steps up its use of
dividends and buybacks to reward shareholders, who have seen the
stock fall this year. Microsoft, the biggest software maker,
boosted its dividend 23 percent in September. As of June, the
company had approval to buy back $23.7 billion shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 29 cents to $26.85 today in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The shares have declined 12 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, 54, has already sold about 50 million shares of
the total 75 million, according to a regulatory filing. He took
over from Bill Gates as CEO in 2000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. settled a
suit by a former vice president who claimed she was pushed onto
the &#8220;mommy-track&#8221; and eventually fired after she chose to work
part-time following her pregnancy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in March by Charlotte Hanna, claimed
violations of the U.S. Family Medical Leave Act, and gender and
pregnancy discrimination. The terms of the settlement are
confidential, said Douglas Wigdor, Hanna&#8217;s attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her complaint, Hanna said she joined Goldman as an
associate in 1998 and two years later was promoted to vice
president for Goldman Sachs University, an in-house training
program. She claimed her opportunities for advancement at
Goldman Sachs disappeared when she took maternity leave with her
first child in February 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When Ms. Hanna decided to take the &#8216;off-ramp&#8217; provided by
the firm to devote time to her children, there was no &#8216;on-ramp&#8217;
that enabled her to return to full-time employment,&#8221; her lawyer
wrote in the complaint. &#8220;The &#8216;off-ramp&#8217; was a direct path to a
mommy-track that ultimately derailed Ms. Hanna&#8217;s career.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hanna claimed that once she began working part time for the
firm, she was channeled into lower positions that made it more
difficult for her to earn more money and advance to better
positions. She claimed she was demoted, lost her office and then
was fired in 2008, before she returned from a second maternity
leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman David Wells had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hanna v. Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 10-cv-02637,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s biggest
drugmaker, leads a race against three rivals to sell the first
new pill in a decade for rheumatoid arthritis, a joint disease
treated by injected drugs with $12 billion in annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tablet, called tasocitinib, curbed inflammation and
stopped the disease from worsening, Pfizer reported last week.
Pfizer may edge out shots sold by Johnson  Johnson, Abbott
Laboratories, and Amgen Inc. if research to be presented Nov. 10
at the American College of Rheumatology in Atlanta suggests its
tablet is also a safe alternative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasocitinib is the most advanced pill in a family of
experimental drugs to target a protein, called JAK, which leads
to joint destruction in 1.3 million Americans with rheumatoid
arthritis. Pfizer&#8217;s study is the first late-stage JAK trial, one
of six the company plans to complete by the end of next year.
The pill can generate peak annual sales of $2 billion, said Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tasocitinib&#8217;s main value proposition is that it is a
first-in-class novel oral therapy launching into an area filled
with injectable products that collectively sell about $12
billion a year for rheumatoid arthritis alone,&#8221; Anderson said
in a Nov. 1 research report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 20 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $17.18 at 4
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The New York-
based drugmaker rose less than a percent in the 12 months
through today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor Competition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is counting on revenue from tasocitinib to help
offset losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol pill,
with $11.4 billion in annual sales, faces competition next year
from cheaper copies in the U.S. The company gained the arthritis
remedy Enbrel in last year&#8217;s $68 billion purchase of Wyeth. The
anti-inflammatory medicine generated $799 million in the third
quarter, making up 5 percent of Pfizer&#8217;s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease where the immune
system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing inflammation
in and around joints. Shots known as anti-TNF therapy are
standard care for the 80 percent of patients who don&#8217;t respond
to treatment with methotrexate, a generic drug that can block
cell growth in people with certain cancers and immune disorders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three biotechnology companies are trying to catch up to
Pfizer with their own JAK drugs - Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
Incyte Corp., and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pfizer&#8217;s pill is
the only one in the third and final stage of tests generally
needed for U.S. approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-Year Lead &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasocitinib &#8220;appears to be in the lead by at least two
years in comparison to other JAK inhibitors,&#8221; said Marc Goodman, an analyst with UBS Securities, in an Oct. 27 note to
clients. &#8220;We believe that the safety issues are key to gaining
the appropriate label and could limit its use to patients with
low cardiovascular risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are most concerned about whether Pfizer&#8217;s drug
will raise cholesterol levels enough to limit the number of
patients who might use it, Goodman said. The pill showed signs
of this side effect in previous study results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors may be slow to adopt new JAK drugs for patients who
are already getting relief from older treatments, said David Pisetsky, professor of rheumatology and immunology at Duke
University School of Medicine. While high cholesterol linked to
tasocitinib may be treatable, physicians may resist adding an
additional drug to patients&#8217; daily treatment regimens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because it&#8217;s a new mode of action, there&#8217;s great
interest, but what&#8217;s going to happen in terms of efficacy and
safety when you really put it out there?&#8221; Pisetsky said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s always a difference between what
happens in a trial setting and what happens in real life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enbrel, Remicade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rheumatoid arthritis market is dominated by three anti-
TNF treatments: Enbrel from Pfizer and Thousand Oaks,
California-based Amgen; Humira, from Abbott Park, Illinois-based
Abbott; and Remicade, sold by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based
JJ and Merck  Co., based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey.
The treatments cost as much as $20,000 a year and leave patients
susceptible to infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summary results of the first three months of Pfizer&#8217;s six-
month study were released last week. The study&#8217;s 611 patients
took one of two doses of the drug or a placebo pill. After three
months of treatment, 66 percent of patients taking the higher
dose had at least a 20 percent improvement of symptoms, compared
with 27 percent in the placebo group. Side effects were reported
by 330 patients, with 25 seriously affected. Thirteen patients
stopped taking the drug. A 79-year-old woman with a history of
heart disease and diabetes died after developing diarrhea
followed by renal failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complete Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complete six-month data from the trial will be released
Nov. 7 and presented Nov. 10 at the rheumatology meeting. The
presentation will include the number of patients with 70 percent
improvement and will describe side effects in greater detail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incyte Corp., based in Wilmington, Delaware, will present
the second of three stages of testing of its drug, INCB-28050,
at the rheumatology meeting. Early results of the 125-patient
trial show similar effectiveness to Pfizer&#8217;s drug and comparable
anti-TNFs, though more studies are needed, said Goodman of UBS.
Incyte is partnered with Eli Lilly  Co., of Indianapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rigel, of South San Francisco, California, in September
entered late-stage research for its JAK drug, called
fostamatinib, in joint development with London-based AstraZeneca
Plc. A study in July 2009 failed to show statistically
significant improvement for patients taking the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vertex, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is conducting a
mid-stage trial of its JAK drug, VX-509. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methotrexate, now generic, was approved in 1988 and sells
for less than $1 a pill. Arava, a pill approved in 1998 for
Paris-based Sanofi-Aventis SA, is also sold as a generic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lion Capital LLP will use debt
financing from lenders led by JPMorgan Chase  Co. to pay for
its $980 million leveraged buyout of Bumble Bee Foods LLC,
according to a person familiar with the negotiations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., Barclays Plc and Jefferies Group Inc.
also agreed to help raise money for the transaction, the London-
based private-equity firm said today in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion Capital, with investments totaling 19 billion euros
($27 billion) in enterprise value, is buying Bumble Bee from New
York-based private-equity firm Centre Partners Management LLC,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase price is about 7.5 times more than the San
Diego, California-based company&#8217;s earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, the person familiar with
the talks said. Bumble Bee, North America&#8217;s biggest supplier of
canned seafood, had $940 million in net revenue last year,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Della Sweetman, a spokeswoman for Bumble Bee, didn&#8217;t
immediately return a message left at her office seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion Capital will provide about 35 percent of equity
financing for the transaction, the person familiar with the
talks said. The balance will be paid with bonds and bank debt,
which may include term loans and a revolving credit line, the
person said. In a revolving credit facility, money can be
borrowed again once it&#8217;s repaid; in a term loan, it can&#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The debt structure is yet to be determined and bonds are
expected to make up a bigger portion of it, the person said. The
acquisition is expected to be completed by mid-December and
marketing of the buyout debt will begin after the borrowings are
rated, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bumble Bee&#8217;s total leverage, or debt to Ebitda, will be
about 5.5 times after the LBO, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private-equity firms pool money from investors and obtain
debt to finance takeovers with the intention of selling the
companies later for a profit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Wells Fargo
 Co. are among banks most likely to increase dividends as early
as the first quarter of 2011, according to Dick Bove of Rochdale
Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks rallied today after a person familiar with
the matter told Bloomberg News that the Federal Reserve is
preparing guidelines for supervisors to use in assessing whether
banks are strong enough to boost payouts or buy back shares.
Banks in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index climbed 3.7 percent
yesterday, leading the gauge to a two-year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It now looks highly likely that the dividends for a
number of banks will be increased,&#8221; Bove, who is based in Lutz,
Florida, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;Do they have the
capacity to dramatically increase their dividends? The answer is
definitely yes. They have enormous capacity to increase their
earnings from a balance sheet standpoint.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings have topped estimates at 19 of the 24 banks in the
KBW Bank Index that have reported since Oct. 7, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, the largest U.S. home lender,
which last month reported third-quarter earnings that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates, are among the most likely to boost their
payouts, according to Bove. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg dividend forecasts show JPMorgan, based in New
York, will quadruple its quarterly payout to 20 cents in
February, while San Francisco-based Wells Fargo will double its
to 10 cents in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Top Priority&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins, 59, said
last month that an increase is a &#8220;top priority&#8221; for the bank.
JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, said he
was &#8220;reasonably hopeful&#8221; the firm will be able to raise its
payment in 2011&#8217;s first quarter and that regulators were open to
the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bove said other banks that may boost their dividends are
Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Northern Trust Corp., State
Street Corp., BBT Corp., Comerica Inc., U.S. Bancorp and PNC
Financial Services Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The analyst doesn&#8217;t expect the following banks to boost
their payouts: Citigroup Inc., First Horizon National Corp.,
Fifth Third Bancorp, KeyCorp, Marshall  Ilsley Corp., Regions
Financial Corp., SunTrust Banks Inc. and Zions Bancorporation.
He said it is unclear what Bank of America Corp. will do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Treasury Department forced Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America and Citigroup of New York to
slash their quarterly payments to no more than a penny as a
condition of receiving an additional $20 billion of bailout
money in late 2008 and early 2009. The banks had gotten $25
billion a few months earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe, Regulation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Banks Index fell 28 percent from this year&#8217;s
high on May 3 through Aug. 30 on concern that widening European
deficits and U.S. financial regulation would curb lending. Since
then, the index has risen 20 percent. The gauge rallied 3.7
percent at 1:14 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of Bove&#8217;s past predictions have been mixed. He
recommended selling Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. stock four
months before the securities firm collapsed, helping investors
avoid a 65 percent plunge in the shares. Bove raised it to
&#8220;buy&#8221; on Aug. 21, 2008. Lehman filed the world&#8217;s largest
bankruptcy three weeks later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s advance
above its average price in the last 200 days and the likelihood
that its shares won&#8217;t fall to lows bode well for U.S. stocks,
said Christopher Verrone at Strategas Research Partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of the most profitable securities firm in Wall
Street history climbed above the 200-day moving average this
month for the first time since March, when it stayed above the
measure until mid-April. Since its 2010 low on July 2, the stock
has risen, making higher peaks and higher valleys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s bullish trend suggests financial stocks may
rebound soon, helping extend the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index&#8217;s
best September and October performance in 12 years, said
Verrone, lead technical analyst at Strategas. Financial shares
ranked second in weightings among the benchmark&#8217;s 10 groups
after technology, and were the only loser in the past six
months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we see the trend starts to improve for bellwethers
in the financial sector like Goldman, it gives you some
confidence that the market is beginning to treat these financial
stocks a little bit better,&#8221; Verrone said in a telephone
interview from his office in New York. &#8220;That&#8217;s a major group
and it&#8217;s important for that group to at least participate if the
rally is going to extend into 2011.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Financials Index tracking 81 companies has
fallen 4.9 percent in the past six months after new regulations
following the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression
require banks to reduce risk taking while concerns grew that the
industry face more losses from bad mortgages. During the same
period, the SP 500 added 4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry-Group Leadership &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman and other financial shares led during the first
year of the bull market. While the SP 500 jumped 69 percent
from a 12-year low on March 9, 2009, Goldman surged 128 percent
and the financials index rallied 145 percent. Since then, the
group has surrendered its leadership and become a drag on the
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are signs that the industry&#8217;s price trend is
improving, Verrone said. The SP 500 financials index yesterday
crossed above its 200-day average after failing to sustain above
that threshold in three attempts since May. Goldman&#8217;s momentum
is picking up, with the 50-day average about 0.6 percent below
its 200-day average, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group &#8220;is at an important inflection point,&#8221; Verrone
said. &#8220;Anything you get from financials, that really helps the
cause even more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

6,092,194, 6,804,780 and 7,058,822. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court, which specializes in U.S. patent law,
sent the case back to determine how much closely held Finjan is
owed for sales that occurred between the March 2008 trial and
the August 2009 ruling in which a judge ordered Secure Computing
to stop selling the infringing software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The jury awarded $9 million in damages. U.S. District Judge
Gregory M. Sleet increased the amount to more than $13.7 million
because the jury found the infringement to be intentional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McAfee, which is being acquired by Intel Corp., has said it
redesigned the software to avoid using Finjan&#8217;s inventions so
the order wouldn&#8217;t affect sales of its products. McAfee is based
in Santa Clara, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Finjan Inc. v. Secure Computing Corp., 2009-
1576 and 2009-1594, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit (Washington). The lower court case is Finjan Software
Ltd. v. Secure Computing Corp., 06cv369, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Patent Patchwork Is Too Costly, Helps U.S., Chinese Rivals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union risks handing a competitive advantage to
the U.S. and China if it fails to change a patent system which
companies, such as Air Liquide SA, say costs too much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s an urgency to find a solution to de-block this
point on competitiveness for our companies,&#8221; Michel Barnier,
the EU&#8217;s internal-market commissioner, said at a conference in
Brussels Nov. 3. &#8220;We won&#8217;t be credible if prices for our
patents in Europe are above those of U.S. patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barnier&#8217;s remarks come a week before ministers from the 27
EU nations gather to discuss a new proposal for a region-wide
patent system. The EU patent, an idea that&#8217;s been discussed for
some 40 years, was thought dead in 2004 after member nations
failed to agree on the language system to go with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, four years after the European Commission revived the
plans, the EU-wide system is closer than ever, according to the
head of Europe&#8217;s patent agency, which acts independently from
the EU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve never been this close to an agreement,&#8221; Benoit
Battistelli, president of the European Patent Office, said in an
interview in Brussels. The Munich-based EPO is the only place
for companies to apply for a multi-national patent, which has to
be defended in each country once it is granted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This fragmented litigation market in Europe for patents
is costing us a lot,&#8221; Thierry Sueur, vice-president of
intellectual property at Air Liquide, the world&#8217;s biggest
producer of industrial gases, said at the event in Brussels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgium, holder of the EU&#8217;s rotating presidency until the
end of the year, foresees a language framework similar to that
of the EPO. Patents would be granted in French and German as
well as English. Spain has opposed plans to exclude Spanish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any political solution should protect linguistic
diversity,&#8221; Alberto Casado Cervino, director general of the
Spanish Patent Office, said at the Brussels event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Liquide&#8217;s Sueur said continued clashes over languages
will hurt European companies like his. &#8220;We have no time for
fancy theories, we&#8217;re fighting hard to win over our competitors
from the other side of the ocean or from China.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Seeks Patent for Virtual IPhone &#8216;Gun&#8217; for Game-Playing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc., maker of the iPad and the iPhone, is seeking a
patent on a technology that will enhance the ability of players
to use their iPhones as game tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to application 20100279768, published yesterday
in the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the
technology covered by the patent would enable players to use
their iPhones as simulated guns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;gun&#8221; attachment would permit players to target
others in a &#8220;real world gaming environment,&#8221; according to the
application. This would be achieved through the use of the
phone&#8217;s sensors, including its global positioning device and
accelerometer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology also may enable the player to guide &#8220;a
virtual ball through a virtual maze or steer a virtual car or
boat through a virtual racetrack,&#8221; Cupertino, California-based
Apple said in its application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple filed the application in April 2009 with assistance
from Boston&#8217;s Fish  Richardson PC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Claims U.K. Restaurant&#8217;s Sign Infringes Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. accused a restaurant in the U.K.&#8217;s Hampshire
region of infringing a trademark for its Relentless energy
drink, the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Relentless Stake  Lobster house in Southsea received a
17-page legal document demanding that the restaurant&#8217;s name be
changes, according to the BBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based beverage company said the restaurant&#8217;s
sign looked too similar to the label used on its energy drink,
the BBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The restaurant owner told the BBC he was &#8220;gobsmacked&#8221; by
the complaint from Coca-Cola and that he named his restaurant
after his father&#8217;s fishing boat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York State Residents Charged With Criminal Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three residents of New York&#8217;s Oneida County were charged
with felony trademark counterfeiting, the Syracuse Post-Standard
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $183,000 worth of merchandise was seized,
including suspected fake North Face clothing, Ugg boots and
Coach, Louis Vuitton and Dolce  Gabbana handbags, according to
the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fake goods were found at the suspects&#8217; homes and at
rental-storage facilities in three New York towns -- Utica,
Schuyler and Westmorland, the newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants, who also were charged with misdemeanor
conspiracy, are required to appear on court next week, according
to the Post-Standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assemblies of God Sues Retailer for Infringing Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The General Council of the Assemblies of God, a Pentecostal
Christian church based in Springfield, Missouri, sued the
proprietors of two Stockton, California, stores for trademark
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Chicago, stems from
the alleged sale of counterfeit versions of emblem patches, t-
shirts and other items bearing the church&#8217;s trademarks. The
church also accuses the defendants of unauthorized use of
Internet domain names that mirror some of its ministry groups,
such as &#8220;Royal Rangers,&#8221; &#8220;Missionettes&#8221; and &#8220;Frontiersman
Camping Fellowship.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants are two separate stores -- Ranger Supply
Store and Valley Homebuyer Services -- and three Stockton
residents the church says are the proprietors. They also are
accused of copyright infringement by copying the text and images
on the church&#8217;s website and using them on unauthorized sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church asked the court to bar defendants&#8217; infringement,
and to order the seizure and destruction of all infringing
materials in their possession, as well as forfeiture or
cancellation of infringing domain names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the church asked for money damages, including
defendants&#8217; profits attributable to their alleged infringement,
and asked that all damages be tripled to punish the defendants
for their actions. The church also requested $3 million for
infringing the domain names, and for awards of attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The church is represented by William T. McGrath, Maureen
Beacom Gorman, and Tiffany D. Gehrke of Chicago&#8217;s Davis McGrath
LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is General Council of the Assemblies of God v.
Ranger Supply Store Inc, 1:10-cv-07050, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle&#8217;s Ellison to Testify Nov. 8 at SAP Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Officer Larry Ellison, who has
said the new head of rival Hewlett-Packard Co. oversaw
&#8220;industrial espionage&#8221; when he was at SAP AG, will testify
Nov. 8 at a trial between Oracle and SAP, a lawyer said in
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geoffrey Howard, an Oracle attorney, told U.S. District
Judge Phyllis Hamilton in Oakland, California, that date is his
best estimate for when he will call Ellison as a witness.
Hamilton asked about high-profile witnesses to make arrangements
for potential media interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellison said in an Oct. 26 statement that Oracle plans to
produce evidence that Hewlett-Packard CEO Leo Apotheker was
involved in an effort to steal Oracle software while at SAP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP says Apotheker had a limited role in the SAP software
maintenance unit where the downloads took place, and claims
Ellison is seeking to harass him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, based in Redwood City, California, the second-
largest maker of software for business applications behind SAP,
sued its competitor in 2007. It seeks at least $2.3 billion in
damages for what a former SAP unit acknowledges were fraudulent
downloads of Oracle software that infringed Oracle copyrights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle Corp. v. SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Copyright Office Targeted in Denial-of-Service Attack &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An anti-copyright group that has targeted content owners
and intellectual property rights enforcement groups since
September, yesterday attacked the U.S. Copyright Office and
managed to disable its website temporarily, the TorrentFreak
website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the denial-of-service attack began at 3 p.m. London
time, the Copyright Office was completely offline for half an
hour and then began to come back up again slowly, according to
TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past targets of the action, performed by a group that calls
itself &#8220;Anonymous,&#8221; included the Motion Picture Association of
American, the Recording Industry Association of America, and the
U.S. Intellectual Property Office, TorrentFreak reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anonymous released a statement saying it attacked the
Copyright Office website because it was &#8220;perpetuating the
system that is allowing the exploitative usage of copyright and
intellectual property,&#8221; according to TorrentFreak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IP Talk &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. Plans to Revamp IP Laws &#8216;for Internet Age,&#8217; Cameron Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. will review its intellectual-property laws with an
eye to updating them to fit &#8220;the Internet Age,&#8221; Prime Minister
David Cameron said in a speech in east London yesterday . &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The founders of Google have said they could never have
started their company in Britain,&#8221; Cameron said. &#8220;The service
they provide depends on taking a snapshot of all the content on
the internet at any one time and they feel our copyright system
is not as friendly to this sort of innovation as it is in the
United States.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron wants eastern London, including the areas around
Old Street, Shoreditch and the Olympic Park, to be developed as
a &#8220;technology city,&#8221; he said. He said that Google Inc.,
Facebook Inc., Intel Corp., McKinsey  Co. and Cisco Systems
Inc. have committed to investing in projects in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron also said more needs to be done to provide funding
to small and mid-sized enterprises setting up in the capital. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. signed a contract
today with state-owned Shanghai Shendi Group Co. to build its
first mainland China theme park, less than a week after the
World Expo drew a record number of visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signing is &#8220;another step forward&#8221; in Disney&#8217;s goal
to open its fourth theme park outside the U.S. after being in
talks with the Shanghai city government &#8220;for quite some
time,&#8221; the Burbank, California-based company said in an e-
mailed statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney won government approval for a theme park last year.
It still needs approval for the venture from &#8220;relevant
government departments,&#8221; the municipal government said in a
statement on its website today. Shendi will work with the
world&#8217;s biggest theme-park operator to construct and operate
the park, according to another government statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a sign that restrictions on construction
projects have been lifted after the Shanghai World Expo and
work on the Disney park will speed up,&#8221; Zhang Chifei, a
Nanjing-based analyst at Huatai Securities Co., said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project may cost 25 billion yuan ($3.8 billion),
state-controlled Xinhua News Agency said today. The park, to be
in Shanghai&#8217;s Pudong district, will have a Magic Kingdom theme
with some elements reflecting regional flavor, Disney said last
November. Disney opened a park in Hong Kong in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Disney nor the government divulged more details
about the arrangement with Shendi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The six-month Expo attracted 73.1 million visitors,
topping the record of 64 million set in Osaka, Japan, in 1970.
It was part of an investment campaign in the city of
19.2 million people that China aims to develop into a global
financial center by 2020. The city government has spent $44
billion on construction and operating costs as well as
infrastructure including airport terminals, new roads and
tunnels and a three-year renovation of The Bund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roadbuilder Shanghai Pudong Road  Bridge Construction Co.
jumped by the 10 percent daily limit to 19.82 yuan in Shanghai
trading today. Property developer Shanghai Lujiazui Finance 
Trade Zone Development Co. gained 10 percent to 21.66 yuan.
Shanghai Construction Co. rose 9 percent to 17.35 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Disney park will be built inside a 20-square-kilometer
area earmarked for tourism development, said the Shanghai
Municipal Tourism Administrative Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Disney project will probably be a new growth engine
for Shanghai and benefit companies that win building
contracts,&#8221; Zhang of Huatai Securities said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its
average 2011 forecast for Brent crude to $91.75 from $84.50 a
barrel, following the U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s announcement of
additional asset purchases, or quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although there has already been a significant currency
and commodity price shift in anticipation of QE2, we believe
there remains a strong likelihood of further dollar weakness,
which will prove supportive to the oil price,&#8221; analysts at
JPMorgan led by Lawrence Eagles in New York said in a note dated
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The price of West Texas Intermediate crude will remain $2 a
barrel below Brent, the analysts said, raising their 2011 WTI
forecast to $89.75 a barrel from $82.50. JPMorgan raised its
fourth-quarter 2010 estimates to $88 a barrel from $83 a barrel
for Brent, and to $86 from $81 for WTI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forecasts for Brent &#8220;implicitly target a spike to $100
over the next six months,&#8221; according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But it is important to remember that OECD economies
remain fragile, and should the oil price spike too high, too
quickly, that could have a circular impact in terms of global
GDP growth and oil demand,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s experimental pill for
rheumatoid arthritis reduced pain and inflammation without
unforeseen side effects in a study that may help the company
supplant injectable drugs with $12 billion in yearly sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The treatment, called tasocitinib, lessened inflammation by
20 percent or more for patients after six months, according to
Saeed Fatenejad, head of late-stage trials in inflammation and
immunology at New York-based Pfizer. While the medicine raised
bad as well as good cholesterol levels during the study, there
was no increase seen in heart attacks or strokes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, is racing three
biotechnology companies to sell the first pill in a decade for
rheumatoid arthritis, which destroys joints in 1.3 million
Americans. The drug may post annual sales of $2 billion, said
Tim Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in San
Francisco. Pfizer plans to complete four more studies in the
first half of next year before seeking U.S. clearance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see the ability, with all of these studies, to get a
very broad label,&#8221; Fatenejad said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;This might be the first drug that is going for the original
filing with everything: signs and symptoms, quality of life, X-
ray data, and then really looking at the various types where the
drug could be used.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s most recent finding, in the last of three phrases
of research usually needed for U.S. marketing approval, will be
reported Nov. 10 at the American College of Rheumatology meeting
in Atlanta. Revenue from tasocitinib may help offset Pfizer
losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol pill, with $11.4
billion in annual sales, faces competition next year from
cheaper copies in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Leaders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rheumatoid arthritis market is dominated by three
injectable drugs known as anti-TNF treatments, which cost as
much as $20,000 a year and leave patients susceptible to
infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes Enbrel, which Pfizer gained in last year&#8217;s
$68 billion purchase of Wyeth, and is co-marketed with Thousand
Oaks, California-based Amgen. The other two are Humira, sold by
Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories, and Remicade,
sold by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson  Johnson and
Merck  Co., of Whitehouse Station, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasocitinib is the most advanced pill in a family of
experimental treatments targeting a protein called JAK that
leads to joint destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Drug Works&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now we know the drug works, and we know the drug works as
a monotherapy, by itself,&#8221; said Roy Fleischmann, the study&#8217;s
lead investigator and professor of internal medicine at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We also have a pretty good handle on the
safety profile, which has been consistent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasocitinib raised levels of LDL, often called bad
cholesterol because it is linked to heart disease, and increased
HDL, or good cholesterol, which lessens heart disease. The ratio
between the two, a measure used by some heart doctors to gauge
risk of disease, was unchanged. The elevation occurred early in
the course of treatment and didn&#8217;t increase over time, making it
easier to treat if necessary, Fleischmann said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the mid-point point in the study, the drug didn&#8217;t reach
one of its three goals, to increase a measure of disease
remission; the results were numerically positive, though not
statistically significant, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Pfizer study, 25 of 611 patients, or 4.1 percent,
reported serious adverse events during the six months. Among
them, 6 patients had serious infections. That&#8217;s &#8220;probably a
little bit better&#8221; than the anti-TNF drugs, though doctors and
patients would need to be vigilant, Fleischmann said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adverse Events &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 79-year-old woman with a history of heart disease and
diabetes died after developing diarrhea followed by renal
failure, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if tasocitinib isn&#8217;t safer or more effective than
anti-TNF treatments in next year&#8217;s head-to-head tests, similar
results may help the pill win patients who don&#8217;t want regular
injections or are among the 20 percent to 40 percent who don&#8217;t
respond to anti-TNF drugs, Fatenejad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three biotechnology companies developing JAK drugs are:
South San Francisco, California-based Rigel Pharmaceuticals
Inc., Incyte Corp. of Wilmington, Delaware, and Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pfizer&#8217;s pill is
the only one with results from the third and final stage of
tests generally needed for U.S. approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow to Adopt &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors may be slow to adopt new JAK drugs for patients who
are getting relief from older treatments, said David Pisetsky,
professor of rheumatology and immunology at Duke University
School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While high levels of bad cholesterol linked to tasocitinib
may be treatable, physicians may resist adding a drug to
patients&#8217; daily treatment regimens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because it&#8217;s a new mode of action, there&#8217;s great
interest, but what&#8217;s going to happen in terms of efficacy and
safety when you really put it out there?&#8221; Pisetsky said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s always a difference between what
happens in a trial setting and what happens in real life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

very broad label,&#8221; Fatenejad said in a telephone interview.
&#8220;This might be the first drug that is going for the original
filing with everything: signs and symptoms, quality of life, X-
ray data, and then really looking at the various types where the
drug could be used.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares declined 13 cents to $17.05 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has increased
less than a percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offset Lipitor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s most recent finding, in the last of three phrases
of research usually needed for U.S. marketing approval, will be
reported Nov. 10 at the American College of Rheumatology meeting
in Atlanta. Revenue from tasocitinib may help offset Pfizer
losses when its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol pill, with $11.4
billion in annual sales, faces competition next year from
cheaper copies in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rheumatoid arthritis market is dominated by three
injectable drugs known as anti-TNF treatments, which cost as
much as $20,000 a year and leave patients susceptible to
infections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This includes Enbrel, which Pfizer gained in last year&#8217;s
$68 billion purchase of Wyeth, and is co-marketed with Thousand
Oaks, California-based Amgen. The other two are Humira, sold by
Abbott Park, Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories, and Remicade,
sold by New Brunswick, New Jersey-based Johnson  Johnson and
Merck  Co., of Whitehouse Station, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasocitinib is the most advanced pill in a family of
experimental treatments targeting a protein called JAK that
leads to joint destruction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Drug Works&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now we know the drug works, and we know the drug works as
a monotherapy, by itself,&#8221; said Roy Fleischmann, the study&#8217;s
lead investigator and professor of internal medicine at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, in a
telephone interview. &#8220;We also have a pretty good handle on the
safety profile, which has been consistent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasocitinib raised levels of LDL, often called bad
cholesterol because it is linked to heart disease, and increased
HDL, or good cholesterol, which lessens heart disease. The ratio
between the two, a measure used by some heart doctors to gauge
risk of disease, was unchanged. The elevation occurred early in
the course of treatment and didn&#8217;t increase over time, making it
easier to treat if necessary, Fleischmann said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the mid-point point in the study, the drug didn&#8217;t reach
one of its three goals, to increase a measure of disease
remission; the results were numerically positive, though not
statistically significant, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Too Early&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There needs to be some X-Ray data to look at the joints
and to show that the disease does not progress when you have
patients on the drug,&#8221; said Tony Butler, an analyst at Barclays
Capital in New York, in a telephone interview. The study is
&#8220;encouraging,&#8221; though &#8220;it&#8217;s far too early&#8221; to predict the
drug&#8217;s sales potential, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Pfizer study, 25 of 611 patients, or 4.1 percent,
reported serious adverse events during the six months. Among
them, 6 patients had serious infections. That&#8217;s &#8220;probably a
little bit better&#8221; than the anti-TNF drugs, though doctors and
patients would need to be vigilant, Fleischmann said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 79-year-old woman with a history of heart disease and
diabetes died after developing diarrhea followed by renal
failure, according to the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if tasocitinib isn&#8217;t safer or more effective than
anti-TNF treatments in next year&#8217;s head-to-head tests, similar
results may help the pill win patients who don&#8217;t want regular
injections or are among the 20 percent to 40 percent who don&#8217;t
respond to anti-TNF drugs, Fatenejad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Lead &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three biotechnology companies developing JAK drugs are:
South San Francisco, California-based Rigel Pharmaceuticals
Inc., Incyte Corp. of Wilmington, Delaware, and Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pfizer&#8217;s pill is
the only one with results from the third and final stage of
tests generally needed for U.S. approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors may be slow to adopt new JAK drugs for patients who
are getting relief from older treatments, said David Pisetsky,
professor of rheumatology and immunology at Duke University
School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While high levels of bad cholesterol linked to tasocitinib
may be treatable, physicians may resist adding a drug to
patients&#8217; daily treatment regimens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because it&#8217;s a new mode of action, there&#8217;s great
interest, but what&#8217;s going to happen in terms of efficacy and
safety when you really put it out there?&#8221; Pisetsky said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;There&#8217;s always a difference between what
happens in a trial setting and what happens in real life.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian President-elect Dilma Rousseff may spark a stock rally by making &#8220;market-friendly&#8221;
Cabinet picks that indicate &#8220;fiscal rigor,&#8221; Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Bovespa index may climb to 78,000 by yearend,
a 7.4 percent advance from its close last week, should
ministerial appointments signal the government will achieve
primary surpluses of 3.3 percent of gross domestic product,
Stephen Graham, an analyst at Goldman Sachs in Sao Paulo, wrote
in a note to clients dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The target implies containment of inflation expectations,
and so less need for monetary policy to shoulder the burden of
inflation control,&#8221; Graham said. &#8220;Despite the variety of
possibilities, we think a market-friendly cabinet is likely.
There have been unusually clear comments by Rousseff on specific
fiscal targets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rousseff, who takes office Jan. 1, said last week she will
seek to cut net public debt to 38 percent of GDP by the end of
her four-year term from 41 percent to allow Brazil&#8217;s benchmark
interest rate to decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the other hand, failure to move on the fiscal front
could increase the tension mounting between FX rates, interest
rates, and inflation, where solutions for any one problem
exacerbate others,&#8221; Graham wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa was little changed at 72,599.85 at 2:15 p.m.
New York time. Brazilian short-term interest-rate yields
declined today for the first time in a week on speculation
Rousseff will pressure the central bank to lower borrowing costs
next year, while longer-maturity contracts jumped on concern
policy makers will be forced to raise rates later to curb
inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on the contract due January 2012 dropped 5 basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 11.42 percent, while the
yield on the contract due January 2017 jumped 14 basis points to
11.86 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gartmore Group Ltd., the U.K. money
manager that first sold shares in December, fell the most in
seven months in London after the firm said it&#8217;s weighing a sale
or merger, and fund manager Roger Guy said he will retire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to consider its
options, London-based Gartmore said today in a statement. Guy,
44, who manages 17 percent of Gartmore&#8217;s assets, will retire
from &#8220;day-to-day&#8221; fund management at the end of the year. The
shares dropped 15 percent to 107 pence at the close in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gartmore has declined 51 percent since it first traded on
Dec. 14 after losing key fund managers. In March, the firm
suspended Guillaume Rambourg, who once ran a third of Gartmore&#8217;s
assets with Guy, for breaking internal rules, while Gervais
Williams, who ran its growth opportunities fund, stepped down
six months later. Chief Investment Officer Dominic Rossi is
leaving to join Fidelity International Ltd. as global chief
investment officer equities, Fidelity said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re obviously not on the strongest of negotiating
terms&#8221; in sale or merger talks, said Sarah Ing, a London-based
analyst at Singer Capital Markets Ltd. &#8220;They still do have good
quality fund managers so the key thing is to keep them so they
will have a business to sell.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and its partners
plan to build four artificial islands in the Upper Zakum oil
field off Abu Dhabi that could result in cost savings of several
billion dollars, an Exxon executive said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction and use of the islands may allow for the
removal of almost 100 wellhead towers in the sea and may save
the project more than $1 billion and less than $15 billion, said
Morten Mauritzen, president of Exxon Mobil Abu Dhabi Offshore
Petroleum Co. Mauritzen was speaking at an event in Abu Dhabi,
the capital of the United Arab Emirates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost savings would come over the 25 years remaining for
commercial production at Upper Zakum, where Zakum Development
Co. project, known also as Zadco, is pumping crude. State-run
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc, has a 60 percent stake in
Zadco, with Exxon Mobil holding 28 percent and Japan Oil, a unit
of Inpex Corp., owning the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zadco plans a $15 billion artificial islands project to
boost production at the field by about 40 percent to 750,000
barrels a day. Building islands is cheaper than erecting
offshore production platforms, Salah Al-Bufalah, Zadco&#8217;s
major projects manager, said last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leveraged buyout speculation is
triggering an &#8220;unrealistic&#8221; surge in the cost of hedging
against losses on the debt of potential takeover targets,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors can profit by selling credit-default swaps on a
basket of LBO candidates including Gap Inc., Dell Inc. and 13
other companies, strategists led by Charles Himmelberg and
Alberto Gallo in New York said in a report. The trade can
withstand two buyouts within the group, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While a pick-up in LBO deals is definitely likely in
2011, we show that market spreads on many &#8216;LBO candidates&#8217; are
currently priced for a very sharp increase comparable to 2006
levels,&#8221; the strategists wrote. &#8220;These expectations are
unrealistic, given the current constraints in leveraged
financing and the lower leverage in current deals, compared to
pre-crisis. We therefore think investors who have been short LBO
candidates should take profits to avoid being hurt by the
upcoming rally in spreads.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of default swaps has surged on speculation
companies might get taken over by private equity firms, which
typically use debt to finance their transactions, hurting
current bond investors, Goldman said. The market is pricing in
an average 17 percent probability that buyouts of the 15
candidates will succeed, which is &#8220;extremely high&#8221; by
historical standards, the strategists wrote. That makes the cost
to buyers of credit protection &#8220;hefty,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBOs Accelerate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBOs have been accelerating with deal volume reaching $120
billion this year, compared with $135 billion in 2008 and 2009
combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A record $1.3
trillion of deals were done in the so-called buyout boom of 2006
and 2007. Private-equity firms pool money from investors and
obtain debt to finance takeovers with the intention of selling
the companies later for a profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell five-year credit-default swap
protection on the 15 companies, according to the report. The
other candidates are Seagate Technology Plc, J.C. Penney Co.,
Hasbro Inc., Jones Group Inc., Fortune Brands Inc., Avnet Inc.,
Arrow Electronics Inc., Expedia Inc., Sara Lee Corp.,
AmerisourceBergen Corp., ConAgra Foods Inc., McKesson Corp. and
Cardinal Health Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to
meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. defended
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke&#8217;s decision to pump
money into the U.S. economy after officials in Germany, China
and Brazil criticized the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move will spur gross domestic product growth and reduce
the risk of deflation, Jan Hatzius, the New York-based chief
U.S. economist at the company, wrote in an e-mail to clients.
Because the Fed&#8217;s target for overnight loans between banks is
near zero, the central bank is doing &#8220;the next best thing,&#8221;
according to Goldman, one of the 18 primary dealers that are
authorized to trade directly with the central bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The widespread hostility to the Fed&#8217;s actions is
misplaced,&#8221; Hatzius wrote. &#8220;Downside risks to the economic
outlook have declined significantly. U.S. inflation is unlikely
to become a problem for years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bernanke on Nov. 6 defended the central bank&#8217;s decision
last week to buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries and
said he dismissed the idea that it will increase prices to
higher levels than policy makers prefer. German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said Nov. 5 in Berlin that the Fed&#8217;s move was
&#8220;clueless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have rejected any notion that we are going to raise
inflation to a super-normal level in order to have effects on
the economy,&#8221; Bernanke said in a panel discussion at a Fed
conference in Jekyll Island, Georgia. &#8220;It&#8217;s critical for us to
maintain inflation at an appropriate level.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Risks for Everyone&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schaeuble said the Fed&#8217;s decision won&#8217;t revive growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s our problem as well if the U.S. is no longer certain
that the old recipes don&#8217;t work anymore,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t
have the least reason for schadenfreude. We only have reason to
be worried.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s central bank president, Henrique Meirelles, said
&#8220;excess liquidity&#8221; in the U.S. economy is creating &#8220;risks for
everyone.&#8221; In China, Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said
&#8220;many countries are worried about the impact of the policy on
their economies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Board Governor Kevin Warsh today conceded that further
bond purchases risk distorting markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Fed&#8217;s increased presence in the market for long-term
Treasury securities poses nontrivial risks that bear watching,&#8221;
said Warsh, who voted for more stimulus last week, in an opinion
piece in the Wall Street Journal. &#8220;As the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet
expands, it becomes more of a price maker than a price taker,&#8221;
and if investors doubt the values set for the securities, &#8220;risk
premiums across asset classes&#8221; could shift unexpectedly around
the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation Concerns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E. Gerald Corrigan, former Fed Bank of New York president,
said at the Georgia conference that he&#8217;s concerned the central
bank&#8217;s efforts risks causing price increases that are out of the
Fed&#8217;s control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even in the face of substantial margins of
underutilization of human and capital resources, efforts to
achieve an upward nudge in today&#8217;s very low inflation rate make
me somewhat uncomfortable,&#8221; Corrigan, chairman of Goldman&#8217;s
bank subsidiary, said in prepared remarks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices over the life of the securities, widened to
2.13 percentage points from this year&#8217;s low of 1.47 percentage
points set in August. The five-year average is 2.10 percentage
points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Next Best Thing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed can&#8217;t cut its benchmark interest rate any further
after reducing it to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December
2008, Hatzius wrote in his e-mail, which he distributed
yesterday in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields have declined about 18 basis points since
Sept. 20, the day before the Fed announced it was prepared to
provide additional support to the economy. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point. Two-year yields fell to 0.3118 percent on Nov.
4 and five-year rates declined to 1.0148 percent, both record
lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are doing the next best thing, aiming to lower the
bond term premium via purchases of longer-term securities,&#8221;
Hatzius wrote. The strategy is known as quantitative easing
because it targets the quantity of money in the economy. Traders
have dubbed it &#8220;QE2&#8221; because the Fed also tried it last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We also disagree with the criticism that the Fed is
&#8216;flooding the world with money,&#8217;&#8221; Hatzius wrote. One risk of
the decision is that it will boost currencies outside the U.S.,
he said, which makes the goods of exporting nations more
expensive for their customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divergence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;But that is always true when regional cycles diverge, and
it has little to do with QE2 per se.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between two- and 10-year yields was 2.16
percentage points, versus the five-year average of 1.28
percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields, a benchmark for consumer and company
borrowing costs, rose one basis point today to 2.538 percent as
of 11:49 a.m. in London, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield on the two-year Treasury was unchanged at
0.367 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Burry, the former hedge-fund manager who predicted
the housing market&#8217;s plunge, said Bernanke is trying to use
&#8220;poison as the cure&#8221; by pumping more cash into the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempt to bolster growth is reminiscent of Alan Greenspan&#8217;s actions to revive the economy after 2001, Burry said
in comments published last week from a telephone interview. The
former Fed chairman helped create an unsustainable boom in U.S.
property prices with his policies, leading to the worst global
financial crisis since the Great Depression, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius said the outlook has improved from a month ago,
when he said the U.S. economy faced two main scenarios, neither
of them good: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A fairly bad one in which the economy grows at a 1 1/2
percent to 2 percent rate through the middle of next year and
the unemployment rate rises moderately to 10 percent, and a very
bad one in which the economy returns to an outright recession,&#8221;
he wrote to clients on Oct 6. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sent a letter of support for Oleg Deripaska&#8217;s efforts to
obtain a multiple-entry U.S. visa after the billionaire was
denied direct access to the world&#8217;s largest economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;persistent state of limbo&#8221; of Deripaska&#8217;s legal
status in the U.S. &#8220;has become an impediment to the promotion
of mutually advantageous contacts between the business
communities of the two countries,&#8221; Lavrov said in a letter to
the Endeavor Group, the lobbying firm Deripaska hired to help
with his visa, according to according to a regulatory filing on
the U.S. Department of Justice&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deripaska&#8217;s Basic Element holding company, the main
shareholder of aluminum producer United Co. Rusal, paid Endeavor
Group $212,694.10 in the six months through May 2009 to help
with his visa application, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergey Babichenko, a spokesman for Basic Element, declined
to comment on Deripaska&#8217;s visa status in the U.S., saying by
phone today only that the company purchased some consulting
services from Endeavor. The Vedomosti newspaper cited an
unidentified representative for Deripaska as saying the
billionaire doesn&#8217;t plan to visit America anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. revoked the visa without explanation in 2006,
according to an August 2007 filing by Magna International Corp.,
the Canadian auto-parts maker that Deripaska owned a stake in at
the time. The Wall Street Journal last year cited unidentified
people as saying that the visa problem was connected to
allegations that Deripaska had links to organized crime, which
the businessman has repeatedly denied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Russian side has raised this issue with various U.S.
officials on numerous occasions, including in the course of
bilateral discussions with both the White House and the State
Department&#8221; without success, Lavrov said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised its
forecasts for the euro against the dollar, citing the &#8220;very low
probability&#8221; of default by one of the region&#8217;s nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The single European currency will end the year at $1.40 and
strengthen to $1.45 by the second quarter next year and $1.48 in
the third quarter, John Normand, head of global foreign-exchange
strategy, wrote in a research report dated Nov. 5. All forecasts
were previously for $1.30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Financing is almost guaranteed for countries that propose
and deliver meaningful fiscal tightening and European Monetary
Union break-up is more unlikely than it was six months ago,&#8221;
Normand wrote. &#8220;Interim events,&#8221; such as the possibility of
failed auctions and slow disbursement of bailout funds, are
likely to be &#8220;a constraint on the euro&#8217;s rise rather than the
trigger for reversal,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro was 0.6 percent weaker at $1.3954 as of 8:29 a.m.
in London. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co., the two biggest U.S. banks by assets, racked up
perfect trading records for the second time this year, making
money every day last quarter after accomplishing the same feat
in the first three months of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traders at Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
made more than $25 million on more than 55 days during the third
quarter, the bank said in a Nov. 5 regulatory filing. New York-
based JPMorgan, which doesn&#8217;t break out its results by quarter,
made more than $200 million on 12 days in the first nine months
and lost money on only eight, the company said today in a
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which makes the most revenue on
Wall Street trading stocks and bonds, had losses in that
business on two days in the third quarter while Morgan Stanley
reported 10 losing days. Citigroup Inc. also had two
unprofitable trading days in the period, a person briefed on the
matter said. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup had perfect trading
results during the first quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower volatility and improving credit markets helped Wall
Street&#8217;s trading last quarter, said Jim Mitchell, a senior vice
president at Buckingham Research Group in New York. &#8220;If you
don&#8217;t have a lot of volatility and markets are generally
positive, you don&#8217;t tend to have a lot of trading losses,&#8221;
Mitchell said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tudor Pickering Holt  Co. hired
alumni from Citadel Investment Group LLC and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to start a hedge fund focused on energy companies, the
Houston-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Chambers, 41, former global sector head of energy and
utility equities at Citadel, and Walker Moody, 31, previously in
the investment management division at Goldman Sachs, have joined
TPH Asset Management LLC, the new hedge fund unit of Tudor
Pickering Holt, an energy investment and merchant banker, the
company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re bringing very much a bottom-up stock-picking
approach to the business,&#8221; said Dan Pickering, 44, co-president
and head of research at Tudor Pickering, in an interview. &#8220;This
is not a fund that&#8217;s going to need oil to go to $120 to make
money. We&#8217;re going to find stocks that will perform in a good
environment or a bad environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chambers was brought on as portfolio manager and Moody as
head of asset management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pickering started Pickering Energy Partners in 2004 and
merged in 2007 with Tudor Capital, founded by Bob Tudor, 50, a
former Goldman Sachs partner who now serves as chief executive
officer of Tudor Pickering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund is slated to begin trading in February, said
Pickering, who has invested $3 million of his own money. He
declined to say how much capital the company has raised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The industry norm is that critical mass for a hedge fund
or a fund complex today feels like it&#8217;s at least $100 million,&#8221;
Pickering said. &#8220;We would hope to be at critical mass at our
launch or shortly thereafter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. oil company, agreed to buy Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2
billion, giving it access to the natural gas-rich Marcellus
Shale formation in Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders will get $38.25 in cash plus units of an Atlas
pipeline affiliate, for a total of $43.34 a share, a 37 percent
premium to yesterday&#8217;s closing price, Atlas said in a statement
today. The company, based in Moon Township, Pennsylvania, had
its largest one-day share gain since it began trading in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal is worth $4.3 billion including assumed debt, the
companies said. If completed, the purchase would be the third-
largest for San Ramon, California-based Chevron and its biggest
since the 2005 acquisition of Unocal Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atlas &#8220;has one of the premier acreage positions in the
prolific Marcellus,&#8221; George L. Kirkland, Chevron vice chairman,
said in a statement. &#8220;The high quality resource, competitive
cost structure in the Marcellus, strong growth potential of the
asset base and its proximity to premier natural-gas markets make
this targeted acquisition a compelling investment for Chevron.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Marcellus Shale stretches from Pennsylvania into New
York, West Virginia and Ohio and may hold 262 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas, making it the largest known U.S. gas field,
according to Energy Department estimates. Marcellus gas has
averaged 11 percent more than the benchmark price over the past
year, because wells are closer to East Coast population centers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable Wall Street firm, will lend $25 million to a
nonprofit community-development organization to finance 16
charter schools in New York City and New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonprofit group, Local Initiatives Support Corp., will
make the money available to the school operators during the next
two years, Goldman Sachs and LISC, both based in New York, said
today in a statement. The chairman of LISC, according to the
group&#8217;s website, is Robert E. Rubin, former U.S. Treasury
secretary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charter schools are nonsectarian, public institutions that
operate independently of local boards of education in the U.S.
under special charters. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Urban Investment Group
has committed about $150 million for charter schools in New York
and New Jersey, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By funding this facility, Goldman Sachs ensures that
thousands of low-income children will have access to innovative
local schools that also help revitalize blighted
neighborhoods,&#8221; Michael Rubinger, president and chief executive
officer of LISC, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financing may allow the charter schools involved to
obtain as much as $100 million in additional capital, according
to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LISC raises money to support community organizations that
work to revitalize urban and rural areas. The organization gives
grants, invests money, and underwrites loans to low-income
communities, and has provided $127 million in financing to 130
schools in the U.S. since 1997, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Natixis
SA settled a London lawsuit over terminated credit-default swaps
that might have been worth as much as $530 million after a delay
in the trial that was to begin today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs and Natixis are pleased they&#8217;ve reached a
commercial settlement,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s lawyer, Anthony Grabiner,
said in court. The terms are confidential and Grabiner said
neither side would make any further public statements on the
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank&#8217;s London unit, Goldman Sachs International,
sued Natixis in July to stop the termination of three credit-
default swaps. Natixis, a unit of BPCE SA, France&#8217;s second-
largest lender by branches, said in July it would terminate the
swaps because Goldman didn&#8217;t comply with the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French investment bank countersued in September,
seeking a ruling it ended the deal lawfully, as well as breach
of contract damages. Natixis said it was &#8220;ready willing and
able&#8221; to pay Goldman $198.4 million on the &#8220;lawfully and
validly terminated&#8221; credit-default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the most profitable firm in Wall Street history,
disputed Natixis&#8217;s calculation in court papers. Judge Elizabeth Gloster of the High Court of Justice agreed to a request to
postpone the start of the trial to allow for settlement talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is among dozens in the London courts over
structured products which fell in value during the financial
crisis. Banks including Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., and
UBS AG are involved in U.K. suits to end contracts or force
counterparties to pay because of losses tied to the declining
economy. The settlement stems from the first lawsuit Goldman has
filed in London in more than a year, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swap deal between the banks included the three credit-
default swaps, and three corresponding swaps to offload the risk
between the French bank and a special-purpose vehicle
established by a bond insurer. When the insurer restructured in
2009, it left Natixis with the risk of the notes defaulting, the
bank said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman said Natixis knew it &#8220;was at all times so exposed,
and remains exposed, under the credit derivative transactions,&#8221;
according to a court filing. It isn&#8217;t &#8220;entitled to hold GSI
accountable for Natixis&#8217; failure, by its own inaction and
instructions, to achieve what it might have wanted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natixis argued in court papers that Goldman didn&#8217;t tell it
&#8220;as soon as practicable&#8221; that the trustee for the securities
determined in April the deal was in default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs International v. Natixis, case
no. 10-880, High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division
(London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.K. may need two inflation-
linked bond markets as the government considers shifting
pension-fund indexing to another measure of price growth from
its existing benchmark, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Debt Management Office should develop an inflation-
protected bond market pegged to the consumer-price index, or
CPI, once a decision is made by Prime Minister David Cameron&#8217;s
government to proceed, said Kari Hallgrimsson, head of European
inflation trading at JPMorgan in London. The existing retail-
price indexed market should be also be maintained, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs for investors to protect themselves against
mismatched inflation liabilities risk becoming &#8220;very
expensive&#8221; should the debt agency keep issuing bonds, sometimes
called linkers, tied just to the retail price index, or RPI,
Hallgrimsson said. Unlike RPI, the CPI excludes items such as
local taxes and mortgage costs in its calculation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the Debt Management Office chooses not to issue CPI
linkers, it would cause massive volatility in inflation markets,
which in turn could dramatically increase the volatility of
liabilities,&#8221; he said in an interview. &#8220;We see this shift as a
potential game changer. It&#8217;s perfectly possible for the U.K. to
have two inflation markets that complement one another.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. inflation-linked securities are all based on RPI. In
August, the coalition government said it will align state
benefits and public-service pensions to CPI, which was lower
than RPI on average for the past 20 years, and may ask some
private pensions to do the same. Hallgrimsson estimates private
pension liabilities at 1 trillion pounds ($1.6 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100 Million Pounds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for index-linked bonds may pick up as inflation has
stayed above the Bank of England&#8217;s upper limit of 3 percent for
seven months. Consumer prices, which anchor the central bank&#8217;s
target, rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallgrimsson estimates that a pension fund with 10 billion
pounds of CPI-linked liabilities may have to pay 100 million
pounds a year to buy hedging if RPI is one percentage point
below market expectations while CPI remains in line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the fund is forced to hedge in a relatively small CPI
market, which reflects a structural demand-supply imbalance,&#8221;
hedging could end up costing even more, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robert Stheeman, who heads the DMO, repeated last month
that the agency will wait for clarity on the government&#8217;s plans
before asking investors whether CPI-linked bonds are needed. He
said on Sept. 7 that the debt agency is &#8220;keen&#8221; to avoid
fragmentation from issuing too many different products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French Example &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When investors buy inflation-protected bonds, they receive
so-called real yields, which tend to be lower than those of
nominal bonds. The advantage of index-linked bonds is that their
principal increases with inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France is the only country that has two index-linked bonds.
It first issued bonds linked to domestic inflation in 1998,
before selling securities indexed to euro-region CPI in 2001.
Agence France Tresor maintains liquidity in both markets, which
each having outstanding debt of about 70 billion euros. Some
other nations waited until the euro&#8217;s introduction in 1999
before selling linkers, using the regional measure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallgrimsson said he expects the government to settle on
changes next year. The Department of Work and Pensions finished
a consultation with the pension industry on Nov. 3, and the
result will be published in spring, a press officer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquidity &#8216;Misconception&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hallgrimsson said the size of U.K. private pension
liabilities means there will be enough demand for two linker
securities. About 30 percent of those liabilities, or around 300
billion pounds, will already be in a situation where they need
to shift to CPI, he estimates. Hallgrimsson said the exact scale
of demand for CPI-linked bonds is difficult to gauge given that
pension plans&#8217; rules on inflation linkage vary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is a misconception that CPI issuance would undermine
the RPI liquidity,&#8221; he said. Investors may seek to arbitrage
between the two measures, increasing trading volume, he said.
&#8220;Liquidity in one market may compliment the other.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.K. index-linked bonds returned 6.6 percent this year,
compared with a gain of 10.1 percent from their U.S.
counterparts, according to data compiled by Bank of America&#8217;s
Merrill Lynch unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 10-year breakeven rate, a gauge of market expectations
of price growth derived from the yield gap between index-linked
and nominal bonds, has risen to 2.86 percentage points from 2.69
percentage points at the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain became the first industrialized nation to issue
index-linked securities in 1981. The bonds account for around 22
percent of the total gilts outstanding as of the end of
September, according to data from the DMO website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron&#8217;s government may save money with the pension shift
as CPI has shown inflation to be an average 0.7 percentage point
lower than RPI over the past 20 years, according to JPMorgan&#8217;s
own analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan starts trading U.K. CPI inflation swaps in August.
U.K. consumer price inflation, the Bank of England&#8217;s official
gauge, remained at 3.1 percent in September, compared with the
central bank&#8217;s 2 percent target. The retail price growth in the
same month was 4.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Natixis
SA are in settlement talks to resolve a lawsuit over the
termination of credit-default swaps that was scheduled to go to
trial today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Elizabeth Gloster of the High Court of Justice in
London agreed to postpone the start of trial until 2 p.m. today
after Anthony Grabiner, a lawyer for Goldman Sachs, said the
parties were likely to resolve the dispute &#8220;around lunchtime.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank&#8217;s London unit, Goldman Sachs International,
sued Natixis in July to stop the termination of three credit-
default swaps with a potential value of around $530 million.
Natixis, a unit of BPCE SA, France&#8217;s second-largest lender by
branches, said in July it would terminate the swaps because
Goldman didn&#8217;t comply with the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natixis countersued in September, seeking a declaration it
ended the deal lawfully, as well as breach of contract damages.
New York-based Goldman didn&#8217;t tell Natixis &#8220;as soon as
practicable&#8221; that the trustee for the securities determined in
April the deal was in default, Natixis said. Goldman didn&#8217;t
follow directions given by Natixis or provide information, the
French bank said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natixis &#8220;remains, ready, willing and able to pay to GSI
the sum of $198,351,893.24 which is due to GSI,&#8221; the French
bank said. &#8220;The credit-default swaps were lawfully and validly
terminated.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the most profitable firm in Wall Street history,
disputed Natixis&#8217;s calculation in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dozens of Cases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is among dozens in the London courts over products
which fell in value during the financial crisis. Banks including
Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp., and UBS AG are involved in
U.K. suits to end contracts or force counterparties to pay
because of losses tied to the declining economy. The trial stems
from the first lawsuit Goldman has filed in London in more than
a year, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Natixis was aware, by its own admission, of the
possibility of an event of default in respect of some of the
notes,&#8221; Goldman said in a court filing. It isn&#8217;t &#8220;entitled to
hold GSI accountable for Natixis&#8217; failure, by its own inaction
and instructions, to achieve what it might have wanted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The swap deal between the banks included the three credit-
default swaps, and three corresponding swaps to offload the risk
between the French bank and a special-purpose vehicle
established by a bond insurer. When the insurer restructured in
2009, it left Natixis with the risk of the notes defaulting, the
bank said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokeswoman Sophie Bullock declined to comment. An
e-mail to Natixis&#8217;s press office didn&#8217;t receive an immediate
response after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs International v. Natixis, case

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the bank
that makes the most revenue trading stocks and bonds, lost money
in that business on two days in the third quarter and made more
than $100 million on seven days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Losses on Goldman Sachs&#8217;s trading desks were between $25
million and zero on two days during the period that ended on
Sept. 30, according to a filing today by the New York-based
company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The
firm&#8217;s traders made between $75 million and $100 million on 24
days, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading revenue at eight of the biggest Wall Street firms
declined an average 12 percent through September from the same
period a year ago, according to a Bloomberg analysis of company
filings. Goldman Sachs, which generated 69 percent of its
revenue this year from trading, blamed a 36 percent decline in
third-quarter trading revenue on reduced client activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 66 trading days in the quarter, Goldman Sachs
traders made money on 64 days, the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates will require
Canadian visitors to apply for visas after an aviation dispute
between the two countries over landing rights for commercial
flights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new regulations will go into effect on Jan. 2, the
U.A.E. Embassy in Ottawa said in a statement on its website,
without providing any details. Currently, Canadians don&#8217;t
require visas to enter the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.A.E. carriers including Emirates have been seeking dozens
of new landing slots in Canada, contending that the six weekly
flights currently allowed are not enough to meet demand.
Transport Canada, the government agency that oversees the
airline industry, and Air Canada opposed granting more slots on
concerns that U.A.E. carriers may eat into Air Canada&#8217;s traffic
to cities such as Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. is the largest trade partner with Canada in the
Middle East and North Africa, with more than $1.5 billion of
business in 2008, according to U.A.E. government figures. As
many as 27,000 Canadians live in the U.A.E. today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada&#8217;s Department of Foreign Affairs and International
Trade said on Oct. 12 that Canadian troops based in the U.A.E.
will be relocated. Camp Mirage, a military logistics camp near
Dubai, serves as a jump-off point for Canadian forces in
Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Waterloo, Canada-based Research In Motion Ltd.
averted a ban on its BlackBerry smartphone in the U.A.E., after
the country&#8217;s phone regulator said the company&#8217;s messaging
services now comply with local security regulations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mail.ru Group Ltd., the Russian

public offering reached $1 billion after organizers of the sale
exercised their over-allotment option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mail.ru sold banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Morgan Stanley bought 3.3 million depositary receipts at $27.70
each, the Moscow-based company said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trial of former Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. computer programmer Sergey Aleynikov should be held
partly behind closed doors because the U.S. says he may disclose
the firm&#8217;s trade secrets &#8220;in great detail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested in July 2009 and indicted Feb. 11 in
what a prosecutor said was the &#8220;most substantial&#8221; theft that
New York-based Goldman Sachs could recall. The trial is
scheduled to begin Nov. 29 before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In court filings, Aleynikov said he will argue that the
material he is accused of stealing isn&#8217;t a trade secret. He also
said he will discuss &#8220;either in cross-examination or in a
defense case, the way in which the allegedly stolen components
interacted with the rest of Goldman Sach&#8217;s high-frequency
trading system.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said in a court filing today that they may seek
to show the trial jury how those components work together, which
would require a sealed courtroom to protect trade secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A closed courtroom is warranted under the Economic
Espionage Act, which insures victims of such crimes aren&#8217;t &#8220;re-
victimized&#8221; at a trial by public disclosure of their trade
secrets, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Open Source&#8217; Code &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who worked as a programmer at Goldman Sachs from
May 2007 through June of 2009, is accused of copying hundreds of
thousands of lines of computer source code related to the firm&#8217;s
high-frequency trading business on his last day of work.
Aleynikov told federal investigators that he intended only to
copy &#8220;open source&#8221; code not owned by Goldman Sachs, according
to the prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S., in its filing today, asked Cote to allow evidence
of other &#8220;bad acts&#8221; by Aleynikov that weren&#8217;t charged in the
indictment, including an allegation he obtained a proprietary
code without authorization from his previous employer, IDT Corp.
Investigators found the code on at least two files on his laptop
computer after his arrest, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov also served as the president and principal of
&#8220;Fortune-wheel.com,&#8221; a company that was sued for violating the
intellectual property rights of the &#8220;Wheel of Fortune&#8221;
television show, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wheel of Fortune &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov entered into a stipulated permanent injunction in
December 1997 in which &#8220;he was ordered to cease infringing on
the television show &#8216;Wheel of Fortune&#8217; and cease publishing&#8221;
his game, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said that evidence was relevant to the alleged
crimes against Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant&#8217;s resume in his possession at the time of
his arrest essentially bragged about his theft of intellectual
property,&#8221; prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate court filing today, Aleynikov asked Cote to
bar the government from referring to the code as a &#8220;trade
secret.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To allow this would &#8220;implicitly be making the legal
conclusion that the source code constitutes a &#8216;trade secret&#8217;&#8221;
and let the prosecution witnesses make an &#8220;inappropriate legal
opinion&#8221; that the defense can&#8217;t challenge, said Aleynikov&#8217;s
lawyer, Kevin Marino, in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. should be prohibited from discussing Goldman&#8217;s
trading system &#8220;generally&#8221; without making the actual systems
available, Marino said in today&#8217;s filing. Doing so would
restrict Aleynikov&#8217;s ability to cross-examine witnesses
testifying about such evidence, his lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 10-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the top-
ranked manager of European stock sales this year, dismissed
Alexandre Harfouche, the co-head of European equity syndicate,
according to a person familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harfouche didn&#8217;t follow compliance rules at New York-based
Goldman Sachs, according to the person, who declined to be
identified because the matter is considered private. The
violations involved a failure to make certain disclosures and
didn&#8217;t break securities laws or harm clients, said the person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Mr. Harfouche no longer works for the firm,&#8221; New York-
based Goldman Sachs said in a statement, without giving a
reason. Fiona Laffan, a spokeswoman in London, said she couldn&#8217;t
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is trying to repair
damage to the firm&#8217;s reputation inflicted by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission&#8217;s April fraud lawsuit, which accused
Goldman Sachs of misleading investors on a 2007 mortgage-linked
security. That was settled for $550 million in July. The firm
has also paid fines to U.K. and U.S. regulators for failing to
notify them of the SEC probe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re going to be very careful to make sure all of
their internal policies and controls are being applied,&#8221; said
Annemarie McAvoy, an adjunct professor at Fordham University
School of Law who has worked as an in-house lawyer at Morgan
Stanley and Citigroup Inc. &#8220;Given what they just went through,
they&#8217;re not going to take chances.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compliance Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial institutions create compliance rules to help them
meet regulatory requirements even when the regulations don&#8217;t
spell out exactly what the firm has to do, according to McAvoy.
For senior employees like Harfouche, monitoring junior staff and
notifying superiors about new information or problems can be
among the requirements, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The internal policies and procedures cover just about
everything these financial firms do,&#8221; she said. &#8220;So if a step
wasn&#8217;t followed in whatever process was going on, or maybe they
were skipping a step -- there are all kinds of scenarios.&#8221;
McAvoy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harfouche, promoted to managing director last year along
with his co-head Daniel G. Martin, was responsible for advising
corporate clients on large sales of securities known as block
trades. Based in London, Harfouche has been listed as inactive
on the Financial Services Authority&#8217;s Register since the end of
last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FSA spokesman Chris Hamilton declined to comment on
Harfouche&#8217;s departure. Harfouche couldn&#8217;t be reached through
Goldman Sachs and isn&#8217;t listed in the London directory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is the top-ranked adviser on share sales in
Europe, the Middle East and Africa this year, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The New York-based firm led Renault SA&#8217;s
sale of its 3 billion-euro ($4.1 billion) stake in Volvo last
month, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported on Harfouche&#8217;s departure late
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tesla Motors Inc., the U.S.
electric-carmaker backed by Toyota Motor Corp. and Daimler AG,
rose 19  percent in Nasdaq trading after a JPMorgan Chase  Co.
analyst said he was &#8220;bullish&#8221; on the company&#8217;s outlook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesla climbed $4.73 to $29.36 at 4:30 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading, the highest closing price since the shares began
trading on June 29. Tesla has risen 73 percent since its June 28
initial public offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are bullish on TSLA as we believe it is at the
vanguard of improving battery costs/durability,&#8221; Himanshu Patel, an analyst with JPMorgan, wrote in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Palo Alto, California, should be able
to produce &#8220;a well-received Tesla-badged product lineup in this
decade, but also what seems like an increasingly viable
powertrain supply revenue stream,&#8221; Patel said in the report,
reiterating his &#8220;overweight&#8221; recommendation on the shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company yesterday reported a third-quarter net loss of
$34.9 million as sales declined and it spent money to develop a
battery-powered sedan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with Toyota and Daimler, which have each invested
about $50 million in Tesla, Japan&#8217;s Panasonic Corp. last week
bought a $30 million stake. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment Management Corp.
may issue $220.5 million of securities backed mainly by
contracts used to finance residential construction, according to
a person familiar with the matter and a term sheet for the
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale of the securities, backed by a $324.2 million pool
of assets that also includes $61.2 million of residential
mortgages, is being managed by Bank of America Corp., according
to the person, who declined to be identified because terms
aren&#8217;t public, and to the document, which was provided to
Bloomberg by an investor. Whitney Finch, a spokesman for Walter
Investment, said the company couldn&#8217;t comment on the
securitization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts acquired by Walter Investment are typically tied
to &#8220;stick-built&#8221; structures, constructed traditionally, in the
southeastern U.S. by Jim Walter Homes and other builders
affiliated with it that extend the credit initially, said
Jeanetta M. Brown, its chief compliance officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s very similar to a traditional mortgage loan, but
it&#8217;s different in construct,&#8221; she said today in a telephone
interview. &#8220;In the event you need to foreclosure, it works
exactly like a mortgage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contracts are similar to lay-away plans used by stores.
They differ from traditional mortgages in that no money is paid
out by the creditor in the transactions, Brown said. They also
differ from so-called chattel paper in that they involve liens
on the underlying land, which is usually owned by consumers
before construction begins, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Created Through Merger &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Investment, a real estate investment trust based in
Tampa, Florida, was created last year through a merger of the
company, which owns a mortgage lender, and Hanover Capital
Mortgage Holdings Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters reported the debt sale earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most-senior $56.7 million portion of the securities
being marketed, which may receive a AAA rating from Standard 
Poor&#8217;s, may yield 200 basis points to 225 basis points more than
benchmark interest rate swaps, the person said. A $79.4 million
slice, which may be rated A, may sell at a spread of 375 basis
points to 400 basis points, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average age of the underlying assets is 33 months and
their average interest rate is 9.1 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, ending two
days of declines, as a rally in oil prices boosted energy shares
and Ireland&#8217;s central bank governor said the country may return
to bond markets next year, easing concern that Europe&#8217;s debt
crisis will worsen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. gained 1.9 percent as oil reached a two-year
high following an Energy Department report showing an unexpected
decrease in crude stockpiles. Bank of America Corp. rose 2.4
percent, leading financial shares higher. Ford Motor Co. rallied
3.5 percent as the automaker held its lead as the top-earning
car manufacturer. Boeing Co. slid 3.2 percent, weighing on the
Dow Jones Industrial Average, after suspending test flights of
the 787 Dreamliner jet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,218.71 at 4:17 p.m. in New York, recovering from a 0.8 percent
loss. The Dow climbed 10.29 points, or 0.1 percent, to 11,357.04.
Benchmark indexes reached two-yeah highs last week after the
Federal Reserve expanded its program of asset purchases to
stimulate growth, a tactic known as quantitative easing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Currency traders have reversed bets on the sovereign debt
fears, and you see that translating into a weakening dollar and
stronger equity markets,&#8221; said Michael James, a managing
director at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles.
&#8220;Ireland&#8217;s been the focus of sovereign debt concerns over the
last weeks, but the market seems to be weathering those fears.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dollar Index pared gains, rising 0.2 percent to 77.62,
after earlier advancing as much as 0.9 percent. Earlier declines
in stocks today came as Irish 10-year bonds tumbled for a 12th
day, the longest slump since at least 2007. Irish bonds have
plunged on concern the cost of bailing out the nation&#8217;s banks
has made the government debt load unsustainable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governor Honohan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irish central bank Governor Patrick Honohan said he&#8217;s
convinced the country will be able to return to bond markets in
2011 as the government steps up austerity measures to lower the
budget deficit and restore investor confidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is no reason why Ireland shouldn&#8217;t be able to go
back to bond markets next year,&#8221; Honohan, who also sits on the
European Central Bank&#8217;s 22-member Governing Council, told
Bloomberg Television in an interview in Dublin today. &#8220;It takes
time for markets to be reassured. It takes more than calming
words from me or others.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. futures fell earlier as China&#8217;s central bank raised
lenders&#8217; reserve requirements as cash from October&#8217;s larger-
than-forecast $27.1 billion trade surplus threatened to add to
the risk of asset bubbles and accelerating inflation. The step
came a day before the G20 nations meet in Seoul to tackle global
imbalances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;QE2 Backlash&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a mix of issues -- the European situation, China,
there&#8217;s a little bit of backlash to QE2,&#8221; said Michael Nasto,
senior trader at U.S. Global Investors Inc., which manages about
$2.5 billion in San Antonio, Texas. &#8220;People are waiting to find
out what&#8217;s going to happen at the G20 meeting later this week.
Energy&#8217;s leading because the Department of Energy inventory
numbers were all pretty much bullish.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America jumped 2.4 percent to $12.57, the biggest
gain in the Dow. Financial stocks rallied 1.4 percent, the most
out of 10 SP 500 groups. JPMorgan Chase  Co. rose 1.8 percent
to $40.62, while Citigroup Inc. gained 2.8 percent to $4.42. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 1.9 percent to $85.17, leading energy stocks
to the second-biggest gain among 10 industries in the SP 500.
Oil for December delivery surged $1.09 to $87.81 as supplies
dropped 3.27 million barrels to 364.9 million last week, the
Energy Department said. Stockpiles were forecast to increase 1.5
million barrels, according to a Bloomberg News survey.
Inventories of gasoline and distillate fuel, a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, fell more than estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford Jumps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford rose 3.5 percent to $16.63, an almost seven-year high.
Rival General Motors Co. reported third-quarter earnings before
interest and taxes rose to $2.28 billion from $2.03 billion
during the previous three months of the year, lagging behind
Ford as the most profitable automaker this year, while
overtaking Toyota Motor Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing declined 3.2 percent to $67.07, the largest drop
since Aug. 24. The world&#8217;s largest aerospace company suspended
test flights of the 787 Dreamliner jet while it investigates why
one of the planes caught fire and had to make an emergency
landing in Texas. The company was removed from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.&#8217;s &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell Soup Co. dropped 3.3 percent, the most in 18
months, to $34.85 as the world&#8217;s largest soup maker cut its
full-year forecast. Per-share earnings for the year ending July
will climb 2 percent to 4 percent, Campbell said today in a
statement. That compared with a previous forecast of 5 percent
to 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invesco Ltd. fell 3.9 percent to $22.29. Morgan Stanley,
the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets, divested a stake in
Invesco for $664 million, just five months after acquiring it
through the sale of a retail asset-management unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. rallied 7.3 percent to $108.28, the
biggest gain in the SP 500. The New York-based seller of the
namesake brand clothing raised its sales projection for the year
as customers snapped up footwear and apparel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. is betting it can
succeed where Pfizer Inc. failed, with a new type of drug to
combat heart disease by raising good cholesterol levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, will report
results from an advanced trial of its drug next week, four years
after Pfizer abandoned a similar pill linked to heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new treatments could be the biggest advance against
heart disease in the two decades since the arrival of statins, a
group of drugs led by New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s Lipitor. Results
showing Merck&#8217;s pill doesn&#8217;t cause the same side effects that
sidelined Pfizer&#8217;s good cholesterol pill may propel Merck into a
$15 billion annual market, according to Decision Resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s medication &#8220;is looking to be a very promising
agent,&#8221; said Rory Collins, co-director of the University of
Oxford&#8217;s Clinical Trial Service Unit in England. &#8220;Raising good
cholesterol could be an enormous public health benefit. But it&#8217;s
still a big gamble.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck shares declined 9 cents to $34.96 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has increased 4
percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new drug is in a family of medicines known as CETP
inhibitors, designed to boost levels of HDL that flush fat
deposits from arteries to the liver to be purged from the body.
Statins work by decreasing levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol,
that clogs arteries and leads to heart attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart Meeting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on Merck&#8217;s new drug, anacetrapib, will be
presented next week at the American Heart Association meeting in
Chicago, reviving a race to treat heart disease by raising HDL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s study will be the first advanced research to emerge
from the family of medicines known as CETP inhibitors since New
York-based Pfizer&#8217;s pill torcetrapib failed. Roche Holding AG of
Basel, Switzerland, and Eli Lilly  Co., based in Indianapolis,
are testing similar pills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of deaths in the
U.S., kills about 830,000 people a year, according to the
American Heart Association. As many as 100 million Americans
have a deficit of good cholesterol, increasing their risk for
heart attacks and strokes, said Scott Wright, a cardiologist at
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve done all we can do with lowering LDL cholesterol,
and the residual risk remains high,&#8221; Wright said. &#8220;Being thin,
getting weight down, exercising and eating healthy are the best
ways to raise HDL, but those are challenging for most people. We
probably need medication to help the lifestyle changes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Failure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, Pfizer abandoned a good-cholesterol drug it
spent $1 billion to develop after a study found it caused
deaths. An analysis found patients taking it were 60 percent
more likely to die than those who didn&#8217;t receive it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s pill failed because it unexpectedly increased
levels of a hormone called aldosterone, linked to fatty plaque
buildup and high blood pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cardiovascular disease is largely preventable,&#8221; Pfizer
spokesman Ray Kerins said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s
current and future portfolio of medicines in this therapeutic
area focuses on the control of the risk factors inherent in
smoking, diet, physical inactivity and Type 2 diabetes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck paused its own research after Pfizer&#8217;s torcetrapib
setback to scour ongoing studies for signals of hypertension and
design a new safety trial, called Define. Merck&#8217;s anacetrapib is
now in the third and final stage of tests generally needed for
U.S. approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Bar is Raised&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With torcetrapib and the toxicity that was observed, the
bar is raised in terms of having to really demonstrate a
benefit,&#8221; said Yale Mitchel, Merck&#8217;s vice president of
cardiovascular disease research, in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results next week are from the Define trial, which followed
1,800 people for 18 months to examine safety and ability to
alter cholesterol levels. Based on this trial, Merck began
planning its final study, and may seek U.S. approval after 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the right kind of outcome, the market could be
billions and billions of dollars,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, an
analyst with Deutsche Bank in New York, in a telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck&#8217;s results will hint at the potential for Roche to
succeed with dalcetrapib, in the same family of medicines. Roche
has said it will release initial results next year from three
final studies and may seek U.S. clearance in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Game Changer&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The CETP inhibitor is a potential game changer for this
company,&#8221; with the potential to generate as much as Pfizer&#8217;s
Lipitor, the best-selling drug in the world with $11.4 billion
in sales last year, Roche Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan, said during a July 22 conference call. &#8220;It has its
risks, but we are fully committed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lilly is in the second of three stages of testing its drug
in the same family of medicines, according to the U.S. web site
that tracks studies. Lilly spokeswoman Judy Moore said the
company had no comment on its cardiovascular drugs in
development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People with the highest levels of HDL are least likely to
have heart attacks or die from cardiac disease, said Jorge
Plutzky, director of the vascular disease prevention program at
Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital in Boston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cutting LDL by 1 percent reduces heart disease risk by the
same amount, he said. Boosting HDL 1 percent can curb risk by as
much as 3 percent, potentially making this approach more
effective, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It seems as if you get a bigger bang for the buck in
changing HDL,&#8221; Plutzky said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We just
haven&#8217;t been as successful as we would like in doing that. We
ultimately just have to see where the data takes us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert C. Jones, who helped found
and lead Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s quantitative equity fund
management unit, is leaving after 24 years at the company,
according to an internal memo sent to employees today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones, 54, will leave Goldman Sachs at the end of this
year, about a year after becoming an advisory director focused
on special research projects, the memo said. The contents of the
memo were confirmed by Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for the New
York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones is the latest in a series of so-called quant
managers, who use mathematical models to trade securities, to
leave Goldman Sachs following losses at two funds in 2007.
Robert Litterman, who was chairman of the quantitative hedge-
fund group, left in January after 24 years at the firm. Mark Carhart and Raymond Iwanowski, who were co-heads of the
quantitative investment group and the Global Alpha hedge fund,
quit in March 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of last year Goldman Sachs closed its Global
Equity Opportunities Fund, a quant hedge fund that required a $3
billion cash infusion in 2007, after it dwindled to $200 million
in assets from $7.5 billion, people familiar with the situation
said in January. It had been managed by Jones after Carhart and
Iwanowski left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Katinka Domotorffy succeeded Carhart and Iwanowski as head
of the quatitative investment group and was assisted by Jones,
Kent Daniel and Bill Fallon. Domotorffy remains chief investment
officer and head of quantitative investment strategies and
Fallon remains co-chief investment officer of the team&#8217;s alpha
strategies and head of research, according to today&#8217;s memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domotorffy also works alongside Don Mulvihill, co-chief
investment officer of the customized beta strategies team within
quantitative investment strategies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hired in 1987 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones was hired in 1987 into the company&#8217;s investment-
research department and became the founding head of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management&#8217;s global quantitative equity group in
1989, according to the memo. He stopped actively managing
portfolios in 2007, although he remained co-chief investment
officer of the so-called QIS equity business until the end of
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported on Jones&#8217;s retirement
earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. plans to
pull all of its $120 million from Philip Falcone&#8217;s main hedge
fund after returns lagged behind peers and Falcone disclosed he
borrowed $113 million from a smaller fund that had suspended
redemptions, said three people briefed on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falcone, 48, took the loan from the Harbinger Capital
Partners Special Situations Fund in October 2009 to pay personal
taxes, Bloomberg Markets Magazine reported in September. At the 
time, investors were barred from exiting the fund because it had 
assets tied up in the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings 
Inc. New York-based Harbinger Capital Partners disclosed the loan
in the fund&#8217;s March 12 financial statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm&#8217;s main Harbinger Capital Partners Fund tumbled 15
percent through Oct. 15, according to investors. As of
September, about 90 percent of the fund&#8217;s $3.4 billion in net
assets were tied up in wireless-telecommunications investments,
angering some clients who said the portfolio is too concentrated
and too skewed toward illiquid investments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are in an environment with scarce capital inflows so
if there is an additional risk factor from anywhere, including a
large client redeeming, allocators won&#8217;t take the risk of
ignoring it -- they at least have to look into it,&#8221; said Howard Eisen, co-founder of New York-based FletcherBennett Group LLC, a
consultant to hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman,
and Eliot Hoff, a spokesman for Harbinger, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$1 Billion Investment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors in Harbinger&#8217;s core fund are limited to taking
out 25 percent of their investments per quarter, so that a full
withdrawal is spread out over a year. Goldman will get back $30
million in January, and receive its final $30 million payment in
January 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2008, Goldman had $1 billion invested in two
Harbinger funds, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the funds are private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another investor in the core fund, the New York State
Common Retirement Fund, asked to redeem $41 million. Dennis Tompkins, a spokesman for the state pension system, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harbinger is winding down the Special Situations fund,
which had about $2 billion in assets as of September. Following
the fund&#8217;s suspension, clients representing 80 percent of assets
opted to redeem their investments earlier this year, and they
will get money back as the fund&#8217;s positions are sold. Remaining
clients will put their money into other Harbinger funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harbinger&#8217;s Credit Distressed Blue Line Fund, started in
April 2009, has returned 12 percent this year, according to an
investor. The fund has pulled in $500 million in assets this
year, the person said. Distressed funds have jumped 8.7 percent,
on average, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Range Resources Corp., EQT Corp. and Ultra Petroleum Corp. are among companies that may attract
takeover bids because of their holdings in the Marcellus Shale
formation, where natural gas output has exceeded forecasts,
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors expect more deals to follow yesterday&#8217;s agreement
by Chevron Corp. to buy Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion in
cash to gain access to natural gas in the Marcellus. The deal is
worth $4.3 billion including assumed debt, which would make it
Chevron&#8217;s biggest since it bought Unocal Corp. in 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Range, EQT, and Ultra, along with Atlas, all control
hundreds of thousands of acres in the Marcellus, a layer of gas-
rich shale rock under Pennsylvania and adjacent states. The
three have below-average enterprise values -- the value of stock
plus debt -- compared with reserves among the 65 largest U.S.
oil and gas producers, according to a Bloomberg data analysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Marcellus is the best gas shale play in the U.S.,&#8221;
Brian Lively, an analyst for Tudor, Pickering, Holt  Co. in
Houston, said in an interview yesterday. &#8220;You&#8217;re also very
close to market, so you tend to get a premium for your gas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Range and EQT have been among the worst-performing
independent oil and gas producers this year in the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 as investors snapped up shares of companies like
Pioneer Natural Resources Inc. and Denbury Resources Inc. that
pumped more oil, the more profitable product in the current
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Going &#8216;Quietly&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, will join Reliance
Industries Ltd., India&#8217;s largest company by market value, in a
joint venture to extract gas from the Marcellus. Exxon Mobil
Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc have also bought companies with
Marcellus acreage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Majors just don&#8217;t do $4 billion deals and then go quietly
into the night,&#8221; according to a note issued today by Tudor,
Pickering analysts including Lively.&#160;&#8220;There will be more
acquisitions&#8221; and companies going private, the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and other integrated oil companies are buying
shale-gas assets based on a 30-year outlook for energy prices,
confident that natural gas will sell for more than the current
price of about $4.24 per million British thermal units, said
Jonathan Dison, a managing director at Bender Consulting
Services Inc. in Houston, whose clients have included Chevron.
Exxon Mobil has said it expects use of natural gas will outpace
that of oil as global energy demand rises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three First Targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If I were acquiring a company and had all the money in
the world, the three I would target first would be Ultra, Range
and Petrohawk,&#8221; Michael Bodino, a Fort Worth, Texas-based
analyst for Global Hunter Securities, said in an interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultra and Range hold acreage in the Marcellus Shale, while
Houston-based Petrohawk Energy Corp. has holdings in the Texas
Eagle Ford shale that produces oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Whitley, Ultra Petroleum&#8217;s manager for investor
relations, said the company doesn&#8217;t have any offers right now.
&#8220;There are not a lot of barriers if anyone was going to come
put an offer in,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Giles, a spokeswoman for Range, said the company
doesn&#8217;t comment on speculation. Spokespeople for EQT and
Petrohawk didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment yesterday on the
possibility of a takeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going Private &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other companies with Marcellus assets are considering
private transactions. Quicksilver Resources Inc. said last month
it&#8217;s weighing a potential offer to go private. Exco Resources
Inc. said this month that its Chief Executive Officer Douglas H. Miller offered to buy all shares he doesn&#8217;t already own in a
purchase that values the company at about $4.36 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EQT and Range are &#8220;top ideas&#8221; in the Marcellus, RBC
Capital Analyst Scott Hanold wrote in a note to clients
yesterday after Chevron announced its deal. Based on the Chevron
deal, Range is worth $45 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Range fell 73 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $41.86 at 10:19 in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange after rising
4.6 percent yesterday. EQT fell 8 cents to $40.43, after a 5.1
percent rise yesterday. Ultra fell 7.54 cents to $47, after
increasing 4.1 percent yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Range held gas leases on 1.3 million acres in the Marcellus
region as of June 30, second to Chesapeake Energy Corp. the
second-largest U.S. gas producer behind Exxon Mobil, Hanold
wrote in an Aug. 26 note. Relative to its market value, Range
had the most Marcellus acres, with Atlas second. EQT holds
500,000 acres in the Marcellus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Range, EQT and Ultra also have some of the lowest lifting
costs, a measure of the expense to produce the equivalent of a
barrel of oil, in the U.S., according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies like Range that have kept their per-unit
production costs under control can be outsized winners,&#8221; Curtis Trimble, a managing director at MKM Holdings LLC in Houston,
said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bailout of Ireland and Portugal
through the European Financial Stability Facility would resolve

increased,&#8221;Francesco Garzarelli, chief interest-rate

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. won dismissal of most
claims in a shareholder lawsuit alleging that the bank lied
about its exposure to collateralized debt obligations and other
toxic assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein dismissed an array of
claims in the 536-page complaint against Citigroup, finding in
most cases that the plaintiffs failed to allege facts showing
the bank and its officials knew they were misleading investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court finds that plaintiffs have stated a claim to
relief only with respect to alleged misstatements and omissions
occurring between February 2007 and April 2008 concerning
Citigroup&#8217;s collateralized debt obligation holdings,&#8221; Stein
said in yesterday&#8217;s ruling in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs, who sued in 2007, seek to represent all
investors who bought Citigroup stock from Jan. 1, 2004, to Jan.
15, 2009. They claim they lost money when the extent of
Citigroup&#8217;s losses on the investments became public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein ruled that the shareholders failed to allege that the
bank and its officials knew they were acting fraudulently when
they made statements about a series of financial instruments
held by Citigroup, including residential-mortgage-backed
securities, subprime mortgages, structured investment vehicles,
collateralized loan obligations and auction-rate securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are pleased the court has dismissed the great majority
of plaintiffs&#8217; claims and substantially reduced the class period
at stake,&#8221; Danielle Romero-Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement. She said the bank has strong
defenses to the remaining claims related to CDOs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ira M. Press, a lawyer for the investors, said he is
pleased Stein declined to dismiss claims related to Citigroup&#8217;s
CDO disclosures. The CDO claims form &#8220;the lion&#8217;s share&#8221; of the
allegations in the complaint, Press said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stein dismissed claims against seven of 14 current and
former Citigroup officials named in the suit. The remaining
seven, including former Chief Executive Officer Charles Prince,
attended meetings in the summer of 2007 to discuss Citigroup&#8217;s
CDO exposure, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That defendants engaged in meetings concerning
Citigroup&#8217;s CDO risks is inconsistent with the company&#8217;s public
statements downplaying or concealing that risk,&#8221; Stein wrote in
the opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re Citigroup Inc. Securities Litigation, 07-
cv-09901, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn Seeks to Stop Lions Gate Director Voting Shares &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carl Icahn, who has made a hostile bid for Lions Gate
Entertainment Corp., told a judge through his lawyer he will
seek to block board member Mark Rachesky from voting his shares
at the studio&#8217;s Dec. 14 annual meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn, the billionaire chairman of New York-based Icahn
Enterprises LP, will file the motion to suspend Rachesky&#8217;s
voting power in New York state Supreme Court Nov. 15, attorney
Joseph DiBenedetto told Justice James Yates yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn, 74, who is attempting to buy the independent film
and TV studio for $7.50 a share, sued Vancouver-based Lions Gate
in both Canada and New York in July to reverse an equity-for-
debt swap that increased Rachesky&#8217;s stake to almost 29 percent.
Icahn argues that management conspired with large shareholders
to thwart his bid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court of British Columbia on Nov. 1 dismissed
the Canadian suit by Icahn to undo the deal. Icahn has appealed.
An appeals judge on Nov. 5 denied his request for an expedited
hearing. Lions Gate told the New York judge yesterday the
Canadian ruling supports its motion to dismiss the New York case
and said there is no reasonable basis for a court order against
Rachesky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This court cannot rule in the Icahn Group&#8217;s favor without
holding that the British Columbia court got it wrong,&#8221; Lions
Gate attorney William Savitt wrote in a letter yesterday to
Yates. &#8220;This is precisely the situation that this court wished
to avoid when it noted at the September 17 conference that it
&#8216;would drop this case like a hot potato&#8217; in the event the
British Columbia court issued a clear ruling.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Icahn v. Lions Gate, 651076/2010, New York state
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toyota Lawyers Agree to Share Throttle Source Code &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp. agreed in court to turn over access to

is alleged to be the cause of some of the automaker&#8217;s sudden-
acceleration problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Toyota told a judge yesterday in federal court
in Santa Ana, California, that they will provide attorneys for
Toyota vehicle owners access to the &#8220;source codes&#8221; for the
system if the judge issues a confidentiality order covering the
company&#8217;s product and trade secrets. The source codes have been
at the center of disputes between the two sides during the
process of pre-trial evidence gathering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have no problem in turning this over providing we have
the proper protections in place,&#8221; Toyota attorney Vincent
Galvin told U.S. District judge James V. Selna. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Galvin said the information already had been turned over
to the government before Congress held hearings over Toyota&#8217;s
problems earlier this year. He said it hadn&#8217;t been turned over
the plaintiffs yet because pre-trial discovery hadn&#8217;t reached
the stage in which Toyota was required to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Robinson, one of the lead plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers, told
the judge the codes are vital in the case because they will
allow experts to analyze the throttle system and come up with
their own determination over whether flaws may have been a
factor in episodes of inadvertent acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been like someone standing outside a house with a
camera taking pictures of the house and knowing what it looks
like without knowing what it&#8217;s made up of inside,&#8221; Robinson
told the judge. &#8220;We need to analyze this data and see how it
related or didn&#8217;t relate to the recalls.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota is facing about 400 lawsuits in which plaintiffs
claim they are due damages for injuries, death or loss of
vehicle value from sudden acceleration in several models of cars
made by Toyota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The automaker is seeking dismissal of the suits at a
hearing scheduled for Nov. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are combined as In re Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Natixis Settle Credit Default Swaps Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Natixis SA settled a London
lawsuit over terminated credit-default swaps that might have
been worth as much as $530 million after a delay in the trial
that was to begin yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs and Natixis are pleased they&#8217;ve reached a
commercial settlement,&#8221; Goldman&#8217;s lawyer, Anthony Grabiner,
said in court. The terms are confidential and Grabiner said
neither side would make any further public statements on the
agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank&#8217;s London unit, Goldman Sachs International,
sued Natixis in July to stop the termination of three credit-
default swaps. Natixis, a unit of BPCE SA, France&#8217;s second-
largest lender by branches, said in July it would terminate the
swaps because Goldman didn&#8217;t comply with the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The French investment bank countersued in September,
seeking a ruling that it ended the deal lawfully, as well as
breach of contract damages. Natixis said it was &#8220;ready, willing
and able&#8221; to pay Goldman $198.4 million on the &#8220;lawfully and
validly terminated&#8221; credit-default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the most profitable firm in Wall Street history,
disputed Natixis&#8217;s calculation in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Goldman Sachs International v. Natixis, 10-880,
High Court of Justice, Queen&#8217;s Bench Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Air France, BA, Carriers Get $1.1 Billion EU Cartel Fines &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air France-KLM Group, British Airways Plc and SAS Group AB
were among 11 carriers fined a total of 799.4 million euros
($1.1 billion) by European Union regulators for fixing cargo
fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air France and its units got the biggest fine of 339.6
million euros. British Airways was fined 104 million euros and
SAS Group AB got a 70.2 million-euro penalty, the European
Commission said. Cargolux Airlines International SA, Europe&#8217;s
third-biggest air-freight carrier, was fined 79.9 million euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is deplorable that so many major airlines coordinated
their pricing to the detriment of European businesses and
European consumers,&#8221; EU Competition Commissioner Joaquin
Almunia said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU fines come three years after regulators sent
complaints to 26 airlines, following coordinated antitrust raids
across the world that led to jail terms for some executives,
fines and settlements. U.S. authorities have already fined 18
airlines at least $1.6 billion and filed criminal charges
against 14 executives for price-fixing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air France&#8217;s fine exceeds the company&#8217;s total provisions
for the case, spokeswoman Brigitte Barrand said. From 530
million euros set aside as a provision in 2008, Air France-KLM
had already paid out almost 330 million euros in fines and
class-action awards in the U.S., Canada and Australia, she said
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Airways said in an e-mailed statement its fine was
&#8220;within the provision made by the company in its 2006/7 report
and accounts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAS, owner of Scandinavia&#8217;s biggest airline, said that it
will appeal its fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;SAS believes that it has not been involved in a global
cartel and that therefore, the fines are disproportionate,&#8221; it
said in a statement to the Stockholm stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Europe&#8217;s second-largest airline,
wasn&#8217;t fined because it was the first to inform on the cartel,
the EU&#8217;s antitrust agency said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Sues Viel  Cie. Unit for Bid-Rigging &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley sued a New
York-based broker for rigging bids of municipal-bond investment
contracts, allowing banks to profit at taxpayer expense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tradition (North America) Inc., a unit of Paris-based
broker Viel  Cie., worked for the state between 2000 and 2004
and was supposed to get the highest interest rates from banks on
investments of municipal-bond proceeds, Coakley said yesterday
in a statement. Instead, Tradition ran sham auctions, allowing
favored bidders to win deals at below-market rates, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tradition&#8217;s conduct here is very troubling,&#8221; Coakley
said. By fixing the bids, Tradition ensured that favored
providers would get business from the state while also short-
changing Massachusetts, the state said. The lawsuit parallels a
probe by federal investigators into how such investment
contracts were obtained by banks nationwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts&#8217;s college-building authority and development
finance agency are among 160 state and local government bond
issuers that the U.S. Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division
has said were victims of bid-rigging by 16 banks, according to
documents filed in a criminal case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Tradition agent has pleaded guilty in the Justice
Department probe. The U.S. inquiry centers on guaranteed
investment contracts, known as GICs, which municipalities buy
with money raised by selling bonds. The investments let them
earn a return on the cash until the funds are needed for
schools, roads and other public works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tradition has acted in accordance with the law,&#8221; said
Dan Webb, a lawyer for Tradition with Winston  Strawn LLP in
Chicago. &#8220;The charges against Tradition are unfounded and will
be contested vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Glaxo Lawyer Charged With Making False Statements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former in-house attorney for GlaxoSmithKline Plc was
charged with obstruction and making false statements during a
U.S. investigation into unapproved uses of its antidepressant
drug Wellbutrin SR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren Stevens, of Durham, North Carolina, was accused
yesterday in an indictment of impeding an inquiry in 2002 and
2003 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration into the marketing
of the drug for uses not approved by the FDA. Stevens was a vice
president and associate general counsel for London-based Glaxo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens signed letters to the FDA making false statements
and hid the extent of the company&#8217;s promotion of the drug for
unapproved uses, including weight loss, according to the
indictment. She withheld that the company paid a Vermont
physician to speak at 511 promotional events in 2001 and 2002 to
discuss off-label uses and also paid Michigan doctor to give 488
talks, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a difference between legal advocacy based on the
facts and distorting the facts to cover up the truth,&#8221; Carmen
Ortiz, U.S. attorney for Massachusetts, said yesterday in a
statement. &#8220;Federal agencies such as the FDA cannot protect the
public health if entities and individuals they regulate provide
false information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment doesn&#8217;t identify the company or the drug by
name. Glaxo spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne confirmed in an e-mail
that Stevens worked in the legal department and is now retired,
and the drug was Wellbutrin SR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lauren Stevens is an utterly decent and honorable
woman,&#8221; her lawyer, Brien T. O&#8217;Connor of Ropes  Gray LLP, said
in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;She is not guilty of obstruction or
of making false statements. Everything she did in this case was
consistent with ethical lawyering and the advice provided her by
a nationally prominent law firm retained by her employer
specifically because of its experience in working with FDA.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stevens told the FDA she would collect materials about
Glaxo&#8217;s promotion of the drug, which was approved only for a
single use, &#8220;the treatment of a major depressive disorder in
patients age 18 or older,&#8221; according to the indictment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Stevens, 10-cr-694, U.S. District
Court, District of Maryland (Greenbelt). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BGC Capital Markets Sues Tullett for Misuse of Data &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGC Capital Markets LP sued Tullett Prebon Americas Corp.
over claims it misused proprietary U.S. Treasury data that
earned it profits of &#8220;at least hundreds of millions of
dollars.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BGC Capital, based in New York, and Tullett Americas
operate in the competitive interdealer broker industry. BGC
accuses Tullett and its affiliates of misappropriating price
data derived from the electronic brokering eSpeed system to
generate profits in the market for historically unregulated
financial instruments, such as swaps, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $400 billion is traded daily on the eSpeed
system, which is operated by BGC affiliates, according to the
complaint filed yesterday in New York State Supreme Court in
Manhattan. Under contract, the U.S. Treasury data has been
provided to a Tullett Americas affiliate. That contract
prohibits the use of the real-time data by their brokers, who
unfairly use it to compete against BGC, according to the suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because defendant&#8217;s brokers compete directly with
plaintiff&#8217;s brokers, profits earned by defendant by brokering
based on misappropriated data were earned improperly and at
plaintiff&#8217;s expense,&#8221; BGC said in its complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephanie Kuffner, an outside spokeswoman for Tullett,
didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is BGC Capital Markets LP v. Tullett Prebon
Americas Corp., 651954/2010, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley Sues Peak Ridge Fund Over $40.3 Million Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley sued a Peak Ridge Capital Group LLC fund for
$40.3 million in losses this year tied to natural gas futures
trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed Nov. 8 in the Manhattan federal court,
seeks damages as well as legal and other fees stemming from
Morgan Stanley&#8217;s role as the futures broker for Boston-based
Peak Ridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Peak Ridge account lost $9.8 million in natural gas
trades on June 4, according to the lawsuit, after which Morgan
Stanley increased the amount of cash it required the firm to
post to back its trades, known as margin. The bank declared the
fund in default later in June after Peak Ridge failed to meet
its new margin requirements. During the next two weeks, Morgan
Stanley sold off the positions and &#8220;incurred substantial
losses,&#8221; the lawsuit said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak Ridge was previously advised by Brian Hunter, the
former Amaranth Advisors LLC natural-gas trader who lost $6.6
billion in 2006. Hunter &#8220;does not work at Peak Ridge,&#8221; said
Shauna MacDonald, a spokeswoman for Hunter. She declined to
comment further on his employment at the company. Calls to
Michael McNally, Peak Ridge&#8217;s chief executive officer, and Laura
Small, a spokeswoman, weren&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak Ridge used Hunter to devise trading models and
strategies. The Peak Ridge Commodity Volatility Fund, for
example, seeks to profit from price differences in the natural-
gas market. The company also bought the assets of Solengo
Capital Advisors, a hedge-fund firm that Hunter tried to start
six months after Amaranth&#8217;s collapse in September 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2006, Hunter had bet that the difference between the
price of natural gas for 2007 March and April contracts would
widen. Instead, the spread narrowed, creating losses for
Amaranth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Societe Generale Employee Stole Code, Jury Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Societe Generale SA trader stole computer code for
high-frequency trading from the company, a U.S. federal
prosecutor said in opening statements at the start of a trial in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The defendant, Samarth Agrawal, stole valuable, closely
guarded trading code from his employer, Societe Generale,&#8221;
Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Brown told the jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agrawal was charged in April with theft of trade secrets.
The government said he made copies of part of the code he had
access to and more code that he wasn&#8217;t supposed to have. He
faces as much as 10 years in prison if convicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed S. Rakoff is presiding over the
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agrawal was hired in 2007 in New York by the Paris-based
bank to be a quantitative analyst in the high-frequency trading
group, the government said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Agrawal, 10-cr-417, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glaxo Failed to Warn About Paxil&#8217;s Risks, Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the U.K.&#8217;s largest drugmaker, failed
to properly warn consumers that its antidepressant drug Paxil
could cause birth defects, a lawyer for the family of an injured
teenager told jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo officials had research from the 1980s showing Paxil
caused deaths among the offspring of animal test subjects and
didn&#8217;t provide clear warnings about those deaths, Kimberly
Baden, a lawyer for Anna Blyth and her family, told a
Philadelphia jury. Baden said the drug caused a narrowing of the
aorta leading from the heart of Anna, now 14 years old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the evidence will show Paxil caused Anna&#8217;s
birth defects,&#8221; Baden said in opening statements in the trial.
&#8220;We believe the warnings and instructions put out in 1995
weren&#8217;t appropriate and reasonable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blyth family&#8217;s case is the first over Paxil&#8217;s birth-
defect risks to go to trial since the company agreed in July to
pay more than $1 billion to settle 800 cases alleging the
company failed to adequately warn consumers and their doctors
about the drug&#8217;s hazards. The Blyth case wasn&#8217;t part of the
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glaxo officials contend Paxil played no role in Anna&#8217;s
heart defects. They were most likely caused by genetics or the
fact that her mother became pregnant late in life, Chilton
Varner, a lawyer for the drugmaker, told jurors in her opening
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sarah Alspach, a Glaxo spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t return a call
for comment on how many Paxil birth-defect cases remain
outstanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Blyth v. GlaxoSmithKline, 07-3305, Court of
Common Pleas, Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer Arbitration Case Divides U.S. Supreme Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Supreme Court justices, wrestling with an arbitration
case involving an ATT Inc. unit, debated how much ability
companies should have to prevent customers from banding together
to press legal claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an hour-long hearing in Washington yesterday, the
justices signaled that they are likely to divide in the case,
which stems from $30.22 in sales taxes charged to two California
consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business groups say states are undermining the cost savings
arbitration offers by requiring that customers be allowed to
press claims as a class. In the case before the justices, a
federal appeals court invalidated the class-action ban in ATT
Mobility LLC&#8217;s customer contracts, saying the provision was
&#8220;unconscionable&#8221; under California law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several members of the court yesterday indicated they were
hesitant to second-guess California&#8217;s rules designed to protect
consumers from one-sided contracts. &#8220;Who are we to say that the
state is wrong about that?&#8221; Justice Elena Kagan asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other justices suggested that California might be violating
a federal law that requires states to treat arbitration
agreements the same as any other contract. Chief Justice John
Roberts said the state was evaluating the fairness of
arbitration accords using &#8220;a different mode of analysis than
I&#8217;m familiar with under basic contract law.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case could affect tens of millions of arbitration
agreements in California alone, according to ATT. Amazon.com
Inc., Earthlink Inc., DirecTV Inc., Comcast Corp., Dell Inc. and
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce all filed briefs supporting ATT in
the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is ATT Mobility v. Concepcion, 09-893, U.S.
Supreme Court (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money Manager Barry Ran Ponzi Scheme, Jury Is Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A money manager from Brooklyn, New York, ran a 30-year
Ponzi scheme that defrauded hundreds of investors, a federal
prosecutor told jurors at the start of his securities-fraud
trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Philip Barry, 53, a resident of the Bay Ridge section of
Brooklyn, began accepting money in 1978 from investors,
guaranteeing fictional annual profits, according to prosecutors
in the office of U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch in Brooklyn.
Instead, he used new investors&#8217; money to pay earlier ones,
prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a case about a con man,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney
Jeffrey A. Goldberg told jurors in his opening statement. &#8220;The
Ponzi schemer simply takes money out of one investor&#8217;s pocket
and puts it into another investor&#8217;s pocket.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Weil, a lawyer for Barry, told jurors in his
opening statement, &#8220;&#8216;Your house will always go up in value.&#8217;
Philip Barry bought into that same myth, that you can&#8217;t lose
money in real estate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldberg told the jury that Barry&#8217;s business &#8220;was a fake
but his victims were very real.&#8221; He said victims were scheduled
to testify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission said Barry diverted some of the investor money to a
mail-order pornography business. On Sept. 7, Barry sued the SEC
for libel over the accusation. He has run Barry Publications for
30 years, selling &#8220;vinyl LP records, music cassette tapes,
compact discs and DVDs,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Barry, 09-cr-0833, the SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Barry, 09-cv-3860,
and Barry&#8217;s suit against the SEC is Barry v. United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, 10-cv-4071, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore Seeks 12-Week Jail Term for U.K. Author &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Singapore prosecutor urged a judge to jail British author
Alan Shadrake for at least 12 weeks for disparaging the city-
state&#8217;s judiciary in a book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Hema Subramaniam said at a sentencing hearing
yesterday that Shadrake was &#8220;insincere&#8221; in his &#8220;half-hearted
attempt at an apology&#8221; and deserved to be jailed for contempt
of court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadrake, 76, challenged the impartiality of Singapore&#8217;s
judiciary in the book &#8220;Once a Jolly Hangman: Singapore&#8217;s
Justice in the Dock,&#8221; accusing courts of bowing to political
and economic pressures and dispensing justice unequally to the
rich and the poor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadrake alleged &#8220;grave misconduct&#8221; by the city state&#8217;s
courts, High Court Judge Quentin Loh said in his Nov. 3 decision
to convict the author for contempt. The book contained &#8220;half-
truths and selective facts; sometimes even outright
falsehoods,&#8221; Loh said then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge said he would give Shadrake &#8220;a final opportunity
to make amends&#8221; when he convicted the author. Loh yesterday
reserved his decision on a sentence until Nov. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer, dressed in a beige linen suit, showed
&#8220;continued defiance&#8221; of the Singapore judiciary, Subramaniam
said. She cited the writer&#8217;s comments to media that he wouldn&#8217;t
apologize and would continue fighting for freedom and democracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadrake declined to comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Attorney-General v. Alan Shadrake OS720/2010 in
the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil-Industry Suit on U.S. Drilling Rules Set for Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New Orleans judge will conduct a two-day bench trial next
year in an oil industry lawsuit claiming U.S. regulators
continue to stall deep-water drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman, after a closed-door
meeting yesterday with lawyers in three lawsuits challenging the
Obama administration&#8217;s offshore drilling policy, said he would
try two of the cases next year in New Orleans federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Trial will commence on Monday, July 25, 2011, at 9:00
a.m. without a jury,&#8221; Feldman said in an order handed down
yesterday in a suit by Ensco Offshore Co. against the
administration&#8217;s second drilling ban. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feldman also said he would conduct a separate two-day bench
trial Oct. 11 on remaining claims in a separate industry lawsuit
against the first U.S. drilling ban, which President Barack
Obama imposed in May after the BP Plc oil spill in the Gulf of
Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That lawsuit, by Hornbeck Offshore Services LLC., was
joined by the state of Louisiana and more than 200 regional
business and trade groups who claimed U.S. Interior Secretary
Kenneth Salazar improperly restricted exploration in waters
deeper than 500 feet. Feldman struck down the initial ban in
late June, calling it overly broad and punitive to the Gulf
Coast economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interior Department spokeswoman Melissa Schwartz and Ken
Dennard, one of Hornbeck&#8217;s attorneys, declined in e-mails to
comment on the judge&#8217;s order. Ensco Vice President Sean O&#8217;Neill
didn&#8217;t respond to a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should end bets that
Italian 10-year government bonds will rise relative to
equivalent-maturity French debt after the yield spread between
the two securities widened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sovereign spreads will, in our view, remain volatile into
year-end, and the risk-reward of our recommended trade to be
long 10-year Italy versus France has diminished,&#8221;Francesco Garzarelli, chief interest-rate strategist at Goldman Sachs in
London. &#8220;We would now recommend closing this position, looking
to explore opportunities in the same direction at a later
stage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Italian-French 10-year yield spread was at 115 basis
points as of 12:35 p.m. in London, compared with 117 basis
points when Goldman initiated the trade on Sept. 3. The spread
narrowed to 95 basis points on Oct. 26.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co.&#8217;s Schering-Plough unit
won an appeals court ruling that revives its effort to block
Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. from selling a generic form
of the brain-cancer drug Temodar until 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington said in an opinion yesterday that a judge erred in
ruling the patent unenforceable and sent the case back for
further proceedings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, the world&#8217;s biggest generic-drug company, said it
won&#8217;t sell copies of Temodar during the appeal. The two sides
agreed that if Merck won, Teva could begin selling the copy in
August 2013, six months before the patent expires. Temodar,
approved by U.S. regulators in 1999, generated $799 million in
global sales during the first nine months of this year, Merck
said Oct. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court appropriately ruled that the patent for Temodar
in the U.S. is enforceable,&#8221; Bruce N. Kuhlik, general counsel
of Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck, said in a
statement yesterday. &#8220;We invest heavily in RD to discover
innovative medicines like Temodar, and we will vigorously defend
our intellectual property rights.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Teva, said the Petah
Tikva, Israel-based company had no comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Sue L. Robinson in Wilmington,
Delaware, ruled in January that Schering-Plough and British
licensor Cancer Research Technology Ltd. delayed pursuit of the
patent too long and didn&#8217;t provide sufficient information to the
U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit, in a 2-1 decision, said no one was
harmed from the more than nine years it took Cancer Research to
obtain the patent and that there was no intent to deceive the
agency when the inventor failed to disclose a paper he had
written about the compound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Cancer Research Technology Ltd. v. Barr
Laboratories Inc., 2010-1204, U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower court case is Cancer
Research Technology Ltd. v. Barr Laboratories Inc., 07-cv-457,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott, Bayer Ask Court to Narrow Patent-Misconduct Standard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott Laboratories urged a U.S. appeals court to make it
harder for companies to block patent owners from enforcing their
intellectual property rights because of misconduct in obtaining
the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When people are making minor mistakes and the patent
would have been issued anyway, the public is not harmed,&#8221; John
Whealan, a law professor who is representing Abbott in the case,
told the nine-judge U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court, which specializes in patent law, is trying to
find a standard that judges can use to determine when inventors
have committed inequitable conduct at the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. The legal argument has often been used by
generic-drug companies to challenge patents on medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case before the court is an appeal involving an Abbott
dispute with Becton, Dickinson  Co. and Bayer AG&#8217;s health-care
unit over a glucose-monitor design. An Abbott patent was deemed
unenforceable as punishment for the Abbott Park, Illinois-based
company giving contradictory information to the U.S. and
European patent offices on the same invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whealan, the patent office&#8217;s former top lawyer who&#8217;s now an
associate dean at George Washington University, said the court
should have patents deemed unenforceable only if there has been
fraud that was committed to obtain the patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His successor at the patent office, Raymond Chen, said that
if it was too difficult to prove inequitable conduct, patentees
could &#8220;engage in gamesmanship and mischief.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chen said he wants the standard limited because the patent
office is overwhelmed with inventors presenting too much data
for fear they would later be found to have withheld information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allegations of inequitable conduct are raised in about a
third of lawsuits, yet sustained in few, said Circuit Judge
Pauline Newman. Chen called it a &#8220;plague&#8221; in litigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer, Rachel
Krevans from San Francisco&#8217;s Morrison  Foerster LLP, said only
four cases of inequitable conduct have been upheld by the
Federal Circuit, and judges have the option of throwing the
issue out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanofi-Aventis SA&#8217;s patent on a $4 billion-a-year drug, the
blood-thinner Lovenox, was ruled unenforceable when an appeals
court in 2008 found the Paris-based company misled the U.S.
patent office. The court, in a 2-1 decision, said Sanofi
withheld information on studies that compared the active
ingredient of Lovenox with a related compound to ensure the
patent office believed the two were different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America,
which represents drugmakers including Pfizer Inc. and Merck 
Co., urged the court to clarify the standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The oft-cited justification for the inequitable conduct
doctrine is to deter fraudulent conduct before the PTO,&#8221; the
trade group said in a filing on the case. &#8220;In its present form,
however, the doctrine has spiraled out of control.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Circuit judges have been open with their belief
that the legal argument is overused. Chief Judge Randall Rader,
in the April issue of the American University Law Review, said
inequitable conduct has grown &#8220;from a tiny bush on the patent
landscape that inhibited gross fraud into a ubiquitous weed that
infects every prosecution and litigation involving patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Therasense Inc. v. Becton, Dickinson  Co.,
2008-1511, -1512, -1513, -1514, -1595, U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo Accuses Dish of Manipulating Legal System in Patent Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo Inc. accused Dish Network Corp. and EchoStar Corp. of
manipulating the legal system to avoid complying with court
orders to stop offering digital-video recording services that
violate TiVo&#8217;s patent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dish asked  the nine-member U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in Washington yesterday to consider whether U.S.
District Judge David Folsom erred in not granting a full trial,
rather than a hearing, to determine if changes made to the
company&#8217;s software effectively worked around the TiVo patent. A
2-1 panel said in March a hearing was adequate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They have disregarded every provision&#8221; of an order that
they stop infringing the TiVo patent, said Seth Waxman, a lawyer
at WilmerHale who represents Alviso, California-based TiVo.
&#8220;EchoStar continues to violate this patent with devices that
already had their day in court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit accused Dish of violating TiVo&#8217;s patent for
&#8220;time warp&#8221; technology that lets users record a TV program and
play it back at the same time. Dish, which is under court order
to stop DVR service, has continued to provide the feature,
saying it made alterations to bypass TiVo&#8217;s invention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This device is more than colorably different&#8221; from the
one that was before the jury in the 2006 trial, Josh Rosenkranz,
a Dish lawyer at Orrick, Herrington  Sutcliffe LLP in New York,
told the court. &#8220;EchoStar has removed the features that TiVo
said infringed. In order to do that, EchoStar had to innovate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo has said it will be entitled to about $300 million in
damages and contempt sanctions through July 1, 2009, and it will
seek more cash for infringement after that date. That&#8217;s in
addition to $100 million Dish paid TiVo after the original
appeals court ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeal is TiVo v. EchoStar, 2009-1374, U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower-court
case is TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Communications Corp., 04-cv-01,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Marshall). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Caribbean Accused of Infringing Florida Artist&#8217;s Work &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., which took delivery of the
world&#8217;s largest cruise ship Oct. 28, was sued for copyright
infringement by a Coral Gables, Florida-based artist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humberto Benitez said he was approached in 2007 by an art
consultant for the Miami-based cruise line who was seeking two
murals to be installed in a bar aboard a ship under
construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He sent two e-mailed images of his work to the consultant,
after which he said he received a request for a formal proposal
for creating the murals. Benitez estimated the cost to be about
$140,000 and sent a proposal to that effect, according to the
complaint filed Nov. 8 in federal court in Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2007, Benitez was informed his work wasn&#8217;t chosen,
and after his images were returned, he heard no more from the
consultant, he said in his pleadings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benitez said he and 15 family members and friends sailed on
the ship in May as part of his 50th birthday celebration. There
he discovered what he claims are unauthorized derivative copies
of the images he provided the art consultant. He never
authorized the cruise line to copy his work, he said in his
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He contends that the cruise line paid &#8220;another inferior
artist &#8221; to create a &#8220;similar, yet subpar derivative copy&#8221; of
his work. Benitez said the murals are &#8220;woefully inferior&#8221; and
a &#8220;poor replication&#8221; of his work, and that cruise line
passengers may mistakenly believe &#8220;such poor works of art&#8221; are
attributable to him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He asked the court for money damages and awards of attorney
fees and litigation costs and for an order barring the cruise
line from using any unauthorized copies of his work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benitez is represented by Glen H. Waldman and Celina E.
Contreras of Heller Waldman PL of Coconut Grove, Florida. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Humberto Benitez v. Royal Caribbean Cruises
Ltd., 1:10-cv-24029-PAS, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of Florida (Miami). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Seeks &#8216;Onpoint,&#8217; &#8216;Onit&#8217; Trademarks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software company,
filed an application to register &#8220;onpoint&#8221; as a trademark,
according to the database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark

&lt;p&gt;According to the application, filed Nov. 2, Microsoft plans
to use this mark for providing information on various topics to
women. In August the Redmond, Washington-based software company
applied to register &#8220;onit&#8221; for a website portal for topics of

&lt;p&gt;Trademark for Sustainably Produced Palm Products Introduced &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roundable on Sustainable Palm Oil designed a trademark
that will help consumers distinguish products containing palm
ingredients that are from sustainable and socially responsible
sources, the organization said in a statement at its meeting in
Jakarta this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palm oil is used as an ingredient in candles, cosmetics,
cleaning products, food products and as a source of biofuel.
Increasing demand for palm oil has led to deforestation in
tropical areas and loss of habitat for endangered species such
as orangutans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mark will be available to product manufacturers and
retailers in early 2011, according to the statement. It&#8217;s
intended to encourage more companies to commit to using only
certified sustainable palm oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Roundtable is an organization of almost 400 palm
growers, palm oil processors and traders, retailers, investors
and non-governmental organizations such as Oxfam International
and World Wildlife Fund. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obituary &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara Caulfield, IP Litigator, Former Judge Dies at 62 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barbara A. Caulfield, who practiced intellectual-property
and technology litigation at Silicon Valley firms and was the
general counsel of a biotechnology company, died of cancer
yesterday at the age of 62, her firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of her death, Caulfield was a partner at the
Silicon Valley office of New York&#8217;s Kaye Scholer LLP, which she
joined in July from Dewey  LeBoeuf LLP, also of New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was a partner at the now-defunct San Francisco firm
Brobeck, Phleger  Harrison, and also had been a partner at Los
Angeles-based Latham  Watkins LLP and San Francisco&#8217;s Orrick,
Herrington  Sutcliffe LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, President George H.W. Bush appointed her to U.S.
District Court for the Northern District of California, where
she served for three years. When she left the bench to join
Latham, she said her motivation for returning to private
practice was the need to provide financial security for the care
of a disabled daughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caulfield worked for five years as vice president and
general counsel at Affymetrix Inc. of Santa Clara, California, a
maker of products used in genetic analysis. She left Affymetrix
in 2008 to join Dewey  LeBoeuf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caulfield also taught law at the University of Oregon, and
the University of California, Hastings College of Law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She received both her undergraduate and her law degree from
Northwestern University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the firm, no information about a memorial
service is available. Memorial donations may be made to the
Women&#8217;s Cancer Resource Center of Oakland, California. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable bank in Wall Street history, recommended buying
contracts of European gasoil for settlement in January 2011 on
the basis that diesel shortages in China will continue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese supplies of diesel, a category of fuel that
includes gasoil, will be restricted until the end of this year
as a result of Premier Wen Jiabao&#8217;s five-year plan to reduce
energy consumption, Goldman said. China&#8217;s policy of cutting
electricity supplies in order to reach the target has led some
consumers to boost power production from diesel-fired
generators, according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect China to export significantly less diesel and
start to import once again,&#8221; analysts led by David Greely in
New York said in a report today. &#8220;We expect this to tighten the
gasoil market, making it the leading edge of the oil complex.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoil for January delivery was last at $754.50 a ton on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange, having advanced 4.7 percent in
the past month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman closed a separate recommendation to buy December
contracts of crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The bank
said the trade, first suggested on Feb. 5, would have given a
profit of $8.97 a barrel, or 11.5 percent, to investors. Futures
for December delivery last traded at $86.34 a barrel as of 11:16
a.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil prices will be &#8220;substantially higher&#8221; by 2012 as the
global stockpile surplus shrinks and excess production capacity
drops, Goldman said in a note dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crude oil fell in New York before a
government report that may show that U.S. stockpiles rose last
week, while the dollar recovered against the euro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for December delivery fell as much as 62 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $86.10 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange
and was at $86.15 at 11:09 a.m. London time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China is accelerating the yuan&#8217;s
appreciation as part of the &#8220;grand bargain&#8221; to win U.S.
support for Beijing to gain a bigger say at the International
Monetary Fund, says Goldman Sachs Asset Management&#8217;s Jim O&#8217;Neill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s yuan, known as the renminbi, reached the strongest
level against the dollar since 1993 ahead of a Group of 20
leaders meeting this week in Seoul. The gain came after the
IMF&#8217;s executive board approved a plan that would make China the
third-strongest member in the organization, a position described
by the fund&#8217;s chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn as allowing Beijing
to take more &#8220;responsibility&#8221; in the global economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People forget, but the currency has risen by 3 percent
since the summer and has risen nearly 25 percent over five
years,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset, in an
interview on Bloomberg Television. It&#8217;s not a &#8220;fluke&#8221; that
China is given a bigger share at the Washington-based IMF, and
&#8220;that&#8217;s part of the grand bargain,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, who was returning from a nine-day trip to Asia,
including China, also said it&#8217;s &#8220;ridiculous&#8221; to claim that
countries around the world are engaging in a &#8220;currency war.&#8221;
Brazil&#8217;s Finance Minister Guido Mantega used the &#8220;war&#8221; term in
September to complain that countries from the U.S., China to
Japan are pushing to weaken their currencies to gain an export
edge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole currency war thing is ridiculous,&#8221; said
O&#8217;Neill. &#8220;A true currency war will surely be one where the U.S.
bought renminbi. I know this is a great term for people in the
media, but it doesn&#8217;t really make sense to me at all.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yuan High &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yuan rose as much as 0.2 percent to 6.6330 a dollar
today, the strongest level since China unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993, according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trading System. The yuan will rise faster than
the 3 percent traders are betting on in the non-deliverable
forwards, according to O&#8217;Neill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting on an Oct. 23 deal by finance chiefs of the G-20
nations, the IMF agreed last week to shift more than 6 percent
of voting rights to developing countries, while weakening the
clout of European members including Belgium and Germany. The
plan &#8220;may have an influence on the behavior of the Chinese
authorities,&#8221; Managing Director Strauss-Kahn told reporters in
Washington on Nov. 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Banking Crisis &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&#8217;Neill, 53, created the BRICs acronym in 2001 to describe
the rising power of large emerging markets in Brazil, Russia,
India and China. He was named chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management in September after working as the co-head of global
economics research and chief currency economist at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. since 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the interview, O&#8217;Neill also rebuffed speculation that
China may have a banking crisis as the government boosts lending
to stimulate growth during the financial crisis. Harvard
University professor Kenneth Rogoff said in July China&#8217;s
property market had begun a &#8220;collapse&#8221; that would hit the
nation&#8217;s banking system. Fund managers including James Chanos
and Marc Faber also have warned of a crash if a property bubble
isn&#8217;t averted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People in New York seem to be worried about some kind of
Chinese bank crisis,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill. &#8220;That&#8217;s just na&#239;ve. The
Chinese government owns the Chinese banks. Every time I go, I
keep searching for all these things that could go wrong
especially because people are telling me every week. But I
didn&#8217;t see much of it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is moving to reduce its current account surplus in
the share of its economy, a move that the U.S. Treasury endorses,
said O&#8217;Neill. It is the U.S. lawmakers who are intensifying the
tension between the two countries, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The House of Representatives on Sept. 29 passed a bill to
let U.S. companies impose punitive duties on Chinese products to
compensate for a weak yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The relations between the Treasury and China are very
good,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill. &#8220;The problem is something called Congress.
The U.S. politicians need to understand that there&#8217;s plenty of
scope for another big guy on the block as well as themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest
media company, said fourth-quarter profit fell 6.7 percent,
missing analysts&#8217; estimates, after a shift in income from cable
operators whose payments were recorded earlier in the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income shrank to $835 million, or 43 cents a share,
from $895 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, Burbank,
California-based Disney said today in a statement. Excluding
one-time items, profit fell to 45 cents, compared with 47-cent
average of 25 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney recorded revenue from pay-TV services for ESPN in
the quarter ended June 30, sooner than in 2009, resulting in a
drop in the latest period. The film studio posted a profit of
$104 million, reversing a year-ago loss, on box-office sales of
&#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; and revenue from the &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221; DVD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On the revenue side, the big miss was at the media
networks, with both broadcast and cable segments weaker than we
expected,&#8221; said David Joyce, an analyst at Miller Tabak  Co.
in New York who recommends buying the stock. &#8220;On the operating
income side, the biggest miss was at the film studio, where we
expected more based on the strength of &#8216;Toy Story 3.&#8217;&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 1.3 percent to $9.74 billion in the period ended
Oct. 2, missing the $10 billion average of 20 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Results included a
restructuring cost of $58 million, or 2 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, also the world&#8217;s biggest theme-park operator, rose
68 cents to $36.60 in extended trading. The stock dropped $1.06
to $35.93 in regular New York Stock Exchange composite trading
after the report was released early. Disney has advanced 11
percent this year. The company said it is investigating how the
information became available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cable Advertising &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from cable networks, including ESPN and Disney
Channel, slid 6.2 percent to $3.13 billion because of the shift
in pay-TV revenue. Income dropped 28 percent to $1.07 billion,
also a result of the swing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ESPN advertising sales rose 19 percent in the quarter,
Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said on a conference call.
Fees paid by cable operators increased 9 percent in the period
and 10 percent for the year, he said. Those fees will be higher
in fiscal 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operating profit at the broadcasting division, led by the
ABC network and local TV stations, jumped to $147 million from
$2 million a year earlier. Revenue slid 7.5 percent to $1.29
billion, the company said. Adjusted for the extra week, ad sales
at Disney&#8217;s ABC stations was 26 percent higher than a year ago,
the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Toy Story&#8217; DVD &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; and DVD revenue from &#8220;Iron Man 2&#8221;
contributed the bulk of the film studio&#8217;s $104 million in
operating profit, compared with a $13 million loss a year ago.
&#8220;Toy Story 3,&#8221; the biggest U.S. movie of the year, has
collected $1.06 billion in worldwide box-office sales, according
to Box Office Mojo, an industry website. Studio revenue
increased 6.4 percent to $1.59 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Toy Story 3&#8221; DVD sales will do &#8220;quite well,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger said on the call, without
providing a specific estimate. He said 25 percent of &#8220;Toy Story
3&#8221; buyers have opted for Blu-Ray versions and of those
customers, 80 percent chose more expensive discs that come with
a digital copy of the movie, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theme-park revenue declined almost 1 percent to $2.82
billion as the company continued to reduce bargains used during
the U.S. recession to bolster attendance. Profit fell 8.1
percent to $316 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attendance at U.S. theme parks fell 6 percent in the
period. Adjusted for the extra week, attendance would have risen
1 percent, Rasulo said. Advance bookings at its U.S. operations
are 5 percent higher than a year earlier, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capital Spending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said capital spending will rise by $1 billion
in fiscal 2011 due to theme park expansion and the addition of
new cruise ships. The company spent $2.11 billion in the year
just ended. Disney also expects retirement costs to rise by $100
million this fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s consumer products unit increased profit 22 percent
to $184 million as sales grew 13 percent to $730 million. The
interactive unit narrowed its loss to $104 million as revenue
gained 20 percent to $188 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iger said Disney is investing less in producing console
games and more in casual online video games. The company is
focused on making its interactive division profitable, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would be disappointed if we continue to lose a
significant amount of money in those businesses, and if we do, I
would imagine we will have to redirect in some form,&#8221; Iger
said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to be in this business if we&#8217;re not going
to be able to make money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
clients exit a bet that Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies will
gain on concern the central bank will raise borrowing costs to
tame inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who followed the New York-based firm&#8217;s advice
would have earned a return of 11.3 percent as the Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of 40 companies rose above 14,000 from
12,616.01 since April 1, when the trade was initiated, analysts
Robin Brooks and Dominic Wilson wrote in a research note. The
recommendation was among the nine &#8220;Top Trades&#8221; Goldman Sachs
made for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation is above policy makers&#8217; &#8220;comfort zone&#8221; and more
policy &#8220;tightening&#8221; will likely occur, the New York-based
analysts wrote in the report. &#8220;The near-term risk-reward for
this position also looks unappealing as we approach the year-end
&#8216;roll-off,&#8217;&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Missiles Reach Bases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese military&#8217;s non-nuclear missiles have &#8220;the
capability to attack&#8221; and close down five of six major U.S. Air
Force bases in South Korea and Japan, an unpublished government
report says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s improved inventory of short- and medium-range
missiles provides a &#8220;dramatic increase&#8221; in its ability to
&#8220;inhibit&#8221; U.S. military operations in the western Pacific,
according to excerpts from the draft of the 2010 annual report
by the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission
scheduled for release on Nov. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AgriBank Joins Index &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., which completed the
world&#8217;s third-biggest initial public offering this year, will
join Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng China Enterprises Index following a
quarterly review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. will also join the measure
while Datang International Power Generation Co. and
Metallurgical Corp. of China Ltd. will be deleted, Hang Seng
Indexes Co. said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. Changes
will take effect Dec. 6. The number of constituents on the H-
share index of Chinese companies will stay at 40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, Sina Venture &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Internet venture in China and Sina Corp.,
owner of the country&#8217;s third-most-visited web portal, will offer
services including instant messaging, challenging industry
leader Tencent Holdings Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai MSN Network Communications Technology Co., 50
percent-owned by Microsoft, will collaborate with Sina on blogs,
mini-blogs, mobile-phone content, and instant messaging,
according to a joint statement by the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EU Renews Tariff &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union renewed tariffs against China on a
chemical used by plastic-bottle mold makers such as Resilux NV
and bottlers including Coca-Cola Co., saying the levies limit
the risk of a surge in imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The EU re-imposed the duties of as much as 184 euros ($253)
a metric ton on polyethylene terephthalate until November 2015
to curb import competition for European producers including
Spain&#8217;s Novapet SA. Polyethylene terephthalate, also used in
plastic films and fibers, is known as PET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Vase Auction &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elaborately decorated Qianlong-dynasty porcelain vase
sold for a record 51.6 million pounds ($83 million) as Chinese
buyers competed for Imperial-associated trophies at the &#8220;Asian
Art in London&#8221; event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16-inch-high piece had been discovered during a routine
house clearance in the suburb of Pinner, said Bainbridges, a
west London auction house. It had estimated the vase to fetch
between 800,000 pounds and 1.2 million pounds. The hammer price
was 43 million pounds before 20 percent fees, making it the
highest for any Chinese artwork sold at auction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARKETS &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell for the third time this week as Cisco
Systems Inc. said profit will miss analyst estimates, while the
euro weakened and Irish bonds slid amid concern indebted
European nations may need bailouts. London copper touched a
record as China&#8217;s industrial production grew. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index sank 0.4 percent to
1,213.54 at 4 p.m. in New York. The measure extended losses
after Walt Disney Co. reported earnings that trailed estimates.
The euro weakened against 14 of its 16 most-traded peers and
reached a one-month low versus the dollar. The yield on Irish
10-year bonds rose to a record 6.52 percentage points above
benchmark German bunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco&#8217;s forecast triggered a selloff in technology
companies, the group that has led the SP 500&#8217;s 16 percent rally
since the end of August. Bank shares followed the euro and Irish
bonds lower after French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said
that investors must share the cost of sovereign debt
restructurings, backing a German call that helped drive yields
on so-called peripheral bonds to record highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE FOLLOWING STOCKS MAY BE ACTIVE TODAY: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288 CH): The nation&#8217;s
third-largest bank by assets will be added to Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang
Seng China Enterprises Index starting Dec. 6, according to index
compiler Hang Seng Indexes Co. The stock added 1.1 percent to
2.80 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citic Securities Co. (600030 CH): China&#8217;s biggest listed
brokerage said it received the approval from the China
Securities Regulatory Commission to sell a 45 percent stake in
China Securities Co. for 1.22 billion yuan ($184.2 million). The
stock rose 1.1 percent to 15.64 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNHTC Jinan Truck Co. (000951 CH): The listed unit of the
country&#8217;s largest heavy truck producer said sales volume rose 41
percent in the first 10 months from a year earlier to 92,836
units. The stock dropped 0.7 percent to 29.49 yuan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hengli Properties Development (Group) Ltd. (169 HK) The
developer said it will increase the amount raised in a rights
offer to HK$111.9 million from HK$67 million by offering one new
share for each one held, up from three for each five. The stock
will resume trading in Hong Kong today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Long Holdings Ltd. (183 HK): The developer will sell,
for 120 million yuan, its 52 percent stake in a unit that&#8217;s
building a hotel, housing and commercial project in Guangdong.
Hong Long book a gain of HK$137.4 million. The stock will resume
trading in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ricardo Salinas, Mexico&#8217;s second-
richest person according to Forbes magazine, is challenging
Grupo Televisa SA with a new cable-TV service in the nation&#8217;s
capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Play, a unit of Salinas&#8217;s Mexico City-based mobile-
phone carrier Grupo Iusacell SA, offers packages of video, Web
and phone service in 13 Mexico City neighborhoods, with plans to
expand, according to the company&#8217;s website. Iusacell executives
declined to comment, said Dan McCosh, a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video service gives closely held Iusacell, which began
offering Internet and land-line phone calls in parts of Mexico&#8217;s
three biggest cities this year, a new way to lure customers from
Mexico City-based Televisa, which controls three of the nation&#8217;s
largest cable-TV carriers. Salinas&#8217;s TV Azteca SA is the second-
biggest broadcaster in Mexico after Televisa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Play&#8217;s packages of video, voice and Internet range
from 649 pesos to 1,399 pesos ($53 to $114) a month. The
cheapest plan has download speeds of as much as 5 megabits a
second. The comparable package at Televisa&#8217;s Mexico City carrier
Empresas Cablevision SAB costs 699 pesos a month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa Executive Vice President Alfonso de Angoitia said
last month the company is examining ways to enter the mobile-
phone market, where Iusacell is the third-biggest carrier behind
America Movil SAB and Telefonica SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Play also represents new competition for Mexican
billionaire Carlos Slim, the world&#8217;s richest man, according to
Forbes. His Telefonos de Mexico SAB has about 70 percent of
Mexico&#8217;s high-speed Internet subscribers and 79 percent of its
phone customers. The company has a partnership with satellite-TV
provider Dish Mexico, co-owned by EchoStar Corp. and MVS
Comunicaciones SA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa fell 94 centavos, or 1.6 percent, to 56.63 pesos
at 4:10 p.m. New York time in trading in Mexico City. Telmex
dropped 6 centavos to 9.57 pesos. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. denied a
Dow Jones Newswires report that it will stop taking orders early
for General Motors Co.&#8217;s initial public offering, according to
spokeswoman Andrea Rachman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The report that Goldman Sachs is no longer taking orders
or won&#8217;t be taking orders, or will stop taking orders on Friday
at noon is incorrect,&#8221; Rachman said in a phone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Jones earlier reported that New York-based Goldman
Sachs would close its books on GM&#8217;s initial offering tomorrow at
noon, citing Scott Sweet, managing director at research firm
IPOBoutique.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM, 61 percent owned by the U.S. government and based in
Detroit, plans to raise $10.6 billion in an IPO scheduled for
Nov. 17, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended
clients exit a bet that Hong Kong-listed companies in China will
gain on concern the central bank will raise borrowing costs to
tame inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who followed the New York-based firm&#8217;s advice
would have earned a return of 11.3 percent as the Hang Seng
China Enterprises Index of 40 companies rose above 14,000 from

Robin Brooks and Dominic Wilson wrote in a research note today.
The recommendation was among the nine &#8220;Top Trades&#8221; Goldman
Sachs made for 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s annual inflation rate jumped to a two-year high of
4.4 percent in October while retail sales rose 18.6 percent from
a year earlier, the statistics bureau said today. China
increased reserve requirements for some banks twice yesterday,
taking the total increase to 100 basis points for a few lenders,
according to two people with direct knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation is above policy makers&#8217; &#8220;comfort zone&#8221; and more
&#8220;tightening&#8221; will likely occur, the New York-based analysts
wrote in the report. &#8220;The near-term risk-reward for this
position also looks unappealing as we approach the year-end
&#8216;roll-off,&#8217;&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gain of Chinese stocks in Hong Kong beat the 2.7
percent increase in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and 10.8
percent advance in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 22
developing nations during the period. China overtook Japan to
become the second-largest economy in the world in the second
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Reserve Requirements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The H-share index reached 14,204.13 on Nov. 8, the
strongest level since May 2008, and closed at 14,088.03 today.
Goldman Sachs had a &#8220;target&#8221; of 15,000 for the trade
recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has closed four of the nine &#8220;Top&#8221; trades,
including two money-losing ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clients following the bank&#8217;s advice would have lost 24
basis points trading interest-rate swaps for the U.K. and
Australia and lost 168 basis points in cross-currency swaps in
Turkey. The advice of buying credit-default swaps in Spain and
selling similar contracts in Ireland returned 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profitable Advice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the five remaining recommendations are poised to
be profitable, including buying Russian stocks, wagering a rally
in currencies tied to growth and a trade involving U.S. stock
volatility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade of buying the Polish zloty against the Japanese
yen has declined 12 percent since it was initiated in December
and the bet on the British pound&#8217;s gain versus the New Zealand&#8217;s
dollar has lost 10.6 percent, according to data compiled by
Goldman Sachs and Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The People&#8217;s Bank of China said in a statement yesterday
banks&#8217; reserve requirements will rise 50 basis points from Nov.
16, the first nationwide increase since May. China ordered some
lenders, including Bank of Communications Co., to raise their
reserve ratios by an additional 50 basis points, or 0.5
percentage point, from Nov. 15, a person with direct knowledge
of the matter said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;long-term outlook&#8221; for emerging-market stocks
remains favorable as growth in developing nations is &#8220;robust&#8221;
and the companies there benefit from the low interest rates in
major economies, the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be important to be more selective going
forward,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)&#8217;s Internet venture
in China and Sina Corp. (SINA), owner of the country&#8217;s third-most-visited web portal, will offer services including instant
messaging, challenging industry leader Tencent Holdings Ltd. (700) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai MSN Network Communications Technology Co., 50
percent-owned by Microsoft, will collaborate with Sina on blogs,
mini-blogs, mobile-phone content, and instant messaging,
according to a joint statement by the companies today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is strengthening ties with Chinese online
companies to expand in the world&#8217;s biggest Internet market by
subscribers. Tencent, the biggest local Internet company,
yesterday said a dispute that&#8217;s affected users of its market-leading QQ instant-messaging service has yet to be resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;QQ accounted for 77 percent of China&#8217;s instant-messaging
market at the end of last year, compared with 4.2 percent for
Microsoft&#8217;s MSN, according to research company Analysys
International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website of Sina, based in Shanghai, ranks behind only
Baidu Inc. (BIDU), China&#8217;s biggest search-engine, and Tencent&#8217;s QQ.com
in user traffic in China, according to China Websites Ranking, a
site run by the Internet Society of China that compiles Web
traffic information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many as 3 percent of QQ&#8217;s subscribers may be affected by
Tencent&#8217;s Nov. 3 decision to stop support for computers with
software made by 360.cn, a Chinese security software company,
according to estimates by Mizuho Securities Asia Ltd. analyst
Muzhi Li last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark Papermaster, who oversaw Apple
Inc.&#8217;s mobile-device engineering until he left in August after
criticism of the iPhone&#8217;s antenna design, has joined Cisco
Systems Inc. as a vice president working on chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papermaster is responsible for chips that go into the Nexus
7000 and Catalyst switches, products that help route network
data, said Neil Wu Becker, a spokesman for Cisco, the world&#8217;s
largest maker of networking equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papermaster, a former executive at International Business
Machines Corp., left Apple in August amid criticism of the
iPhone&#8217;s antenna design. The phone can lose signal strength if
held a certain way, prompting Consumer Reports magazine not to
recommend the device -- the first time it hasn&#8217;t endorsed an
iPhone model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papermaster faced an earlier controversy when he was hired
at Apple. The move prompted a legal fight with IBM, who said he
violated an agreement not to work for a competitor within a year
of leaving. The dispute was resolved in January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switches are Cisco&#8217;s biggest source of revenue, accounting
for 33 percent of sales last quarter, or $3.61 billion. Earlier
this week, the company forecast sales and profit that fell short
of analysts&#8217; estimates. The outlook triggered the biggest
decline in the stock price since 1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco, based in San Jose, California, fell 37 cents to
$20.15 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading today. The shares have
tumbled 16 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;United Parcel Service Inc., the
world&#8217;s largest package-delivery business, and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. paced $36.1 billion of corporate bond issuance this week as
sales accelerated amid borrowing costs near record lows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPS offered $2 billion of bonds to pay for pension-fund
contributions, helping push dollar-denominated corporate sales
past $1 trillion for the second consecutive year, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S.
bank by assets behind Bank of America Corp., sold $1.75 billion
of five-year senior holding company notes, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company bond offerings climbed 27 percent from the five
days through Nov. 5, when volume was $28.4 billion, as companies
took advantage of record low yields and strong demand from
institutional money managers, said Sean Slein at Dwight Asset
Management in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s been a bit of a change in the risk people are
willing to take,&#8221; said Slein, who helps oversee about $800
million of high-yield debt. &#8220;There&#8217;s still some skittishness
concerning equities and worry about the economy remaining on
this upward track. Money managers are looking at high-yield as
getting equity-like returns with half the volatility.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HCA Inc., the hospital chain acquired four years ago in a
$33 billion leveraged buyout, sold $1.53 billion of notes to
lead $11.6 billion of high-yield, high-risk corporate bond
issuance. Sales of the debt climbed 40 percent from the week
ended Nov. 5, when offerings reached $8.23 billion, Bloomberg
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Issuer&#8217;s Market&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an issuer&#8217;s market right now, and underwriters are
taking full advantage of that and pricing offerings fairly
aggressively,&#8221; said Slein. &#8220;If money keeps coming into this
asset class, it&#8217;s going to have to be put somewhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average yield on junk debt rose 9 basis points to 7.66
percent from Nov. 5. It touched 7.55 percent on Nov. 9, the
lowest since March 2005, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch&#8217;s U.S. High Yield Master II Index. The extra yield
investors demand to own junk bonds instead of Treasuries fell 4
basis points to 575 basis points, index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales this week compare with the 2010 average of $22.5
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance may
remain elevated after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
last week announced a plan to buy $600 billion of Treasuries in
an effort to slash unemployment and avert deflation, putting
pressure on U.S. interest rates to fall and encouraging
investors to buy bonds with higher-yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Supportive&#8217; Conditions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Away from an exogenous shock to the market, there is
little I see on the horizon that could change the supportive
technical and fundamental backdrop,&#8221; said Peter Aherne, head of
capital markets and syndicate at Citigroup Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LGE and KU Energy LLC and its Louisville Gas  Electric
Co. and Kentucky Utilities Co. units sold a combined $2.91
billion of debt on Nov. 8 to lead investment-grade issuance this
week, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With rates this low, why not borrow today when you can?&#8221;
Timothy Cox, an executive director of debt capital markets at
Mizuho Securities USA in New York, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;Companies can improve their balance sheets and
continue to pay out higher-coupon debt due down the road, so why
not act now, because who knows what the future brings?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-Grade Spreads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own investment-grade
debt instead of Treasuries was unchanged from Nov. 5 at 176,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Corporate
Master index. Yields were 3.75 percent, up from 3.57 percent
last week. Yields touched 3.53 reached on Nov. 4, the lowest
since the daily index was made available about 24 years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The depth and breadth of issuance and the quality of
demand we saw, all suggests that the market tone remains very
supportive from a technical and fundamental point of view,&#8221;
Aherne said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ClubCorp Club Operations Inc. is among companies planning
to sell dollar-denominated debt in November. The golf-course
company may sell $415 million of eight-year notes as soon as
next week, according to a person familiar with the offering.
Proceeds may be used to repay borrowings under the company&#8217;s
senior secured credit facilities, said the person, who declined
to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co., the world&#8217;s biggest
media company, rose the most in six months after analysts said
fourth-quarter profit topped estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding restructuring and impairment costs of $216
million, profit amounted to 50 cents a share, according to
Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Nomura Securities International
Inc. in New York. That beat the 47-cent average of 25 analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney gained $1.82, or 5.1 percent, to $37.75 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest advance
since May. Disney Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo fully
disclosed restructuring, programming and film studio writedowns
during the company&#8217;s conference call after U.S. markets closed
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Upon scanning the press release, the results seemed
weak,&#8221; Nathanson wrote in a note today. &#8220;However, it turns out
that you can&#8217;t judge a quarter by a press release.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday the stock fell $1.06, or 2.9 percent, to $35.93
after the report was released early, before U.S. markets closed.
The company said it is investigating how the information became
available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income fell 6.7 percent to $835 million, or 43 cents a
share, from $895 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier, Burbank,
California-based Disney said yesterday. Sales slid 1.3 percent
to $9.74 billion in the period ended Oct. 2, missing the $10
billion average of 20 analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney had a $100 million writedown of film inventory, a
$58 million charge for programming writeoffs at its Lifetime
network, and restructuring and impairment charges of $58
million, Rasulo said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anthony DiClemente, an analyst with Barclays Capital in New
York, also told clients in a note today that adjusted earnings
amounted to 50 cents a share excluding the above items. Disney
reported adjusted per-share earnings of 45 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiClemente and Nathanson recommend buying the stock. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the Wall
Street firm that makes more money trading equities than any
other bank, stopped providing clearing services for some of its
smallest U.S. clients, three people told of the decision said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs limited clearing for accounts that manage
less than $5 million, lifting the previous $1 million threshold,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the
decision was private. While the firm continues to clear trades
for some accounts below the new limit, it&#8217;s winnowing out
clients that are riskier, have lower growth prospects and are
more retail rather than institutional in focus, one of the
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are conducting a routine analysis of our business and
in some cases the profile of clients was not consistent with our
current standards and criteria,&#8221; said Ed Canaday, a spokesman
for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s equities division generated $5.43 billion
in revenue for the first nine months of the year, down 32
percent from $7.95 billion in the same period of 2009, according
to the bank&#8217;s third-quarter earnings report. The firm handles
U.S. clearing through its registered broker-dealer subsidiary,
Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing LP, known as GSEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm started the review of the business about four or
five months ago, according to one of the people familiar with
the matter. The company notified a number of clients this week
that the changes would mean they would have to find new clearing
agents, two other people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the decision wasn&#8217;t a reaction to any of the new U.S.
rules for Wall Street, it was partly in response to increasing
regulatory scrutiny, one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., the biggest
U.S. lender, asked a federal judge to throw out a lawsuit
brought by foreclosed homeowners who accuse it of racketeering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwayne Ransom Davis and Melisa Davis sued last month in
Indianapolis, claiming Bank of America &#8220;routinely&#8221; submitted
perjured affidavits to support foreclosures. They lost their
Knightstown, Indiana, home last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, in papers filed
Nov. 10 with U.S. District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson, said the
Davises were improperly using a federal court to attack a state
court proceeding and hadn&#8217;t shown they were injured. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While plaintiffs claim they do not seek to overturn the
judgment in the foreclosure action, it is clear they are trying
to do precisely that,&#8221; in violation of federal law, Bank of
America told the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Davises didn&#8217;t ask the court to reverse their September
2009 foreclosure. They said in their complaint that the use of
&#8220;robo-signers&#8221;, or people who sign affidavits attesting to
facts underlying foreclosures without actual knowledge of them,
constitutes racketeering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They seek class-action, or group, status for anyone whose
home was taken under such circumstances since October 2006, and
compensatory damages, which would be tripled under U.S.
racketeering laws. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Davis v. Countrywide Home Loans Inc., 10cv1303,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of Indiana
(Indianapolis). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill Banker Indicted With 18 in Brazil Says He&#8217;s Scapegoat &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just before dawn on a cool June morning, six submachine-
gun-wielding federal agents charged into Alexandre Caiado&#8217;s Sao
Paulo apartment. After arresting him, they hustled Caiado into a
pickup truck for a 30-block drive to Merrill Lynch  Co.&#8217;s
office, where he had been working as a private banker for two
years, Bloomberg News&#8217; Alexander Ragir and Michael Smith report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the agents scoured Caiado&#8217;s desktop computer, Mary
Livingston, a lawyer for Merrill, sat down alone with Caiado.
&#8220;She gave me very specific instructions,&#8221; says Caiado,
recalling the scene in 2006. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t supposed to say what I
really did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors charged Caiado with arranging illegal fund
transfers for Merrill clients -- part of what has become a four-
year investigation into bankers helping clients secretly move
undeclared money abroad to evade Brazilian income taxes,
Bloomberg Markets magazine reports in its December issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caiado&#8217;s work at Merrill was part of a pattern in which
bankers helped clients move undeclared money in and out of
Brazil in ways that couldn&#8217;t be tracked by tax authorities, says
Deltan Dallagnol, a prosecutor handling Caiado&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Livingston, the lawyer who was with Caiado on the day he
was arrested, says Merrill sent her and two or three other
lawyers to the office to help Caiado. She says she talked to him
as police were searching for records. She declined to confirm or
deny that she told Caiado to not tell police what he really did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not responding to that,&#8221; she says. Asked if she
disputes Caiado&#8217;s account, she says, &#8220;I am not going to dignify
his story with an explanation.&#8221; He has no credibility because
he&#8217;s suing Merrill, she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill spokesman Bill Halldin says the firm is fighting
the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are vigorously defending ourselves in that matter,&#8221;
Halldin says. No Merrill officer or director in Brazil has ever
been charged with a crime, he says. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BASF Wins Appeal Over Customers&#8217; Vitamin-Cartel Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BASF SE, Roche Holding AG and Sanofi-Aventis SA can&#8217;t be
sued by a group of customers who claim they paid too much for
vitamins during a price-fixing cartel in the 1990s, a U.K.
appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeal in London today ruled the companies
missed a two-year deadline for filing the lawsuit. The ruling
upheld the Competition Appeal Tribunal&#8217;s decision that the court
couldn&#8217;t extend the time limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was and is no power to extend time&#8221; to sue, Judge
Timothy Lloyd wrote in the unanimous ruling from a three-judge
panel. &#8220;The claim was rightly dismissed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union in 2001 fined Roche, BASF, Aventis SA
and five other companies a then-record 855.2 million euros ($1.2
billion) for working together to inflate vitamin prices. The
collusion was &#8220;the most damaging series of cartels the
commission has ever investigated,&#8221; Mario Monti, who was then EU
Competition Commissioner, said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a good result for business,&#8221; said Clare Canning,
BASF&#8217;s lawyer at the firm Mayer Brown LLP in London. &#8220;It
provides certainty in this economic climate, in which the
limitation of financial damage is ever more important.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The customers, including BCL Old Co. and Grampian Country
Food Group Ltd., sued in March and May 2008, just before they
believed the statute of limitations was about to expire. They
based the deadline on the cartel&#8217;s appeal of the EU fines in
Brussels. In May 2009, the U.K. Court of Appeal ruled the group
had missed the deadline because the cartel appealed only the EU
fines and not the price-fixing allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that court loss, the customers asked the Competition
Appeal Tribunal, which handles U.K. antitrust cases, to use its
discretion to extend their window for suing. The tribunal in
November denied the request, which lead to the latest appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A call to the law firm representing the customers, Taylor
Vinters, wasn&#8217;t returned and the individual customers couldn&#8217;t
immediately be reached. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milan&#8217;s Banks Failed to Shop Around, Prosecution Witness Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four banks on trial for fraud for misselling
derivatives to the City of Milan failed to shop around for
competing quotes that would have made the cost of the swaps more
transparent, a prosecution witness said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gianluca Fusai, a finance professor at the University of
East Piedmont, told a court in Milan on Nov. 10 that the banks,
which had been hired to arrange a bond sale and subsequently
proposed swaps to adjust the interest payments on the bonds,
acted as consultants to the city. As such, the securities firms
should have found the best swap prices for the client, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lenders &#8220;didn&#8217;t examine the cost of doing the swaps
with other banks,&#8221; Fusai said. A range of bids for the
derivatives would have brought transparency, he said after more
than 10 hours of questioning over three hearings since Oct. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank AG, Depfa Bank Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
UBS AG are accused of misleading Milan and earning 101 million
euros ($139 million) in hidden fees from the transactions. The
banks first sold interest-rate swaps to the city on 1.7 billion
euros of bonds. The banks deny the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italian municipalities are required to sell repayment bonds
or create a payment plan if they sell a so-called bullet bond
which is repaid at maturity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fusai said that Milan should have considered the option of
selling repayment bonds, which wouldn&#8217;t have required a swap.
Local governments including the regions of Lazio, Sicily and
Sardinia have successfully sold the bonds, some with durations
of as long as 30 years, he said. Instead, Milan sold a bullet
bond with an amortizing swap arranged by the banks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fusai said the banks charged Milan 52 million euros at the
start of the swap. He said that so-called implicit cost marked
the difference between the city&#8217;s and the banks&#8217; credit risks.
He didn&#8217;t account for the cost the banks faced in arranging the
transactions in his calculation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milan is making money on the transactions and has received
about 30 million euros by swapping the fixed rate on its
borrowings for a variable rate with Deutsche Bank, the bank&#8217;s
lawyer said at a hearing on Nov. 3. The city has a mark-to-
market gain on the contract at current prices, said the lawyer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a partial picture,&#8221; said Fusai. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t
reflect the risks assumed.&#8221; The city is receiving money today
and has pushed back its borrowings, Fusai said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not
interested in the mark-to-market at a generic date but when the
contract is agreed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. Officials
for JPMorgan, UBS and Depfa couldn&#8217;t immediately comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Morgan Stanley Oil Chief Denied $30 Million in Finra Ruling &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s former oil-trading chief, Olav Refvik,
lost a demand for $30 million after accusing the firm of
&#8220;wrongful termination&#8221; and other mistreatment, according to a
ruling by industry arbitrators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refvik, who left the firm in 2008, had also levied claims
including breach of implied contract, unjust enrichment and
improper forfeiture of vested stock and options, according to
the Oct. 27 ruling released by the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority. The ruling doesn&#8217;t provide details on the allegations
or the rationale for the arbitrators&#8217; decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refvik left the bank and the board of TransMontaigne
Partners LP, an oil transportation and storage company owned by
Morgan Stanley, the unit said in October 2008, about three
months after the bank gave his responsibilities to a colleague.
He filed a claim in March 2009, the ruling shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re obviously very pleased with the ruling,&#8221; said Mark
Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley, declining
to elaborate on the dispute. The bank is the sixth-largest in
the U.S. by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refvik didn&#8217;t return phone calls and e-mails seeking
comment. He retired from Morgan Stanley after 18 years at the
firm, according to his biography on the website of Arrowhawk
Capital Partners, a Darien, Connecticut-based hedge-fund manager
that he helped found. He joined Noble Group Ltd. this year as
global head of oil and oil-products trading, energy-news website
SparkSpread reported in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls also weren&#8217;t returned from two lawyers listed by
Finra as representing him, Jeffrey Liddle and Christine Palmieri
of New York-based Liddle  Robinson LLP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WestLB Loses Trial Over Valuation Claim Against Nomura &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nomura Holdings Inc. unit doesn&#8217;t owe WestLB AG the $22.3
million the German lender bailed out during the financial crisis
was seeking at trial, a London court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nomura International Plc &#8220;acted irrationally&#8221; in
valuing securities in an investment fund after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., WestLB failed to prove that
valuation resulted in it losing any money it wouldn&#8217;t have
otherwise, Judge Nigel Teare ruled yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WestLB &#8220;failed to prove on the balance of probabilities
that the shares had a value in excess of the defendants&#8217; fee and
so has failed to prove that it has suffered any damage,&#8221; Teare
said in his judgment. The value of the securities determined by
Nomura isn&#8217;t binding, he said. The judge denied WestLB
permission to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WestLB claimed at a trial in the High Court in London that
Nomura International last year used a &#8220;fraudulent&#8221; bidding
procedure to determine the value of shares in an investment fund
after missing a deadline to deliver notes that were linked to
the shares rather than pay their cash value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomura &#8220;acted irrationally in limiting its investigation
of value to a dealer poll,&#8221; yet it didn&#8217;t act &#8220;dishonestly,&#8221;
Teare said in the judgment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the trading desk in Nomura International&#8217;s
structured credit group conducted a dealer poll in February by
sending bid requests on the securities to banks including
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG, Standard
Chartered Plc, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG,
according to the judgment. None of the dealers were interested,
so the Tokyo-based lender concluded the shares were worthless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are surprised and disappointed at the judge&#8217;s ruling
and are considering an appeal,&#8221; West LB said in an e-mailed
statement. The German lender would have to apply directly to the
Court of Appeal in London to challenge the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WestLB, based in Dusseldorf, had claimed Nomura should have
used the $22.3 million cash value of the notes established by
the fund&#8217;s manager, Mauritian International Trust Co., or Mitco.
Nomura said that valuation wasn&#8217;t reliable because it didn&#8217;t
outline its methodology or the fund&#8217;s underlying assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nomura is satisfied with today&#8217;s decision,&#8221; the bank
said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;We have always maintained that
WestLB&#8217;s claim was without foundation. We now consider the
matter concluded.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On The Docket &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;British Court to Consider BAE Radar Deal in Tanzania Nov. 23 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A U.K. court will start considering on Nov. 23 whether to
approve a &#8220;plea agreement&#8221; under which BAE Systems Plc will
pay as much as 30 million pounds ($48.4 million) in compensation
to Tanzania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The date was given in an e-mailed statement Nov. 10 from
the British High Commission in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania&#8217;s
commercial capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europe&#8217;s biggest defence contractor reached the deal this
year with the U.K. Serious Fraud Office to end a five-year probe
into whether it enticed Tanzanian officials to buy a radar
system with payments. The proposed settlement package needs
court approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alstom Gets Eurostar Trial Date for October 2011 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alstom SA said the High Court of London set October 2011 as
a date for a trial to judge on the fairness of a tender in which
Eurostar Group Ltd. picked high-speed trains made by German
rival Siemens AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a preliminary hearing Nov. 10, the court ordered Eurostar
to disclose the documents relating to the evaluations of the
offers, Alstom also said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s stock market may surge as
much as 70 percent to a record by the end of 2011 as low
interest rates worldwide and &#8220;reasonable&#8221; valuations lure
investors, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation&#8217;s benchmark Bovespa Index may climb to 122,000
next year in JPMorgan&#8217;s &#8220;positive&#8221; scenario that assumes
&#8220;risk-free&#8221; interest rates remain low, Ben Laidler, a
strategist for the bank, wrote in a report today. The rally may
be driven by a pickup in foreign inflows, along with the removal
of &#8220;overhangs&#8221; including the world&#8217;s largest share sale by
Petroleo Brasileiro SA in September and last month&#8217;s
presidential election, Laidler wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa has climbed 3.8 percent this year to 71,195.16
yesterday, trailing a 14 percent gain in the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index. Laidler advised holding &#8220;overweight&#8221; positions
in Brazilian stocks relative to the country&#8217;s weighting in the
MSCI EM Latin America Index of regional shares and said
investors should focus on companies that rely on domestic demand
such as financial firms and homebuilders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Macro fundamentals are robust,&#8221; Laidler wrote. Credit
conditions are very supportive and &#8220;valuations are not
stretched,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa may fall 14 percent in JPMorgan&#8217;s &#8220;cautious&#8221;
scenario that assumes earnings decline, according to the report.
The MSCI EM Latin America Index of regional shares has an
&#8220;upside&#8221; of 53 percent through 2011 and a potential
&#8220;downside&#8221; of 14 percent, Laidler wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s Natrecor is safe
for heart failure patients, though it offers few benefits,
according to a study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natrecor, given intravenously, was one of the first drugs
for congestive heart failure when it was approved in 2001, and
in 2004 it generated $230 million in revenue. Sales plummeted to
less than $100 million in 2006 after reviews of its use in less
than 1,000 patients tied the medicine to worsening kidney
function and higher death rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newest study, in 7,141 patients, was reported today at
the American Heart Association meeting in Chicago. It found the
drug is safe, and that it slightly improved shortness of breath,
a symptom of worsening heart failure. The benefit, though,
didn&#8217;t last and the findings are unlikely to make Natrecor a
significant contributor to JJ&#8217;s sales, said Michael Weinstein,
a New York-based analyst at JPMorgan Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Natrecor died years ago, so it would be hard to
revitalize,&#8221; Weinstein said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 6 million people in the U.S. have heart failure,
when a weakened heart is unable to pump enough blood to fuel the
body. The U.S. will spend $39.2 billion treating it this year,
according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $100 million study from New Brunswick, New Jersey-based
Johnson  Johnson, dubbed Ascend-HF, was carried out in 30
countries worldwide. It started treatment within 24 hours and
continued to use the drug for as long as a week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Died or Re-Hospitalized &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A month after treatment, 9.4 percent of Natrecor patients
and 10.1 percent given placebo had died or were re-hospitalized
because of their heart failure, the study found. All patients
were also receiving standard treatment, generally diuretics,
morphine and other medicines intended to offer comfort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2009, the U.S. Justice Department joined two
whistleblower lawsuits accusing JJ&#8217;s Scios unit of marketing
Natrecor for uses other than those approved by the U.S. The suit
alleges that after the drug went on the market, Scios began an
&#8220;aggressive&#8221; campaign to market the drug to doctors for
patients outside the hospital with less severe heart failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The criminal investigation is continuing and discussions
are under way in an effort to settle this matter,&#8221; JJ said in
a regulatory filing on Oct. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study answers many scientific questions and should help
doctors better understand the drug&#8217;s effects, said Peter
DiBattiste, JJ&#8217;s vice president of cardiovascular development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings to Regulators &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings will be sent to U.S. regulators, he said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the largest trial ever conducted in patients with
acute decompensated heart failure, and affirms our commitment
to patients and physicians who have limited treatment options
to fight this life threatening disorder,&#8221; DeBattiste said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another study reported at the heart meeting, Pfizer
Inc.&#8217;s Inspra slashed deaths from cardiovascular causes and
hospitalizations for worsening heart failure disease by one-
third in patients with mild levels of the disease. That trial,
in 2,737 people, was funded by New York-based Pfizer and halted
in May, when the benefit was first announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspra is already approved for use in patients with
moderate to severe disease. The newest findings should increase
use of Inspra and similar medicines, said Mariell Jessup,
medical director of the University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s heart and
vascular center and chair of the meeting&#8217;s scientific program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we are applying these therapies to less sick
patients, we can prevent them from becoming severely
debilitated,&#8221; Jessup said. &#8216;When patients get so sick, we have
very limited therapies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspra Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the study, 18.3 percent of patients treated with Inspra
died or were hospitalized for heart failure, compared with 25.9
percent given placebo. The results were simultaneously published
by the New England Journal of Medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug, also sold in generic form under the chemical name
eplerenone, is an aldosterone antagonist. The drugs help prevent
salt retention, which can cause the body to retain fluids.
Reducing fluid build-up eases shortness of breath, reduces
fatigue and lessens swelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drugs including diuretics, nitroglycerine and blood-
pressure medications known as ACE inhibitors have been effective
at reducing symptoms and deaths in heart-failure patients, said
Andrew Smith, director of Emory University&#8217;s Center for Heart
Failure Therapy and Heart Transplantation in Atlanta, in a Nov.
10 interview. There is a need for new treatments, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There really has not been a trial that has shown a clear-
cut benefit as far as reducing future hospitalizations,&#8221; said
Smith, who was not involved in the study. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co., the $32 billion hedge
fund run by billionaire John Paulson, sold its entire position
in Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and trimmed stakes in Bank of
America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson sold 30 million shares of Bank of America last
quarter, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission today. The sale and market declines cut his
stake in the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank by $605.8
million, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shoddy mortgage lending has led bankers into a two-front
war, pitting them against U.S. homeowners challenging the right
to foreclose and mortgage-bond investors demanding refunds that
could approach $200 billion. Pimco, BlackRock Inc., MetLife Inc.
and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York are seeking to force
Bank of America to repurchase mortgages packaged into $47
billion of bonds by its Countrywide Financial Corp. unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the hedge funds, I think a lot of the easy money had
been made,&#8221; said Douglas Ciocca , managing director at
Renaissance Financial Corp. in Leawood, Kansas, which oversees
about $2 billion in assets. &#8220;From here it will be harder to
swallow a process of financial reform and that will impact
profits, especially when the banks are struggling with their
identity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America has declined 16 percent since the second
quarter, compared with a gain by the same percentage for the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson also sold 82.7 million shares of Citigroup, 2
million shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co., 2 million shares of
Wells Fargo  Co. and his entire stake of 1.1 million shares in
Goldman Sachs in the quarter. The sales helped cut his holdings
of financial stocks by 4.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Mindich&#8217;s Eton Park Capital
Management LP and John Paulson&#8217;s hedge fund sold their stakes in
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. during the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eton Park previously held 2 million shares of New York-
based Goldman Sachs, according to a filing today with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Paulson  Co. sold 1.1
million shares of the bank, a separate filing shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindich, 43, is a former Goldman Sachs partner who began
New York-based Eton Park in 2004 with $3.5 billion, one of the
biggest startups in the hedge-fund industry. Paulson, who
oversees New York&#8217;s Paulson  Co., became a billionaire by
betting against the U.S. mortgage markets during the credit
crisis that started with the subprime collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eton Park held onto its 15 million shares in Morgan
Stanley, 21.1 million shares of Bank of America Corp. and 60.5
million shares of Citigroup Inc. according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eton Park bought 7.75 million shares of Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc. valued at $1.12 billion, the filing shows. BHP
Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest mining company, in August
made a $130-a-share hostile takeover offer for Saskatoon-based
Potash, the biggest fertilizer company. The bid was rejected by
Potash as too low, and this month was blocked by the Canadian
government. Shares of Potash have jumped 22 percent since Aug.
16, the day before BHP&#8217;s unsolicited offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money managers who oversee more than $100 million in
equities must file a Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange
Commission within 45 days of each quarter&#8217;s end to show their
U.S.-listed stocks, options and convertible bonds. The filings
don&#8217;t show non-U.S. securities or how much cash the firms hold. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter  Gamble Co., the world&#8217;s
largest consumer-products company, sold $1.5 billion of notes
with corporate bond issuance on pace for a record November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Borrowers from Ally Financial Inc., the biggest issuer of
junk-rated debt this year, to Newark, New Jersey-based
Prudential Financial Inc. have issued or are marketing at least
$6.72 billion of the securities in the U.S. today, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Corporations have sold more than $69
billion of debt this month and are on track to surpass the
$124.7 billion issued in November 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issuance is accelerating, surpassing the 2010 average last
week for the ninth time in 10 weeks, as yields on corporate
bonds hover near record lows. Companies will take advantage of
&#8220;a great market for both investment-grade and high-yield
issuers&#8221; to sell debt through the Thanksgiving holiday in the
U.S. on Nov. 25, said Scott MacDonald, head of credit and
economic research at Aladdin Capital Management LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to see a pretty good market for new issues
as companies decide it might be time to pre-finance maturities
if they think markets are going to be choppier,&#8221; said
MacDonald, who&#8217;s based in Stamford, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG&#8217;s offering was split between $1 billion of five-year
notes that yield 47 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $500 million of two-year floating-rate debt that
pays 4 basis points more than the three-month London interbank
offered rate, according to a person familiar with the offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three-month Libor is a lending benchmark set yesterday at
0.28 percent. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crest, Old Spice &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering is Cincinnati-based PG&#8217;s second in U.S.
dollars this year, following a $1.25 billion sale in February of
2.5-year notes that paid a 55 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Crest toothpaste and Old Spice fragrances
reported profit in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30
declined 6.8 percent, exceeding some analysts&#8217; estimates, after
it sold a pharmaceuticals unit and commodity costs rose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PG fell 4 cents, or 0.06 percent, to $64.29 as of 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have gained 6 percent during the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is ranked Aa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
an equivalent AA- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial, the auto and home lender formerly known as
GMAC Inc., sold $1 billion of seven-year notes, Bloomberg data
show. The 6.25 percent debt yields 6.5 percent. The Detroit-
based company has sold $5.65 billion of notes in four sales in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prudential Financial, the second-biggest U.S. life insurer
after MetLife Inc., sold $1 billion of notes to help pay for two
overseas units from American International Group Inc. The
company sold $500 million of 4.5 percent, 10-year notes that pay
a spread of 167 basis points and $500 million of 6.2 percent,
30-year bonds that yield 185 basis points more than benchmarks,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds climbed to 3.75
percent on Nov. 12 after touching 3.53 percent, the lowest on
record, on Nov. 4, a day after the Federal Reserve announced
plans to buy an additional $600 billion of Treasuries as it
tries to stimulate the economy and stave off deflation,
according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk-debt yields climbed to 7.66 percent on Nov. 12 from
7.55 percent, the lowest since March 2005, on Nov. 9, the index
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Real economic growth is going to be slower in Europe and
may moderate here, we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to happen on the
fiscal or taxation front, and there are still sovereign
issues,&#8221; MacDonald said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no magic wand to make these
things all go away.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. is creating a
social-games hub in partnership with CrowdStar International
Ltd., the second-largest maker of such titles on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is overhauling the MSN Games site to let players
compete with each other across Web properties including Bing
Games and Windows Live Messenger, the companies said today in a
statement. Players using the Microsoft Game Hub will be able to
see each others&#8217; scores across the Microsoft platforms and
Facebook Inc.&#8217;s social network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Game Hub will compete against a crowded field of
companies moving to capitalize on consumer interest in games
that can be played for a few minutes at a time. Yahoo! Inc.,
Facebook and Apple Inc. have established social-gaming platforms
over the past few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games on Facebook gained popularity in the U.S. last year,
leading Electronic Arts Inc. to purchase Playfish Inc., the
maker of &#8220;Pet Society&#8221; and &#8220;Restaurant City,&#8221; for as much as
$400 million. Walt Disney Co. agreed to buy Playdom Inc.,
another supplier of games on Facebook, for $563.2 million in
July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MSN Games, a unit of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft,
offers more than 1,000 titles, including &#8220;Bejeweled,&#8221; &#8220;Mah
Jong Tiles&#8221; and &#8220;Spades.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, San Francisco-based Zynga Game Network Inc.,
the largest maker of social games on Facebook, began letting
users of Microsoft&#8217;s game site play &#8220;FarmVille.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developer Rankings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closely held CrowdStar, whose offerings include the virtual
fish-care game &#8220;Happy Aquarium,&#8221; is the third-largest
developer overall behind Zynga and Phrases on Facebook&#8217;s social
network, with more than 50 million monthly active users,
according to the latest ranking from AppData.com, a website that
tracks application use on Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the partnership, CrowdStar&#8217;s games will be featured
first on Bing Games before rolling out to other Microsoft sites,
the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Games on social networks such as Facebook and MySpace are
free of charge. The makers generate revenue by selling virtual
goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software company, fell 7
cents to $26.20 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. The shares have dropped 14 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;

are under way,&#8221; the company said in an e-mailed statement
today. Nigerian oil workers&#8217; union, Pengassan, said eight of its
members, who are employed by Exxon, were abducted from the
company&#8217;s Oso gas and condensate platform yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of the attack there were 74 people aboard the
platform, Pengassan said in an e-mailed statement today. &#8220;We
have not been able to establish contact with the abductors,&#8221; it
said in the statement. &#8220;Pengassan calls on the government to
ensure they are found and released immediately.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The southern Niger River delta, home to Nigeria&#8217;s oil and
gas industry, has seen a new surge of violence since a
government amnesty in 2009 led to the disarming of thousands of
fighters and a period of relative quiet. Seven foreign workers
were abducted in an attack on Afren Plc&#8217;s offshore Okoro field
on Nov. 7, about a week after an Eni SpA pipeline was sabotaged
in a separate attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil holds a 40 percent stake in a venture it
operates for majority partner, state-owned Nigerian National
Petroleum Corp. The venture produces 720,000 barrels a day of
crude, condensate and natural gas liquids from 90 offshore
platforms in the country, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Armed Groups &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attacks by armed groups in the delta region cut Nigeria&#8217;s
oil production by more than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the violence declined following last year&#8217;s amnesty,
the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta, the main
militant group in the region, refused to disarm, saying its
demands for local control of oil revenue weren&#8217;t met. MEND
claimed responsibility for the attack on Afren. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another armed group, which identified itself as the Niger
Delta Liberation Force under the leadership of General John
Togo, said in an e-mailed statement to reporters yesterday it
was &#8220;no longer part of the fraudulent amnesty&#8221; and will target
oil installations in fresh attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This time, we will operate on both land and sea,&#8221; the
group said. &#8220;Oil installations are our target.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s biggest oil producer and the fifth-
Largest source of U.S. oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s
biggest mining company, may raise its dividend in the first half
after scrapping a $40 billion takeover bid for Potash Corp. of
Saskatchewan Inc., Goldman Sachs  Partners Australia Pty said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP resumed plans to purchase $4.2 billion of its shares
under a $13 billion buyback program suspended in 2007, the
Melbourne-based company said today after announcing it abandoned
its offer for the world&#8217;s largest fertilizer maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the first-half result we would expect BHP to increase
its dividend, particularly as the weak U.S. dollar has resulted
in the Australian dollar dividend falling,&#8221; Neil Goodwill and
Roscoe Widdup, Melbourne-based analysts at Goldman Sachs, wrote
in a report today. &#8220;We would also expect BHP to consider on-
and-off-market buybacks for the Australian listed stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian dollar has risen 18 percent against the U.S.
dollar since end-June, the most among the 16 major currencies
Bloomberg tracks. It reached parity with the U.S. dollar last
month for the first time since July 1982. BHP, due to report
first-half results on Feb. 16, paid a dividend of 87 cents a
share for the year ended June 30, according to Goldman Sachs.
The company may pay 99 cents this year, Goldman estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;From a market perspective the removal of acquisition risk
with regard to Potash Corp. and the reactivation of the buyback
program will, we believe, be regarded as sensible,&#8221; Goldman
said in the report. &#8220;Overall we think BHP would likely be
conservative and preserve a very strong balance sheet for
potential opportunities in what has been a volatile market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BHP rose 1.8 percent to 2,406 pence by the 4:35 p.m. London
close. It earlier fell 0.4 percent to A$44.14 in Sydney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company could buy back $20 billion to $30 billion of
its shares by the end of fiscal 2012, Goldman said. The broker
reinstated BHP coverage today with a &#8220;conviction buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. advised
investors to buy European equities for the coming 6 to 12
months, while Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc forecast stocks
may rise &#8220;potentially very strongly&#8221; in 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are &#8220;very bullish on equities on a rolling 6-12 months
horizon, with the potential for a &#8217;99 type of extreme upward
move not to be dismissed,&#8221; JPMorgan strategists Mislav Matejka
and Emmanuel Cau wrote in a report today, adding that returns on
a 5- to 10-year period will be &#8220;poor.&#8221; RBS strategists Ian Richards and Graham Bishop in London forecast gains of 20
percent for European stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rarely has the valuation of the equity market appeared so
anomalous in the context of other asset classes,&#8221; Richards and
Bishop wrote. &#8220;But another dose of liquidity, normalising
inflation expectations, and a corporate sector that is at last
showing signs of using the exceptionally low cost of debt to
drive shareholder return, all bode well for an aggressive
valuation re-appraisal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index has climbed 17 percent
since May as the U.S. Federal Reserve boosted its asset-
purchases plan to stimulate growth, offsetting concern that
Greece and Ireland may struggle to reduce their budget deficits.
The index is still trading at 12 times its companies&#8217; estimated
earnings, down from a ratio of almost 16 at the end of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Appear Cheaper&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the short term, we still see stocks as the asset class
offering the best risk-reward,&#8221; the JPMorgan strategists wrote.
&#8220;They are at the right stage of the earnings upcycle, asset
reflation favours equities, they are relatively underowned and
appear cheaper than other assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While valuations appear &#8220;attractive&#8221; in the short term
relative to profits and compared with bonds, when analyzed
against historical earnings cycles, they are starting to look
&#8220;stretched,&#8221; Matejka and Cau wrote. The &#8220;Grand Experiment&#8221;
of quantitative easing may end result in a bear market for both
bonds and equities after an initial rebound in stocks, the
strategists wrote, as policymakers&#8217; credibility declines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx 600 surged 36 percent in 1999, capping five years
of gains, as investors bet new technologies would boost
earnings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There would likely be a &#8220;dramatic&#8221; price decline if China

&lt;p&gt;Belle International Holdings Ltd.
rose the most in two weeks in Hong Kong trading after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. added China&#8217;s largest retailer of women&#8217;s shoes
to its &#8220;conviction buy&#8221; list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belle climbed 3.5 percent to close at HK$15 as of the 4
p.m. close of trading in Hong Kong. The advance, the biggest
since Nov. 1, made Belle the biggest gainer on the benchmark
Hang Seng Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The retailer may be among the companies poised to benefit
from industry consolidation, according to a note Goldman sent to
its clients late on Nov. 12. China&#8217;s top 50 retailers control 5
percent of the market, compared with 41 percent for the biggest
50 in the U.S., the Goldman Sachs analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leading U.S. retailers &#8220;enjoyed double-digit growth
until their market share reached 7 percent to 8 percent,&#8221;
Joshua Lu, Caroline Li, Vivienne Mao and Source Yuan said in the
note. &#8220;Their counterparts in China currently have only 1
percent to 2 percent market share&#8221; and would benefit from
consolidation that may take place over the next decade, the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, the world&#8217;s most populous nation, has had average
monthly retail sales growth of 18.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belle, which was included in the Hang Seng Index in
September, has surged 67 percent this year, compared with a 9.9
percent gain for the benchmark. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Steve Ballmer and Chairman Bill Gates, responding to a
request to consider breaking up the company to boost the return
for investors, say they aren&#8217;t in favor of the idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executives made the remarks after a question at an
investor meeting in Bellevue, Washington. Microsoft, which makes
most of its money from its Office and Windows computer software,
also offers everything from Xbox video-game machines to mobile-
phone programs to Hotmail Web e-mail services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A breakup doesn&#8217;t make sense because the computer industry
is consolidating, Ballmer said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it would be
useful,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It creates economic dis-synergies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. suggested that
Microsoft might spin off some consumer businesses, including the
Xbox division, so that it could better focus on its main
products. Microsoft&#8217;s shares have tumbled 15 percent this year,
hurt by concern that it&#8217;s losing ground to mobile software from
Apple Inc. and Google Inc. A slow recovery among corporate
customers also is weighing on sales, Goldman Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 23 cents to
$25.81 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co., the hedge fund run by
John Paulson, trimmed positions in Bank of America Corp., Wells
Fargo  Co. and Citigroup Inc. in the third quarter and sold off
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as regulatory changes and disputes over
faulty mortgages threatened to hurt bank profits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson, whose New York-based hedge fund has $33 billion in
assets, sold 30 million Bank of America shares in the quarter,
or about 18 percent of his stake, according to a regulatory
filing yesterday. The billionaire&#8217;s position in the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based bank was valued at $1.8 billion as of Sept.
30. Bank of America shares fell 8.8 percent in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue at U.S. banks shrank in the third quarter, led by
Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, as tighter capital rules and
restrictions on bank trading are squeezing lenders. Banks also
may be forced to repurchase as much as $179.2 billion in
mortgages that were packed into securities, according to
Christopher Gamaitoni, vice president of research at Compass
Point Research  Trading LLC in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the hedge funds, I think a lot of the easy money had
been made in bank shares,&#8221; said Doug Ciocca, managing director
at Renaissance Financial Corp. in Leawood, Kansas, which
oversees $2 billion in assets. &#8220;From here it will be harder to
swallow a process of financial reform and that will impact
profits, especially when the banks are struggling with their
identity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, Wells Fargo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s fund also cut its Citigroup stake by 16 percent,
yesterday&#8217;s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission showed. The firm still owned $1.7 billion in shares
of the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson trimmed his Wells Fargo stake by 11 percent,
holding 15.5 million shares in the San Francisco-based bank
valued at $389 million as of Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He cut his position in JPMorgan Chase  Co. by 29 percent,
keeping a $190 million stake in the New York company, and sold
his entire holding in New York-based Goldman Sachs, valued at
about $144.4 million at midyear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson told clients at a recent meeting he doesn&#8217;t see a
significant risk that banks may be forced to buy back mortgages,
said a person who was present and asked not to be identified
because the fund is private. A spokesman for Paulson declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Seller &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson was the biggest seller of Bank of America among
hedge funds, which in aggregate sold a net 34.9 million shares
in the quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds added a net 510.8 million shares to existing
stakes in Citigroup during the quarter. That was their fourth-
largest net addition, behind Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan,
Genzyme Corp. and Apple Inc., the Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined net revenue of the six largest U.S. banks fell
by an average of 8 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, driven by declines in everything from trading at
Goldman Sachs to home lending at Bank of America. New laws
restricting account and credit-card fees, as well as derivatives
and capital rules, are also squeezing lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America and other banks halted foreclosures after
court documents surfaced showing employees at some of the
largest mortgage firms signed foreclosure paperwork without
checking the accuracy, throwing home seizures into doubt. The
bank, along with Wells Fargo, instituted a review of the
procedures and attorneys general in all 50 states are
investigating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson&#8217;s largest fund, Advantage Plus, rose 2.5 percent
this year through Oct. 31. Funds that bet on corporate events
such as mergers and bankruptcies have climbed 8.6 percent on
average, according to Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paulson  Co. had been betting on an economic recovery by
2012, before the firm scaled back its bullish investments.
Paulson, 54, said in September that he believes the global
recovery remains intact, and that he expects to make money in
the next two years with the stocks of companies going through
bankruptcies, restructurings and reorganizations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banco Panamericano SA&#8217;s 2.5 billion-
real ($1.5 billion) rescue may hurt Brazil&#8217;s smallest banks as
increased &#8220;scrutiny&#8221; cuts demand for loan-portfolio purchases,
JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA&#8217;s rating was cut at Bank of
America because the lender&#8217;s dependence on credit assignments
makes it vulnerable after the bailout, according to a note to
clients today. Larger lenders may limit loan-portfolio buying, a
&#8220;key source of funding&#8221; for smaller rivals, according to a
Nov. 12 report from JPMorgan sent by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Panamericano, based in Sao Paulo, is the target of a
criminal investigation after the central bank found accounting
inconsistencies that sparked last week&#8217;s bailout by controlling
shareholder Grupo Silvio Santos. Shares and bonds of Brazil&#8217;s
smallest banks tumbled, led by Panamericano, after the probe
cast doubt on the industry&#8217;s accounting practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Banks who buy portfolios may reduce their appetite for
those loans and increase due diligence,&#8221; Frederic de Mariz and
Saul Martinez, analysts at JPMorgan, wrote in the note. Brazil&#8217;s
five largest banks own 77 percent of the country&#8217;s deposits,
&#8220;which makes access to funding a structural issue for small
banks,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield on Panamericano&#8217;s 8.5 percent bonds due in 2020
has jumped to 9.99 percent from 6.93 percent on Nov. 4,
according to prices from Trace. The stock has dropped 38 percent
in the same period, trading at 4.77 reais at 10:37 a.m. New York
time today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruzeiro and its competitors may suffer from &#8220;less
favorable&#8221; terms for credit assignments following
Panamericano&#8217;s rescue, Jorg Friedemann, an analyst at Bank of
America in Sao Paulo, wrote in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cruzeiro&#8217;s &#8220;high dependence on income from credit
assignments makes it more vulnerable to any changes to, or
additional scrutiny of, credit assignment guidelines going
forward,&#8221; wrote Friedemann, who lowered his rating on the bank
to &#8220;underperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The bank&#8217;s ability to generate income from this source
could come under pressure,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-controlled lender Caixa Economica Federal is unlikely
to increase its stake in Panamericano as it may be reluctant to
&#8220;give the appearance that a public bank is bailing out a
private one,&#8221; according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest company by market value, and ConocoPhillips said
drilling costs in Norway need to be reduced to improve recovery
from aging oil fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs are &#8220;a real challenge&#8221; for oil and gas production
in Norway, Jan Aage Hansen at Exxon in Norway, said today in a
presentation in Oslo to Oil Minister Terje Riis-Johansen as part
of hearings on how to raise recovery from dwindling deposits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hansen and Steinar Vaage, head of ConocoPhillips in Norway,
called for greater mobility of rigs between Norway and the U.K.
to lower costs and improve availability. Norway&#8217;s regulatory
requirements for rigs differ from those in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What&#8217;s important is that we open up the market,&#8221; Vaage
said at the meeting. &#8220;This opening of the market would be very
important to get access to rigs that are more cost effective and
reduce costs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has urged producers such as state-controlled
Statoil ASA and ConocoPhillips to improve recovery from the
country&#8217;s deposits. Output in the world&#8217;s seventh-biggest oil
exporter has almost fallen more than 40 percent in the past
decade after 40 years of pumping from fields such as Ekofisk,
Oseberg and Troll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costs for the oil industry in Norway are forecast to climb
3 percent to 4 percent annually in the coming years, after
surging 80 percent from 2004 to 2008, Bjoern Harald Martinsen,
an economist at the Norwegian Oil Industry Association, said in
an interview last week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The biggest opportunity for us is not necessarily to do
more things, but to be Goldman Sachs in more places,&#8221;
Blankfein, 56, said today in New York at a conference sponsored
by Bank of America Corp. About 12 percent of the firm&#8217;s revenue
came from emerging markets since 2006, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has added employees in emerging markets,
including China, India, the Middle East and Latin America, at a
compound annual rate of 33 percent since 2003, much faster than
in developed markets, Blankfein said. Business in those markets
will fuel an increase in the firm&#8217;s return on equity, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Experience tells us that these markets will not move in a
straight line,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;We must scale our investment
in such a way so that we can stay the course.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the most profitable securities firm in
Wall Street history before converting to a bank during the 2008
financial crisis. The firm rebounded in 2009 to set a new
earnings record, then profit slumped this year and Goldman Sachs
agreed to pay $550 million in July to settle a fraud lawsuit
filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the 2007
sale of a mortgage-linked investment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less Volatility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said the firm also sees opportunities in the
changing regulatory environment and in technological evolution.
While regulations restrict Goldman Sachs and other banks from
investing and trading their own capital, it will mean that
Goldman Sachs&#8217;s fund business increases its return on equity and
produces less volatile revenue, he said. Increased transparency
in over-the-counter derivatives will give advantages to firms
with the best technology, Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As I think about our industry over the last 30 years, it
has often fought change, fearing it was revolution instead of
evolution,&#8221; Blankfein said. &#8220;Embracing change early has been
fundamental to Goldman Sachs&#8217;s success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether he remains confident in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s
ability to achieve a 20 percent or higher return on tangible
equity over the economic cycle, Blankfein said he is &#8220;not sure
we have to revise that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index may
rise as much as 20 percent in 12 months and the dollar is poised
to climb as U.S. economic growth tops investors&#8217; projections,
Goldman Sachs Asset Management Chairman Jim O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. equity market will probably outperform the rest of
the world and the dollar may strengthen 5 percent from current
levels, O&#8217;Neill said in an interview in London today. The
Federal Reserve will engage in another round of bond purchases,
or &#8220;QE3,&#8221; if its current program fails to revive growth in the
world&#8217;s largest economy, O&#8217;Neill said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is little changed since Nov. 3, when the Fed
said it would buy $600 billion of Treasuries, adding to an
earlier $1.7 trillion asset-purchase program known as
quantitative easing that&#8217;s designed to cut unemployment and
avert deflation. The Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S.
currency against those of six trading partners, rose 3 percent
during the period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If QE2 doesn&#8217;t work, then we&#8217;ll get QE3,&#8221; said O&#8217;Neill,
who was named chairman of the money manager in September after
working as the co-head of global economics research and chief
currency economist at New York-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
since 1995. There&#8217;s a &#8220;good chance&#8221; the SP 500 will rise 15
percent to 20 percent in the next 12 months, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Movement for the Emancipation of
the Niger Delta claimed responsibility for an attack on Exxon
Mobil Corp.s Nigerian unit in Akwa Ibom state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nigerian government has not spoken with MEND about
&#8220;injustice&#8221; in the Niger delta, Jomo Gbomo, spokesman for the
rebel group, said in an e-mail today. &#8220;In the coming weeks,
MEND will launch a major operation that will simultaneously
affect oil facilities across the Niger delta.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The southern Niger River delta, home to Nigeria&#8217;s oil and
gas industry, has seen a new surge of violence since a
government amnesty in 2009 led to the disarming of thousands of
fighters and a period of relative quiet. Seven foreign workers
were abducted in an attack on Afren Plc&#8217;s offshore Okoro
field on Nov. 7, about a week after an Eni SpA pipeline was
sabotaged in a separate attack. Attacks by armed groups in the
delta region cut Nigeria&#8217;s oil production by more than 28
percent from 2006 to 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven local employees were abducted in yesterday&#8217;s
operation, Gbomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They were taken to prevent the Nigerian government from
attributing the damage to this facility to an industrial
accident,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No amount of military activities will
secure the release of these hostages. They will be released at
our time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government and security agencies have been informed and
&#8220;appropriate&#8221; response measures are under way, Exxon Mobil
said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to pay $25
million to settle a lawsuit over a decades-old oil spill and
related environmental contamination in Brooklyn, New York, state
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes a payment of $19.5 million for
environmental projects, the largest single payment of its kind
in New York&#8217;s history, according to Cuomo&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement also requires Exxon to pay for the cleanup
of the spill of at least 17 million gallons of oil in Brooklyn&#8217;s
Greenpoint area discovered in 1978, according to the statement.
At least 55 acres of the Brooklyn community are now
contaminated, Cuomo&#8217;s office said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For far too long, residents of Greenpoint have been
forced to live with an environmental nightmare lurking just
beneath their homes, their businesses and their community,&#8221;
Cuomo said. &#8220;With this settlement, Exxon Mobil will be held
accountable for fully cleaning up this environmental disaster.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement was filed today in federal court in
Brooklyn. It includes $500,000 in civil penalties and damages,
$1.5 million to compensation the state for past cleanups
associated with the spill, and $3.5 million for future oversight
costs, Cuomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement also resolves a 2004 complaint by the
environmental watchdog group Riverkeeper, which was consolidated
with Cuomo&#8217;s case, and a lawsuit by Brooklyn Borough president
Marty Markowitz, according to Kristen Hellmer, an Exxon
spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to reach a mutually agreeable resolution to
the lawsuit, and our focus will continue to be our cleanup
efforts in Greenpoint,&#8221; Hellmer said in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class Actions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two class-action, or group, suits representing residents
for property value losses and potential health costs related to
the spill remain unresolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Greenpoint neighborhood previously was home to
refineries and storage tanks owned by Standard Oil, an Exxon
predecessor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spill was two-thirds larger than the 1989 Exxon Valdez
spill that released 11 million gallons of oil into Alaska&#8217;s
Prince William Sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement obligates Exxon to address soil, groundwater
and air concerns, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Cleanup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has been working since 1979 to remediate the site,
according to a statement by the Irving, Texas-based company.
More than 11 million gallons have been removed, the company
said. Hellmer declined to discuss cleanup costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cuomo suit sought to have the company clean oil from
the soil and groundwater in the Greenpoint neighborhood and
prevent it from leaking into Newtown Creek, a 3.5-mile waterway
that separates the boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The settlement doesn&#8217;t incorporate the investigation and
cleanup of Newtown Creek because it is a Superfund site being
dealt with by the federal government, Cuomo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Exxon settlement and the recent Superfund listing of
Newtown Creek will make it possible for Riverkeeper and local
residents to realize our vision of a Greenpoint that is free of
historic pollution,&#8221; Riverkeeper executive director Paul Gallay
said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erin Brockovich &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2005 suit filed Brooklyn state Supreme Court on behalf of
more than 400 Greenpoint residents by Los Angeles law firm
Girardi/Keese is unresolved. The firm&#8217;s founder, Thomas Girardi,
was lead counsel in Erin Brockovich&#8217;s suit against Pacific Gas 
Electric, a unit of PGE Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our suit is simply pending,&#8221; Girardi said in a phone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marc Bern, a partner at Napoli Bern Ripka LLP, sought
federal class action status in a lawsuit on behalf of residents
for a $58 billion claim against Exxon, BP Plc and other
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;&#8216;Hopefully we will be entering negotiations with Exxon in
the very near future to resolve this matter,&#8221; Bern said. &#8220;The
Greenpoint controversy has been pending too long, particularly
in light of New York&#8217;s desire to reclaim the water views.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 1800s, the Greenpoint area housed more than 50
refineries, and the contamination may have begun then, Exxon has
said. By 1892, most of the facilities were owned by Standard
Oil. Leaking gasoline caused a sewer explosion in 1950 that sent
manhole covers flying. The site was identified as an
environmental hazard in 1978 when a Coast Guard patrol spotted
an oily plume in Newtown Creek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has had no active refinery operations in Greenpoint
since 1963 and no terminal operations since 1993, Hellmer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s case is State of New York v. Exxonmobil Corp.,
07-cv-02902, and the Riverkeeper case is Riverkeeper v. Exxon
Mobil 04-cv-02056, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New
York (Brooklyn). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. selected
110 people to become partners, up from 94 in the last round two
years ago, as Wall Street rebounds from the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the employees named this year were David Kostin,
chief U.S. equity strategist, Andre Laport Ribeiro, the Sao
Paolo-based head of Latin America equities, and Colin Coleman,
who runs the firm&#8217;s South Africa business, according to an
internal memo (see full list below) obtained by Bloomberg News.
The appointments take effect Jan. 1. David Wells, a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elections are a vestige of the firm&#8217;s days as the last
major investment bank partnership, before the company ended 130
years of private ownership with its 1999 initial public
offering. Partners, who get a $600,000 salary, share in a
special compensation pool and typically receive most of their
yearend bonuses in restricted stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are no partners in a corporation, this is an
honorary designation that enables people in it to participate in
a bonus pool,&#8221; said Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York
University&#8217;s Stern School of Business who was a partner at
Goldman Sachs before it went public. &#8220;This is a promotion for
most of them in terms of how much they get paid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs had 443 partners after the 2008 class was
elected and 402 after the 2006 round. Wells wouldn&#8217;t say how
many partners there will be after the latest round of
promotions. The New York-based company employed 35,400 people at
the end of September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Partners &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New partners included Donald J. Casturo from the
commodities unit, Dina H. Powell, the firm&#8217;s head of corporate
engagement, London-based credit trader Wayne M. Leslie, and
Peeyush Misra, a former Bear Stearns Cos. mortgage trader.
Massimo Della Ragione, a Milan-based merger specialist, also
made the cut, as did China portfolio strategist Christopher Eoyang, Shin Horie, the Tokyo-based head of Japan investment
research, and Jonathan M. Penkin, co-head of equity capital
markets in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells wouldn&#8217;t say how many of the new partners are women.
The firm was sued in September by three women, former employees,
who alleged that they faced discrimination in pay and fewer
opportunities for promotion than men. Goldman Sachs has called
the suit without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s profit through the first nine months of
2010 dropped 29 percent to $5.97 billion from the same period
last year. The company has set aside $13.1 billion for
compensation and benefits this year, 21 percent less than at the
same time in 2009. The stock dropped 21 cents to $164.89 as of
4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, and is
down 2.3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Pay &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs set a Wall Street pay record in 2007 when it
doled out more than $20 billion, or 44 percent of revenue, to
30,522 employees at the time. Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, was awarded a $67.9 million bonus
that year, the highest ever for a securities industry CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 2008 financial crisis led governments around the
world to supply taxpayer money to keep banks afloat, Goldman
Sachs has cut compensation. Last year the firm slashed the ratio
of revenue paid to employees to 36 percent, the lowest since the
firm went public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year Goldman Sachs has set aside 43 percent of revenue
to pay employees, or 45 percent when the cost of a U.K. tax on
bonuses is included. In a presentation yesterday at a New York
conference hosted by Bank of America Corp., Blankfein said the
firm&#8217;s decisions on compensation depend on &#8220;what the market
requires us to do in most cases, and I think that that is a bit
of an evolving picture.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs published its
list of partners in a press release. The firm has since stopped
making the list public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine why they want to call attention to what
is in essence not an appointment of managers but a transfer of
people into a different compensation category,&#8221; Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of the 2010 partner class at
Goldman Sachs: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp.
added less than half a percentage point of market share apiece
in U.S. Internet searches last month, while Yahoo! Inc. lost
ground, according to ComScore Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google had 66.3 percent of the market in October, up from
66.1 percent the previous month, Reston, the Virginia-based
research firm said today. Microsoft&#8217;s Bing climbed to 11.5
percent from 11.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo are teaming up to challenge Google&#8217;s
dominance in the market, relying on a 10-year search agreement
that puts Bing on Yahoo sites. Combined, they handled 28 percent
of queries last month, up from 27.9 percent. The companies are
jockeying with Google for a bigger piece of the search
advertising market, which may account for 49 percent of total
U.S. online ad spending this year. That&#8217;s up from 47 percent in
2009, according to EMarketer Inc. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, fell 17 cents

&lt;p&gt;Gender was absent from the Group of
20&#8217;s talks. That&#8217;s odd because it was on display everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The G-20&#8217;s summit in Seoul last week featured what must be
the biggest number of female leaders ever assembled for top-
level economic talks. There, I moderated panel discussions with
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina, Julia Gillard of
Australia and Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister. I
chatted briefly with Angela Merkel of Germany and at least
caught a glimpse of Dilma Rousseff, president-elect of Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If ever there were a sign that women are in the ascendancy,
Seoul was it. And yet South Korea is an ideal place to make a
bigger point about women: Economies that underutilize them do so
to their detriment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea ranked a dismal 104th in a report last month by the
World Economic Forum on the gender gap between men and women. It
trailed the United Arab Emirates, Suriname, Senegal and
Azerbaijan. That&#8217;s quite a blemish on an otherwise highly
successful economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, there are signs companies are profiting from this
discrimination -- and they&#8217;re not Korean, but foreign ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study by U.S. and Korean researchers including Harvard
Business School&#8217;s Jordan Siegel found that if you operate in a
sexist country full of educated, talented women, it makes good
business sense to tap them for management roles. They argue that
a growing number of multinationals are loading up on Korean
women and reaping the benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One-Engine World &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s depressing how governments don&#8217;t realize that failing
to harness half of populations holds back growth. Planes that
need two engines to fly don&#8217;t take off when one isn&#8217;t working,
so why do nations think they can thrive in our madly competitive
world with one engine? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In their communiqu&#233; last week, the G-20 found time to
mention the tiniest of details about everything from fossil-fuel
subsidies to the average cost of transferring remittances to
fostering &#8220;smallholder&#8221; agriculture. And yet nothing about
empowering women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea doesn&#8217;t have a monopoly on sexism. Japan relegates
all too many educated women to the role of tea-girl. Kathy Matsui of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in recent years has urged a
greater focus on &#8220;womenomics.&#8221; The Tokyo-based strategist says
that if Japan&#8217;s female employment rate matched that of males --
one of the highest anywhere at about 80 percent -- gross
domestic product would get a boost of as much as 15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Never mind the pervasive evidence that women are a key cure
for what ails deflationary Japan. Still, the men who control the
nation have as much use for gender equality as they do increased
immigration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Male-Female Divide &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea must close its male-female divide to keep up with
Asia&#8217;s upstart economies. Drafting more women for senior and
middle management may be just what Korea Inc. needs. The same
goes for encouraging more women to run for political office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the paradoxes of Korea is education. Its
institutions of higher education are meritocratic and produce
legions of bright, qualified workers of both sexes. Even so,
Korean women are chronically underemployed by Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siegel and researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Hanshin University looked at hundreds of medium-
sized and large companies operating in Korea. In the last decade,
they found, a 10 percent increase in female managers was good
for a 1 percent jump in profits generated by assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung&#8217;s Women &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, Samsung Electronics Co. demonstrates the point. In
the early 2000s, it had no women executives; today, female
employees make up 40 percent of the total workforce of 187,800
and 10 percent of managers. Samsung is now the world&#8217;s largest
television maker and is eating Sony Corp.&#8217;s lunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Womenomics can be linked to many of Korea&#8217;s biggest
challenges. Rigid mindsets, for example, make it difficult for
women to have both a fulfilling career and a family. Many end up
putting off childbirth or having fewer kids, the result of which
is one of the lowest birthrates anywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gender will grow in importance as developing Asia thrives.
From China to Malaysia, many business cultures are less apt to
let gender decide who gets big promotions. It&#8217;s something Korean
President Lee Myung Bak should be thinking about early and often
as he ponders how to compete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea&#8217;s export-led model worked spectacularly. Many
executives in Seoul told me how impressed they were by how the
nation of 49 million people has evolved and boomed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fresh Air &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Korea&#8217;s growth strategy has outlived its usefulness.
The next phase must be about ideas and innovation, not factories.
Korea will need all the collective brainpower it can muster --
male and female. If Korea doesn&#8217;t begin making the most out of
its women, multinationals will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;G-20 gender dynamics offer a breath of fresh air. Perhaps
having so many women at the boy&#8217;s table will shake leaders out
of their complacency and help unleash Goldman&#8217;s womenomics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh represented his nation
proudly in Seoul. Still, I kept wishing he had brought Congress
Party President Sonia Gandhi with him. It would have gone even
further to remind us that it&#8217;s no longer a man&#8217;s world. If only
our hiring practices reflected it. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Nov 17, 2010  4:13 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/microsoft-s-web-calling-unit-lures-boeing-aims-for-1-billion.html"><headline>Microsoft Web-Call Unit Lures Boeing, France Telecom</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. has lined up
customers such as Boeing Co. and France Telecom SA for new
software that handles Web-based calling and videoconferencing,
advancing an effort that may add $1 billion in annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software, called Lync, debuted at an event today,
before going on sale Dec. 1. It has the potential to generate
sales on par with Microsoft&#8217;s SharePoint business, which makes
about $1.3 billion a year, Kurt DelBene, president of the
Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s Office unit, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DelBene&#8217;s unit has revamped Web-calling and conferencing
software to gain more of the $50 billion market for products
that help companies replace traditional phone networks with
systems that send communications over the Internet. The new
software is a bid to parlay Microsoft&#8217;s personal-computer know-
how in the networking realm dominated by Cisco Systems Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft had a very strong offering in all areas except
the place where they were weakest: the telecom area,&#8221; said Bern
Elliot, an analyst at Stamford, Connecticut-based Gartner Inc.
&#8220;With this release, they&#8217;ve used their experience to improve
that. Now, if you wanted to, you could get rid of your existing
phones.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take until the middle of next year to see whether
Lync will be a serious contender, Elliot said. Lync is the third
iteration of Microsoft&#8217;s software for Internet-based calling and
teleconferencing, which was introduced in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracking Down Co-Workers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is to put Internet messages, video chats and phone
calls on the same platform -- a concept called unified
communication -- and make it easier to reach people wherever
they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you call a co-worker&#8217;s office but he&#8217;s
traveling, Lync will try the person in his hotel room in Kuala
Lumpur, DelBene said. Microsoft Office users can right-click on
contact names to call them. If they need a third person to join,
they can drag and drop the name to create a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc has been using the previous versions
of the software and plans to upgrade to the new one as part of
its effort to switch out traditional phone systems, DelBene
said. Other Lync customers include Estee Lauder Cos., Nikon
Corp. and Marquette University, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard Co., whose services business helps
customers install Lync, has orders to deploy Lync to more than
300,000 workers at Fortune 500 companies, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fell 24 cents to $25.57 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares have declined 16
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco Showdown &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft bids for customers, it often squares off
with Cisco, International Business Machines Corp. and Avaya
Inc., said Gurdeep Singh Pall, a Microsoft vice president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco&#8217;s unified-communications business, which has more
than 1,000 customers, includes Internet phones and call-center
products, as well as social-networking tools and mobile
applications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which posted revenue growth of 45 percent last
quarter from a year earlier, counts the Abu Dhabi Police and
Bulgarian Ministry of Transport as customers. It sold its 30
millionth Internet phone last month to HSBC Holdings Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DelBene says he isn&#8217;t worried about the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m usually a person that is overly fixated on what could
go wrong, but in this space I feel we&#8217;re the leaders,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s not a vendor I&#8217;m particularly worried about.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco built its technology by buying other companies, which
may give Microsoft an edge, Gartner&#8217;s Elliot said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cisco has all the pieces -- they don&#8217;t have as strong
integration across the pieces,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mix of Technologies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Skype Technologies SA leads the market for consumer
Internet calling, it isn&#8217;t as big a competitor in the corporate
arena. Skype lacks the kind of tools many companies need for
security and auditing purposes, Pall said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has replaced its own phones and conferencing
services with its technology, resulting in $215 million in
annual savings in the U.S., DelBene said. For now, many
customers are using the software alongside traditional phones.
Eventually, they&#8217;ll phase out the older approach, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides linking up with Office software, the program can be
embedded in a company&#8217;s other applications. For example,
Schlumberger Ltd., the world&#8217;s largest oilfield-services
contractor, integrated the software with its programs for
monitoring oil rigs. That lets the company quickly call staff on
the affected rig if it notices a problem, Pall said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark Ages &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software stems from more than seven years of work,
beginning with a group assembled by Chairman Bill Gates. The
team included Pall and Gates&#8217;s former technical assistant, Anoop Gupta, who ran the business before Pall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gates was interested because he felt the telecommunications
industry was stuck in the Dark Ages, instead of being
transformed by the PC and the Internet, Pall said. Microsoft
came close to buying a large business in the telecommunications
field in order to jump-start its efforts, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company discarded that plan in 2005 to focus on
building its own software, Pall said. He declined to say which
company Microsoft came close to buying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We started building this platform six years ago,&#8221; Pall
said. &#8220;It takes a long time to build it right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An experimental drug from Merck 
Co. raised levels of good cholesterol, slashed bad cholesterol
and may have helped patients avert heart complications, without
the safety risks that prompted Pfizer Inc. to abandon a similar
product four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients on the treatment, called anacetrapib, had a 40
percent drop in bad cholesterol and a 138 percent rise in the
good cholesterol that ferries fat from the blood, the study
found. Sixteen people on the drug died, had heart attacks or
strokes, compared with 21 on a placebo. The 1,623 patient trial
was funded by Whitehouse Station, New Jersey-based Merck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data, reported at the American Heart Association
meeting in Chicago, will revive interest in a class of medicines
that may reach peak sales of $19 billion a year, said Nikhil Mehta, director of cardiovascular disorders at Decision
Resources Inc., a consulting firm. Investors who lowered
expectations after the failure of Pfizer&#8217;s pill torcetrapib, in
a family of medicines known as CETP inhibitors, may now change
their view, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If what we are seeing now is born out in larger studies,
this could be the next big thing that could benefit hundreds of
millions of people,&#8221; said Christopher Cannon, the lead
researcher and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women&#8217;s Hospital in
Boston. &#8220;The bad cholesterol goes down to the level you are
born with and good cholesterol gets up to twice what you are
born with. This is totally unprecedented territory.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck rose 37 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $34.47 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares rose 0.5
percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG, based in Basel, Switzerland, and Eli
Lilly  Co. of Indianapolis have similar drugs in development.
Merck said it will begin its final trial of anacetrapib in
30,000 high-risk patients next year &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason the sales potential that existed before
torcetrapib failed doesn&#8217;t apply now,&#8221; Decision Resources&#8217;
Mehta said in a telephone interview. &#8220;No other drugs have taken
the place of these medicines. There is still potential for
multibillion dollars of sales, going up into the double-digit
range. This is an important study for reassuring people and
raising the profile of the class again.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding virtually rules out the likelihood that Merck&#8217;s
pill will have the same toxicity as the failed Pfizer drug, said
Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in
Ohio, who led one of the trials studying the similar Pfizer
compound, called torcetrapib. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Good Chance&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a very good chance that this drug will make
it,&#8221; Nissen said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lipitor, which lowers bad cholesterol, or LDL, generated
$11.4 billion in sales for New York-based Pfizer last year. The
product faces generic competition in the U.S. next year.
Torcetrapib, before being abandoned after the company paid $1
billion to develop it, was seen as the next big revenue-
generator for Pfizer, the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctors and drug companies have been searching for years
for ways to reduce heart disease with good cholesterol, and the
findings are promising, Nissen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This class, if it works, could be as big as the
statins,&#8221; the class Lipitor belongs to, he said. &#8220;If we can
reduce event rates another 25 percent above what statins do,
that will save a lot of lives.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potent Drugs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the study also received potent drugs known as
statins to lower bad cholesterol levels. While those medications
reduce the risk of heart attack and death by about one-third,
heart disease remains the leading killer worldwide, according to
the World Health Organization. Statins generated $35 billion in
2009, according to IMS Health Inc., a research company in
Norwalk, Connecticut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study was also published in the New England Journal of
Medicine to coincide with the presentation. There were no signs
of increased blood pressure or levels of the hormone
aldosterone, which studies suggest may be the cause of
torcetrapib&#8217;s flaws. In the trial, significantly fewer patients
getting anacetrapib needed procedures to clear clogged heart
arteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While torcetrapib raised good cholesterol levels, it also
unintentionally increased blood pressure, electrolytes and the
hormone aldosterone. An analysis of the existing data on
torcetrapib suggest those so-called off-target effects were the
cause of the drug&#8217;s toxicity. Merck&#8217;s product doesn&#8217;t have any
of those effects or show signs of other serious adverse events,
the researchers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Confident&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We were able to say very confidently anacetrapib is not
associated with increases in blood pressure, as torcetrapib was,
electrolytes or aldosterone,&#8221; Yale Mitchel, Merck&#8217;s vice
president of clinical research for atherosclerosis, said in an
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torcetrapib increased the number of deaths in its final
study, making that a key issue, said Harlan Krumholz, a
cardiologist and professor at Yale University School of
Medicine. In Merck study today, four patients taking anacetrapib
and one person given a placebo died from cardiovascular causes.
While the difference could have stemmed from chance, it is
something to watch, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying this will be a dangerous drug, but I&#8217;m not
sure there will be reduction in deaths,&#8221; he said in an
interview. &#8220;I&#8217;m bullish on the idea of testing this, I&#8217;m just
not bullish about the result. I don&#8217;t have enough information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. selected
110 people to become partners, up from 94 in the last round two
years ago, as Wall Street rebounds from the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the employees named this year were Donald J. Casturo
from the commodities unit and Dina H. Powell, the firm&#8217;s head of
corporate engagement, according to a list (see full list below)
published in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg News. The
appointments take effect Jan. 1. David Wells, a spokesman for
Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elections are a vestige of the firm&#8217;s days as Wall
Street&#8217;s last remaining partnership, before the company ended
130 years of private ownership with its 1999 initial public
offering. Partners, who get a $600,000 salary, share in a
special compensation pool and typically receive most of their
yearend bonuses in restricted stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are no partners in a corporation, this is an
honorary designation that enables people in it to participate in
a bonus pool,&#8221; said Roy Smith, a finance professor at New York
University&#8217;s Stern School of Business who was a partner at
Goldman Sachs before it went public. &#8220;This is a promotion for
most of them in terms of how much they get paid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s profit through the first nine months of
2010 was $5.97 billion, down 29 percent from the same period
last year. The company has set aside $13.1 billion for
compensation and benefits this year, 21 percent less than at the
same time in 2009. The stock, up 11 cents to $165.21 at 2:14
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, is down less
than 3 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Pay &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs set a Wall Street pay record in 2007 when it
doled out more than $20 billion, or 44 percent of revenue, to
30,522 employees at the time. Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, was awarded a $67.9 million bonus
that year, the highest ever for a securities industry CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the 2008 financial crisis led governments around the
world to supply taxpayer money to keep banks afloat, Goldman
Sachs has cut compensation. Last year the firm slashed the ratio
of revenue paid to employees to 36 percent, the lowest since the
firm went public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year Goldman Sachs has set aside 43 percent of revenue
to pay employees, or 45 percent when the cost of a U.K. tax on
bonuses is included. In a presentation yesterday at a New York
conference hosted by Bank of America Corp., Blankfein said the
firm&#8217;s decisions on compensation depend on &#8220;what the market
requires us to do in most cases, and I think that that is a bit
of an evolving picture.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs would publish
its list of partners in a press release. Since the crisis, the
firm has stopped making the list public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine why they want to call attention to what
is in essence not an appointment of managers but a transfer of
people into a different compensation category,&#8221; Smith said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exalenz Bioscience Ltd., the Israeli

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable securities firm in Wall Street history, promoted a
record number of employees to managing director, boosting their
pay and status as investment banks recover from the financial
crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 321 appointments, up from 272 last year and 259 in
2008, were detailed in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News. The announcement came a day after the New York-based
company selected 110 people to become partners, a designation
that means they share in a special pool of compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, has presided over an expansion of the firm, with
the total number of employees rising to 35,400 from about 24,000
when he took over in mid-2006. In promoting more employees this
year, the company is rewarding people who stayed through the
financial crisis, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a function of trying to regain loyalty after
turbulent times,&#8221; said Peabody, who is based in New York and
recommends investors buy Goldman Sachs stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing directors are one level below the highest rank of
partner. While they typically receive higher pay than more
junior employees, they don&#8217;t share in the special bonus pool
reserved for partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Women Ever &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s promotions include the largest group of women
ever, making up 24 percent of the new class, said Lucas van Praag, a spokesman in New York. Women make up 19 percent of all
managing directors, including the new class, he said. Van Praag
said &#8220;over 10 percent&#8221; of this year&#8217;s new partners are women
and declined to give a more specific figure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was sued in September by three former
employees who alleged that they faced discrimination in pay and
fewer opportunities for promotion than men. Goldman Sachs has
said the suit is without merit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While half of the new managing directors are based in the
Americas, 28 percent are in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
and 22 percent are in Asia, van Praag said. He said the figures
represent a marginal increase in the number outside the
Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 45 percent of the new partners are based in the
Americas, with 29 percent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa
and 26 percent in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That, I think, is reflective of where their growth is
going to be,&#8221; Peabody said of the hires outside the Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a list of the new managing directors from
the internal memo: &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Firat Kayakiran" date="Nov 18, 2010 12:34 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-18/western-coal-receives-3-25-billion-proposal-to-combine-with-walter-energy.html"><headline>Walter Energy Offers to Acquire Western Coal for $3.25 Billion Cash, Stock</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc., a southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal, offered to buy Canada&#8217;s
Western Coal Corp. for C$3.3 billion ($3.2 billion) to increase
its access to the commodity as rising demand drives up prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy, based in Tampa, Florida, bid for the
outstanding common shares of Western Coal at C$11.50 a share in
cash and stock, the U.S. company said in a statement, adding
that it&#8217;s in exclusive talks. It also agreed to buy a 19.8
percent stake in Western Coal from largest shareholder Audley
European Opportunities Master Fund Ltd. for C$630 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A transaction with Western Coal would be transformational
for our company,&#8221; Joe Leonard, interim chief executive officer
of Walter Energy, said in the statement. &#8220;The combined company
would be the leading publicly traded pure-play metallurgical
coal producer in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Producers are seeking to add assets and expand reserves as
prices for coking, or steelmaking, coal advance. Demand from
Asia drove fourth-quarter prices up 62 percent from a year
earlier to $209 a ton, according to a benchmark contract between
BHP Billiton Ltd., the largest exporter, and Japanese
steelmakers JFE Holdings Inc. and Kobe Steel Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher Premium &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy&#8217;s bid represents a 59 percent premium to
Western Coal&#8217;s 20-day average price of C$7.23 on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. That compares with an average premium of 24
percent for coal-industry deals announced this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An almost 60 percent premium seems a lot,&#8221; said Sachin Shah, a special situations and merger arbitrage strategist at
Capstone Global Markets in New York. &#8220;As the largest
shareholder supports it, some kind of deal will eventually
happen.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Coal rose C$3.38, or 46 percent, to C$10.76 at
11:40 a.m. in Toronto. Walter Energy fell 34 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $94.37 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy will begin due diligence &#8220;immediately&#8221; with
a view to reaching an agreement in the next two weeks, Leonard
said today on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is advising Walter, and Simpson Thacher 
Bartlett LLP and Osler Hoskin  Harcourt LLP are legal counsel.
Western Coal is using Royal Bank of Canada, Cenkos Securities
Plc, Goodmans LLP, Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton  Garrison LLP,
and Trowers  Hamlins LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global Steel Production &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter has forecast more than 50 percent growth in global
steel output in the next decade, boosting consumption of coking
coal. &#8220;China, Brazil and India will continue to see major
growth; these dynamics will increase demand,&#8221; Leonard said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter will raise its output by 36 percent to 9.5 million
tons in 2012, while Western Coal, which operates in Canada, the
U.S. and Britain, is targeting production of 11 million tons in
the fiscal year through March 2013, up from 6.7 million tons in
fiscal 2011, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The increase in production and reserves would position
the new entity to capitalize on the current and anticipated
strength in the global metallurgical coal markets,&#8221; Walter
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Energy Co., the largest Central Appalachian coal
producer with 2.8 billion tons of reserves, will consider merger
proposals from steelmakers at a board meeting on Nov. 21, CEO
Don Blankenship said yesterday in New York. Closely held U.S.
producer Drummond Co., which has assets in Colombia, may be
targeted by BHP, UBS AG said Nov. 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy and Western Coal won&#8217;t pay penalties if a
&#8220;definitive agreement&#8221; isn&#8217;t reached and the exclusivity
agreement between them isn&#8217;t binding, according to a separate
statement from Western Coal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Retail investors bought more than 17
percent of General Motors Co.&#8217;s shares in its $20 billion
initial public offering yesterday, said Jes Staley, JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s investment bank chief executive officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than $3.5 billion of the stock was placed with U.S.
retail investors, Staley said in an interview on CNBC today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a great thing to get the public back in as a
shareholder of a company of the quality of General Motors,&#8221; he
said. The offering comes 16 months after the automaker emerged
from bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total issuance to retail investors was &#8220;the largest by
some distance of any IPO that&#8217;s ever been done,&#8221; GM Chief
Financial Officer Chris Liddell said earlier today in a
Bloomberg Television interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total SA and BP Plc bought cargoes
of North Sea Forties crude. Chevron Corp. halted production at
the Alba oilfield in the region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total said it purchased a shipment for loading on Nov. 28
to Nov. 30 at 60 cents below the Dated Brent benchmark.
Occidental Petroleum Corp.&#8217;s Phibro said it sold a Dec. 1 to
Dec. 3 delivery cargo at a 45-cent discount. Trafigura made a
bid without concluding a deal, according to traders involved in
North Sea transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reported North Sea market activity typically occurs during
a trading window that ends daily at 4:30 p.m. in London. Prior
to the window, Forties loading from 10 to 21 days in the future
cost 40 cents less than Dated Brent, from 45 cents less the day
before, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude for January settlement traded at $84.79 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange at the
close of the window, up from $84.52 a barrel at the same time
yesterday. The February contract traded at $84.93 a barrel,
widening the contango, or price spread, between the two nearest-
term contracts unchanged to 14 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp.&#8217;s North Sea Alba oil field remains closed
after an &#8220;emergency shutdown&#8221; yesterday following a gas
release, Sam Howard, a company spokesman, said by phone today
from Aberdeen, Scotland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Alba field produced about 32,000 barrels of oil a day
last year, according to Chevron. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria, a favored supplier of oil to U.S. refiners, plans
to keep daily exports of its 14 main crude grades unchanged in
January, according to preliminary loading schedules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipments of the Nigerian crude will average about 2.2
million barrels a day, the loading plans obtained by Bloomberg
News show. The same volume is to be shipped in December which
exclude Oso, Okwori and Pennington grades. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp.&#8217;s Richmond,
California, refinery flared gases because of a compressor loss,
according to a filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plant flared an unknown amount of sulfur dioxide at
about 5:45 a.m. local time today, according to the filing with
the California Emergency Management Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company planned to shut a
fluid catalytic cracker and an alkylation unit at the plant
starting in mid-October for several weeks of work, according to
a person with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker was said to
halt production around Oct. 15 and maintenance on the unit was
scheduled to last about 35 days, said the person in early
September, who declined to be identified because the information
wasn&#8217;t public. Two smaller units would also be shut for work
during the turnaround, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Richmond refinery operates a fluid catalytic cracker
and a hydrocracker, according to the company&#8217;s website. The
plant has a capacity of 257,200 barrels a day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks may postpone dividend
increases until the second quarter of next year after the
Federal Reserve issued new guidelines on capital levels,
according to a report by JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm reiterated its view the &#8220;better positioned
banks,&#8221; including U.S. Bancorp, PNC Financial Services Group
Inc. and Wells Fargo  Co., could be the first to raise
dividends, analysts led by Vivek Juneja said in a note to
clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;higher profitability banks will benefit because of
the Fed&#8217;s expectation of capital accretion under any capital
plan after factoring dividend payments and net share
repurchases,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts said. The second quarter
&#8220;could be the period for dividend increases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve yesterday issued guidelines on how it
will decide whether large U.S. banks may raise dividends and buy
back shares, requiring the lenders to submit to stress tests of
capital levels. The Fed is asking large banks to submit capital
plans by Jan. 7, regardless of whether they expect to boost
dividends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nitto Denko Corp. rose to the
highest in more than six months in Tokyo after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. raised its rating for the Japanese maker of materials
for electronics products on expected demand for tablet PCs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock gained 4 percent to 3,630 yen as of the close on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the highest close since April 30. The
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average added 2.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand next year for touch-panel products such as tablet
PCs and smartphones, which can surf the Web and play videos, may
boost sales of Nitto Denko&#8217;s optical film, Goldman Sachs analyst
Daiki Takayama, wrote in a report dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takayama raised Osaka-based Nitto Denko to &#8220;buy&#8221; from

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. and its partners
in a $15 billion liquefied natural gas development in Papua New
Guinea are likely to produce more fuel than they initially
expected during the first phase of the project, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture initially may produce 6.9 million metric tons
of LNG from two units, up from the 6.6 million tons previously
projected, according to Credit Suisse and Citigroup Inc.
analysts who cover Exxon&#8217;s partner, Oil Search Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Hides field drilling campaign next year is likely to
underpin an expansion of the project to a third processing unit,
Sydney-based Credit Suisse analyst Sandra McCullagh said after a
visit to the project in Papua New Guinea. A final investment
decision on the next stage may occur in 2012, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and partners approved the development of the project
almost a year ago. The venture may double the size of Papua New
Guinea&#8217;s economy, Port Moresby-based Oil Search has said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First exports are due in 2014. A third plant may begin in
2016, McCullagh said in the report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are increasingly confident&#8221; Oil Search has additional
growth opportunities that may boost earnings, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Search rose 2.3 percent to A$6.67 at the 4:10 p.m.
close in Sydney, compared with a 0.3 percent increase for the
benchmark SP/ASX 200 Index. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., whose
$11 billion suit against Barclays Plc is drawing to a close, is
going after JPMorgan Chase  Co. as the next deep pocket to pay
creditors in the biggest U.S. bankruptcy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman sued JPMorgan for $8.6 billion in collateral and
tens of billions in damages, claiming the bank and Chairman
James Dimon helped cause its collapse. The second-biggest U.S.
bank twice asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit. It said it was
protected by a law governing the $467 trillion market for swaps
and repurchase agreements when it lent Lehman&#8217;s failing
brokerage $100 billion a day during the 2008 financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s defense hinges on so-called &#8220;safe harbor&#8221;
laws, which allow clearing banks handling securities trades to
take collateral from dealers without getting sued if a
bankruptcy occurs later. Debtors can undo some transfers of
assets done close to a bankruptcy filing. Banks invoke safe-
harbor laws to oppose return of the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lehman has some viable claims here, so the real question
is going to be the scope of the safe-harbor provisions,&#8221; said
Stephen Lubben, a bankruptcy professor at Seton Hall University
School of Law in Newark, New Jersey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, has argued in court papers
that safe-harbor laws &#8220;present an insurmountable legal obstacle
to Lehman&#8217;s lawsuit.&#8221; Losing that argument may hurt confidence
in the market for swaps, repos and securities contracts, lawyers
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., General
Electric Co and Oracle Corp. are among the best companies on
which to use a buy-write strategy, which involves buying the
stock and selling a call option, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategists John Marshall and Maria Grant said the strategy
is attractive because selling May call options that are about 12
percent above the stock price allows investors to gain about 6
percent in premium from the sale and profit as much as 18
percent over the next six months, according to their report
dated yesterday. They listed 50 stocks with &#8220;buy&#8221; ratings from
Goldman Sachs analysts and share-price forecasts for a gain of
at least 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Selling a covered call generates upfront income for
investors willing to commit to sell their position (or a portion
of their position) at a target price,&#8221; the strategists wrote.
&#8220;Buy-writes are a good way to attempt to outperform peers in a
rangebound or weak market environment if there is a requirement
to be invested. Buy-writes are also attractive for investors who
believe a stock is a longer-term buy but should be range-bound
near term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based strategists also recommended using the
strategy on MGM Resorts International, Aruba Networks Inc.,
Salesforce.com Inc., CF Industries Holdings Inc. and E*Trade
Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;States&#8217; tax revenue grew about 6
percent in the three months ended in Sept. 30, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. estimated, the third consecutive quarterly increase
as the U.S. climbed out of the longest recession since the Great
Depression. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said its economists examined receipts from 16
states accounting for more than half of nationwide collections.
The year-over-year gain in the period appeared to continue into
the fourth quarter, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outlook for the state and local sector has improved
over the last several months, as revenues have picked up or at
least stabilized in most states,&#8221; Alec Phillips said in the
note to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gain may help states close budget deficits that will
likely total $140 billion in fiscal 2012, the Washington-based
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said in a report on Oct.
7. An 18-month recession that was declared over in June 2009
shrunk state tax collections by 8.4 percent in fiscal 2009 and
3.1 percent in fiscal 2010, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The third-quarter gain in tax collections would be the
third consecutive after five quarters of decline, based on a
report by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue grew by 2.5 percent in the first quarter and 2.3
percent in the second, according to the Albany, New York-based
institute. Rockefeller estimated on Oct. 19 that revenue rose
2.8 percent in the first two months of the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tushar Poddar, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. economist who correctly predicted how high India&#8217;s
central bank would raise interest rates this year, forecasts
further increases are needed to curb inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India may lift the repurchase rate as
much as 75 basis points in the first half of 2011 to 7 percent,
according to Poddar. That&#8217;s three times the median estimate of
25 basis points in a survey of 10 economists by Bloomberg News
yesterday. Only HSBC Holdings Plc. shared his forecast. Poddar
estimated in January 150 basis points of increases in 2010, a
call fulfilled by the bank&#8217;s Nov. 2 move. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a concern inflation may remain persistent
despite the RBI&#8217;s rate action,&#8221; Poddar said in the interview in
his office a day after the RBI&#8217;s meeting. &#8220;Ideally, both the
fiscal and the monetary policy should be tighter than where they
are right now to address inflation and the current-account
deficit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asia&#8217;s fastest round of monetary policy tightening
threatens to slow expansion in the $1.3 trillion economy and
push up government borrowing costs. While higher rates would
bolster the rupee by enhancing the premium over the near-zero
borrowing costs in the U.S., a widening current-account deficit
may limit gains and increase exchange-rate swings, Poddar said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation, IDBI &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s annual consumer-price inflation was 9.82 percent in
September, more than twice China&#8217;s and the highest among Group
of 20 nations after Argentina. China, the fastest-growing major
economy, raised its main one-year lending rate for the first
time since 2007 last month. Brazil raised benchmark borrowing
costs by 200 basis points this year, while Russia cut by 100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in India&#8217;s credit markets, state-owned lender
IDBI Bank Ltd. obtained a $125 million dollar-denominated loan.
GAIL India Ltd., the nation&#8217;s biggest natural gas distributor,
plans to raise about $420 million borrowing from the U.S.
Export-Import Bank and selling local-currency debt to fund
projects. The nation&#8217;s government bonds gained yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IDBI&#8217;s three-year loan will pay interest at 145 basis
points, or 1.45 percentage points, more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, or Libor, Executive Director
Melwyn Rego said in an interview yesterday. The loan was
arranged by 12 banks, including BNP Paribas, Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc and Standard Chartered Plc, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GAIL, a state-run company that recently got approval for a
$100 million loan from Exim Bank, has applied for another $100
million, Finance Director R.K. Goel said in a telephone
interview. The utility plans to raise 10 billion rupees ($220
million) in the year ending March 31 selling bonds, commercial
paper and raising funds from other state-run companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s 10-year bond yield rose one basis point to 8.03
percent as of 11:53 a.m. local time today. The bonds gained the
most in more than two weeks yesterday, driving the yield on the
7.80 percent note due May 2020 down five basis points to 8.02
percent, according to the central bank&#8217;s trading system. That
was the biggest decline since Nov. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While India&#8217;s benchmark 10-year rupee bond yield has risen
44 basis points this year, Poddar predicted it will remain at
about 8 percent through March. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium compared with similar-maturity U.S. Treasuries
has advanced to 517 basis points from 375 on Jan. 1, helping to
attract an unprecedented $10 billion of inflows into rupee debt
this year, bringing foreigners&#8217; holdings to $17.6 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rupee Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman forecasts the rupee will strengthen 4.2 percent to
43.40 per dollar in six months, adding to a 2.8 percent gain
this year to 45.25 as of today. It may lag behind some emerging-
market currencies because of India&#8217;s current-account deficit,
which may be 2.9 percent of gross domestic product for the year
through March, according to Goldman. The firm advised buying
South Korea&#8217;s won versus the rupee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBI Governor Duvvuri Subbarao raised the repurchase rate,
used to inject money into the financial system, to 6.25 percent
this year from 4.75 percent, and the reverse repurchase rate,
used to withdraw funds, to 5.25 percent from 3.25 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With inflation slowing, and the RBI concluding in September
that monetary policy had already returned &#8220;close to normal,&#8221;
India&#8217;s central bank said Nov. 2 that it probably wouldn&#8217;t boost
borrowing costs for at least three months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Immediate future rate action is unlikely barring some
shocks,&#8221; Subbarao said in a press conference in Mumbai Nov. 2.
He said in a Nov. 3 interview that it may take one or two years
to bring inflation &#8220;firmly&#8221; under control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Wait and Watch&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Chartered Plc predicted he will keep rates
unchanged through June to safeguard growth. Prime Minister
Manmohan Singh&#8217;s government wants the nation to achieve a
sustained 10 percent expansion pace. The International Monetary
Fund raised its 2010 economic growth forecast for India on Oct.
6 to 9.7 percent from 9.4 percent, the fastest pace among major
economies after China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The RBI will wait and watch,&#8221; said Samiran Chakraborty,
a Mumbai-based economist at Standard Chartered who previously
taught at the Delhi School of Economics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of fixing rates on money for a year has surged a
record 166 basis points this year to 6.72 percent in India&#8217;s
interest-rate swaps market, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
rate, a fixed payment made to receive floating rates, increased
24 points this quarter as the Federal Reserve announced plans to
pump $600 million into the U.S. economy by buying Treasuries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Taking a Risk&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The RBI is definitely taking a risk not hiking rate
further,&#8221; Edwin Gutierrez, a money manager who helps invest $6
billion in emerging market-debt at Aberdeen Asset Management Plc
in London, said in a Nov. 16 interview. &#8220;If stronger commodity
prices do indeed feed through from the Fed&#8217;s easing, that risk
will prove to be foolhardy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s wholesale inflation rate will reach 6.5 percent in
the year through March, a percentage point higher than the RBI&#8217;s
forecast, said Poddar, who researched the monetary systems of
Jordan and Lebanon while an economist at the International
Monetary Fund before joining Goldman in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pause in the interest-hiking cycle may be temporary
and RBI will resume raising rate in early 2011,&#8221; said Poddar,
37. The native of Kolkata earned his doctorate in economics from
the London School of Economics and his bachelor&#8217;s degree at
Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poddar predicted in January the central bank would announce
a shift in its main policy tool to the repurchase rate from the
reverse repo, resulting in monetary tightening to the extent of
another 150 basis points. The RBI did that in July as the
banking system faced a shortage of liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. underestimated in January the amount
of increases, predicting 0.75 to 1 percentage point before March
2011. Nomura Holdings Inc. the same month forecast a rise of
1.25 percentage points in the repo rate by December, as did HSBC
and Credit Agricole SA. Morgan Stanley correctly predicted the
year-end 6.25 percent level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Making forecasts in India is very difficult and can&#8217;t be
compared with advanced economies, given the inefficiencies in
the data compilation, such as for inflation,&#8221; Poddar said.
After his forecasting success in 2010, he said, &#8220;the stakes and
challenges have increased to get the next rate call right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

of increases, predicting 0.75 to 1 percentage point before March
2011. Nomura Holdings Inc. the same month forecast a rise of
1.25 percentage points in the repo rate by December, as did HSBC
and Credit Agricole SA. Morgan Stanley correctly predicted the
year-end 6.25 percent level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Making forecasts in India is very difficult and can&#8217;t be
compared with advanced economies, given the inefficiencies in
the data compilation, such as for inflation,&#8221; Poddar said.
After his forecasting success in 2010, he said, &#8220;the stakes and
challenges have increased to get the next rate call right.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 160 pounds of the gas was being released a day,

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, the former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. programmer charged with stealing secret
computer-trading software, wants to tell jurors about
exaggerated claims he says the government made, then took back,
in his case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &#8220;once believed that Sergey Aleynikov had
stolen Goldman Sachs&#8217;s entire high frequency trading platform,
worth millions of dollars, and that unless he was detained he
would sell it to the highest bidder and throw the world&#8217;s
financial markets into turmoil,&#8221; he said in court papers filed
today in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors now claim Aleynikov stole only parts of the
trading system, he claimed. The change in the government&#8217;s
position will help him prove he didn&#8217;t have the necessary intent
to violate the two laws he&#8217;s charged with breaking, he claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is charged with violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is presiding over the trial
set to begin Nov. 29, dismissed a third criminal count of
unauthorized computer access against Aleynikov in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessie Erwin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office
in New York, declined to comment on Aleynikov&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested in July 2009 and charged with
stealing computer trading code from Goldman Sachs on his last
day of work with the bank the month before. He&#8217;s seeking to
admit into evidence a series of statements made at a July 4,
2009, detention hearing by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov stole Goldman Sachs&#8217;s &#8220;proprietary, high-
quantity, high-volume trading platform with which they conduct
all of their trades in all major markets within the United
States and other places,&#8221; Aleynikov quoted Facciponti as saying
at the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Most Substantial Theft&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the most substantial theft that the bank can
remember ever happening to it, in the sense that the entire
platform has been stolen,&#8221; Facciponti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov also asked Cote to let his attorneys quote
another prosecutor on the case who, at a hearing in June, said
that Aleynikov is charged with stealing &#8220;just a portion of the
trading platform.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money managers may boost demand for
government-backed mortgage bonds because their holdings would be
about $200 billion higher if they matched the amounts of the
securities in benchmark debt indexes, according to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 37 percent of the investors are &#8220;underweight&#8221; the
debt, down from 67 percent during the summer, the New York-based
analysts led by Matt Jozoff said in a Nov. 19 report, citing a
survey that the bank conducted last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The potential for further purchases by money managers, who
recently increased their holdings by between $200 billion and
$300 billion, represents a source of support for the $5.2
trillion market as they drift toward &#8220;neutral&#8221; allocations,
the analysts said. The investors, who trimmed their holdings as
the Federal Reserve through March bought $1.25 trillion of
agency mortgage securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac
or Ginnie Mae, may go even further in their buying, Barclays
Capital analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Although money managers have increased their holdings
noticeably over the past few months, there is little to prevent
them from moving to overweight the sector, especially if there
are limited &#8216;cheap&#8217; alternatives,&#8221; the Barclays analysts led by
Ajay Rajadhyaksha in New York wrote in a Nov. 19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between 20 percent and 25 percent of money managers have
been &#8220;overweight&#8221; agency mortgage bonds throughout this year,
according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pimco Purchases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bill Gross, who runs the world&#8217;s biggest bond fund at
Pacific Investment Management Co., has been among recent buyers.
Last month, Pimco&#8217;s $256 billion Total Return Fund boosted
mortgage-related assets to 39 percent of holdings, the highest
level since July 2009, from 28 percent, according to data on the
website of the Newport Beach, California, company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prices of some mortgage bonds backed by higher-rate loans
have risen to records this month even as some benchmark
Treasuries tumbled. As of 10:30 a.m. in New York, 6.5 percent,
30-year fixed-rate securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae climbed
to 111.13 cents on the dollar, from 110.38 on Oct. 29, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are flocking to higher-coupon agency mortgage
bonds on the view that they will be repaid relatively quickly
even as loan rates increase, making the securities akin to
shorter-term Treasuries with higher yields, said Ken Hackel,
head of securitized product strategy at CRT Capital Group LLC in Stamford, Connecticut. At same time, investors are also wagering
they will be protected by limited refinancing by the underlying
homeowners, which returns their principal at par, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a little bit of an inconsistency in the way people
are looking at the world,&#8221; Hackel said in a Nov. 19 telephone
interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fannie Mae&#8217;s 6.5 percent securities have projected average
lives of 2.5 years based on average analyst prepayment
forecasts, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
Washington-based company&#8217;s 3.5 percent securities, with average
lives of 7.1 years, have fallen to 98.56 cents, from 100.75. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Motorola Inc.&#8217;s Mobility unit
filed a patent-infringement complaint today against Microsoft
Corp. with the U.S. International Trade Commission in
Washington, expanding a licensing feud between the two
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motorola Mobility, which makes handsets for mobile
telephones, said Microsoft&#8217;s Xbox gaming system is infringing
its patents and is seeking an order to block imports of the
products. Notice of the complaint was posted on the ITC&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s biggest software maker, filed a
lawsuit on Nov. 9 accusing Motorola of breaching contractual
obligations to fairly license patents on wireless networking and
video coding to be used in the Xbox. A day later Motorola filed
patent-infringement complaints in Florida and Wisconsin. The ITC
case contains allegations similar to those filed in Wisconsin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said Motorola is demanding patent royalties
that are &#8220;wholly disproportionate to the royalty rate that its
patents should command under any reasonable calculus.&#8221; Motorola
has said the demand was a &#8220;fair offer&#8221; that Microsoft refused
to accept. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the fight over Xbox licensing fees, Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft and Schaumburg, Illinois-based
Motorola have patent litigation complaints against each other
over mobile-phone technology. Microsoft filed an ITC case last
month seeking to block U.S. imports of Motorola&#8217;s Android
phones. That case is pending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, a former
central banker, is set to win re-election as mayor of Warsaw
without a runoff, one of the best results for her Civic Platform
party in local-government elections throughout Poland yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gronkiewicz-Waltz won 53 percent support, compared with 24
percent for her closest rival, Czeslaw Bielecki of the Law 
Justice party, according to official returns from 53 percent of
precincts. Civic Platform won 31 percent of the vote for
assemblies in Poland&#8217;s 16 provinces, compared with 23 percent
for Law  Justice, the biggest opposition party, the State
Election Commission said on its website today, citing returns
from 84 percent of precincts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civic Platform&#8217;s performance nationwide falls short of the
party&#8217;s expectations, said Wawrzyniec Konarski, a political
scientist at Krakow&#8217;s Jagiellonian University. Prime Minister
Donald Tusk&#8217;s party, which supports euro adoption and state
asset sales, had been counting on a result closer to 40 percent
after its main rival Law  Justice lost a half dozen members of
parliament to internal squabbles in recent weeks, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Platform has to ask itself why it didn&#8217;t do better,&#8221;
Konarski said by phone. &#8220;For the two main parties, the results
show that they must work very hard to win voters&#8221; before
general elections next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peasants Third &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Polish Peasants Party, Civic Platform&#8217;s partner in the
ruling coalition, ran third in elections to provincial
assemblies with 15.7 percent, followed by the opposition
Democratic Left Alliance, with 15.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Civic Platform is leading in nationwide opinion polls a
year before parliamentary elections are due, with 38 percent in
to an SMG/KRC poll for TVN24 television on Nov. 18. The party&#8217;s
candidate Bronislaw Komorowski won the presidency in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gronkiewicz-Waltz will face a runoff if her final tally is
below 50 percent. The incumbent mayor, elected in 2006 after
serving as a vice president of the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, campaigned on pledges to
continue building transportation facilities such as the
underground Metro network, after more than doubling the city&#8217;s
investment budget to 9 billion zloty ($3.1 billion) a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ll say, rather immodestly, that Warsaw needs a good
financial manager,&#8221; she said in an interview before the
election. &#8220;These are huge investments. You need to be able to
find funds, to create sophisticated financial architecture.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radoslaw Markowski, a sociology professor at the Polish
Academy of Sciences, said her popularity was due largely to the
effect of a &#8220;low base.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Nothing Happened&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing happened for years&#8221; and investments were
&#8220;paralyzed&#8221; under Gronkiewicz&#8217;s predecessor, Lech Kaczynski,
he said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In voting elsewhere, independent candidates won or were
leading mayoral elections in nine of Poland&#8217;s 18 largest cities.
Civic Platform candidates were ahead in six cities, the
Democratic Left Alliance in two, while Law  Justice&#8217;s candidate
won the first round in Lublin, in eastern Poland. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, extended its offer to acquire King Pharmaceuticals
Inc. to allow more time to seek regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $14.25-a-share offer announced last month will now
expire at the end of the day on Dec. 17, Pfizer said today in a
statement. The deal values Bristol, Tennessee-based King at $3.6
billion and was set to run out on Nov. 19. As of then, about 75
percent of King&#8217;s shares had been tendered, Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has yet to submit the paperwork needed to secure
antitrust approval for the acquisition, said Joan Campion, a
spokeswoman for the New York-based company. The companies still
anticipate that the transaction will be completed by the first
quarter, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The offer is contingent upon regulatory clearance and at
this point, we are working to submit our regulatory filings,&#8221;
Campion said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chinese policy measures to contain
inflation in 2011 will have a limited impact on oil-demand
growth, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The much bigger risk in the near term will come from the
current exceptional strength in diesel demand, which could push
Chinese oil demand to new highs in November and December,&#8221; the
bank said today in a report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects to add number of defendants accused of misusing
confidential information in BP lawsuit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) agreed to pay
Citigroup Inc. $100 million to settle claims that the San
Francisco-based bank improperly won bidding to acquire Wachovia
Corp. during the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are glad to put this matter behind us, and we look
forward to our two institutions working together constructively
in the future,&#8221; Wells Fargo said Nov. 19 in a joint statement
with New York-based Citigroup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo trumped Citigroup&#8217;s $2.16 billion bid for
Wachovia&#8217;s banking operations in 2008, by paying $12.7 billion
for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender in a deal that
required no guarantees from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
The final deal deprived Citigroup of a chance to bolster its
business, which later required a $45 billion government bailout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The takeover battle spawned lawsuits among the companies.
The settlement resolves &#8220;all claims related to this dispute,&#8221;
the banks said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lehman U.K. Unit Wins Court Ruling Over $1.5 Billion &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s former U.K. unit won a
court ruling allowing it to keep more than $1.5 billion worth of
securities left in the bank&#8217;s accounts when it collapsed more
than two years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers International Europe, which is liquidating
in London, had asked the U.K. court for direction on whether
five other Lehman units owned any of the securities that had
been bought and sold to one another in a series of internal
transactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is known as the &#8220;Rascals&#8221; litigation, for
&#8220;Regulation and Administration of Safe Custody and Local
Settlement,&#8221; the name of the bank&#8217;s internal process for making
accounting entries between LBIE and the affiliates to record
repurchase arrangements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The standard Rascals process had the effect of
transferring that beneficial ownership in the securities to
LBIE,&#8221; its administrators at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP said in
a statement Nov. 19. &#8220;LBIE retained beneficial ownership of the
securities thereafter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed for the U.S.&#8217;s biggest bankruptcy in September
2008, roiling financial markets and contributing to the worst
economic crisis since the Great Depression. The U.K. unit has
been involved in suits with the parent company in the U.S. and
affiliates throughout Europe over billions in accounts frozen
when the bank collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Lehman Brothers International
(Europe)(In Administration), case no. 7942/2008, High Court of
Justice, Chancery Division (London). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Ex-SocGen Trader Found Guilty of Stealing Secrets &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Societe Generale SA (GLE) trader Samarth Agrawal was found
guilty of stealing trade secrets related to the bank&#8217;s high-speed computer trading software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal court jury in New York delivered the verdict on
Nov. 19 at the end of a two-week trial. U.S. District Judge Jed
S. Rakoff set Agrawal&#8217;s sentencing for Feb. 24. He faces a
prison term of as long as four years and nine months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agrawal testified, under questioning by his own lawyer,
Ivan Fisher, that he shared information about Societe Generale&#8217;s
trading software with a Manhattan hedge fund, Tower Research
Capital LLC, where he hoped to create a similar system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rakoff, who told lawyers he was &#8220;puzzled&#8221; by Agrawal&#8217;s
self-incriminating testimony, said he assumed Fisher was using a
&#8220;sympathy defense&#8221; on his client&#8217;s behalf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agrawal was convicted of theft of trade secrets and
transporting stolen property in interstate commerce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the trial, Agrawal told jurors his superiors at
Societe General encouraged him to work at home because spending
too many nights and weekends in the office would raise &#8220;red
flags&#8221; for company security. For that reason, he said, he
printed copies of the computer codes in June 2009 to study at
home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Agrawal, 10-cr-00417, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Will Ferrell Loses $18 Million Claim Against JPMorgan Unit &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A securities arbitration panel rejected an $18 million
claim by a group of investors including actors Will Ferrell and
Larry David against a unit of JPMorgan Chase  Co., ordering
instead that they reimburse the bank for more than $600,000 in
legal costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two, along with Ferrell&#8217;s wife, Viveca Paulin, and Los
Angeles business manager Matt Lichtenberg, filed a complaint
against J.P. Morgan Securities with the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. They said that the brokerage, originally a
component of Bear Stearns  Co., made unauthorized investments
in &#8220;preferred securities,&#8221; which the complaint didn&#8217;t specify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A three-member arbitration panel denied the claim &#8220;in its
entirety&#8221; Nov. 12, according to documents released by Finra.
The panel told the comedians&#8217; group to pay $600,000 in J.P.
Morgan&#8217;s legal costs, adding $22,500 &#8220;for discovery abuse and
failure to comply with the forum&#8217;s discovery rules and
procedures.&#8221; The award documents said the group repeatedly
failed to produce required documentation quickly enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents said Ferrell and the others accused J.P.
Morgan of engaging in &#8220;unauthorized and unsuitable purchases of
unspecified preferred securities with regard to their respective
accounts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan declined to comment on the decision.
Lichtenberg didn&#8217;t respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Merck Wins Verdict in Suit Claiming Fosamax Defect &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck  Co. (MRK)&#8217;s Fosamax osteoporosis drug isn&#8217;t responsible
for a Florida woman&#8217;s dental and jaw problems, a New York jury
found Nov. 19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judith Graves sued Merck in 2006, alleging the company
failed to warn doctors and patients that the bone-loss drug was
linked to jaw tissue death. Graves said she developed jaw
problems requiring multiple surgeries after taking the drug.
Merck said her condition was connected to underlying medical
conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The evidence showed the company acted properly and that
Fosamax did not cause the plaintiff&#8217;s dental and jaw problems,&#8221;
Mike Brock, Merck&#8217;s attorney, said in a statement. &#8220;The
plaintiff had multiple medical conditions that can cause people
to develop jaw and dental problems.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, is facing
more than 1,500 claims in federal and state courts alleging
Fosamax defects, the company said. With the Nov. 19 decision,
Merck has won two of the three cases that have gone to a jury
verdict. In the third case, the jury&#8217;s $8 million award was
reduced to $1.5 million last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are obviously disappointed as every single treating
doctor testified Fosamax caused Mrs. Graves&#8217; osteonecrosis of
the jaw,&#8221; her lawyer, Tim O&#8217;Brien, said in an e-mail. Graves
will appeal, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Graves v. Merck  Co., 1:06-cv-05513, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kinder Morgan&#8217;s Settlement of Buyout Suits Approved &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinder Morgan Inc., the Houston-based pipeline company
taken private in a $22 billion leveraged buyout, won approval of
a $200 million settlement of investor lawsuits over the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A state court judge in Topeka, Kansas, concluded Nov. 19
that the agreement resolving shareholders&#8217; complaints about the
2007 buyout was a reasonable resolution of the securities-fraud
cases. Investors alleged they were being shortchanged in the
offer by a group led by co-founder Richard Kinder to take the
company private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased we were able to achieve such a phenomenal
settlement for shareholders,&#8221; Randy Baron, a lawyer
representing investors, said in an e-mail. Baron said the accord
is the largest securities-fraud settlement in the U.S. of suits
challenging a buyout. It will provide some investors as much as
$2-a-share more for their Kinder Morgan stock, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinder&#8217;s group agreed to pay $107.50 a share for Kinder
Morgan&#8217;s stock as part of the buyout. The group also assumed $7
billion in debt, bringing the transaction&#8217;s value to $22
billion, the largest-ever pipeline acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the company and the investor group believe that the
acquisition of KMI&#8217;s public shares was accomplished through a
completely open and fair process and denies all allegations of
wrongdoing, we believe it is in the best interests of all
parties to avoid the expense and uncertainty of continued
litigation,&#8221; Larry Pierce, Kinder Morgan&#8217;s spokesman, said in
an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Kinder Morgan Inc. Shareholders
Litigation, Consolidated Cases 06-C-801, Shawnee County, Kansas,
District Court, Division 12 (Topeka). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Toyota Speed-Up Cases Won&#8217;t Be Dismissed, Judge Says &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge tentatively ruled that he will reject most
of Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)&#8217;s first major legal challenge to class-action lawsuits filed against the automaker by car owners over
sudden acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The car owners&#8217; lawyers provided sufficient evidence to
allow their cases to go forward, U.S. District Judge James V.
Selna in Santa Ana, California, said in a tentative ruling
posted on his court&#8217;s website. Selna heard arguments Nov. 19
over Toyota&#8217;s motion to dismiss class-action, or group, lawsuits
claiming economic loss linked to sudden acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is true that plaintiffs do not generally allege the
precise dollar value of their losses, but that level of
specificity is not required at this pleading stage,&#8221; Selna
wrote in his 63-page ruling. &#8220;It is enough that they allege a
tangible loss that can be proved or disproved upon discovery.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selna said he would issue a final ruling by the U.S.
Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economic-loss lawsuits, combined for pretrial filings
and rulings before Selna, claim Toyota drove down the value of
vehicles by failing to fix or disclose defects that triggered
unintended acceleration. Federal suits claiming death or injury
caused by such episodes are also combined in the Santa Ana
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota asked Selna to dismiss the car owners&#8217; claim that
the company knew of a defect in the vehicles&#8217; electronic
throttle control system and concealed it from consumers. The
plaintiffs failed to identify an &#8220;actual defect,&#8221; the company
said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selna said would let this claim go forward. &#8220;Plaintiffs&#8217;
fraudulent concealment claim pleads particular facts in support
of the defect allegations, and that is all that is required at
this stage,&#8221; he wrote in the tentative ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These rulings are only tentative and come at a stage of
the legal proceedings in which the judge has to accept that what
the plaintiffs allege are true,&#8221; said Toyota attorney Lisa
Gilford in an interview after the hearing. &#8220;We are confident
that as the facts develop in this case they will show that there
are no defects in these Toyota vehicles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The burden &#8220;is now squarely on plaintiffs&#8217; counsel to
prove their allegations, and Toyota is confident that no such
proof exists,&#8221; Celeste Migliore, a company spokeswoman, said in
an e-mailed statement. The claim that Toyota&#8217;s electronic
throttle control system is defective is &#8220;wholly
unsubstantiated,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the judge finalizes these tentative rulings they will
be a substantial victory for the plaintiffs,&#8221; consumer lawyer
Steve W. Berman said after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are combined as In re Toyota Motor Corp.
Unintended Acceleration Marketing, Sales Practices and Products
Liability Litigation, 8:10-ml-02151, U.S. District Court,
Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FDIC Seeks Lawyer Documents as Suits Loom Against Failed Banks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has sued one law firm
and threatened to sue another to obtain documents lawyers
received from executives at five banks that have failed since
the onset of the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC seeks the return of files and records that
officers and directors at the five financial institutions copied
and gave to private lawyers before their banks collapsed,
according to documents in two cases filed in federal court in
Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC is also preparing to file negligence and fraud
suits against executives of failed banks. The FDIC board has
authorized civil suits against more than 80 officers and
directors of failed banks, while the bank regulator and the FBI
are cooperating on about 50 cases of possible criminal
violations involving former and current bank employees and
customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the FDIC&#8217;s position that we must return these
documents, which were shared with us by our clients, is
unsupported and unreasonable, and significantly limits our
clients&#8217; abilities to defend themselves effectively,&#8221; Mark
Flanagan, managing partner at McKenna Long  Aldridge LLP, which
sued the FDIC on Nov. 17, said in an e-mail. &#8220;The resolution of
this issue will have a wide ranging impact on the rights of all
bank officers and directors and the law firms that represent
them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKenna Long&#8217;s suit against the FDIC asks the federal court
to determine what should be done with the documents. The firm is
based in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McKenna Long represents executives from four banks that
failed this year: Darby Bank  Trust Co. in Vidalia, Georgia;
McIntosh Commercial Bank in Carrollton, Georgia; Northwest Bank
 Trust in Acworth, Georgia; and K Bank in Randallstown,
Maryland. As part of that representation, the firm says it has
received copies of board and committee minutes, commercial loan
files, and reports prepared by the bank executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FDIC demanded that McKenna Long &#8220;immediately return to
the FDIC as receiver all bank records and all copies therof
taken from any failed bank,&#8221; according to a Nov. 15 letter from
James M. Barker, managing counsel for the FDIC, court papers
show. The letter said accessing, copying, and removal of the
documents violated the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. The FDIC
also said the law firm must return any legal fees that were paid
from the banks&#8217; funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are FDIC v. Bryan Cave LLP, 10-cv-03666, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of Georgia (Atlanta), and
McKenna Long  Aldridge LLP v. FDIC, 10-cv-3779. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;UBS, Ex-Private Banking Clients Sue Over Investments &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS AG (UBSN)&#8217;s Singapore unit sued two former private banking
clients, saying they failed to pay for investment losses of
S$9.3 million ($7.2 million). The couple countersued, accusing
UBS of negligence in investment advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS claims Ng Kok Keong and his wife Yow Sin May placed
bets on foreign currencies and failed to pay for a shortfall in
their account, according to court papers filed with the
Singapore High Court. The trial is scheduled to start Nov. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ng had limited experience in the financial market and
relied on UBS and banker Lily See for advice, according to the
couple&#8217;s counterclaim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See belatedly informed Ng and his wife that money in their
account had dipped below minimum requirements and failed to
close certain trades, causing further losses, the couple claimed
in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Yeo, a Singapore-based spokeswoman at UBS, said the
company doesn&#8217;t comment on ongoing legal issues. The couple&#8217;s
lawyer Kelvin Chia also declined to comment. UBS is represented
by Cavinder Bull from Drew  Napier LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is UBS AG, Singapore Branch v. Ng Kok Keong  Yow
Sin May S390/2009 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Societe Generale Says Ex-Client, Suing Over Losses, Knew Risks &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Societe Generale SA&#8217;s Singapore unit, sued by a former
private banking client for hiding investment losses, said the
legally trained businessman made his own decisions and
understood the terms of the bank&#8217;s agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan Leong Cheng &#8220;held himself out to be a sophisticated
investor who was capable of evaluating the terms, potential
financial consequences and risks of foreign currency trading,&#8221;
the unit of France&#8217;s second-biggest bank said in its defense
filed with the Singapore High Court Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chan, a resident of Perth, Western Australia, sued Societe
Generale and two of its executives last month in a bid to
recover $7.9 million of the losses. Chan claimed Senior Director
Liew Marn Leng and her supervisor Lilian Ang made wrong currency
bets which almost depleted his $10 million account and for years
removed pages from his statements to hide the losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chan Leong Cheng vs. Societe Generale Bank 
Trust Singapore Branch, Liew Marn Leng Jenny and Lilian Ang,
S780/2010 in the Singapore High Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;BP Ordered to Return Items by Singapore Court in Trader Case &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP Plc (BP/)&#8217;s former head of fuel oil trading Quek Chin Thean
and four other ex-employees won a Singapore court ruling to set
aside a search order, ordering the oil company to return all the
items it took. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Singapore court ruling, part of an ongoing trial
involving the workers, also ordered a separate hearing on costs
and damages to the five people. A sixth person&#8217;s application for
the so-called Anton Piller Order to be set aside wasn&#8217;t granted,
according to an e-mailed statement released Nov. 19 by the six
former BP oil-trading executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The court&#8217;s ruling vindicates their stand that the APOs
were taken out for unlawful reasons, and that the plaintiff had
failed to disclose material facts to the court when the APOs
were obtained in the first place,&#8221; they said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London-based oil company sued Quek and five other
former employees. Five of them allegedly wrongfully downloaded
and misused confidential information, including oil-trading
&#8220;cheat sheets.&#8221; BP accused the group of helping rival Shenzhen
Brightoil Group set up a competing business in Singapore. Quek,
whose official title was head of residues trading, was fired
from BP on July 9. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BP says the latest court order still upholds its request to
protect trade secrets. &#8220;The orders reflect the court&#8217;s
recognition of the need in this case to protect BP&#8217;s
confidential information and to prevent the destruction of
evidence, whilst balancing competing interests,&#8221; Robert Wine, a
spokesman based in London, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quek, Clarence Chang, John Foo and Laura Kuan countersued
BP in August for wrongful dismissal and claimed the company
withheld money owed to them. The group, including former head of
operations Paul John Bradshaw and legal manager Simon Cheong,
has denied misusing any of BP&#8217;s trade secrets. They were fired
after the company said it found evidence of wrongdoing. BP
accused five of them, excluding Cheong, of &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;misusing confidential information. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;New Suits &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Citigroup Sued in N.Y. for &#8216;Accelerated&#8217; Foreclosures &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. was accused of using fraudulent paperwork to
process &#8220;accelerated&#8221; mortgage foreclosures in a lawsuit filed
in federal court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Motivated by speed and profits rather than obligatory
attention to detail, Citi failed to record necessary documents
to legally foreclose,&#8221; borrower Brian Costigan said in his
complaint seeking class-action status on behalf of others who
had home loans with the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint includes claims for breach of contract,
breach of good faith and fair dealing, and fraud against
Citigroup and its mortgage unit, Citimortgage Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Costigan said Citigroup employees submitted fraudulent
affidavits that allegedly proved Citi&#8217;s control of a mortgage
and &#8220;outsourced tasks&#8221; to outsiders without adequate
oversight. He said the bank used &#8220;robo signers&#8217; and didn&#8217;t
verify amounts borrowed and determine which institutions had a
right to foreclose. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Citigroup, didn&#8217;t return a
voice-mail message left at his office after business hours
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Brian Costigan v. Citigroup, 10-CV-8776, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Oracle Rests SAP Case Without Apotheker Evidence &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle Corp. (ORCL) rested its copyright infringement damages case
against SAP AG (SAP) without showing jurors the full videotaped
deposition of former SAP Chief Executive Officer Leo Apotheker,
who is now Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)&#8217;s CEO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safra Catz, Oracle&#8217;s co-president, testified Nov. 19 in the
portion of the trial in which the Redwood City, California-based
company sought to rebut SAP&#8217;s assertions that it should pay no
more than about $40 million in damages. Oracle is seeking at
least $1.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closing arguments are scheduled to begin Nov. 22, after
which the jury will begin deliberations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle attorney David Boies previously said testimony from
Apotheker was important to the case because he was &#8216;&#8216;at the
center of&#8221; the conduct by an SAP unit that illegally downloaded
Oracle software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apotheker&#8217;s testimony by video &#8220;didn&#8217;t add anything,&#8221;
Boies said in an interview outside the courtroom. The deposition
was taken in 2008 and Apotheker testified about matters that
were &#8220;superseded&#8221; by agreements SAP made not to contest
liability for the unit&#8217;s infringement or that SAP contributed to
the infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle showed a short excerpt of Apotheker&#8217;s video during
opening arguments, which can&#8217;t be considered as evidence by the
jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle was unable to serve Apotheker with a subpoena to
testify at the trial. &lt;/p&gt;

Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Kissel Loses Bid to Halt Retrial for Husband&#8217;s Murder &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nancy Kissel, charged with the 2003 murder of her Merrill
Lynch  Co. (BAC) banker husband, will be retried, a Hong Kong judge
ruled, rejecting her application for the proceedings to be
halted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Andrew Macrae told the media not to report the
details of his ruling. He previously ordered the media not to
report on the details of her application for a stay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michigan-born Kissel, serving a life sentence in prison,
would have been released had her application been successful.
Prosecutors charged her again with murder in March after Hong
Kong&#8217;s top court overturned her 2005 conviction. The 46-year-old
mother of three&#8217;s retrial is set to begin on Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kissel&#8217;s defense lawyer Derek Chan declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s Court of Final Appeal said in February that
Kissel&#8217;s conviction was flawed because the judge wrongly allowed
hearsay evidence and prosecutors improperly questioned her
during the 2005 trial. Jurors heard in the three-month trial
that she drugged her husband Robert with a milkshake, bludgeoned
him to death and hid his body in a carpet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Nancy Ann Kissel and HKSAR, HCCC55/2010, Hong
Kong Court of First Instance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. settled a
dispute with Varun Bery, who had sued the bank in Hong Kong for
breaching an agreement that allowed him to leave with the
private equity team and platform he managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bery will provide private equity consultancy services to
JPMorgan, they said in a joint statement announcing the
&#8220;amicable resolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bery, who co-founded private equity firm TVG Capital
Partners Ltd., sued JPMorgan Private Capital Asia Corp. in April,
claiming damages &#8220;in the region of $30.8 million.&#8221; Bery joined
JPMorgan in 2008 to head the bank&#8217;s Asian private equity
business and was told in 2009 that the bank wouldn&#8217;t commit more
capital to it, or allow it to be spun out, according to the
lawsuit. He left the bank in November 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bery continues to operate as managing director of TVG and
JPMorgan wishes him every success in the future, according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Ray Bashford and TVG spokeswoman Emily
Chow declined to comment on whether the spin out will be allowed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anthony W. Ling, head of European
equity research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is moving into a
new role and handing off responsibilities to three deputies,
according to three people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ling, who has overseen the research since 2000, will focus
on other investment research initiatives including GS Sustain,
the product centered on companies that pursue socially and
environmentally sustainable policies, said two of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the move isn&#8217;t public. He
joined the bank in 1999 and has been a partner since 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick Hargreaves, John Sawtell and Richard Tufft are
taking over his responsibilities, the people said. Tufft was
elected to become a partner last week, while Hargreaves and
Sawtell are both managing directors, one level below partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sophie Bullock, a spokeswoman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs in London, said she couldn&#8217;t comment. Financial News
reported Ling&#8217;s decision to step down from running European
equity research earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain announced a limit of 21,700
on the number of visas for skilled workers, clamping down on
migrants without jobs while leaving room for companies to bring
in staff after they warned a cap might hurt the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister David Cameron pledged before the May
election to reduce net immigration from outside the European
Union to below 100,000 people a year, half the level of 2009.
Companies warned the proposed cap might make it harder to
attract talent and in September Business Secretary Vince Cable
said that a temporary limit had been &#8220;very damaging.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting out how the cap will work from April next year,
Home Secretary Theresa May told Parliament today that only 1,000
visas will be issued to people of &#8220;exceptional talent&#8221; who
don&#8217;t have job offers. The number of visas available for people
with offers will be 20,700, an increase of 7,000 on the total
issued in 2009. Companies will face no limits on bringing in
overseas staff earning more than 40,000 pounds ($63,000) a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This package will serve the needs of British business,&#8221;
May told lawmakers. &#8220;It will respond to the wishes of the
British public.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cameron made an immigration clampdown a key election
pledge, but his proposed cap was opposed by Cable&#8217;s Liberal
Democrat party, the junior partner in the coalition government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immigration Surge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net migration into the U.K. surged after Poland and other
eastern European nations joined the EU in 2004. In 2007, it
reached 233,000, compared with 48,000 a decade earlier when the
previous Labour government took office, Office for National
Statistics data show. It stood at 196,000 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May said today the salary requirement on &#8220;intra-company
transfers&#8221; would have blocked half the 22,000 visas granted in
2009. None of today&#8217;s announcements cover workers from within
the EU, whose citizens are free to live and work in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour home affairs spokesman Ed Balls said the government
&#8220;has been in wholesale retreat&#8221; on immigration. &#8220;Her proposed
cap is a con, a fig leaf and no cap at all,&#8221; he said in reply. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Business will be pleased to see that the government has
taken its concerns on board,&#8221; said David Frost, director
general of the British Chambers of Commerce. His words were
echoed by John Cridland, director-general designate of the
Confederation of British Industry, who said the announcement
&#8220;shows that the government has listened to the needs of
business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tougher Test &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May said the current &#8220;Tier One,&#8221; for highly-skilled
migrants without a job offer, will be reduced to 1,000 visas for
scientists, academics and artists. &#8220;Tier Two,&#8221; for workers
with a job offer, will be restricted to graduates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students face a tougher test, too. May said she&#8217;ll consult
on restricting visas to those coming to studying at degree level
or above -- around half the current level. When they finish
their courses, they may also find it harder to get visas to work
in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other moves include breaking the link between temporary
visas and permanent settlement and requiring people applying for
marriage visas to demonstrate they speak English. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We must tighten up our immigration system, focusing on
tackling abuse and supporting only the most economically
beneficial migrants,&#8221; May said. &#8220;We will have to take action
across all routes of entry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors that helped companies from
Microsoft Corp. to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. sell bonds at record-low
borrowing costs are being punished on concern Federal Reserve
efforts to stave off deflation will drive up yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You kind of have come up to a buyers&#8217; strike or buyers&#8217;
sensitivity,&#8221; in terms of low-coupon debt, said Thomas Chow, a
money manager at Philadelphia-based Delaware Investments, which
oversees $120 billion of fixed-income assets. &#8220;Higher yield and
higher coupons offer some protection from rising rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt from Wal-Mart, Microsoft and Coca-Cola Co. sold in the
past two months with relative yields as low as 25 basis points
is trailing investment-grade credit that pays an average spread
of 175 basis points. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is urging
investors to buy bonds with spreads at least 200 basis points
above U.S. Treasuries as the Fed seeks to purchase $600 billion
of government debt to avert deflation and expand the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft&#8217;s $1 billion of 10-
year, 3 percent notes have fallen 1.95 cents on the dollar from
their Sept. 22 issue to 97.19 cents as of Nov. 18, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The 2 percent loss on the top-ranked debt
compares with a 0.2 percent decline for investment-grade bonds
since Sept. 23, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying Opportunity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price declines in the bonds of some of the world&#8217;s highest-
rated companies are an opportunity to buy the securities as a
hedge against contagion from Europe&#8217;s debt crisis, which may
weaken the Treasury market, said Jason Weiner, a senior fixed-
income fund manager in Milwaukee at MI Investment Management
Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At some point, what&#8217;s going on in Ireland, Greece,
Portugal and other sovereign-risk countries out there could
infect the U.S. Treasury market on the basis we issued too much
debt and we&#8217;re no longer a safe haven,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to own company bonds instead of similar-maturity
government debt rose 1 basis point to 166 basis points, or 1.66
percentage point, down from this year&#8217;s high of 201 basis points
on June 11, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s Global
Broad Market Corporate Index. Yields averaged 3.63 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative yields on U.S. investment-grade bonds were
unchanged yesterday at 175 basis points, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch&#8217;s U.S. Corporate Master Index. Spreads
have declined 2 basis points this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Default Swaps Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of protecting bonds from default in the U.S. rose
for a second day to the highest level in a week. The Markit CDX
North America Investment Grade Index, which investors use to
hedge against losses on corporate debt or to speculate on
creditworthiness, increased 2.8 basis points to a mid-price of
93.8 basis points as of 12:56 p.m. in New York, according to
index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The index, which typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves, ended Nov. 19 at 89.8
basis points. Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a
borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the
defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a
contract protecting $10 million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance Food Group Co., the food distributor owned by
Blackstone Group LP, pulled its proposed $550 million note sale
citing &#8220;adverse market conditions,&#8221; according to a person
familiar with the transaction. The company was marketing seven-
year notes, said the person, who declined to be identified
citing lack of authorization to speak publicly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Amusements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Amusements Inc., the movie theater company
controlled by Sumner Redstone, plans to sell $390 million of
seven-year senior secured notes, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. The debt may be issued as soon as next
week, said the person, who declined to be identified because
terms aren&#8217;t set. The bonds may be sold through the company&#8217;s
NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC unit with proceeds used to
refinance a credit facility, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since July, companies from McDonald&#8217;s Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest restaurant chain, to drugmaker Johnson  Johnson, sold
debt at record low borrowing costs as investors priced in a
slower economic recovery and the Fed held interest rates near
zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, rated Aaa by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and AAA
by SP, obtained the second-lowest borrowing costs for 10-year
debt, after Johnson  Johnson and Colgate-Palmolive Co.,
Bloomberg data show. Investor demand and record-low yields on
investment-grade debt helped the world&#8217;s largest software maker
issue the securities in its second bond offering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart, the world&#8217;s largest retailer, sold $750 million
of 0.75 percent bonds on Oct. 18 at the lowest borrowing cost
for three-year notes, according to Bank of America Corp., which
helped manage the offering. The notes lost 0.41 cent on the
dollar to trade at 99.24 cents as of Nov. 18, Trace data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their 0.4 percent decline since they were sold compares
with the 0.02 percent gain on investment-grade corporate bonds
due in one to three years, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds with low coupons are suffering because too many hedge
funds and &#8220;fast-money flippers&#8221; purchased the securities,
instead of investors who typically buy and hold the debt, said
Tim Doubek, a portfolio manager who helps oversee more than $22
billion of investment-grade credit at Columbia Management in
Minneapolis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Lumber Around&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re just finding people want to sell them right around
where they were issued, and they really can&#8217;t interest any
buyers because a large portion of the buyer base of that new
issue is trying to do the same thing,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to
be one of those markets where the high-quality new issues lumber
around where they came or widen and you&#8217;ll see really, really
good deep bids for lower-quality names.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spreads in 2011 are likely to tighten most on debt from
high-quality financials, low-quality non-financials and bonds
maturing between five and seven years, Goldman strategists
Charles Himmelberg, Alberto Gallo, Lotfi Karoui and Annie Chu
wrote in a Nov. 19 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our rates team expects long-dated Treasuries to move
higher on economic recovery, both in the U.S. and globally, and
the normalization of U.S. inflation expectations, with yields on
the 10-year rising to 3.3 percent by the end of 2011,&#8221; the
strategists wrote. &#8220;We expect total returns on tight-spread
credit to underperform accordingly, with high-quality names
suffering the most.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola&#8217;s 0.75 percent, 3-year notes issued on Nov. 4 at
99.953 cents on the dollar, tying Wal-Mart&#8217;s record, traded at
99.382 cents as of 12:06 p.m. in New York, Trace data show. The
$1.25 billion of debt from the world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker
has lost 0.8 percent since issue, compared with the 0.28 percent
decline on investment-grade corporate bonds due between one and
three years during the same period, Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weiner, whose firm oversees about $32 billion, including
the Microsoft securities issued in September, says he will
consider purchasing some of the low-coupon debt from companies
such as International Business Machines Corp. of Armonk, New
York, and Microsoft, if they continue to decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are willing to buy IBM and Microsoft and other
corporations that have really solid balance sheets and adds
diversification away from Treasuries,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the base of snowcapped Mount Fuji
sits a bright yellow compound that is home to one of Japan&#8217;s
most profitable -- and secretive -- companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc Ltd.&#8217;s systems tell lathes, grinders and milling
machines how to turn steel into an Apple Inc. iPhone case or
aluminum into the rib of a Boeing Co. 747. More than half of the
world&#8217;s computerized tools, including those used by suppliers to
Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors Co., use Fanuc controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re the Microsoft you&#8217;ve never heard of,&#8221; said Scott Foster, an analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo. &#8220;If Mount Fuji
erupted and took them out, the world would stop running.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc&#8217;s operating margin rose to a record 44 percent last
quarter, the company said, making it the third highest on the
Topix 100, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. To further
boost profits, President Yoshiharu Inaba is focusing on China
and India, Asia&#8217;s two fastest-growing major economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re working harder than ever to penetrate the Chinese
and Indian markets,&#8221; Inaba, 62, said last month at company
headquarters. &#8220;All of our capacity is running full-out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc boosted net income to 31.1 billion yen ($373.1
million) last quarter, an almost eightfold increase from a year
earlier. That&#8217;s more than double the growth reported by 1,605
companies on the Topix, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, India Focus &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s success contrasts with Japan&#8217;s net exports,
or shipments less imports, which were unchanged in the third
quarter as the yen traded near a 15-year high. Worldwide
spending on machine tools this year will rise 12 percent to $56
billion, U.K.-based researcher Oxford Economics Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re the industry standard,&#8221; said Osamu Matsuda, an
assistant manager for Jtekt Corp., Japan&#8217;s biggest listed
toolmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s $19.5 billion machine-tool market, the world&#8217;s
biggest, is forecast to grow by as much as 20 percent a year
through 2015, Oxford Economics said. India is forecast to grow
by as much as 30 percent a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc&#8217;s biggest rival is Munich-based Siemens AG, Europe&#8217;s
largest engineering company, which introduced a simpler product
lineup to appeal to Chinese manufacturers. Shenyang Machine Tool
Co., China&#8217;s biggest tool maker, is developing its own controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubiquitous Color &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc&#8217;s headquarters are a sprawling, yellow campus
surrounded by forest in the shadow of Japan&#8217;s tallest mountain.
Workers in yellow jumpsuits bearing paramilitary-style badges
trot between yellow buildings as yellow cars hum along pine-
lined roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inaba&#8217;s father, Seiuemon, who ran the $35 billion company
for almost three decades after it spun off from Fujitsu Ltd. in
1972, picked the color because it &#8220;promotes clear thinking,&#8221;
workers said. Fanuc&#8217;s website also features yellow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 85-year-old electrical engineer once gave researchers a
clock running 10 times faster than normal to remind them to stay
ahead of the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yellow robots work nonstop cranking out Fanuc&#8217;s mainstay
product: the computer numerical controls, or CNC, that run more
than 50 percent of the world&#8217;s automated machine tools, the
company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc also makes yellow robots that help Nissan Motor Co.,
based in Yokohama, Japan, weld cars. Its machine tools are used
by Foxconn Technology Group, the world&#8217;s largest contract
manufacturer of electronics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing, General Electric &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company rarely allows visitors inside its factories,
and workers not engaged in research don&#8217;t have access to
laboratories. Most board members can&#8217;t get in, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In a factory floor as big as a football field, you might
see four people,&#8221; said Morten Paulsen, an analyst at CLSA Asia-
Pacific Markets in Tokyo. &#8220;The rest are robots reproducing
themselves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc dominates shop floors in Japan, where its CNC panels
run as much as 70 percent of machine tools, including those at
suppliers to Toyota City-based Toyota, the world&#8217;s biggest
carmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., Fanuc panels help automate production for
Chicago-based Boeing, the world&#8217;s largest aerospace company, and
Fairfield, Connecticut-based General Electric Co., the world&#8217;s
biggest provider of power-generation equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E-Mail Banned &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc shares have surged 40 percent this year even as it
keeps shareholders at arm&#8217;s length. The company doesn&#8217;t have an
investor relations department, doesn&#8217;t meet investors one-on-one
and doesn&#8217;t hold conference calls or briefings at the stock
exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders seeking information from Fanuc go to its
campus, a two-hour ride west of Tokyo, where the younger Inaba
takes questions four times a year in his yellow blazer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He irked investors in July by canceling the first-quarter
briefing and filing an earnings report without sales breakdowns
and orders data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I understand we have an obligation to present earnings,
but my job is to make sure we have earnings,&#8221; Yoshiharu Inaba
said last month. &#8220;Part of the strategy is to make sure our
competitors don&#8217;t get information.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc also prohibits workers from using e-mail, except on
designated terminals. Most business is done by phone and fax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Japan&#8217;s International Machine Tool Fair this month,
Fanuc showed off a swiveling, 6-meter-tall (20-foot-tall) yellow
arm that moves car chassis for Detroit-based GM. A swarm of
salesmen in yellow blazers fielded questions, some in Chinese. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxconn Robots &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fanuc makes about 70 percent of its sales in the global
auto industry, Yoshiharu Inaba said. China&#8217;s auto sales rose 46
percent last year to make it the world&#8217;s largest market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China, no longer content to be the world&#8217;s low-cost
manufacturer, is automating. Strikes by factory workers this
year drove up wages, tipping cost calculations in favor of CNC
and robots, said William Montgomery, a Tokyo-based analyst at MF
Global Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foxconn, the Apple supplier that doubled factory pay after
a spate of worker suicides, buys 800 programmable Robodrills
from Fanuc every month -- for about $62,000 each -- to make the
stainless steel band that wraps around the iPhone. The Taipei-
based manufacturer also uses a Fanuc robot to plug chips into
circuit boards at speeds of more than 100 pieces a minute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They used to have women with hairnets doing it,&#8221;
Montgomery said. &#8220;Now this robot is replacing them, and they&#8217;re
going to run that factory 24 hours a day.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $17.8
million of notes with returns based on the performance of the
MSCI AC World Index, the first offering linked to the benchmark
in three months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-year structured notes, sold Nov. 17, pay about
1.2 times any gains in the index of world stocks, according to a
prospectus filed yesterday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Investors will receive their principal back when the
notes mature, provided the MSCI doesn&#8217;t fall more than 10
percent. A greater decline would mean they lose money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering is the first linked to the benchmark index
since Aug. 20, when Goldman Sachs sold $2.6 million of 18-month
notes, the data show. The MSCI AC World Index measures share
prices of companies in both emerging and developed countries. It
rose 6.3 percent this year through yesterday, while the SP 500
Index of U.S. stocks climbed 7.4 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structured notes are securities created by banks, which
package debt with derivatives to offer customized bets to
investors while earning fees and raising money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives are financial instruments used to hedge risks
or for speculation. Their value is linked to stocks, bonds,
loans, currencies and commodities, or to specific events such as
changes in the weather or interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FBI raids seeking documents from
three investment firms are related to hedge fund insider trading
investigations directed by the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara, according to a person familiar with the probes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offices of Level Global Investors LP and Diamondback
Capital Management LLC, firms founded by alumni of SAC Capital
Advisors LLC, were searched by Federal Bureau of Investigation
agents, the government said yesterday. Agents also executed a
search warrant at the offices of Loch Capital Management,
according to another person familiar with the matter. Both
declined to be identified because the probes are ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government has decided it needs to use force to
obtain all the information,&#8221; said Jacob Frenkel, a former
federal prosecutor and lawyer with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. &#8220;It has opted not to issue grand jury subpoenas but
instead use the search warrant process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Bruce, a spokesman for Diamondback, and Andy Merrill,
a spokesman for Level Global, confirmed the FBI had searched
their offices and said they are cooperating. Timothy McSweeney
of Boston-based Loch Capital didn&#8217;t respond to a phone message
seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Davis, a spokeswoman for Bharara, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diamondback, based in Stamford, Connecticut, owned U.S.-
listed stocks in 706 companies at the end of the third quarter,
with a market value of $4.13 billion, most of it in energy
companies and financial services, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Level Global, with offices in Greenwich and New York,
owned stocks in 77 companies valued at $3.08 billion, with 34
percent of that in consumer discretionary stocks and 31 percent
in information technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its biggest U.S. stock holding by market value is a 5.8
percent stake in Virgin Media Inc., the U.K.&#8217;s second-largest
pay-television company, according to regulatory filings for the
third quarter. Diamondback has about 215 employees as of Aug. 1,
according to an investor letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frenkel, the former prosecutor, said that it&#8217;s likely the
government has cooperating witnesses providing information to
help it obtain the warrants from federal judges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The availability of those tools is very fact and
cooperator intensive,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In order to get a warrant,
the government has to have information that would enable it to
get court authorization.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Ex-Asia Private Equity Head Settle Dispute &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. settled a dispute with Varun Bery, who
had sued the bank in Hong Kong for breaching an agreement that
allowed him to leave with the private equity team and platform
he managed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bery will provide private equity consulting services to
JPMorgan, they said in a joint statement announcing the
&#8220;amicable resolution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bery, who co-founded private equity firm TVG Capital
Partners Ltd., sued JPMorgan Private Capital Asia Corp. in
April, claiming damages &#8220;in the region of $30.8 million.&#8221; Bery
joined JPMorgan in 2008 to head the bank&#8217;s Asian private equity
business and was told in 2009 that the bank wouldn&#8217;t commit more
capital to it, or allow it to be spun out, according to the
lawsuit. He left the bank in November 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bery continues to operate as managing director of TVG and
JPMorgan wishes him every success in the future, according to
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokesman Ray Bashford and TVG spokeswoman Emily
Chow declined to comment on whether the spinout will be allowed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enron Broadband&#8217;s Shelby Pleads Guilty to Insider Trading &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Enron Broadband Services executive Rex Shelby
pleaded guilty to one insider trading count as prosecutors
dropped more serious charges stemming from the collapse of the
world&#8217;s largest energy trader nine years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelby, 58, agreed to serve as long as six months in a
federal halfway house, plus as long as six months&#8217; house arrest,
and forfeit about $2.5 million to end the final prosecution
linked to what the government claimed was a conspiracy to
overstate the capabilities and performance of Enron Corp.&#8217;s
Internet unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This ends Enron, because Rex was the very last Enron
defendant standing from prosecutions that resulted from the
company&#8217;s bankruptcy,&#8221; Ed Tomko, Shelby&#8217;s lawyer, said in a
telephone interview before yesterday&#8217;s plea hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Vanessa Gilmore accepted Shelby&#8217;s plea
in her Houston courtroom yesterday. A retrial for Shelby, the
Internet unit&#8217;s former senior vice president of engineering
operations, had been set for January. He will remain free on $1
million bond until sentencing, scheduled for Feb. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 5,000 jobs and $60 billion in shareholder value
were wiped out when Enron plunged into bankruptcy in December
2001 after widespread accounting fraud was revealed. Enron&#8217;s
former chief executive officers Jeffrey Skilling and Kenneth Lay
were convicted of conspiring to mislead investors about the
company&#8217;s performance, including the broadband division&#8217;s
prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Rex was conflicted about pleading guilty, but we got a
deal that was fair considering the passage of time and the risk
involved,&#8221; Tomko said in the interview. &#8220;It ensures that Rex
won&#8217;t have to go through the uncertainty of another trial like
the last one, which so confused the jury.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Shelby, H-03-093, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morris Pleads Guilty in New York State Pension Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henry &#8220;Hank&#8221; Morris pleaded guilty to a single count of
securities fraud stemming from New York Attorney General Andrew
Cuomo&#8217;s probe of corruption in the state pension fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re pleading guilty?&#8221; New York state Supreme Court
Justice Lewis Stone asked yesterday at a hearing in Manhattan.
&#8220;Yes, your honor,&#8221; Morris said. The judge said the crime
carries a sentence of 1 1/3 to four years in prison or no jail
time at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris is the eighth person to plead guilty in connection
with the New York corruption probe. Former state Comptroller
Alan Hevesi in October admitted to receiving a reward for
official misconduct. Last week, Cuomo sued Steven Rattner,
former head of Quadrangle Group LLC, accusing him of arranging
kickbacks to Morris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris, chief political adviser to Hevesi, was accused of
corrupting the investment process at the pension fund, recently
valued at $132.8 billion, to favor deals that would benefit
himself, his associates and contributors to Hevesi&#8217;s campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ellen Biben, a prosecutor from Cuomo&#8217;s office, told Stone
that Morris&#8217;s plea yesterday established &#8220;once and for all that
his conduct wasn&#8217;t just unethical, but was criminal.&#8221; Morris
had faced more than 70 charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morris reaped $19 million in fees for himself through 23
state pension-fund investments for which he acted as an
undisclosed placement agent, or middleman, according to Cuomo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is People v. Morris, 0025/2009, New York State
Supreme Court, New York County (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novartis Told by Jury to Pay $12.8 Million Over Bone Drugs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis AG must pay $12.8 million to a North Carolina
woman&#8217;s family over claims that the company&#8217;s bone-strengthening
drugs Aredia and Zometa caused irreplaceable bone damage, a jury
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award will be reduced to about $1.1 million under state
law. Jurors in federal court in Winston-Salem, North Carolina,
deliberated about 12 hours over three days before finding today
that Basel, Switzerland-based Novartis failed to adequately warn
Rita Fussman about the drugs&#8217; risks. Fussman&#8217;s family alleged
the drugs ate away her jaw while she struggled through
treatments for breast cancer before dying last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that the jury saw fit to award punitive
damages because the evidence produced more than justified such
an award,&#8221; Robert Germany, Fussman&#8217;s lawyer, said in an
interview after jurors returned the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fussman family&#8217;s lawsuit was the third product-
liability case to go to trial over the bone-strengthening
treatments. Last month, a New Jersey jury rejected a woman&#8217;s
claims that Aredia and Zometa caused her jaw deterioration. In
October 2009, a Montana jury ordered Novartis to pay $3.2
million in damages to a cancer patient who made the same claims
over the medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novartis is facing about 700 suits over the bone-
strengthening medicines, according to court filings. Some of the
cases have been consolidated before a federal judge in
Tennessee. Others, like Fussman&#8217;s, have been sent back to their
home courts for trial. Still other cases have been heard in
state courts around the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Julie Masow, a U.S.-based spokeswoman for Novartis, said
the company was disappointed with the jury&#8217;s verdict. &#8220;We are
reviewing our appellate options,&#8221; she said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Estate of Rita Fussman v. Novartis
Pharmaceuticals Corp., 06-CV-000149, U.S. District Court, Middle
District of North Carolina (Winston-Salem). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Siemens Agrees on Payment to Settle Nigerian Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens AG, Europe&#8217;s largest engineering company, agreed to
pay 7 billion naira ($46.5 million) to settle charges of illegal
payments to officials in Nigeria, Justice Minister Mohammed
Adoke said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The federal government has agreed to discontinue the
criminal prosecution it instituted against Siemens,&#8221; Adoke told
reporters in Abuja, the capital, yesterday. The company agreed
to be &#8220;of good conduct&#8221; in future business dealings in the
West African nation, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2008, Siemens agreed to pay $800 million to
settle U.S. charges that it violated anti-corruption laws by
funding bribes to governments around the world, including in
Nigeria. Siemens&#8217;s payment to Nigeria is about three times
higher than the alleged bribes, Adoke said, without providing
further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siemens&#8217;s agreement with the Nigerian government is &#8220;the
last step toward improving relationships with Nigeria,&#8221; Joern
Roggenbuck, a spokesman for the company, said in a phone
interview from Munich yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero Shareholder Sues to Stop Stock Incentive Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero Energy Corp.&#8217;s stock incentive plan is wasteful
and exposes the company to excessive taxes, a shareholder said
in a lawsuit that seeks to throw out the oil refiner&#8217;s
compensation program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valero shareholder Milton Pfeiffer said that the stock plan
is worth as much $20 million per participant, according to a
complaint filed Nov. 19 in U.S. District Court in Wilmington,
Delaware. Pfeiffer sued the company&#8217;s board of directors,
Valero&#8217;s chief executive officer and chairman William R. Klesse
and four other executives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These excessive payments are not justified in light of
the fact that the company suffered a loss of net income of
almost $2 billion for the fiscal year ending 2009,&#8221; Pfeiffer
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Antonio-based refiner will lose millions of dollars
of tax benefits because the compensation program is defective,
according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company spokesman Bill Day said he couldn&#8217;t comment because
he hasn&#8217;t yet seen the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Milton Pfeiffer vs. Kimberly S. Bowers, 01-
cv-01000, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware
(Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Programmer Asks Judge to Admit Statements &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
programmer charged with stealing secret computer-trading
software, wants to tell jurors about exaggerated claims he says
the government made, then took back, in his case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &#8220;once believed that Sergey Aleynikov had
stolen Goldman Sachs&#8217;s entire high frequency trading platform,
worth millions of dollars, and that unless he was detained he
would sell it to the highest bidder and throw the world&#8217;s
financial markets into turmoil,&#8221; he said in court papers filed
yesterday in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors now claim Aleynikov stole only parts of the
trading system, he claimed. The change in the government&#8217;s
position will help him prove he didn&#8217;t have the necessary intent
to violate the two laws he&#8217;s charged with breaking, he claimed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is charged with violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is presiding over the trial
set to begin Nov. 29, dismissed a third criminal count of
unauthorized computer access against Aleynikov in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessie Erwin, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office
in New York, declined to comment on Aleynikov&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested in July 2009 and charged with
stealing computer trading code from Goldman Sachs on his last
day of work with the bank the month before. He&#8217;s seeking to
admit into evidence a series of statements made at a July 4,
2009, detention hearing by Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph
Facciponti. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiesi Claims FBI Delayed Advising Her of Rights &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danielle Chiesi, accused with Raj Rajaratnam in the largest
insider-trading case involving hedge funds, testified that U.S.
agents questioned her before advising her of her right to remain
silent and to seek a lawyer&#8217;s advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiesi, testifying for the first time in a hearing
yesterday, told U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell in New York
that a group of five federal agents who woke her up and arrested
her in her apartment Oct. 16, 2009, asked her questions and
tried to get her to cooperate with their investigation before
giving her a so-called Miranda warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Absolutely not,&#8221; Chiesi said, in reply to a question
from her attorney asking whether she had any doubt about her
claim that she wasn&#8217;t told her rights until after she was
arrested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiesi, a former New Castle Funds LLC consultant, and
Rajaratnam, Galleon Group LLC&#8217;s co-founder, are charged
with profiting from tips from company executives, hedge-fund
employees and other insiders. Yesterday&#8217;s hearing comes in
response to court papers filed by Chiesi asking Holwell to bar
the government from using any statements she made that morning
to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-01184, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Madoff Employee Bongiorno Must Remain in Custody &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annette Bongiorno, Bernard Madoff&#8217;s longtime secretary
indicted this month in his Ponzi scheme, lost her bid for bail
and was ordered by a federal magistrate in Florida to be taken
to New York to face charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bongiorno, 62, who started working for Madoff in 1968,
shortly after she graduated from high school, is charged in a
federal indictment with conspiracy, securities fraud and tax
evasion. U.S. Magistrate Judge Ann E. Vitunac in West Palm Beach
yesterday denied Bongiorno&#8217;s request to be released with
electronic monitoring or under house arrest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bongiorno worked as Madoff&#8217;s personal secretary in the
1980s. She also had clerical duties at Bernard Madoff Investment
Securities LLC. Clients who discovered the wrong Social Security
numbers on their statements were told to call Bongiorno,
according to a copy of one such notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She took $14.4 million out of the investment fund by
creating sham trades in her own account, where she deposited a
total of $920,000 from 1975 to 2008, the government charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also received $325,000 in off-the-books payments from
the firm, prosecutors charged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She faces a prison sentence of as long as 75 years if
convicted of all charges, the U.S. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maurice Sercarz, Bongiorno&#8217;s lawyer, said in court that he
was continuing to work with federal prosecutors and agents in
New York to come up with at least five family members or friends
of Bongiorno&#8217;s who can post $2 million in assets to secure a $5
million bond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v. Bongiorno, 10-mj-08361, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Florida (West Palm Beach). The New
York case is 10-cr-00228, U.S. District Court, Southern District
of New York (Manhattan). The Madoff case is U.S. v. Madoff, 09-
cr-00213, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Asks Judge to Reverse Barclays&#8217; &#8216;Windfall&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. asked a judge to reverse
billions of dollars in &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; transfers of assets to
Barclays Plc when it bought the defunct investment bank&#8217;s
brokerage in the 2008 financial crisis, according to a court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman has accused the U.K. bank of making an $11 billion
&#8220;windfall&#8221; on the purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The sale transaction that was disclosed to the court was
based upon false premises from the very outset,&#8221; Lehman&#8217;s
lawyer, Robert Gaffey, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James in a
court filing yesterday that is his last chance to sway the
judge. Peck may rule on Lehman&#8217;s yearlong lawsuit against
Barclays in January or February, said lawyers in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan pits the
U.K.&#8217;s third-biggest bank against Lehman, which wants money to
pay off creditors. Peck said after more than 30 days of
witnesses that he was in &#8220;uncharted territory.&#8221; He asked both
sides to advise him --in filings due yesterday -- how to apply
the law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history
on Sept. 15, 2008, got &#8220;a strong push&#8221; from the U.S. Federal
Reserve Bank of New York and the Securities and Exchange
Commission to declare itself bankrupt, according to yesterday&#8217;s
filing. The regulators Lehman&#8217;s board the day before it &#8220;knows
what our opinion is on this,&#8221; according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck must decide whether to alter a deal sealed in a week
of financial turmoil, or let all or part of it stand. He said in
court last month he had been leaning toward Barclays&#8217; view,
expressed by lawyer David Boies, that he would have approved the
sale even if he&#8217;d known everything he knows now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts are usually final under federal law. Judges can
reopen a contract to correct mistakes or, under so-called Rule
60(b), if new evidence or fraud is discovered. Still, University
of California, Los Angeles professor Lynn LoPucki said he knows
of no emergency bankruptcy sale in his 898-case database that
has been reopened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In yesterday&#8217;s filing, Gaffey said essential aspects of the
sale to Barclays &#8220;were either misrepresented to the court, or,
worse, never disclosed at all.&#8221; They included Barclays&#8217; profit
on the deal, which the judge was told would be a &#8220;balanced&#8221;
transaction, and obligations it said it would assume and didn&#8217;t,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays&#8217; lawyer David Boies has told Peck in court that
federal law doesn&#8217;t allow him to rewrite the sale contract. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oracle Asks Jurors to Find SAP Owes $1.7 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Oracle Corp. attorney told a federal jury yesterday that
SAP AG should pay at least $1.7 billion in damages for copyright
infringement even though SAP&#8217;s plans to use the copyrights
didn&#8217;t fully work out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Boies, Oracle&#8217;s lawyer at a three-week trial in
Oakland, California, said the damage award that the jury will
decide should be based on SAP&#8217;s business plans in 2005 to
capture thousand customers from Oracle and not the smaller
number of customers that actually left Oracle for SAP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The board and top executives expected the infringement
would be worth billions of dollars,&#8221; Boies said in closing
arguments yesterday. &#8216;When they take it, they own it and they
have to pay for it regardless of whether they did well or didn&#8217;t
do well.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oracle, the second-largest maker of business application
software behind Walldorf, Germany-based SAP, sued its competitor
in 2007, claiming SAP&#8217;s TomorrowNow software maintenance unit
made hundreds of thousands of downloads and several thousand
copies of Redwood City, California-based Oracle&#8217;s software to
avoid paying licensing fees and to steal customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAP has agreed that the infringement occurred. The
downloads enabled TomorrowNow to fix bugs and provide updates to
software customers who otherwise would have had to pay Oracle
for maintenance or do the work themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Oracle Corp. v. SAP AG, 07-01658, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of California (Oakland). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-PM Group Manager Says No Sensitive Data Used in Share Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former PM Group Plc manager on trial for insider trading
told a London jury that he didn&#8217;t use price-sensitive
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neil Rollins, 46, testified that he didn&#8217;t believe it would
be illegal to trade shares of the company in 2006 prior to PM
Group announcing it was experiencing a decline in sales. He said
that while he was aware of the figures and knew the company
planned to cut jobs, the information didn&#8217;t influence his
decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was not using the price-sensitive information to make
my decision,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rollins sold 74,000 shares in the company in August and
September 2006, prosecutors said in the indictment. He
transferred 120,000 pounds ($191,000) to his father, prosecutors
said. He is also charged with laundering the proceeds of the
share sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bradford, England-based PM Group, which was bought by
Vishay Intertechnology Inc. in 2007, makes scales used in the
waste-management industry. In December 2006, PM Group discovered
that Rollins had sold the shares and fired him, prosecutors said
at the trial earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Litigation Departments &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Pays Advisers $1.1 Billion in 25 1/2 Months &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. paid its lawyers and managers
$42.1 million in October, bringing total advisers&#8217; fees to $1.1
billion after 25 1/2 months in bankruptcy, according to a court
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restructuring firm Alvarez  Marsal LLC, which runs the
defunct investment bank through its co-founder, Bryan Marsal,
led recipients with $369.8 million in fees through October for
&#8220;interim management,&#8221; according to yesterday&#8217;s filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court. Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP of New York has
collected $245.8 million for acting as the lead bankruptcy law
firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jones Day, which is handling Lehman&#8217;s $11 billion lawsuit
against Barclays Plc and other litigation, made $40.8 million
through October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advisers&#8217; fees haven&#8217;t faced major challenges from the
bankruptcy judge or trustee who monitor such payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman became the most expensive bankruptcy to administer
in U.S. history in April, when it topped the $757 million cost
of energy trader Enron Corp.&#8217;s three-year liquidation,
according to the database of Lynn LoPucki, a bankruptcy-law
professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Macleod, a Lehman spokeswoman, didn&#8217;t reply to an
e-mail seeking comment, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman, once the world&#8217;s fourth-biggest investment bank,
filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008
with assets of $639 billion. Creditors include Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., UBS AG, the New York Giants professional football
team and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority as well as individuals
who hold Lehman bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,

&lt;p&gt;Jing Ulrich, the Hong Kong-based
chairwoman of equities and commodities at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
gave her views on how China would tackle inflation in a press
conference in Hong Kong today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are expecting three to four increases in interest
rates next year in nominal lending and deposit rates, to reverse
the negative rate situation. Second is to continue to increase
banks&#8217; reserve requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The third way to contain the excess liquidity is to lower
China&#8217;s loans quota for the new year. This year the loan quota
was set at 7.5 trillion yuan. Next year the loan quota will be
lower compared to 2010, roughly maybe 7 trillion RMB, which
implies a 14 percent of loan growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A delivery of liquefied natural gas
to the U.K. from the U.S. last week was the first such
consignment since 1959 and may mark the start of a new trade
link between the markets, JPMorgan Cazenove said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The LNG tanker Maersk Meridian delivered an initial
shipment of the fuel to the Isle of Grain terminal, east of
London, from the Sabine Pass terminal in the U.S., National Grid
Plc said Nov. 19. The fuel had been reloaded at the U.S.
terminal, JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Fred Lucas said in a report
dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Cargo reloading will create a physical link, albeit
presently very thin, between the U.K. and U.S. gas markets,&#8221;
which were previously &#8220;isolated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If reloading
volumes rise materially, this could enforce a tighter price
spread between the U.K. and U.S. gas markets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LNG was last shipped to the U.K. from the U.S. on Feb. 20,
1959, when a tanker delivered fuel to Canvey Island from Lake
Charles, Louisiana, Lucas said. That was also the first-ever LNG
cargo, according to JPMorgan Cazenove. LNG is natural gas that&#8217;s
chilled into liquid form, shrinking in volume to 1/600th of its
gaseous state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We suspect that LNG exporters (especially the Qataris)
are watching this trade very closely,&#8221; Lucas said. &#8220;They will
not want to sell LNG on Henry Hub pricing only to see their gas
re-exported to higher-price markets by terminal owners,&#8221; he
said, referring to the benchmark for prices of natural-gas
futures traded in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission expanded its complaint against Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. trader Fabrice Tourre, accusing him of giving the company
&#8220;substantial assistance&#8221; as it misled investors in a product
linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC, which reached a $550 million settlement with
Goldman Sachs in July, included the new claim against Tourre in
an amended complaint filed Nov. 22 at U.S. District Court in New
York. The London-based trader, accused of helping the Wall
Street firm defraud investors in a product known as Abacus, may
face trial after failing to win dismissal of the SEC&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Tourre were sued April 16 by the SEC,
which accused them of failing to tell investors that hedge fund
Paulson  Co. helped pick the underlying securities for the
collateralized debt obligation and planned to bet against them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC &#8220;is clearly preparing for this case to go the
distance,&#8221; said Jacob Frenkel, a partner at Potomac, Maryland-
based law firm Shulman Rogers Gandal Pordy  Ecker. &#8220;They want
to make sure that their allegations are sufficiently broad&#8221; so
that a jury could still find him responsible for aiding fraud
even if they determine he wasn&#8217;t the primary violator, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phone call to Pamela Chepiga, Tourre&#8217;s attorney at Allen
 Overy LLP in New York, wasn&#8217;t returned. Goldman Sachs
spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre &#8220;played a principal role&#8221; in the offer and sale of
the securities to Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche
Industriebank AG, and &#8220;was aware&#8221; of marketing materials that
omitted Paulson&#8217;s role in selecting underlying securities for
Abacus, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should sell options on
retail stocks including Macy&#8217;s Inc. and Tiffany  Co. before
Black Friday because prices for the contracts are likely to fall
by January, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strategists John Marshall and Maria Grant recommended that
Macy&#8217;s shareholders sell January covered strangles, which
involve selling a put and call with the same expiry. Those who
don&#8217;t own shares of the second-biggest U.S. department-store
chain should sell puts, which give the right to sell the stock.
They said shareholders of Tiffany should sell January $60 calls,
giving the right to buy shares of the jewelry retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after U.S. Thanksgiving is known as Black Friday,
the traditional beginning of holiday buying. Stores often open
early on Black Friday and offer discounts to lure shoppers. The
SP 500 Retailing Index rose 2.6 percent at 4 p.m. in New York,
the most among 24 industry groups in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index, and has climbed 6.5 percent this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given our analysts&#8217; view that strong holiday sales are
already priced into valuation for many of these names, together
with a view that holiday sales will be spread out rather than
concentrated around Black Friday, we think volatility can remain
modest for many retailers,&#8221; the strategists wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macy&#8217;s and Tiffany are among the best candidates for retail
options selling because implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for contracts expiring in one or two months is
above the historic volatility that the stocks realized over the
past month, the Goldman Sachs strategists said. Selling options
on Nordstrom Inc., the U.S. department-store chain with more
than 100 namesake locations, also is &#8220;attractive,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selling Opportunities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Realized volatility has been unusually low in retail in
November,&#8221; the New York-based strategists wrote in a report
yesterday. &#8220;With December and January typically less volatile
than November, we&#8217;d focus on options selling opportunities in
retail.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Macy&#8217;s, they recommended shareholders sell the January
$25 put and January $28 call and that non-shareholders sell the
January $25 puts because Goldman Sachs retail analyst Adrianne Shapira projects &#8220;limited upside&#8221; for the shares. The
Cincinnati-based company rose 1.7 percent to $25.89. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-month implied volatility of 37 is &#8220;well above seasonal
holiday levels,&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;Typically, realized volatility
comes in by 7 points in the month prior to December expiration
and a further 2 points in the month ahead of January expiration
after a sharp increase in November.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chico&#8217;s, Abercrombie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other attractive stocks for options selling are Chico&#8217;s FAS
Inc., J.C. Penney Co., Abercrombie  Fitch Co. and Limited
Brands, Inc., Marshall and Grant said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc.&#8217;s January options should be purchased because
contracts expiring in one and three months are trading &#8220;near
the bottom end of their recent ranges,&#8221; the strategists said.
Options with those maturities have implied volatilities of 20
and 22, respectively, while the median historic volatility
leading up to December and January expiration over the past 16
years was 45 and 52, respectively, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the current implied volatility discount is too
extreme,&#8221; the strategists said. &#8220;In fact, we see the potential
for the importance of iPads this holiday season and a peak in
conjecture around the potential iPhone launch at Verizon to
drive increased volatility in Apple in January.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy a security for a certain
amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the right
to sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in
the price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves
or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, extinguished a fire at its Beaumont refinery in
Texas, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, said. The plant is
operating, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire was reported at about 10:15 a.m. local time and
was &#8220;quickly extinguished&#8221;, Allexon said in an e-mailed

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One employee sustained minor injuries and has received
first-aid treatment onsite,&#8221; according to Allexon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has been undergoing maintenance on a
hydrocracker, catalytic reformer, de-ethanizer and other units
at the refinery since September, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. municipal bond sales may fall
next year as Republicans gain greater control over states and
Congress alters the Build America Bonds program, JPMorgan Chase
 Co. analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State and local-government bond sales may drop to $395
billion in 2011 from about $415 billion this year, Alex Roever,
Chris Holmes and Josh Rudolph wrote in a report to clients
today. Sales may fall by another $50 billion if the Build
America Bonds program isn&#8217;t extended beyond its scheduled
expiration at the end of the year, they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of new bonds may decline as the subsidy paid by
the federal government on Build America Bonds interest is cut to
32 percent from 35 percent, as proposed in a bill pending in the
Senate, the New York-based analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A backlash against government borrowing may also lower bond
issuance, the report said. Republicans advocating spending
restraint won control of a majority of U.S. governorships and
full power over 25 legislatures in the Nov. 2 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Intensifying scrutiny of the wide deficits and ominous
debt loads of sovereign governments has made excess borrowing
taboo,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &#8220;After gaining substantial
standing in state Congresses, the Republican influence is widely
expected to dampen the marginal propensity to borrow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Len Blavatnik&#8217;s lawsuit
claiming JPMorgan Chase  Co. lost 10 percent of the $1 billion
he had it manage can move forward after a state appeals court
upheld a judge&#8217;s ruling that the suit shouldn&#8217;t be tossed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik claims JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank,
put twice as much money into risky mortgages as Blavatnik&#8217;s
investment guidelines allowed while Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon was unloading such investments from the bank&#8217;s
books. A panel of the New York appellate court kept the case
alive in a ruling yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides in January appealed a judge&#8217;s December order
that threw out two of Blavatnik&#8217;s claims while keeping two
others. The case, which hinges on the definition of an &#8220;asset-
backed security,&#8221; has begun the information-gathering, or
discovery, phase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blavatnik, 53, claims he was damaged by the bank&#8217;s
misrepresentations and &#8220;there remain questions of fact as to
whether the information defendants provided was incorrect and
whether plaintiff justifiably relied thereon,&#8221; a unanimous
panel of the state Supreme Court&#8217;s Appellate Division said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Sedarat, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Improper Attempt&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is &#8220;an improper attempt&#8221; to &#8220;use the courts to
collect reimbursement for investment losses that have resulted
from an extraordinary and unprecedented economic crisis that no
one could have anticipated,&#8221; New York-based JPMorgan said in
its court papers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E.ON AG, the world&#8217;s largest
utility, is working with Barclays Capital and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. on the possible sale of its U.K. power grid, according to
two people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks were asked to advise the utility on options after
the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board approached E.ON about
buying the asset, another person said. The Canadian pension plan
was part of a group that lost out on the sale of Electricite de
France SA&#8217;s U.K. network, bought by Cheung Kong Infrastructure
Holdings earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility, based in Dusseldorf, Germany, is considering a
sale of U.K. electricity lines as part of a plan to sell 15
billion euros ($20 billion) of assets by the end of 2013 to
lower debt, said the people, who asked to remain anonymous as
E.ON&#8217;s plans are private. The U.K. grid could fetch as much as
3.6 billion pounds ($5.7 billion), one of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.ON spokesman Josef Nelles couldn&#8217;t immediately be reached
for comment. A Barclays Capital spokesman wouldn&#8217;t comment. Axel
Luedeke, based spokesman for JPMorgan in Frankfurt, declined to
comment, as did Linda Sims, a spokeswoman for Canada Pension
Plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.ON wants to slash debt and raise funds for growth outside
Europe, where it faces stagnant demand and levies from
governments seeking to plug deficits. A sale of the grid would
follow Paris-based Electricite de France SA&#8217;s 5.8 billion pound,
including debt, sale of its U.K. power lines to a group led by
Li Ka-shing&#8217;s Cheung Kong Infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Predictable Returns&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canada Pension is interested in power transmission assets
as they represent &#8220;stable, predictable return streams,&#8221; Chief
Executive Officer David Denison said in a Nov. 10 telephone
interview. He declined to comment on whether the pension fund is
interested in E.ON&#8217;s U.K. grid. The fund was mentioned as a
possible buyer by the London-based Sunday Times this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.ON, the world&#8217;s largest utility by sales, wants to raise
15 billion euros through asset disposals by the end of 2013,
Chief Executive Officer Johannes Teyssen said Nov. 10, without
specifying which businesses the company will sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The utility is considering selling its U.K. power grid,
Bernhard Reutersberg, the company&#8217;s board member for regional
units, distribution and retail, said the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;E.ON has electricity networks in Germany, the U.K., Sweden
and eastern Europe. The utility agreed to sell its high-voltage
grid in Germany to TenneT Holding BV last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shekel may advance 12 percent
against the dollar in the next year as Israel&#8217;s economy expands
and the dollar weakens as the Federal Reserve steps up asset
purchases, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. Bonds dropped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Israel&#8217;s economy is now well-entrenched and growth and
interest rates are moving in a direction that is likely to
support shekel appreciation,&#8221; Ahmet Akarli, a London-based
economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a telephone interview
yesterday. &#8220;Some of it will be absorbed by Bank of Israel
intervention but the central bank will allow some strengthening
to combat inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shekel may strengthen to 3.5 per dollar in three
months, 3.3 per dollar in six months and 3.23 per dollar in 12
months, he said. It&#8217;s likely to trade at 4.9 per euro in three
months, 4.95 in six months, and 5.04 in a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bank of Israel has been buying foreign currency since
March 2008, more than doubling reserves to $69.6 billion by the
end of October. &#8220;Had it not been for the Bank of Israel foreign
currency interventions, our shekel view would be even more
constructive,&#8221; Akarli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Israeli currency, which has appreciated 3.6 percent so
far this year, strengthened 0.4 percent to 3.6600 per dollar at
2:17 p.m. in Tel Aviv. It&#8217;s the third-best performer among the
10 most-active currencies in emerging Europe, the Middle East
and Africa, data compiled by Bloomberg show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro Outlook &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The euro will strengthen to $1.55 as the Fed proceeds with
a second round of so-called quantitative easing, Goldman said
Oct. 6. The Fed on Nov. 3 announced plans to buy an additional
$600 billion of Treasuries through June to boost the economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli growth was 3.8 percent in the third quarter, the
Jerusalem-based Central Bureau of Statistics said Nov. 16. Bank
of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer has raised the main lending
rate by 1.5 percentage points to 2 percent since August 2009 as
the economy recovers, helping to strengthen the shekel even as
the central bank bought foreign currency to cap its gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumer prices are expected to rise 2.8 percent in the
next 12 months, according to a central bank survey of
forecasters released Nov. 16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government bonds fell, pushing the yield on the benchmark
Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 up 4 basis points to 4.46
percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brookstone Inc., a retailer of items
such as cordless air compressors, remote-control toy helicopters
and massaging chairs, was sued for patent infringement by
Baltimore-based manufacturer of specialty items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;180s Inc. claims Brookstone is infringing three patent for
behind-the-head earmuffs. At issue are patents 6,735,784,
6,920,645 and 6,502,248. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookstone was notified it was infringing the patents in
November 2009 and received a demand that it quit making and
selling &#8220;Luxe Earmuffs,&#8221; according to the complaint filed Nov.
15 in federal court in Baltimore. 180s claimed that before it
began selling the Luxe Earmuffs, Brookstone &#8220;had knowledge&#8221; of
the Baltimore company&#8217;s IP rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brookstone didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mailed
request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;180s, which also accused Brookstone of infringing the
earmuffs&#8217; trade dress, said it has been damaged and
&#8220;irreparably harmed&#8221; by the alleged infringement. It asked the
court for an order barring future infringement, and awards of
money damages, attorney fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claiming the infringement is deliberate, 180s asked that
the damages be tripled to punish Brookstone for its actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baltimore company is represented by Douglas P. Lobel,
Jonathan G. Graves and Heather A. Faltin of Cooley LLP of San
Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is 180s Inc. v. Brookstone Inc., 1:10-cv-03231-

&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures&#8217; Myhrvold Gets Surgical Stapler Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nathan Myhrvold, the founder and chief executive officer of
Intellectual Ventures, is a named inventor on a patent for a
surgical stapler that was issued yesterday, according to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patent 7,832,611, which was one of 4,933 U.S. patents
issued yesterday, covers a device that can be deformed to enable
the user to reach around &#8220;anatomical corners&#8221; and areas of the
patient&#8217;s body that are difficult to access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The application for the patent was filed in May 2007, and
it is assigned to The Invention Science Fund of Bellevue,
Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myhrvold, who is the former chief technology officer of
Microsoft Corp., is a named inventor on 131 issued U.S. patents,
of which 29 are assigned to the Invention Science Fund. Those
patents cover a wide range of technologies, including systems
for genome selection, a method of masking or degrading
biological material identifiers, a nanotube circuit analysis
system, scattered X-ray visualization, multiprocessor resource
optimization, and image correction using individual manipulation
of microlenses in a microlens array. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures, which characterizes itself as an
&#8220;invention company,&#8221; holds &#8220;invention sessions&#8221; where
Myhrvold and a group of scientists and engineers sit around a
table and work at inventing new technology to solve existing
problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Intellectual Ventures website, the company
is developing inventions in areas including agriculture,
automotive, communications, computer hardware, construction,
consumer electronics, e-commerce, energy, financial services,
health technologies, information technology, life sciences,
materials science, medical devices, nanotechnology, physical
sciences, security, semiconductors and software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company invites corporations and foundations to hire
Intellectual Ventures to conduct two-day invention sessions. It
says it files more than 500 patent applications a year and
claims the cost per patent is &#8220;very low compared with that of
corporate RD organizations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intellectual Ventures said it owns the patents that result
from sponsored invention sessions. The company said it gives
sponsors non-exclusive licenses to the inventions, and typically
receive a portion of the profits associated with the licensing
of the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searete LLC, also is based in Bellevue, is the assignee for
81 patents on which Myhrvold is named as an inventor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goode-Cook Accused of Infringing Turkey-Handling Instructions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg Smoked Turkeys Inc. of Tyler, Texas, sued a
Houston restaurant chain for copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint, filed yesterday in federal court in Tyler,
accused Goode-Cook Inc. of infringing the copyright for
instructions for handling smoked turkeys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg, which does business at the www.gobblegobble.com
website, said it created an insert on the handling of its smoked
turkeys and began posting it on the company website in 2003. It
claims that Goode-Cook&#8217;s website contains instructions for
handling the turkeys it sells that copy the Greenberg
instructions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goode-Cook is accused of deliberately infringing the
copyrights. The restaurant company didn&#8217;t immediately return an
e-mail seeking a response to the allegations in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg asked the court to order Goode-Cook to quit
infringing the copyright, and for an award of profits the
Houston company derived from the alleged infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Greenberg asked for a court order mandating
the destruction of all infringing turkeys, promotional materials
and turkey-handling instructions. The Tyler-based company also
requested money damages, and awards of attorney fees and
ligation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenberg is represented by Jonathan Michael Rowan of
Potter Minton PC of Tyler. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Greenberg Smoked Turkeys Inc. v. Goode-Cooke
Inc., 6:10-cv-00621-LED, U.S. District Court, Eastern District
of Texas (Tyler). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Didn&#8217;t Pay for Viagra Placement in &#8216;Love&#8217; Film &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Viagra brand is all over News Corp.&#8217;s &#8220;Love
and Other Drugs,&#8221; the director maintains that Pfizer Inc.
didn&#8217;t pay for product placement, the BrandChannel trade journal
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The film, released this week, features Jake Gyllenhaal and
Anne Hathaway in an adaptation of Jamie Reidy&#8217;s 2005 memoir,
&#8220;Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman,&#8221; according to
BrandChannel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When director Edward Zwick said there was no Viagra product
placement, he meant no money changed hands for the use of the
trademark and brand, according to BrandChannel, which contends
that a financial transaction isn&#8217;t necessary for product
placement to occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BrandChannel noted that the film also contains a scene in
which Anheuser-Busch InBev NV&#8217;s trademark is prominently
displayed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nepali Task Force Urges Trademark for Hand-Knotted Carpets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with a downturn in demand for hand-knotted carpets,
an industry and government task force in Nepal has recommended
the establishment of a collective trademark for Nepali carpets,
Nepal Republic Media&#8217;s Republica reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One aim is to halt the export of substandard carpets from
neighboring countries under the Nepali name, according to
Republica. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some carpet manufacturers in the country are hesitant about
registration because they don&#8217;t see a benefit of a mark without
an establishment of minimum quality standards, Republica
reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for Nepali carpets has declined, with exports
falling to 780,000 square meters in 2009-2010 from 3.3 million
in 1993-1994, according to Republica. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Corning&#8217;s Solar-Grade Silicon Trade Secrets Case Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Corning Corp.&#8217;s trade secrets case against a
Pennsylvania company was dismissed by a federal judge in Bay
City, Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed in March, Dow Corning accused RSI
Silicon Products LLC of Easton, Pennsylvania, of
misappropriating trade secrets related to the production of a
grade of silicon suitable for use in solar cells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Corning had argued that RSI&#8217;s attempt to engage an
unidentified vendor in a process to develop solar-grade silicon
indicated the company was in possession of Dow Corning trade
secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Midland, Michigan-based company said there was no
reason for RSI to contact the vendor about developing the
process unless it was aware that the vendor was working with Dow
Corning and wanted to replicate that trade-secret methodology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RSI&#8217;s request for communications with the unnamed company
and its request for contact information for other suitable
vendors made clear &#8220;its unlawful acquisition, use, and
disclosure of Dow Corning&#8217;s trade secret purification
methodology and equipment,&#8221; Dow Corning said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pennsylvania company responded by asking that the case
be dismissed because Dow Corning hadn&#8217;t made sufficiently
specific claims of trade secret theft, and that there wasn&#8217;t
enough Michigan-based contact between the two companies to
justify trying the case in that state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Thomas L. Ludington dismissed the case
Nov. 15. He said that although Dow Corning complaint was
sufficiently specific under Michigan law about the alleged
misappropriation of the trade secrets, RSI&#8217;s contacts to
Michigan &#8220;are simply insufficient&#8221; for the case to go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The interests of this state in the controversy and the
plaintiff&#8217;s interest in obtaining relief are insufficient to
force the defendants to travel here and provide a defense
against the speculative allegations in the plaintiff&#8217;s
complaint,&#8221; Ludington wrote in his order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dow Corning was represented by David J. Debold and Jason C.
Schwartz of Los Angeles-based Gibson Dunn  Crutcher LLP. RSI&#8217;s
lawyers are David E. Plunkett of Williams, Williams, Rattner 
Plunkett PC of Birmingham, Michigan, and Michael A. Ladra of
Palo Alto, California&#8217;s Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich  Rosati PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Dow Corning Corp. v. RSI Silicon Products LLC,
1:10-cv-11226-TLL-CEB, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
Michigan (Bay City). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP Moves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pabst Patent Group Hires Lawyers, Scientific Advisers From AGG &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pabst Patent Group LLC hired two lawyers and two scientific
advisers, the Atlanta-based intellectual-property firm said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four new hires joined from Arnall Golden Gregory LLP,
also of Atlanta. They are Robert A. Hodges, David E. Huizenga,
Jonas Jarvholm and Sandra A. Sciascia-Zirger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodges, a lawyer, is himself an inventor on three issued
U.S. patents. He does patent acquisition work and has
represented clients in proceedings before the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office, where he previously worked as an examiner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His clients&#8217; technologies have included biological
therapeutics, receptors, transport, cell signaling, diagnostic
and prognostic markers and techniques, genomics, proteomics,
transgenic and recombinant organisms, analytic techniques, and
recombinant DNA products and procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree in genetics from the
University of California at Davis, a doctorate in biochemistry
from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and a law
degree from Georgia State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huizenga, also a lawyer, is the named inventor on two U.S.
patents, according to the firm&#8217;s statement. He does litigation,
IP counseling and patent-acquisition work. He has represented
clients in areas including genetics, recombinant biotechnology,
stem cells, cell therapies, molecular diagnostics, combinatorial
chemistry and medical devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has an undergraduate degree in biology and chemistry
from the University of San Diego, a doctorate in genetics from
Harvard University and a law degree from Emory University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jarvholm, a scientific adviser, works in the areas of
chemistry and pharmaceuticals. He has an undergraduate degree in
chemistry from Shorter College and a doctorate in chemistry and
biochemistry from Georgia Institute of Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sciascia-Zirger acts as a scientific adviser for clients in
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical areas. She has an
undergraduate degree from the University of Montevallo and a
doctorate in molecular genetics from the University of Kansas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
biggest oil company, invested 17 billion kroner ($2.8 billion)
in Norway in 2009 and expects the same levels for 2010 and 2011,
as it works to maintain production in the Scandinavian country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, which has a daily output of 410,000 barrels of oil
equivalent in Norway, invested 6 billion kroner in 2008 and last
year estimated investments would stay at about 10 billion
kroner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s driven by the Ringhorne drilling, the ramp-up in
drilling activity, the ramp-up in new projects,&#8221; John Whelan,
operations manager for North Sea production at Exxon in Norway,
said today in an interview. &#8220;A lot of the drilling and the
activity we&#8217;re doing now is to keep production.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norway&#8217;s oil output peaked in 2000 and is forecast to drop
6 percent this year to about 1.87 million barrels a day,
according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. The industry
has urged the government to open up more of the northern areas
to exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon is not seeking to reduce its presence in the country,
Whelan said. Norway accounts for 10 percent of Exxon&#8217;s worldwide
production and it has participated in about one-third of all
Norwegian discoveries since 2007. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Norway is very important for us,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We still
see significant life in our existing operating assets.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whelan declined to comment on a report by the Sunday Times
that it has started a $2 billion auction of North Sea oil
assets, including its Beryl field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We don&#8217;t comment on speculation around our assets,&#8221;
Whelan said. &#8220;We&#8217;re a long-term investor in the U.K. and we&#8217;re
going to continue to be a major investor in the U.K.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s sway in the global commodity
market is likely to shrink next year as the U.S. and Europe
assume bigger roles, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we look into 2011, the story is not going to be
China,&#8221; Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities research at Goldman
Sachs, said today at a conference in London. &#8220;It is going to be
Europe and the U.S.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is late in its cycle of economic growth, Currie said.
&#8220;They are raising rates. They are battling inflation.&#8221; In
Europe and the U.S., &#8220;it&#8217;s still early cycle,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude oil may reach $100 a barrel next year, Currie said.
&#8220;That&#8217;s our forecast 12 months out,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currie wants to be short on metals and long on energy at
the start of 2011, he said. Later in the year, &#8220;as demand begins
to push back up,&#8221; oil will &#8220;start again to look like the non-
energy space,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Terrance McGill&#8217;s heart raced one
morning in 1990 when Richard Kinder, then his boss at Enron
Corp., rang his phone wanting to know why natural-gas
shipments on the company&#8217;s Texas-to-California pipeline had
plunged 76 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McGill dug out the daily report sent to top managers and
realized a number had been transposed. He explained the typo,
and a satisfied Kinder hung up. McGill never forgot the
lesson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He knew every morning what every pipeline was doing,
what every power plant was generating, what every processing
plant was producing,&#8221; said McGill, now senior vice president
of natural-gas operations and engineering for Enbridge Inc.&#8217;s
North American unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kinder&#8217;s attention to detail may be his most valuable
asset as he prepares an initial public offering of Kinder
Morgan Inc., operator of the second-largest U.S. pipeline
network, said Jim Murchie, founder of Energy Income Partners
LLC in Westport, Connecticut. Just three years ago Kinder
participated in a $22 billion leveraged buyout to take the
company private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now investors who backed that buyout, including Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and Carlyle Group, plan to raise as much as
$1.5 billion in the stock sale while Kinder, 66, holds on to
his 31 percent stake and is given the power to name five of
the company&#8217;s 13 directors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Total SA has designs ready for a new
petrochemical project in Qatar if a $6 billion project
announced by Exxon Mobil Corp. early this year is canceled,
two people with knowledge of the matter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total&#8217;s plans have existed since 2006, said one of the
people, who declined to be named because the matter is
confidential. The company is in talks to build a mixed-feed
petrochemical cracker that will probably be located in the
energy center of Ras Laffan, the other person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar is using its natural gas reserves, the world&#8217;s third
largest, to run petrochemical, aluminum and fertilizer
plants as it diversifies its economy away from liquefied natural
gas and oil exports. The country aims to raise its annual
production of petrochemicals to 28 million metric tons by 2014,
Energy Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah said in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qatar may choose a different partner for the project, a
Qatar Petroleum official said in August. The official declined
to be named because he wasn&#8217;t authorized to speak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-controlled Qatar Petroleum signed an agreement with
Exxon in January to build a petrochemical complex, the biggest
single energy-related project since Shell&#8217;s Pearl gas-to-liquids
plant was announced in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon has &#8220;progressed work jointly with Qatar Petroleum&#8221;
on the project, Nikolaas Baeckelmans, an Exxon spokesman, said
in an e-mailed statement today. We &#8220;are awaiting a decision to
proceed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Very Early Stages&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total is in the &#8220;very early stages&#8221; of discussions to
build a cracker in the country and hopes for &#8220;clarification&#8221;
on the matter early next year, ICIS reported Nov. 23, citing
Graeme Burnett, Total Petrochemicals vice president for Asia and
the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Qatar Petroleum spokesman could not be reached for
comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s planned petrochemical facility was to include a 1.6
million-ton-a-year steam cracker, two 650,000-ton polyethylene
plants and a 700,000-ton ethylene glycol unit. Construction was
to have been completed by 2015, according to Exxon and Qatar
Petroleum in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total owns stakes in four Qatari facilities that liquefy
gas and is a shareholder in Qatar Petrochemical Co. and Qatofin
Co.&#8217;s so-called linear low-density polyethylene plant. Qatofin
owns part of a new 1.3 million-ton-a-year ethane cracker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China may become a net importer of
diesel in November as new supplies are brought into the country
to meet rising domestic demand, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diesel fuel imports will rise &#8220;significantly&#8221; as the
country tries to refill declining stockpiles and alleviate
shortages at service stations, according to a report by Brynjar
Eirik Bustnes yesterday. The jump in new outside supplies may be
&#8220;short-lived&#8221; as refiners return from maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Due to increased diesel demand, there is now a chance
that November will show China as a net importer of diesel,&#8221;
Bustnes said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s diesel imports fell 60 percent in October to 42,674
metric tons, the lowest since November 2008, while exports
climbed 0.9 percent to 359,414 tons, according to data from the
General Administration of Customs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. flared gases in an
unplanned event at its oil refinery in Torrance, California,
according to a filing to the South Coast Air Quality Management
District. The incident began at 7:32 p.m. local time yesterday,
the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery receives most of its crude from the San
Joaquin Valley and produces about 10 percent of the gasoline
refined in California, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Torrance refinery can process as much as 155,800
barrels of crude oil a day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apollo Global Management LLC, the
private-equity firm run by Leon Black, named Marc Spilker, a
former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive, to the new position
of president. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spilker, 46, will oversee Apollo&#8217;s day-to-day operations
and sit on the company&#8217;s executive committee, which includes
Black and senior managing director Josh Harris, the New York-
based firm said in a statement today. He is scheduled to start
Dec. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spilker was previously the co-head of investment management
at Goldman Sachs, turning the responsibilities over to Edward Forst at the end of February. He retired from New York-based
Goldman Sachs in May, Apollo said. Goldman Sachs&#8217; investment
management division oversees about $1 trillion in assets,
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;His successful career at Goldman Sachs and his extensive
knowledge of the alternative asset management industry make him
an ideal addition to our executive committee,&#8221; Black said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spilker earned an undergraduate degree from the University
of Pennsylvania and a master&#8217;s degree in business from the
university&#8217;s Wharton School. He joined Goldman Sachs in 1990 and
became a partner in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before joining the investment-management division in 2006
as the head of global alternative asset management, Spilker was
responsible for U.S. equities trading and global equity
derivatives. He previously oversaw fixed income, currencies and
commodities in Japan and served as global head of foreign-
exchange options. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court will consider
making some patents more vulnerable to legal challenge, agreeing
to hear Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s appeal in a case that forced changes
in the company&#8217;s Word software and may cost it $300 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, fighting a verdict won by closely held I4i LP,
says the federal appeals court that handles patent cases is
making it too hard for those accused of infringement to argue
that a patent never should have been issued and is invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest software maker has support in its
appeal from more than a dozen publicly traded companies,
including Apple Inc. and Google Inc. Apple told the justices
that the patent system &#8220;is tilting out of balance,&#8221; giving
disproportionate power to people who secure patents of
questionable legitimacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award stood as the largest ever upheld by an appeals
court in a patent case. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in Washington concluded that Microsoft didn&#8217;t
prove that the disputed patent was based on technology that was
already in the marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which had $5.41 billion in profit in the most
recent quarter, hasn&#8217;t yet paid any damages to I4i. The unit
that sells Office is Microsoft&#8217;s biggest, with $5.13 billion in
sales in the quarter that ended Sept. 30. Microsoft rose six
cents to $25.31 at 4 p.m. in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional Presumption &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its ruling, the appeals court said Microsoft needed to
offer &#8220;clear and convincing evidence&#8221; to overcome the
traditional presumption that patents approved by the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office are valid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft contends that a less-demanding standard should
apply when a jury is presented with evidence about pre-existing
technology that the patent examiner didn&#8217;t consider. In such a
case, &#8220;there is no factual determination with respect to
patentability that warrants deference in the form of a clear-
and-convincing-evidence standard,&#8221; the Redmond, Washington-
based company argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toronto-based I4i urged the Supreme Court not to hear the
appeal, arguing that the clear and convincing standard is a
longstanding rule that has encouraged innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The heightened burden benefits the public by increasing
inventors&#8217; incentive to commit the resources required for
innovation and then to disclose their inventions,&#8221; I4i argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Markup Language &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a method developed by I4i for editing
some documents using XML, a so-called markup language that tells
the computer how text should appear. I4i created a way to store
the content and the XML codes separately, making it easier for
users to work alone with either the content or the codes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The disputed feature is one used by large companies to add
special data to Word files, such as information in forms
submitted by customers. Customers including drugmakers Merck 
Co. and Bayer AG use I4i&#8217;s software to make sure that people get
the correct and most up-to-date information on the labels of
their medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its 2007 lawsuit, I4i accused Microsoft of incorporating
the invention into the larger company&#8217;s Word program, which is
used by 500 million people worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft argued in defense that I4i had included its
innovation in a product it sold to a client more than a year
before it filed its patent application. That prior use would
have rendered the invention ineligible for patenting under
federal law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$200 Million Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A jury agreed with I4i and awarded $200 million. The judge
overseeing the case increased that sum because of misconduct by
Microsoft&#8217;s trial lawyer, and the figure has continued to grow
with interest. The court also ordered Microsoft to stop using
the invention, forcing the company to update the Word software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has support in its appeal from trade groups
representing the financial services and wireless industries. The
Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the
Clearing House Association told the justices that suits based on
questionable patents &#8220;are a plague upon the financial
industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court&#8217;s decision to hear the case &#8220;is a clear
affirmation that the issues raised in this case are critical to
the integrity of our patent system,&#8221; David Howard, Microsoft&#8217;s
deputy general counsel for litigation, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Simplistic Appeal&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I4i Chairman Loudon Owen said in a telephone interview that
Microsoft&#8217;s argument has a &#8220;simplistic appeal&#8221; that &#8220;does not
take into consideration at all what the patent office actually
does.&#8221; If Microsoft wins, he said, inventors would inundate the
already overburdened patent office with data and examiners would
have to fill out more paperwork to explain their decisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What it&#8217;s going to result in is tremendous uncertainty
for anyone who owns a patent,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It would be a sea
change in the operations of the patent office and would be a
dramatic body blow to the health of the U.S. patent industry and
the value of patents.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case, which the court will consider in the first half
of 2011, is Microsoft v. I4i Limited Partnership, 10-290 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Husky Energy Inc. the Calgary-based
company controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, agreed
to buy C$860 million ($842.5 million) of oil and natural-gas
properties in western Canada from Exxon Mobil Corp., adding
production and reserves in areas where it&#8217;s already operating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purchase in Alberta and northeast British Columbia will
add the equivalent of 21,900 barrels a day of oil and gas
production and 113 million barrels of proved and probable
reserves, Calgary-based Husky said in a statement today. The
deal is part of C$4.86 billion in planned capital spending next
year, a 20 percent increase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The properties are &#8220;located in core operating areas where
we will be able to leverage our existing infrastructure to
create additional shareholder value,&#8221; Asim Ghosh, chief
executive officer of Husky, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husky also said it intends to sell $1 billion of common
stock to finance expansion, including initial development of the
Sunrise oil-sands project it shares with BP Plc and a planned
joint venture in Southeast Asia with China National Offshore Oil
Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said it has decided not to spin off assets in
Southeast Asia. Talks with China National Offshore on the Liwan
3-1 natural-gas joint venture in the South China Sea are at &#8220;an
advanced stage&#8221; and plans will be submitted early next year, it
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Husky fell 95 cents, or 3.7 percent, to C$24.57 at 4 p.m.
in Toronto, the largest drop in four months. It has fallen 18
percent this year. Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, rose 22 cents
to $69.45 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline on the West Coast
climbed after production was curtailed at Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s
Torrance refinery in southern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit at the 155,800-barrels-a-day refinery was being
started Nov. 26 after a Nov. 24 power failure when workers
identified a &#8220;mechanical issue&#8221; and shut the unit, Aarti Ramachandran, a refinery spokeswoman, said in a telephone

Los Angeles climbed 2.5 cents to 10 cents a gallon versus
January-delivery futures traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as of 3:29 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery of the fuel rose 8.76
cents to $2.321 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob&#8217;s premium in San Francisco widened 0.25 cent to 8
cents a gallon. The prompt price advanced 6.51 cents to $2.301. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Portland was unchanged at 4.25 cents as the grade advanced 7.17

&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast widened 0.25 cent to 5 cents a gallon as of 2:01 p.m.
New York time. The grade advanced 5.42 cents to $2.1651 a

&lt;p&gt;The premium to December futures for the same fuel in New
York narrowed 0.62 cent to 2.63 cents a gallon. The grade
climbed 6.36 cents to $2.3064 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline for December delivery rose 7.43 cents, or 3.4
percent, to settle at $2.2846 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest

&lt;p&gt;Rebecca Patterson, global head of
foreign exchange at JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s JPMorgan Private Bank
in New York, comments on the European sovereign-debt crisis, the
effects of a weaker dollar, and investing in emerging markets.
She spoke in an interview with Tom Keene on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Surveillance Midday&#8221; program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Germany&#8217;s lending: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unfortunately for Germany, they are the only country that
can bail out the periphery countries. They are the lender of
last resort.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the effects of a weaker dollar: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This weaker dollar is leading central banks who are
getting Treasuries and intervening to have to recycle some of
that into something else. They&#8217;re buying Germany, and they&#8217;re
buying French, and they&#8217;re buying U.K. bonds. That&#8217;s pushing up
the euro, which is making the Europeans&#8217; problem even worse.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On German growth: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Germany continues to grow like this, and you&#8217;re
starting to see more and more unions in Germany asking for wage
increases, what happens if you get broader inflation?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What is the ECB going to do then? Do they raise interest
rates, because Germany hates inflation, or do they keep rates
low for the rest of the periphery?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You have this divide between the core and the periphery
on an inflation front possibly into next year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On European bank debt problems: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has become very clear in Ireland that this isn&#8217;t just
about the sovereigns, it&#8217;s about the banks. And we don&#8217;t have
enough money for the sovereigns and the banks. That&#8217;s part of
the reason the euro is dropping today. Despite the news out of
Ireland this weekend, you&#8217;ve still got more uncertainty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On emerging-market versus European returns: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You look at all the question marks from every policy
maker from Europe and all these weekend announcements, and you
say, &#8216;OK, fine, maybe I can get 8 percent on a peripheral bond.&#8217;
Nice return, but I&#8217;m taking a huge amount of risk on that. I can
get a similar return on Indonesia or Brazil or Mexico without
the risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

reach a forecast of 78,000 by yearend due to the prospect of
higher Brazilian borrowing costs amid quickening inflation,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President-elect Dilma Rousseff&#8217;s ministerial appointments
are &#8220;mixed, rather than best-case from financial markets&#8217; point
of view, so it&#8217;s not clear if fiscal management will be tight
enough to take pressure off rates,&#8221; analyst Stephen Graham
wrote in a note to clients dated yesterday. Graham said his
previous estimate &#8220;looks increasingly out of reach.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market assets such as Brazil&#8217;s are also suffering
because of Europe&#8217;s debt crisis, speculation that China will
move to cool its economy, and military tensions between North
and South Korea, Graham wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bovespa dropped 0.2 percent to 68,065.45 at 9:18 a.m.
New York time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. said it returned
units to service at its oil refinery in Torrance, California,
and operations are &#8220;normal&#8221; after maintenance and a power
supply failure last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nov. 24 power failure and a subsequent &#8220;mechanical
issue&#8221; had shut some areas of the refinery, Aarti Ramachandran,
a company spokeswoman, said in a telephone interview. While
production was disrupted at the 155,800-barrel a-day refinery,
Exxon met contractual obligations, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, based in Irving, Texas, plans to flare gases at the
Torrance refinery beginning tomorrow through Dec. 3, according
to a filing with South Coast Air Quality Management District.
The flaring, which isn&#8217;t related to a breakdown, is expected to
begin at 4:00 p.m., the filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The flaring is related to routine maintenance and not
related to the issues last week,&#8221; said Barbara Burgett, a
spokeswoman for Exxon. &#8220;There will be no impact to
production.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Braun and William Selway" date="Nov 30, 2010  7:14 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-30/ex-jpmorgan-banker-pleads-guilty-to-rigging-u-s-municipal-bond-contracts.html"><headline>Ex-JPMorgan Banker Pleads Guilty to Rigging U.S. Municipal Bond Contracts</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker
became the eighth person to plead guilty to rigging investment
contracts and derivatives in a federal antitrust investigation
of the $2.8 trillion municipal-bond market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James L. Hertz, whom the Justice Department said worked for
a Manhattan-based financial institution that it didn&#8217;t name,
pleaded guilty to bid-rigging, fraud and conspiracy charges,
according to a department news release. He also agreed to
cooperate with prosecutors. Hertz, 53, a Cranford, New Jersey,
resident, was employed at New York-based JPMorgan from 1994
through 2008, according to records filed with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hertz and co-conspirators designated in advance which co-
conspirator provider, either his employer or another financial
institution, would be the winning bidder for certain investment
agreements or other municipal finance contracts,&#8221; the Justice
Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former bankers at Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG have
pleaded guilty to conspiring with brokers to pay states and
local governments below-market rates on investments purchased
with bond proceeds. One branch of the conspiracy stretched from
California to Pennsylvania and included more than 200 deals
involving about 160 state agencies, local governments and
nonprofits, Bloomberg News has reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AnnMarie Hauser, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five Targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone message left at
his home. He is one of five former JPMorgan bankers who received
letters informing them that they&#8217;re targets of the Justice
Department probe, according to Finra records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2008, JPMorgan said it would stop selling
derivatives -- financial instruments whose value is tied to
another security -- to municipal borrowers. The bank has
disclosed in company filings that it&#8217;s facing a civil suit by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to
municipal-bond investment contracts and derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz received tips from a Minnesota-based broker who
worked for local governments, identified only as Broker E, about
competitors&#8217; bids so that he could alter his offers to win
contracts, according to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also conspired with another bank, identified as
Financial Institution A, to fix prices for deals and submit
intentionally losing bids to give the appearance of a legitimate
auction and comply with U.S. Treasury regulations, according to
court documents released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University Money &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Hertz competed for a derivative contract with an
unnamed state university that would go to the firm offering the
lowest interest rate, according to the charges. Hertz initially
told Broker E he would do it for 4.029 percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-owner of the broker handling the bid signaled that
Hertz could raise his offer to 4.039, which Hertz did, the court
papers said. He was awarded the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another deal based on the lowest price a town could pay
for a portfolio of securities, the broker, after collecting
other bids, advised Hertz to raise his bid by $5,000. He did so
and won the contract, according to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Damage from New Zealand&#8217;s worst
earthquake in eight decades may total as much as NZ$4.9 billion
($3.6 billion) and take four years to repair, according to a
Goldman Sachs report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The damage estimate is higher than the Treasury
Department&#8217;s provisional NZ$4 billion forecast because of
aftershocks since the initial 7 magnitude temblor rocked
Canterbury province on Sept. 4, Philip Borkin, an economist at
Goldman Sachs  Partners New Zealand Ltd. in Auckland, said in
the e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 138,000 damage claims have been lodged with the
Earthquake Commission, the government-owned insurer responsible
for repairs, ahead of a Dec. 4 deadline. About 3,300 properties
are on land that needs to be stabilized, and in some cases
protection such as underground retaining walls will be required
before rebuilding can start, the government said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For the majority of property owners, the recovery process
is relatively straightforward and the repair process can start
now,&#8221; as long as the commission has assessed their case,
Earthquake Recovery Minister Gerry Brownlee said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a further 5,500 properties, land damage can be fixed
while the building repair is carried out, according to the
government report, which mapped about 22,500 sites overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boost to Economy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rebuilding homes, office buildings and pipelines will boost
New Zealand&#8217;s economy over the next two years, adding 0.8
percentage point to growth by the third quarter of 2011, when
reconstruction is expected to be at a peak, Borkin said. By the
end of 2012, gross domestic product will still be 0.4 point
higher than in the absence of the earthquake, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Homebuilding and repair is expected to surge 5.1 percent in
the year ending June 30, 2011, from a year earlier as the
increase in Canterbury rebuilding offsets depressed activity
elsewhere, Borkin said. Excluding the earthquake effects,
residential construction is forecast to increase 2.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs assumes building and contents damage to about
145,000 homes will cost NZ$2.5 billion. It said the cost to
20,000 non-residential buildings will be NZ$1.4 billion and
added an estimated NZ$1 billion for infrastructure repairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure repair is expected to be completed by mid-
2012 and the reconstruction of houses may take until 2014,
Borkin said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A prospective customer enters a high-end jewelry store and
sinks into a leather couch. A sales rep hands her a glass of Champagne and an iPad
packed with images of jewels for her to choose from to make a custom piece. She flips
through them and, with the help of a wireless connection, flicks her creation onto an
iVIP, a small table fitted with a touch screen. There, she rotates or enlarges the image.
As soon as she sends it to the iVIP, it also automatically emerges on a V-Cube, a
triangular display device mounted at eye level next to the table. From the luxury of the
couch, she watches the V-Cube rotate 3D images of her creation. Using the iPad or
iVIP, she tries it on, using an avatar instead of waiting for the real piece to be crafted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds complex, but this is Zhongjie &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Jiang&#8217;s vision of the jewelry store of the
future. It&#8217;s a model that has intrigued Chinese jewelers looking to cut retail-space costs
and online jewelry outlets seeking to distinguish themselves. The former head of
consumer operations and search quality for Google China, Jiang founded his
information technology company, Waltz, in Wuxi, China, in 2009 to sell luxury retailers
technology to display and sell their wares better. Today, Waltz designs software and
hardware (including the iVIP and V-Cube), renders 3D animation of products, and
customizes and installs its display gadgets for clients. Mainland and Hong Kong
jewelers, such as Yuehao Jewelry, TTF Jewelry, and Chow Tai Fuk, use iVIP and V-
Cubes, and Celinni in France, ZS Diamonds in the U.K., and Dimend SCAASI in the
U.S. use Waltz for their websites&#8217; 3D animation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jiang says the 47-employee company had $38,000 in revenue in 2009, is on track for
$1.5 million this year, and could hit $15 million in 2011, when he aims to double its
workforce. As part of its overseas returnee incentive program, the Wuxi city government
invested $700,000 in Waltz and pays the rent on its 13,000-square-foot office. Up next:
bagging bigger international brands&#8213;. Jiang says Waltz just secured a deal to provide
the French luxury cell phone company Hanmac in-store display technology in China and
set up a Paris sales office to showcase Waltz&#8217;s technology and services. Jiang, 36,
spoke recently with Bloomberg.com contributor Megan Shank about Waltz&#8217;s traditional
sales model, introducing new technologies to old industries, and why American
companies fail in China. Edited excerpts of their conversation follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Megan Shank: What made you think the Chinese market was ready for 3D images of
consumer products? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zhongjie &#8220;Sunny&#8221; Jiang: After &#8220;Avatar&#8221; came out, 3D technology became very popular in
China and around the world. I believe it&#8217;s only the beginning. Unlike other industries, the
high-end consumer retail market has not yet taken advantage of technology. At the
same time, shoppers have demonstrated their willingness to buy in a new way. Take the
rise of Bluenile.com in the U.S.: This business model has become popular in China only
during the past two or three years. Now hundreds of such websites are emerging. The
fashion industry is aggressively looking for new ways to use multimedia and information
management systems to sell their products and track their inventories. China is the
second-largest luxury consumer market in the world and the fastest-growing one. My
old Google China colleagues started their own businesses, but as far as I know, I am
the only former Google China employee who started a business in a traditional industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: Who are your competitors? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: For V-Cube, we have some competition in Denmark, though their price is 10,000
euros [$13,340] and ours is 38,000 renminbi [$5,700], so it&#8217;s a completely different
dynamic. For 3D design, we have competitors in Israel and France. They have better
technology but higher prices. Considering price and quality, we&#8217;re still the best choice. In
the domestic market, we don&#8217;t yet have a direct competitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How have the technologies you&#8217;re using and adapting been used traditionally? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Multi-touch screen technology has been in existence since the 1990s, but Apple only
recently popularized it. Now Apple holds patents for its multi-point touch screen, but
many companies are out there with similar patents and products as cool as iPad. As
soon as an Apple product is launched in China, a copycat enters the market in
Shenzhen. The technology behind V-Cube is not a secret, though we do hold
intellectual property rights, including a pending patent. Holographic technology has
been extensively used in museums, in large-scale exhibitions, and on television. It has
rarely been applied in the commercial world, however, especially in the retail market.
There are a couple of reasons why. First, there&#8217;s been little consideration for how to
create small holographic machines for in-store display. Second, learning how to mass-
produce lifelike images of 3D jewelry and other luxury products at low cost has been a
challenge. [On a consumer level,] it&#8217;s not meaningful to display only a few images, as
the museums do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How have you met this challenge? What&#8217;s your process? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: For example, we&#8217;ll have clients take three pictures of a diamond ring from different
angles, so our technicians can see details. The 3D design team has a three-step
process. First they use 3D modeling software to create the image. Then they render it
according to the shape and color. Finally, they animate the image in a way that
highlights the details. So it might turn, zoom in or out, or pause on a certain component.
My technicians are highly skilled art school graduates. The reason we&#8217;re more efficient
and cost-effective than other market players is that we are extremely specialized. We
cut this three-step process down into smaller steps. And as with car manufacturers,
each of my technicians focuses on only one of those divided steps within a process, so
we can affordably process hundreds of models in a day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: What is your sales model? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: For the domestic market, we are using agents who are resourceful and strong at
sales. Most American companies fail in China because they don&#8217;t use agents. For
example, Dell is famous for its direct sales business model, but two years after the
company entered the Chinese market, it had to change its strategy because it couldn&#8217;t
reach local customers without agents. Now its model is similar to Lenovo&#8217;s -- using a
whole network of agents. Baidu became the No. 1 search engine in China simply
because it relied on agents rather than its own sales and marketing team. These agents
are powerful either geographically or within an industry. Many times, they have strong
connections with the local government, which is difficult for newcomers to manage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: How will you deal with possible IP infringement? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: This is China. As long as you have cool stuff, people will copy it. If they don&#8217;t, it
means you have a poor product. You have to think ahead. We have our first generation
V-Cube, but we&#8217;re already at work on our second and third generation, which we&#8217;ll
launch as soon as the future competition shows up. We don&#8217;t want to engage in price
wars. We want to attract clients because of our advanced innovations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: You&#8217;ve received a lot of support from the Wuxi city government. What influence does
it have on you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: They&#8217;re playing the role of angel, but they&#8217;re not intending to be a portion of my
company forever. They promised me I can purchase their portion of the stock back
within two years at a low interest rate. It&#8217;s a good partnership, and it&#8217;s good for them,
because we provide jobs and pay taxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Q: You&#8217;ve said you want to be the Apple of China. What do you mean? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Apple is good at generating cool stories, designs, and ideas. Apple is successful
because of its marketing and advertising capabilities. That&#8217;s what I admire and hope to
emulate with Waltz. I&#8217;d also like to create a diversity of Waltz products, as Apple has
done with MacBook, iPod, iTunes, iPad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. programmer, &#8220;stole valuable secret computer
code&#8221; from the brokerage, a prosecutor told jurors at the
opening of the trial in New York on charges of theft of trading
software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti made the
government&#8217;s opening statement today in federal court in New
York. Aleynikov&#8217;s lawyer followed, saying his client broke a
confidentiality rule of the company and committed no crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is charged with violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is presiding over the
trial, dismissed a third criminal count of unauthorized computer
access in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If convicted, Aleynikov faces as much as 15 years in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facciponti told jurors the programmer started at Goldman
Sachs in 2007 and worked there until 2009, when he agreed to
take a job at Teza Technologies LLC. Chicago-based Teza promised
a $1.2 million salary, a bonus and profit-sharing, compared with
$400,000 he was making at Goldman Sachs, the prosecutor said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 5:20 p.m. on his last day of work, June 5, 2009,
Aleynikov sent parts of Goldman&#8217;s high-speed trading code to an
outside computer server, Facciponti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaching a Barrier &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He &#8220;thought that he&#8217;d found a foolproof way of getting
around the security barriers&#8221; designed to prevent employee
theft of trade secrets, Facciponti told the jury. Aleynikov sent
stolen code to a code-storage website in Europe that wasn&#8217;t
blocked by Goldman Sachs, he said. Aleynikov then executed a
program to cover his tracks, Facciponti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was arrested on July 3, 2009. Federal agents
searched Aleynikov&#8217;s laptop, a flash drive and his home
computers, with his consent, Facciponti said. All contained code
stolen from Goldman Sachs, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defense lawyer, Kevin Marino, argued in his opening
statement that Aleynikov intended to strip out pieces of open-
source software -- software available for use by the public --
contained within the Goldman Sachs code files. He tried to cover
his tracks because he knew he was violating the company&#8217;s
confidentiality rules and feared he would be sued by the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs
confidentiality provision is a federal crime,&#8221; Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Theft Allegation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Aleynikov&#8217;s arrest, Facciponti told a judge
that the programmer stole Goldman Sachs&#8217;s entire high-speed
trading platform. Prosecutors have since said they believe he
stole only parts of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge yesterday told lawyers that she won&#8217;t seal the
courtroom as the government asked, at least during the testimony
of the first four witnesses, who may testify today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m hoping that all of the testimony will be public,&#8221;
Cote said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors asked Cote to keep parts of the evidence secret
to avoid disclosing trade secrets of Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trial is to take at least two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. territory chose the four bidders in September and
expects their final proposals by March 7, said David Alvarez,
executive director of the Public-Private Partnerships Authority.
It sent a draft concession agreement and request for proposals
to the groups on Nov. 19, he said. The transaction should close
by mid-June after the meetings that begin tomorrow in New York,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have taken another critical step,&#8221; Alvarez said in a
telephone interview today. &#8220;Now we can tell the investor
community that we have an official procurement going on.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico overhauled rules for public-private
partnerships in June 2009 so they don&#8217;t need legislative
approval. The upfront payments from leases with private
companies to run services like roads will help close a budget
deficit that was $3.3 billion when Luis Fortuno, the first
Republican elected governor in 40 years, took office in January
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Money that&#8217;s looking for a jurisdiction in which to place
itself can think of Puerto Rico as a home,&#8221; Jose Perez-Riera,
secretary of economic development and commerce, said on the
telephone call with Alvarez. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bidding Groups &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approved bidders for the roads are: Spain&#8217;s Abertis
Infraestructuras SA and Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Infrastructure Partners
II unit; Brazil&#8217;s Cia. de Concessoes Rodoviarias; Spain&#8217;s
Itinere Infraestructuras SA and Citigroup Inc.&#8217;s Infrastructure
Investors unit; and Spain&#8217;s Obrascon Huarte Lain SA and Morgan
Stanley Infrastructure Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The toll roads generate about $90 million in annual
revenue, Alvarez said. Puerto Rico will get a lump sum from the
selected group, which will be entitled to the toll revenue and
be responsible for maintenance for 40 to 50 years, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lump sum will be used in part to buy back bonds sold to
finance the roads, lowering debt-service for the government. The
bonds&#8217; cost will set a minimum price for the bids on the road
lease, he said. Puerto Rico has identified the bonds it plans to
buy and will inform the bidders of the price after getting
approval from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, Alvarez said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a landmark transaction&#8221; for public-private
partnerships in the U.S., he said. &#8220;We are complying with all
the bondholding covenants under the different bond
resolutions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Busiest Highway &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal will cover the Jose de Diego expressway, Puerto
Rico&#8217;s busiest highway, which runs 52 miles (84 kilometers) from
San Juan to Arecibo, according to the authority&#8217;s website, and
PR-5, a San Juan highway that intersects the larger road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fiscal 2010, the Diego expressway brought in an
estimated $85.7 million in revenue and PR-5 earned $4.3 million,
according to a June study from the authority. The report says
the deal will be the first phase in a four-part plan to lease
roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Messages left for a Goldman spokeswoman, Andrea Raphael,
and the chief investment officer of Concessoes Rodoviarias,
Arthur Piotto, were not immediately returned. Danielle Romero- Apsilos, a Citigroup spokeswoman, and a Morgan Stanley
spokeswoman, Erica Platt, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alvarez&#8217;s partnership authority is moving ahead with other
projects, he said. It&#8217;s renovating 100 schools using $756
million from a sale of Qualified School Construction Bonds. Work
on two schools is underway and is expected to commence on 14
more by the end of the year, he said. Approval for construction
of 12 new schools will likely come by mid-December, Alvarez
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Airport Lease &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authority is also pursuing a lease for Luis Munoz Marin
International Airport in San Juan to a private operator, said
Alvarez. The authority is likely to get approval from the
necessary 65 percent of the airlines that serve Puerto Rico,
including AMR Inc.&#8217;s American Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc.,
by the end of the year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s raised its outlook on Puerto Rico&#8217;s
general-obligation bonds yesterday from stable to positive,
saying spending cuts and revenue-generating measures could help
balance the budget within two years. SP rates the debt at BBB-,
the lowest investment grade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puerto Rico reported yesterday that its economic-activity
index contracted by the smallest amount in October since April
2008. Gasoline consumption for the fiscal year that began in
July, an indicator of traffic on the island&#8217;s roads, was up 1.9
percent from the same period last year, the report said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. will give its
investment bankers iPads to provide an additional mobile tool as
Apple Inc. expands its domain to Wall Street, threatening
Research in Motion Ltd. in a market it traditionally dominated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe there are real benefits in our working
environment that can be realized using this device - as well as
the personal productivity and enjoyment that come as part of the
package,&#8221; two managing directors at New York-based JPMorgan
said in an e-mail obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple is building on its momentum in the tablet business,
leveraging its 95 percent market share to expand from its
traditional consumer base into the corporate market as RIM
readies a rival device, the BlackBerry PlayBook. The Canadian
maker of smartphones is trying to catch up with Apple as banks
including Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG unveil
applications for the iPad and Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America
Corp. consider letting employees use iPhones instead of Wall
Street&#8217;s 11-year-old device of choice, the BlackBerry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Apple represents a clear and present danger for RIM going
forward,&#8221; said Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher  Co.
&#8220;For the first time you have a viable alternative to secure
mobile communications and by and large we see people moving away
from the BlackBerry platform in droves in favor of the iPhone
and the iPad.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, hired former Merrill Lynch  Co.
wealth-management executive Michael Falcon to head its
retirement-services division in the U.S. and Canada. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falcon will report to George Gatch, chief executive officer
of JPMorgan Investment Management Americas, the New York-based
bank said today in a statement. He is currently president of
Samuel Bennett Inc., a financial and media consulting service
founded by Jean Chatzky, the financial editor for NBC&#8217;s Today
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falcon, who was at Merrill Lynch from 2000 to 2008, is
returning to the bank that gave him one of his first jobs after
graduating from Indiana University Bloomington in 1984,
according to his biography on LinkedIn. He has been in the
finance industry since 1985 when he joined Chase Manhattan Bank,
which became part of JPMorgan through several acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bringing on someone with Michael&#8217;s experience will ensure
that we expand our retirement offering to be even more
comprehensive, addressing new market realities and the current
needs of Americans who are saving for retirement,&#8221; Gatch said
in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weekly retail sales rose in the week
ended Nov. 27 as shoppers flocked to the Black Friday sales with
renewed confidence following the economic downturn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sales climbed 0.5 percent from the preceding week, the
International Council of Shopping Centers and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said today in a statement. Sales at stores open at
least a year rose 3.5 percent from a year earlier. The results
don&#8217;t include online sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confidence among U.S. consumers increased more than
forecast in November to the highest level in five months,
according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Index.
Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. gross
domestic product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 212 million shoppers went to stores and websites over
the holiday weekend, on average spending $365.34, according to
the National Retail Federation. The proportion of sales online
rose to more than one-third of the total, the highest ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers lured shoppers with discounting and promotions
like J.C. Penney Co.&#8217;s $10 diamond-accented earrings. The ICSC
said it expects November sales to rise as much as 4 percent
compared with last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Co. Chief Executive
Officer Muhtar Kent said multiple international accords, not a
single treaty, are needed to fight climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think one treaty can work for the world,&#8221; Kent,
58, said in an interview in Cancun, Mexico, where delegates from
more than 190 countries are gathered for United Nations-led
talks on setting rules to limit global warming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest soft-drink maker is among companies in
the Mexican resort lobbying envoys on the shape of an eventual
accord that may restrict emissions from burning fossil fuels,
channel up to $100 billion to poor nations and protect forests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago in Copenhagen, delegates failed to draft a
treaty, leaving in limbo the 1997 Kyoto accord that mandated
cuts in carbon-dioxide emissions until the end of 2012. While
envoys aim to replace that agreement with new commitments, UN
officials say a treaty is unlikely to be drafted this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments by India&#8217;s environment minister and Kent add
strength to suggestions from climate envoys that working for a
single binding treaty may not be the best way forward for the
negotiations set to end Dec. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;An international agreement is not anywhere on the
horizon,&#8221; Jairam Ramesh said today in New Delhi. &#8220;Action has to
be domestic. That&#8217;s what the last 15 months has shown.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich, Poor Divide &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Copenhagen round of talks concluded with a non-
binding agreement, negotiators have been unable to bridge the
divide between richer nations bound by the Kyoto treaty and
poorer countries led by China and India that reject similar
rules for their industrializing economies. Indian and Chinese
leaders say their priorities are economic growth and ending
poverty. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve been at it for 18 years on climate change but
that&#8217;s not unique,&#8221; said Duncan Hollis, an associate professor
at Temple University&#8217;s Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia and
editor of the &#8220;Oxford Guide to Treaties&#8221; to be published next
year. &#8220;Breaking this up into smaller pieces and trying to knock
off one piece at a time is certainly worth trying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Momentum is building instead for extending national and
regional plans to limit greenhouse gases, from domestic carbon
markets to renewable-energy standards, in which utilities are
forced to include a fixed percentage of clean energy in the mix
they sell to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Viewpoint &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN talks in their second day today in Mexico are moving
away from a global treaty, Ramesh said. Meetings instead should
focus on &#8220;domestic actions,&#8221; the minister said, adding that
India won&#8217;t accept limits on growth set by other nations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While executives from 400 companies including Tesco Plc and
Unilever NV released a statement saying they&#8217;d work to end
deforestation and use of refrigerants that harm the atmosphere,
the Coca-Cola executive went further, delving into the politics
of treaty-making. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There can&#8217;t be just one framework,&#8221; Kent said, adding
that &#8220;you can&#8217;t judge India&#8217;s progress with the same metrics as
U.S. progress.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN framework needs to become &#8220;more flexible&#8221; and
allow countries to have different timelines for moving ahead
with efforts to curb fossil-fuel emissions, Kent said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Government Incentives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While companies can accomplish much on their own to reduce
emissions and protect the environment, only governments can set
a price on carbon and provide the incentives needed to spur
shifts in energy use, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama failed to win passage in Congress
this year of legislation to cap carbon emissions linked to
global warming. Prospects for action will grow slimmer next year
when Republicans take control of the House of Representatives
and expand their minority in the Senate. Dozens of Republican
lawmakers elected this month have expressed skepticism about
global warming or action to curb it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon said he is &#8220;incredibly impressed&#8221; by the
opportunities in South Africa and the rest of the continent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The growth rate of banking in emerging markets is set to
be two to three times faster than that of the United States and
Western Europe where most of our investment banking is currently
focused,&#8221; he said in a statement today after visiting South
Africa with former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, an adviser
to the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender is seeking to expand in emerging markets
overseas as greater regulation of businesses like derivatives
squeezes revenue in the U.S. The lender generates about 25
percent of revenue outside the U.S. and about 62 percent of net
profit. Citigroup Inc. has also announced plans to grow in
Africa, while Barclays Plc owns a stake in Absa Group Ltd.,
South Africa&#8217;s third-largest bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has hired bankers from rivals like Morgan Stanley
and sent employees from Geneva and London to Johannesburg and
Cape Town to bring the number of employees in the country to
about 450. The bank ranks tenth in arranging stock offerings in
the region, and 14th on mergers and acquisitions, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in South Africa is set to outpace that in the U.S.
in 2011, according to the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s World
Economic Outlook, published in October. Sub-Saharan African
economies may expand by 5.5 percent next year, compared with
2.3 percent growth in the U.S., according to the IMF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lender, which has slipped down the rankings for equity
offerings, is &#8220;committed&#8221; to growing its businesses in Africa,
according to John Coulter, chief executive officer of JPMorgan&#8217;s
Johannesburg-based sub-Saharan Africa unit. Coulter, 49, who
left the company in 2005, returned last year and said in an
interview on Nov. 10 he wants JPMorgan to be in a &#8220;top-tier
position in any business&#8221; it pursues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The commodity shipping fleet will
expand at a faster pace than demand next year, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fleet will swell by 11 percent, exceeding an 8.4
percent increase in demand, Goldman analysts Scott Malat and
Varun Gokarn wrote in a report dated Nov. 29. Port delays and
rising shipments up and down the Chinese coast may narrow the
resulting &#8220;supply-demand gap,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimates were part of new research rating the shares
of Genco Shipping  Trading Ltd. and DryShips Inc. (DRYS) as
&#8220;neutral.&#8221; Diana Shipping Inc. (DSX) was rated a &#8220;buy.&#8221; The

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
rebounded from the financial crisis to post record profit last
year, was a regular borrower from two emergency Federal Reserve
programs in 2008 and early 2009, new data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm borrowed from the Fed&#8217;s Term Securities Lending
Facility most weeks from March 2008 through April 2009, data
released by the Fed today show. Two units of the New York-based
firm borrowed as much as $24.2 billion from the Fed&#8217;s Primary
Dealer Credit Facility in the weeks after Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy in September 2008, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, 56, was quoted by
Vanity Fair last year as saying the company might have survived
the credit crisis without government help. The firm&#8217;s president,Gary Cohn, was more definitive, according to the magazine: &#8220;I
think we would not have failed,&#8221; he was quoted as saying. &#8220;We
had cash.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, who was president of
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during 2008 and 2009, has
disputed such an assessment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;None of them would have survived,&#8221; without government
help, Geithner said in an interview last December with Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;Political Capital with Al Hunt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs took a $100 million overnight loan from the
Primary Dealer Credit Facility on March 18, 2008, the day after
the facility was created in the wake of JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s
rescue of Bear Stearns Cos. At the time, spokesman Michael DuVally said his firm was &#8220;testing&#8221; the facility and would use
it &#8220;if doing so makes sense from an economic and funding
diversification point of view.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm didn&#8217;t borrow any more from the PDCF until Sept.
15, the day that Lehman Brothers filed the largest bankruptcy in
U.S. history. On that day Goldman Sachs borrowed $2.5 billion at
a 2.25 percent interest rate and furnished the Fed with $2.68
billion of collateral. The firm doubled the amount it borrowed
to $5 billion on Sept. 19 and doubled it again to $10 billion on
Sept. 22, when Goldman Sachs&#8217;s London subsidiary also took its
first PDCF loan of $250 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peak Borrowing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the peak, Goldman Sachs borrowed $24.2 billion on Oct.
15, which included $18 billion for the firm&#8217;s U.S. broker-dealer
and $6.2 billion for the firm&#8217;s London division, the data show.
The peak borrowing came two days after the U.S. Treasury
Department assembled executives from nine of the country&#8217;s
biggest financial firms and told them they&#8217;d be provided with
capital injections from the government, with Goldman Sachs
receiving $10 billion from the Troubled Asset Relief Program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its quarterly filings with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t disclose that it
borrowed from the PDCF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm also borrowed from the Term Securities Lending
Facility, which offered longer-term funding than the PDCF&#8217;s
overnight loans. On March 28, 2008, Goldman Sachs borrowed $7
billion from the Fed&#8217;s TSLF in exchange for $8.42 billion of
collateral that included $3.5 billion in agency-backed mortgage
debt and $4.9 billion of non-agency backed mortgage debt. Before
the loan was scheduled to mature on April 25, Goldman Sachs
borrowed an additional $4 billion on April 11 and $223 million
on April 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Largest Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two largest TSLF loans to Goldman Sachs were $7.5
billion on Dec. 4, 2008, and the same amount on Dec. 31, 2008,
the data show. The firm also didn&#8217;t disclose its TSLF borrowing
in its quarterly SEC filings, although it provided data on its
borrowing to the U.S. Treasury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the loans from the PDCF and the TLSF are combined, the
firm&#8217;s total borrowing from the Fed peaked at $35.39 billion on
Oct. 21 and Oct. 22, 2008, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DuVally, the spokesman in New York, declined to discuss the
borrowing and the firm&#8217;s decision not to disclose it, beyond a
statement responding to today&#8217;s release of Fed data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In late 2008, many of the U.S. funding markets were
clearly broken,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Federal Reserve took essential
steps to fix these markets and its actions were very
successful.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t borrow as much as some of its rivals,
while it borrowed more than others. Morgan Stanley, which was
the second-biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs
before the two firms converted into banks in September 2008,
borrowed as much as $100.5 billion at its peak on Sept. 29,
2008, the data show. That includes $61.3 billion of loans from
the PDCF and $39.2 billion from the TSLF, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The borrowing occurred &#8220;during a time of immense financial
turmoil throughout the banking sector and the broader market,&#8221;
Morgan Stanley said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-biggest U.S. bank by
assets, borrowed $3 billion from the Primary Dealer Credit
Facility on Sept. 15 and as much as $5 billion from the TSLF on
Oct. 17, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We did not need the liquidity or funding&#8221; on the day of
Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy, said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a JPMorgan
spokeswoman. As Lehman&#8217;s collapse triggered broader financial
turmoil, &#8220;we had been encouraged by our regulators to use their
facilities when it was helpful to the marketplace and to remove
any stigma,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as JPMorgan borrowed less from those two programs than
Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley, it was borrowing from a
different Fed program that neither Goldman Sachs nor Morgan
Stanley tapped. JPMorgan Chase and its Chase Bank USA subsidiary
borrowed from the Term Asset Facility, which was established in
December 2007 to provide term loans to depositary institutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has previously said that it borrowed from the
Fed&#8217;s discount window without disclosing how much. Data on
discount window borrowing isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spot gasoline in Los Angeles dropped
after Exxon Mobil Corp. said it returned units to service at its
refinery in Torrance, southern California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Nov. 24 power failure and a subsequent mechanical issue
shut some units of the refinery, curbing production. Plant
operations at the 155,800-barrel a-day refinery have returned to
normal, Aarti Ramachandran, a company spokeswoman, said in a
telephone interview yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planned flaring at Torrance from today through Dec. 3 isn&#8217;t
related to the issues last week and won&#8217;t affect production,
said Barbara Burgett, a refinery spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles dropped 1.25 cents to 7.5 cents a gallon versus
January-delivery futures traded on the New York Mercantile
Exchange as of 4:10 p.m. New York time, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery of the fuel rose 10.11
cents to $2.3754 a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbob&#8217;s premium in San Francisco was unchanged at 5.75 
cents a gallon. The prompt price advanced 11.36 cents to $2.3579
a gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Portland added 2.5 cents to 7.5 cents as the grade advanced 6.02
cents to $2.3754. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline on the
Gulf Coast narrowed 0.62 cent to 4.75 cents a gallon as of 4:20
p.m. New York time. The grade advanced 10.73 cents to $2.2529 a
gallon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premium to January futures for the same fuel in New
York widened 4.5 cents to 6 cents a gallon. The grade climbed
8.02 cents to $2.3604. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline for January delivery gained 11.36 cents, or 5.2
percent, to settle at $2.3004 a gallon on the Nymex, the highest
settlement for the front-month contract since May 4. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. began a court
fight for control of $4 billion in securities it claims to have
acquired with the purchase Washington Mutual Inc.&#8217;s bank for
$1.9 billion in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan wants U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath in
Wilmington, Delaware, to rule that investors got preferred stock
in WaMu in exchange for the debt-like, trust-preferred
securities when WaMu&#8217;s bank was seized by regulators. The Office
of Thrift Supervision ordered the exchange to ensure that WaMu&#8217;s
bank kept control of the securities, according to court records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walrath said she will rule on whether that exchange
actually took place when she decides to approve or reject
Seattle-based WaMu&#8217;s bankruptcy liquidation plan. Walrath will
start a hearing on the plan tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge today questioned one of the arguments of hedge
funds claiming to own $1.1 billion of the securities. The funds
said they still own the debt-like investments because WaMu
didn&#8217;t create, register and deliver the stock they were supposed
to get in exchange for the trust-preferred securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That makes no sense,&#8221; Walrath told attorney Robert J.
Stark, who is representing hedge fund managers including Black
Horse Capital LP and Lonestar Partners LP. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., the most profitable Wall Street firm, increased their
forecasts for U.S. and global growth in 2011, predicted an
acceleration in 2012 and recommended investors buy banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy will grow at a 2.7 percent rate next year,
up from a previous forecast of 2 percent, and 3.6 percent in
2012, economists led by Jan Hatzius in New York said in a report
today. The global economy will grow 4.6 percent in 2011 and 4.8
percent in 2012, Dominic Wilson, senior global economist, said
in a separate report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They recommended U.S. bank stocks, junk bonds, commodities,
Japanese stocks and China&#8217;s currency as the first of the firm&#8217;s
&#8220;top trades&#8221; for 2011. The forecasts are a departure from the
pessimism that characterized Goldman Sachs&#8217; projections since
2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This outlook represents a fundamental shift in the
thinking that has governed our forecast for at least the last
five years,&#8221; Hatzius said in the report. &#8220;The hand-off from
policy stimulus to private demand -- which seemed elusive just a
couple of months ago -- now appears to be developing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks started what is historically their best month
with a rally today after ADP Employer Services data showed
companies added 93,000 jobs last month, the Federal Reserve said
the economy gained strength across most of the nation and
manufacturing in China expanded at the fastest pace in seven
months. The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index advanced as much as 2.3
percent, the most since Sept. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underlying Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs economists said underlying demand, a
measure of growth that excludes the effects of fiscal stimulus
and inventory restocking, has strengthened and is on track to
expand at a 5 percent rate in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the
U.S. economy to grow 2.5 percent next year and 3.1 percent in
2012. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
lowered its forecast for global growth last month to 4.2 percent
for 2011 from 4.5 percent, and predicted 4.6 percent for 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as growth accelerates, U.S. unemployment will remain
elevated by historical standards, declining to 8.5 percent by
the end of 2012 from 9.6 percent in October, the economists
said. The jobless rate increased to 10.1 percent in October
2009, the highest monthly figure since 1983. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation, Unemployment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, is
likely to be 0.5 percent in each of the next two years, Goldman
Sachs said. The combination of high unemployment and low
inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve from raising
interest rates, the economists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conditions will be &#8220;positive for risky assets,&#8221; they
wrote. The SP 500, the main benchmark for American equities,
will likely end next year at 1,450, up 20 percent from 1,206.07
at 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has gained 8.2 percent this year and recouped
three-fifths of its decline from a record in October 2007.
Concerns about the economic fallout from government debt
reduction by some European countries caused rallies to stall in
April and November and are the principal risk to Goldman&#8217;s
outlook, the economists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth in emerging markets may slow next year as
acceleration in the U.S. prompts China, other Asian economies
and Brazil to tighten monetary policy, the economists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For its top trades, Goldman recommended betting on a
decline in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Chinese
renminbi via two-year non-deliverable forwards for an expected
return of 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bets on the KBW Bank Index will return 25 percent, and
selling protection on high-yield corporate bonds via credit-
default swaps will return 8.7 percent, they predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average is likely to return 20
percent next year, while a basket of crude oil, copper, cotton,
soybeans and platinum will gain 28 percent, they said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian banks rallied in Sao Paulo
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Credit Suisse Group AG said they
may benefit as policy makers start raising interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banco Bradesco SA gained 2.2 percent to 34.31 reais at 3
p.m. New York time, after JPMorgan analysts Emy Shayo Cherman
and Ben Laidler said the &#8220;hiking cycle&#8221; may lift the lender&#8217;s
insurance revenue. Credit Suisse raised banks to &#8220;overweight&#8221;
in a recommended list of Brazil stocks, saying higher borrowing
costs will boost earnings while failing to stem credit growth,
according to a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tightening should have a favorable impact on earnings
over the medium-term without impeding strong credit growth,&#8221;
Andrew T. Campbell, an analyst at Credit Suisse in Sao Paulo,
wrote yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policy makers will raise the benchmark interest rate to
12.25 percent next year from 10.75 percent now, according to the
median estimate in a central bank survey of about 100 economists
published Nov. 29. Banks are the second best-performing industry
in Brazil in the second half, with the MSCI gauge of financial
stocks up 34 percent since June 30, compared with a gain of 35
percent for the industrial index and 14 percent for the
benchmark Bovespa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Itau, Santander &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campbell, of Credit Suisse, says investors should buy Itau
Unibanco Holding SA and Banco do Brasil SA. The JPMorgan
analysts name Bradesco and Banco Santander Brasil SA as their
&#8220;top 10 picks&#8221; in Brazil, according to a report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santander gained 4.5 percent to 23.14 reais, while Itau
climbed 2 percent to 40.01 reais. Banco do Brasil rose 2.6
percent to 33.77 reais. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Credit Suisse recommends cutting holdings of stocks
that &#8220;may face headwinds during tightening,&#8221; JPMorgan said
industries such as real estate may extend gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While domestic names have tended to underperform before a
first interest rate hike, the global scenario doesn&#8217;t seem
favorable to commodities,&#8221; wrote Cherman and Laidler. &#8220;We
continue to recommend an overweight position in domestic
sectors.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil futures traded in New York will
average $110 a barrel in 2012, up from a forecast of $100 a
barrel next year, according to Goldman, Sachs  Co. analysts led
by David Greely in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Looking toward 2012, the stage is set for a return to a
structural bull market in oil,&#8221; the analysts said in the report
dated today. The 2012 forecast is based on &#8220;the better
prospects for continued robust world economic growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2.4 million-barrel-a-day increase in global oil demand in
2010 will be sustainable at more than 2 million barrels a day in
2011 and 2012 and require OPEC to tap into its spare capacity,
the Goldman analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had spare
capacity of 5.64 million barrels a day in November, according to
Bloomberg estimates. That compares with 2 million barrels a day
in July 2008, when New York-traded oil futures reached a record
$147.27 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for January delivery gained $2.64, or 3.1 percent, to
settle at $86.75 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
the highest closing price since Nov. 11. Crude has averaged
$78.72 a barrel so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc., the third-largest
U.S. bank by assets, reorganized a commercial real-estate
business it plans to sell, with 30 employees moving to JPMorgan
Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several workers have already left for JPMorgan and the rest
will go over the next couple of months, according to an internal
Citigroup memo obtained by Bloomberg News and confirmed by
Shannon Bell, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departures are part of an August deal in which
Citigroup sold a $3.5 billion portfolio of commercial and
multifamily loans to JPMorgan, also based in New York, for an
undisclosed sum, Bell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo was written by Mark Mason, chief operating officer
of Citi Holdings, the division that has been selling the bank&#8217;s
unwanted assets since its $45 billion government bailout in
2008. The division valued its North American commercial real
estate loans at $5.4 billion at the end of the third quarter of
2010, down 50 percent on the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head of the commercial real-estate group, Tom Lawyer,
is joining JPMorgan as part of the deal. He will be replaced by
Curtis McKinney, a regional manager with the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit slashed the
Citi Holdings division&#8217;s overall assets by 24 percent to $421
billion in the 12 months that ended in September 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hedge funds increased short selling
in U.S. renewable energy stocks to the highest level in a year,
boosting bets against First Solar Inc. (FSLR) and Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) as
government support for low-polluting technologies faltered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventeen percent of the freely traded shares of the 35
U.S. stocks in the WilderHill New Energy Index are sold short,
compared with 16 percent in October and 15 percent in August,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. That&#8217;s almost four times the
4.4 percent short ratio of the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to this week&#8217;s global climate talks in
Mexico, short sellers targeted makers of wind turbines, solar
panels and electric cars whose sales also were undermined by
cash-strapped European governments cutting subsidies. Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. and BlackRock Group trimmed long positions in
renewable-energy shares in the third quarter, filings show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The lack of an international agreement on climate change
and short-term uncertainty on policy support across the globe
makes the sector fairly susceptible to predatory trades from
hedge funds,&#8221; said Krishnan Shakkottai, a market analyst at
Bloomberg New Energy Finance in London. Republican gains in U.S.
mid-term elections are &#8220;a huge deal,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tradeweb LLC, the bond- and
derivatives-trading network partly owned by Wall Street&#8217;s
largest banks, created an electronic method to reduce failed
trades in the agency mortgage-bond market two weeks after the
volume of incomplete agreements reached record highs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BlackRock Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. collaborated with Tradeweb on the technology, the New
York-based firm said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system will allow brokers&#8217; clients to &#8220;pair off&#8221;
trades with different dealers, &#8220;enabling more efficient
resolution of round-robin fails between dealers,&#8221; according to

the five years through 2009, Federal Reserve data show. The
tally repeatedly counts failures that linger for multiple days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The volume of incomplete deals jumped after the U.S.
central bank purchased $1.25 trillion of securities in the $5.3
trillion market in a program designed to bolster the economy and
keep short-term interest rates near zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next Step: Penalties? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, an industry group that advises on transactions in
U.S. debt recommended measures to cut incomplete agreements.
Analysts including those at Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank AG
have said in reports that penalizing sellers who fail to
complete trades may be the next step in reducing them. &lt;/p&gt;

Braun and William Selway" date="Dec 01, 2010  9:30 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-01/former-jpmorgan-banker-admits-rigging-bids-on-municipal-bond-investments.html"><headline>Ex-JPMorgan Banker Pleads Guilty to Rigging Bids on Municipal Bond Deals</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;A former JPMorgan Chase  Co. banker
pleaded guilty to rigging bids for municipal-bond investment
contracts, becoming the eighth person to admit joining the
biggest conspiracy in the $2.8 trillion market&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James L. Hertz, whom the Justice Department said worked for
a Manhattan-based financial institution that it didn&#8217;t name,
acknowledged bid-rigging and fraud conspiracies yesterday,
according to a department news release. He agreed to cooperate
with prosecutors. Hertz, 53, of Cranford, New Jersey, worked at
New York-based JPMorgan from 1994 through 2008, according to
records filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hertz and co-conspirators designated in advance which co-
conspirator provider, either his employer or another financial
institution, would be the winning bidder for certain investment
agreements or other municipal finance contracts,&#8221; the Justice
Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former bankers at Bank of America Corp. and UBS AG have
pleaded guilty to cheating taxpayers by conspiring with brokers
to pay states and local governments below-market rates on
investments purchased with bond proceeds. One branch of the
conspiracy stretched from California to Pennsylvania and
included more than 200 deals involving about 160 state agencies,
local governments and nonprofits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities Swindled &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Municipalities may have lost more than $1 billion because
of bid-rigging, said Steven Feinstein, a finance professor at
Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2007, Bank of America reached an amnesty
agreement with the Justice Department&#8217;s Antitrust Division. It
reported its own illegal activity and agreed to assist
prosecutors. It has given investigators documents, e-mails and
recordings of phone calls, court records show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three former executives of Los Angeles-based investment
broker CDR Financial Products and another three employees of a
General Electric Co. unit were indicted and have pleaded not
guilty, according to court records. U.S. prosecutors named
former bankers at Citigroup Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
Wachovia Corp. and eight other banks as unindicted co-
conspirators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2008, JPMorgan said it would stop selling
derivatives -- financial instruments whose value is tied to
another security -- to municipal borrowers. The bank has
disclosed in company filings that it&#8217;s facing a civil suit by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to
municipal-bond investment contracts and derivatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parking Cash &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokeswoman, Jennifer Zuccarelli, said the bank
is co-operating with the Justice Department and it fired Hertz
in 2007, after he failed to assist the company with its own
probe into the dealings of the municipal derivatives unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal investigation centers on investments that
municipalities buy with money raised through bond sales. The so-
called guaranteed investment contracts let them earn a return
until the cash is needed for schools, roads or other public
works. The U.S. Treasury Department encourages competitive
bidding to ensure that localities get market rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have said that favored bankers got inside
information from brokers who handled the bidding so they could
carve up the market. In some cases, bankers admitted paying
kickbacks to brokers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is one of five former JPMorgan bankers who received
letters informing them that they&#8217;re targets of the Justice
Department probe, according to employment records filed with
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broker E &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hertz received tips from a Minnesota-based person
identified only as Broker E who worked for local governments,
according to the charges. The information about competitors&#8217;
bids allowed Hertz to alter his offers to win contracts,
prosecutors wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He conspired with another bank, identified as Financial
Institution A, to fix prices and submit intentionally losing
bids to give the appearance of a legitimate auction and comply
with U.S. Treasury regulations, according to court documents
released today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2001, Hertz competed for a derivative contract with an
unnamed state university that would go to the firm allowing the
school to pay the lowest interest rate, according to the
charges. Hertz initially told Broker E he would accept 4.029
percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The co-owner of the broker handling the bid signaled that
Hertz could raise his offer to 4.039, which Hertz did, the court
papers said. He got the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another transaction based on the lowest price a town
could pay for a portfolio of securities, the broker, after
collecting other bids, advised Hertz to raise his bid by $5,000.
He did so and won the contract, according to the charges. &lt;/p&gt;

four weeks of November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brazilian companies that depend most
on domestic growth may rally despite their premium over stocks
that benefit from commodities prices, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should remain &#8220;overweight&#8221; in industries such
as real estate and banking as expected increases in borrowing
costs may already be reflected in share prices, analysts
including Emy Shayo Cherman and Ben Laidler wrote in a note to
clients dated yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While domestic names have tended to underperform before a
first interest-rate hike, the global scenario doesn&#8217;t seem
favorable to commodities,&#8221; they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil&#8217;s central bank may increase reserve requirements
when it begins raising interest rates in April, according to
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Emerging-market bonds will
underperform developing-nation equities next year as U.S.
Treasury yields rise, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bond returns are likely to be between 4 percent and 8
percent in 2011, compared with 25 percent for developing-country
equities, Joyce Chang, the head of emerging-market research at
JPMorgan in New York, wrote in a note dated Nov. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local-currency debt will probably return 8.3 percent next
year as the extra yield investors demand to own developing-
nation governments&#8217; dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries declines
by about 70 basis points, she wrote. The yield on U.S. 10-year
notes will rise to 3.45 percent by the end of 2011, she wrote,
compared with 2.9 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Falling U.S. Treasury yields driven by U.S. monetary-policy
easing have propelled emerging-market bond performance this
year, with the JPMorgan EMBI Global index returning 12.4 percent
so far in 2010. The U.S. Federal Reserve&#8217;s plan to buy $600
billion worth of Treasury bonds has been the &#8220;major driver of
markets&#8221; since August, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;After posting 13 percent year-to-date returns in 2010, it
will be a struggle for emerging-market fixed-income assets to
generate even half that return in 2011,&#8221; Chang wrote, adding
that investors were asking themselves &#8220;whether 2011 will be the
year of outperformance by emerging-market equities rather than
emerging-market fixed income.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GDP Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing economies will expand 5.9 percent as a group in
2011, she wrote, and debt issuance by emerging-market companies
and governments will fall to $240 billion next year from $280
billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank&#8217;s EMBI Global Index tracking the so-called yield
spread on emerging-market bonds will fall to 250 basis points
from 322 yesterday, Chang said. The spread on the CEMBI Broad
Index of emerging-market corporate bonds should fall to 260
basis points by the end of 2011 as emerging-market corporate
debt outperforms bonds sold by developed nation companies, she
said. The spread was 323 basis points yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEMBI Broad Index will probably return 6.5 percent
during 2011, Chang wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Engen Petroleum Ltd., a unit of
Malaysia&#8217;s Petroliam Nasional Bhd, completed the acquisition of
Chevron Corp.&#8217;s assets in Malawi, Zambia and the French
territory of Reunion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deal gives Engen, South Africa&#8217;s largest fuel retailer,
an additional 72 filling stations and bulk storage facilities in
the three countries, the Cape Town-based company said in a
statement today. Engen hopes to get regulatory approval to buy
Chevron&#8217;s assets in Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Tanzania and Mauritius
by early next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a significant acquisition for us,&#8221; Wayne Hartmann,
general manager of Engen&#8217;s international business unit, told
reporters in Cape Town, while declining to specify the value of
the deal. &#8220;It is generally cheaper and more effective to make
acquisitions than to build a network yourself.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engen has been expanding in Africa for the past four years
to grow its share of the petroleum retail market while Chevron
is exiting retail activities to focus on oil and gas production.
Engen first announced plans to buy the assets on Sept. 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engen also wants to expand in Kenya, Uganda, Ghana and
Nigeria and will consider further acquisitions &#8220;if
opportunities come up,&#8221; Hartmann said. &#8220;Operating in
developing markets is higher risk. The expectation of our
shareholders is that we will deliver higher returns as a
result.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testimony by a Bank of America Corp.
employee in a New Jersey personal bankruptcy case may give more
ammunition to homeowners and investors in their legal battles
over defaulted mortgages, Bloomberg News&#8217; Prashant Gopal and
Jody Shenn report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda DeMartini, a team leader in the company&#8217;s mortgage-
litigation management division, said during a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court hearing in Camden last year that it was routine for the
lender to keep mortgage promissory notes even after loans were
bundled by the thousands into bonds and sold to investors,
according to a transcript. Contracts for such securitizations
usually require the documents to be transferred to the trustee
for mortgage bondholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Judith H. Wizmur on Nov.
16 rejected a claim on the home of John T. Kemp, ruling his
mortgage company, now owned by Bank of America, had failed to
deliver the note to the trustee. That could leave the trustee
with no standing to take the property, and raises the question
of whether other foreclosures could similarly be blocked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the decision, the bank disavowed the statements
by DeMartini, whom it had flown in from California to testify.
It was the policy of Countrywide Financial Corp., acquired by
Bank of America in July 2008, to deliver notes as called for in
its securitization contracts, according to Larry Platt, an
attorney at KL Gates LLP in Washington designated by the bank
to answer questions about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This particular employee was mistaken in what she said,&#8221;
Platt said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wizmur&#8217;s ruling is being scrutinized by lawyers for
borrowers seeking to stall repossessions as a way to press
lenders to modify their debt. Attorneys for homeowners have
already won cases by calling into doubt the legitimacy of
affidavits used to take back properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If this is correct, many, many, many foreclosures already
occurred in which this plaintiff didn&#8217;t have the note,&#8221; said
Bruce Levitt, the South Orange, New Jersey, attorney
representing Kemp. &#8220;This could affect thousands or hundreds of
thousands of loans.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of John T. Kemp, Kemp v.
Countrywide Home Loans Inc., 08-02448, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
District of New Jersey (Camden). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delta Air Wins Dismissal of Virgin Suit Over First-Class Seats &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delta Air Lines Inc., the world&#8217;s second-biggest carrier,
won the dismissal of a Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. U.K. lawsuit
over a patent for flat-bed seats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virgin, the long-haul carrier controlled by billionaire
Richard Branson, sued Atlanta-based Delta in 2008 over claims
that its seats, designed by Premium Aircraft Interiors Group
Ltd., infringed Virgin&#8217;s patent. The British carrier &#8220;has no
real prospect of establishing infringement,&#8221; Judge Richard
Arnold in London said in a judgment yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling &#8220;does not necessarily deprive Virgin of the
possibility of relief against Delta,&#8221; Arnold said. &#8220;Virgin may
be able to bring a claim against Delta for infringement of one
or more of its U.S. patents. It may also, at some point in the
future, be in a position to sue Delta for infringement of a
European patent containing seat unit claims.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Virgin Atlantic Airways v. Delta Air Lines,
HC08C1577, High Court of Justice Chancery Division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global U.K. Unit Sued Over Investor&#8217;s $1.55 Million Loss &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF Global Holdings Ltd. was sued by an investor who claims
the brokerage caused him to lose about 1 million pounds ($1.55
million) by encouraging him to make short-term, risky trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An account manager at MF&#8217;s GNI unit gave Michael Wilson, an
Aberdeen, Scotland-based businessman, &#8220;market commentary and
investment advice&#8221; that broke rules on execution-only accounts,
Wilson&#8217;s lawyer, Jalil Asif, told a London court yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following advice from his account manager, Wilson took a
&#8220;risky&#8221; strategy of short-term buying and selling of a type of
derivatives that resulted in large losses. The brokerage should
have &#8220;balanced what was said&#8221; by the account manager by
telling Wilson the risks, Asif said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wilson operated an execution-only account at GNI between
2003 and 2005, his lawyer Asif said. Even though it was an
execution-only account the brokerage &#8220;permitted&#8221; Wilson&#8217;s
account manager &#8220;to provide market commentary and investment
advice&#8221; while he wasn&#8217;t permitted to do so under Financial
Services Authority rules, Asif said in written arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MF&#8217;s lawyer, James Smith, said the manager never gave
investment advice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He was merely seeking to assist Mr. Wilson in the context
of an execution-only dealing relationship,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;Mr.
Wilson knew perfectly well what he was doing and always would
have traded the way he did.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Michael Duthie Wilson v MF Global Ltd.,

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. sued Bank of America Corp.,
claiming $150 million on a collateralized debt obligation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman is seeking to prevent Bank of America from using
&#8220;unenforceable&#8221; clauses of the deal to &#8220;improperly&#8221; change
Lehman&#8217;s right to priority payment on the CDO, according to a
complaint filed Nov. 29 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeking money to pay creditors, the bankrupt investment
bank has been using lawsuits and requesting court rulings to
preserve disputed payment rights on derivatives transactions.
The disputes hinge on conflicts between bankruptcy law and the
rules governing swap agreements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, sued in its role as trustee, had no
comment, said spokesman William Halldin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IVest Managing Partner Defrauded Investors, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors accused IVest International Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s managing partner of conspiring to solicit millions of
dollars from investors and using the money for mortgage
payments, golfing expenses and $100,000 in New York Yankees
tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Graulich IV, 54, of Henryville, Pennsylvania, is
charged with interstate wire fraud for promoting risk-free
investments in notes, letters of credit and other financial
instruments, U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman in Newark, New
Jersey, said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Graulich, along with unnamed co-conspirators, represented
that they had an &#8216;exclusive&#8217; investment platform available by
invitation only, and that had been previously open only to those
able to invest at least $100 million,&#8221; Fishman said. He said
they promised &#8220;weekly returns of 22 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s taken the position that he&#8217;s not guilty of any
financial crime,&#8221; Graulich&#8217;s lawyer, Jay V. Surgent of
Lyndhurst, New Jersey, said in a telephone interview yesterday.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll proceed with a vigorous defense.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the criminal complaint, one unnamed investor
met Graulich in London for a presentation and invested about
$4.4 million with him. Graulich used a bank account in
Morristown, New Jersey, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC Avoiding Criticism on Lehman Deal, Barclays Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission faulted
Barclays Plc&#8217;s purchase of bankrupt Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc.&#8217;s brokerage to avoid &#8220;political criticism&#8221;
if any brokerage customers don&#8217;t get paid, Barclays said in a
court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. bank asked a New York bankruptcy judge to dismiss
the SEC&#8217;s argument that $1.3 billion in pending transfers may be
needed for customers. The assets were allocated to Barclays in a
sale given &#8220;unqualified support&#8221; by previous SEC commissioners
faced with &#8220;a potentially disastrous liquidation&#8221; of the
brokerage in the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays said Nov. 29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This court should not countenance new SEC commissioners
repudiating their predecessors&#8217; position before this court in an
effort to avoid any perceived political criticism,&#8221; it said in
the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K.&#8217;s third-largest bank is awaiting the judge&#8217;s
verdict after a court trial over an alleged $11 billion
&#8220;windfall&#8221; it made buying the brokerage in the 2008 financial
crisis. Barclays says it is still owed $3 billion allocated to
it in a sale contract signed by all parties to the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester declined immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC said in a Nov. 22 court filing that two transfers
from the Lehman brokerage would violate securities law if they
increased the deficiency in the accounts. They are $769 million
in securities held in the brokerage&#8217;s reserve bank account, and
$507 million in assets listed as a debit item in the brokerage&#8217;s
customer reserve, according to the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC &#8220;did not raise these alleged prerequisites at the
time of the sale,&#8221; Barclays said in court papers. &#8220;Barclays
was making an enormous investment (and taking an enormous risk)
by acquiring&#8221; Lehman&#8217;s business.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Goldman Programmer Aleynikov Stole Code, Jury Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
programmer, &#8220;stole valuable secret computer code&#8221; from the
brokerage, a prosecutor told jurors at the opening of the trial
in New York on charges of theft of trading software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti made the
government&#8217;s opening statement yesterday in federal court in New
York. Aleynikov&#8217;s lawyer followed, saying his client broke a
confidentiality rule of the company and committed no crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov is charged with violating the Economic Espionage
Act and the Interstate Transportation of Stolen Property Act.
U.S. District Judge Denise Cote, who is presiding over the
trial, dismissed a third criminal count of unauthorized computer
access in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If convicted, Aleynikov faces as much as 15 years in
prison. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He &#8220;thought that he&#8217;d found a foolproof way of getting
around the security barriers&#8221; designed to prevent employee
theft of trade secrets, Facciponti told the jury. Aleynikov sent
stolen code to a code-storage website in Europe that wasn&#8217;t
blocked by Goldman Sachs, he said. Aleynikov then executed a
program to cover his tracks, Facciponti said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defense lawyer, Kevin Marino, argued in his opening
statement that Aleynikov intended to strip out pieces of open-
source software -- software available for use by the public --
contained within the Goldman Sachs code files. He tried to cover
his tracks because he knew he was violating the company&#8217;s
confidentiality rules and feared he would be sued by the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I will dispute to my death that violating a Goldman Sachs
confidentiality provision is a federal crime,&#8221; Marino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, 1:10-cr-00096, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Deutsche Telekom Manager Convicted Over Spy Scandal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Deutsche Telekom AG security manager was convicted
of violating privacy rules and improperly using funds for his
involvement in spying on journalists and board members at the
company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bonn Regional Court sentenced Klaus Trzeschan to three
and a half years in prison at a hearing yesterday. Trzeschan,
who was also convicted of fraud, had admitted that he
participated in the corporate spying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case centers on allegations that managers at the
company obtained phone records for journalists and supervisory
board members to search for sources of news leaks. Prosecutors
in June dropped probes into former Chairman Klaus Zumwinkel and
ex-Chief Executive Officer Kai-Uwe Ricke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t call this a spy affair, because we&#8217;re talking
about serious crimes here,&#8221; Presiding Judge Klaus Reinhoff said
after delivering the verdict. &#8220;We cannot stress enough that
Deutsche Telekom made it really easy for Mr. Trzeschan to commit
these crimes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will review the written judgment and will comment at
the appropriate time,&#8221; Trzeschan&#8217;s attorney Hans-Joerg Odenthal
said after the verdict. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Singapore Airlines to Pay $48 Million Fine, U.S. Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore Airlines Cargo Pte Ltd. agreed to plead guilty
and pay a $48 million criminal fine for its role in a conspiracy
to fix prices, the U.S. Justice Department said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department filed a one-count felony charge in federal
court yesterday accusing the company of helping fix prices
between 2002 and 2006, the Justice Department said in an e-
mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plea deal, which requires court approval, is the latest
in the department&#8217;s ongoing investigation into the air-cargo
industry. Including yesterday&#8217;s events, 20 airlines and 17
executives have been charged and more than $1.7 billion in fines
have been levied. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Singapore Airlines Cargo said it has
cooperated with the investigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company decided to accept the offer after consulting
its legal advisers and carefully weighing its options,&#8221;
according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other airlines that have agreed to pay fines in the
investigation are Polar Air Cargo LLC, a unit of Atlas Air
Worldwide Holdings Inc.; Air France-KLM Group; Cathay Pacific
Airways Ltd.; SAS Cargo Group A/S and Martinair Holland NV, a
unit of KLM. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. shut down a crude oil
pipeline after a leak was detected near a creek in Salt Lake
City, according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for the
mayor&#8217;s office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron workers reported the spill at 11:23 p.m. local time
yesterday, said Captain Michael Harp of the Salt Lake City Fire
Department. Firefighters were able to contain the fuel before it
reached Red Butte Creek, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This pipeline happens to cross a lot of our watershed
areas, so it literally could affect, if there is a spill, a
million people&#8217;s drinking-water supply,&#8221; Mayor Ralph Becker
said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company does not anticipate
any impact on Salt Lake City refineries, Justin Higgs, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At this time, we are uncertain when the pipeline will be
back in service,&#8221; Higgs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second leak in six months on the 10-inch line,
Harrison Smith said. The pipe was shut from June 12 to June 21
and the mayor&#8217;s office reported an estimated 800 barrels of
crude leaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sean Comey, another company spokesman, said at the time
that an electrical arc may have caused the June spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corp.&#8217;s 58,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Salt Lake
City receives a small volume of crude from the common carrier
Chevron pipeline, Mike Marcy, a Tesoro spokesman, said in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro doesn&#8217;t expect any difficulty supplying customers
and meeting contractual obligations while the line is out of
service, Marcy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cause of the leak is under investigation while the
cleanup continues, Harp said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Over the last few months we&#8217;ve been in the process of
evaluating this line and others in the area,&#8221; Becker said.
&#8220;This obviously creates a whole new sense of urgency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

Mider and Jeffrey McCracken" date="Dec 02, 2010  5:20 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2010-12-02/nicor-gas-utility-is-said-to-seek-buyers-with-jpmorgan-running-the-auction.html"><headline>Nicor Is Said to Seek Buyers, Work With JPMorgan, Sending Shares Higher</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;Nicor Inc., the Chicago-area natural-
gas utility with a market value of about $2 billion, is seeking
a buyer, according to people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is running the auction and started
contacting potential buyers two to three months ago, said the
people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the
talks are private. Some utility companies and infrastructure
funds were approached and decided the price for Nicor was too
high to submit a bid, some of the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicor&#8217;s natural-gas distribution unit, Nicor Gas, has more
than 2 million customers in northern Illinois and the Chicago
suburbs. The utility has limited growth opportunities because
large population increases are not expected in the region, said
Andrew Pusateri, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicor Gas provided almost 80 percent of the company&#8217;s 2009
sales, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicor rose $3.11, or 7.2 percent, to $46.63 at 4:15 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicor Chief Executive Officer Russ Strobel, 58, is pursuing
a sale as the Naperville, Illinois-based company&#8217;s shares trade
at 15 times estimated 2011 earnings. That multiple compares with
about 12 times for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Utilities Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s relatively high valuation may make it hard to
find a buyer, Mark Barnett, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is hard to see who would be excited by the prospect of
taking them out,&#8221; said Barnett, who rates Nicor shares three
stars out of five and doesn&#8217;t own any. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pension Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most likely bidders would likely be private equity or
pension funds seeking the steady flow of income produced by
Nicor&#8217;s regulated gas distributor, Barnett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Integrys Energy Group, which owns Peoples Gas, a natural-
gas utility in Chicago, would make &#8220;the most sense&#8221; out of
publicly traded utility companies that might have an interest
because of cost savings achieved by combining service
territories, Barnett said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annette Martinez, a spokeswoman for Nicor, said she
couldn&#8217;t comment. Bonnie Johnson, a spokeswoman for Integrys
Energy, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the gas utility, Nicor owns Tropical
Shipping, a freight business operating in the Bahamas and
Caribbean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicor shares closed at $43.52 yesterday in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading, valuing the company at about $2
billion. The company had about $729 million of net debt as of
Sept. 30. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Timothy Main, who has run the
JPMorgan Chase  Co. investment-banking unit for financial
institutions in North America for nine years, plans to take a
&#8220;senior&#8221; role elsewhere in the firm, the bank said in a memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main, 45, will take a new job when he returns from a
sabbatical in January, New York-based JPMorgan said in an
internal memo yesterday confirmed by spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau.
The memo doesn&#8217;t specify the position. Two bankers from Main&#8217;s
group, Fernando Rivas, 36, and John Simmons, 40, were promoted
to jointly lead the unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Main, JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bankers boosted market
share with bank and insurance clients and played a role in some
of the most tumultuous chapters in the global financial crisis.
Main and his team helped Wells Fargo  Co. outmaneuver Citigroup
Inc. to buy the tottering Wachovia Corp., and worked with PNC
Financial Services Group Inc. on its takeover of National City
Corp., both in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The financials unit &#8220;has grown across all products and
geographies to become No. 1 in the sector,&#8221; said Jeffrey Urwin
and Kevin Willsey, co-heads of investment banking in the U.S.
and Canada, in the memo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s rank for both equity underwriting and merger
advice for North American financial companies jumped to second
place from 2008 through today from eighth place during 2001 to
2003, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Main, a native of South Africa, joined the former J.P.
Morgan  Co. in 1987 after graduating from Princeton University. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
the recipient of the world&#8217;s biggest banking bailout, hired Rod McWalters to help manage its U.S. loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McWalters, 43, is helping develop a new global group called
the &#8220;active credit portfolio management team,&#8221; said Pholida
Phengsomphone, an RBS spokeswoman. He will be a director in the
bank&#8217;s Stamford, Connecticut, office and focus on selling loans
and hedging with credit-default swaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reports to Andrew Weinberg, head of transaction
portfolio management for the Americas, and Richard Hubble, who
heads trading and execution for the new group, Phengsomphone
said. The global head of RBS&#8217;s new credit group is John Ryan,
who joined the bank&#8217;s London office in April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS, which has headquarters in Edinburgh, reduced the net
loans on its balance sheet by 26 percent, to $572.6 billion, in
the year ended Sept. 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The bank reported a bigger-than-expected decline in
bad-loan provisions in the third quarter, leading to a narrower
loss than the year-earlier period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland, which was rescued by the U.K.
government, has taken $59.9 billion of writedowns and credit
losses resulting from the financial crisis, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McWalters previously worked at Commerzbank AG, UBS AG and
Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks advanced, giving the Dow
Jones Industrial Average its biggest two-day rally since July,
as purchases of existing homes unexpectedly jumped, retail sales
topped analysts&#8217; estimates and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended buying financial shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PulteGroup Inc., the largest U.S. homebuilder by revenue,
advanced 3.2 percent after pending sales of existing homes
increased by a record 10 percent in October. Home Depot Inc.
climbed 5.5 percent, leading gains in the Dow, as retail sales
rose the most since March. Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. drove financial shares to the biggest advance in the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index after Goldman Sachs said the
economic outlook is &#8220;supportive&#8221; for the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 1.3 percent to 1,221.53 at 4 p.m. in New
York after gaining 2.2 percent yesterday. The last time the
measure posted two straight advances exceeding 1 percent was in
February. The Dow gained 106.63 points, or 1 percent, to
11,362.41. Both gauges are up more than 3.2 percent in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is telling us that the economy is doing better
than expected,&#8221; said Hank Smith, chief investment officer at
Haverford Trust Co., which manages about $6.5 billion in Radnor,
Pennsylvania. &#8220;Buying financial stocks is one way to play the
improvement in the macroeconomic environment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is up 19 percent from this year&#8217;s low in July
as companies reported higher-than-estimated earnings and the
Federal Reserve increased its program of asset purchases to
stimulate growth. The index had fallen as much as 3.9 percent
from a two-year high on Nov. 5 amid investor concern that the
European debt crisis would hamper economic growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP 500 at 1,450 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The benchmark for U.S. equities rose 2.2 percent yesterday,
its biggest advance since Sept. 1, amid improving data on the
U.S. and China economies and speculation of a larger European
financial rescue. Goldman Sachs&#8217; investment strategist David Kostin said the SP 500 may rise to 1,450 by the end of next
year, a gain of more than 20 percent from yesterday&#8217;s close, as
the economic recovery accelerates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, U.S. equities advanced as European Central
Bank policy makers meeting in Frankfurt kept the benchmark
interest rate at a record low of 1 percent and delayed the
bank&#8217;s exit from emergency liquidity measures as the debt crisis
threatens to engulf Portugal and Spain. The ECB didn&#8217;t announce
new measures to halt the crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. stock futures maintained gains before the open of
exchanges as fewer Americans filed claims for unemployment
insurance payments over the past month, showing the job market
is improving. The number of applications for jobless benefits
averaged 431,000 a week over the month ended Nov. 27, the lowest
level since August 2008, Labor Department figures showed. Claims
increased by 26,000 last week, more than forecast, to 436,000,
after reaching a two-year low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Picking Up Strength&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re picking up strength,&#8221; said Tom Wirth, senior
investment officer for Chemung Canal Trust Co., which manages
$1.5 billion in Elmira, New York. &#8220;Almost every data point we
get over here is telling us no double-dip recession.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of 12 homebuilders in SP indexes rallied 3.9
percent, as all of its companies gained at least 2.2 percent.
Pending sales of U.S. existing houses unexpectedly jumped a
record 10 percent in October, the National Association of
Realtors said. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
was for a 1 percent decrease. The group&#8217;s data go back to 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PulteGroup rose 3.2 percent to $6.75. D.R. Horton Inc., the
second-largest U.S. builder, advanced 3.7 percent to $10.92.
Lennar Corp., the third-biggest, jumped 7.2 percent to $16.88. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail sales rose the most in eight months in November, led
by Abercrombie  Fitch Co. and J.C. Penney Co., and beat
analysts&#8217; estimates as consumers gobbled up discounts,
particularly during the Thanksgiving weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teen retailer Abercrombie had the second-biggest gain in
the SP 500, rallying 11 percent to $56.02. Same-store sales
rose 22 percent, above the 6.4 percent average of analysts&#8217;
estimates compiled by Retail Metrics Inc. J.C. Penney rose 2.3
percent to $34.47 as the third-largest U.S. department store
chain boosted sales 9.2 percent, above a 3.3 percent projection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
rose the most in the Dow, advancing 5.5 percent to $33.36. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Retail sales numbers in the U.S. are quite strong and
that&#8217;s a positive for stocks,&#8221; said David Abella, a money
manager at Rochdale Investment Management LLC in New York, which
has $3 billion under management. &#8220;The news out of the U.S.
seems to be slowly improving.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overweight Financials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks climbed 2.6 percent, the most among 10
industries in the SP 500. Goldman Sachs upgraded the group to
&#8220;overweight,&#8221; the first positive recommendation since 2008, as
strong economic growth, higher stock prices and a helpful
interest rate environment will help financial services
companies, the bank&#8217;s U.S. portfolio strategy team wrote in a
note to investors yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the largest U.S. lender, climbed 3.5
percent to $11.68, and JPMorgan Chase, the second-biggest U.S.
bank by assets, rose 3 percent to $39.31. Marshall  Ilsley
Corp. gained 12 percent, the most in the SP 500, to $5.48. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp., the third-largest U.S. mobile phone
carrier, gained 2.4 percent to $3.86. Clearwire Corp., the high-
speed wireless network carrier 54 percent owned by Sprint, said
it plans to sell at least $1.1 billion of debt after saying last
month it may not have enough funding to keep operating.
Clearwire tumbled 13 percent to $5.90. &lt;/p&gt;

could &#8220;free up some capital&#8221; and trade at the equivalent of
$250 a share if it split itself into three entities, Price,
president of MFP Investors LLC, said. David Wells, a spokesman
for Goldman Sachs in New York, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price made his reputation as a value investor in the 1980s
by buying shares of beaten-down lenders and running some of the
best-performing mutual funds in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares climbed 2.6 percent to $162.50 at 4
p.m. in New York. They have lost 3.8 percent this year, compared
with a 9.5 percent gain in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index and a
5 percent rise by financial stocks in the measure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp. supports a
network accord between partner Clearwire Corp. and Deutsche
Telekom AG&#8217;s T-Mobile USA, said Goldman, Sachs  Co. analyst
Jason Armstrong, who met with Sprint management yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sprint indicated they have encouraged a wholesale deal,&#8221;
wrote Armstrong in a Dec. 1 note, after meeting with Chief
Executive Officer Dan Hesse and Chief Financial Officer Bob Brust. &#8220;Sprint would support a T-Mobile equity infusion into
Clearwire,&#8221; he wrote, noting it would hinge on the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a wholesale deal, T-Mobile would buy capacity on
Clearwire&#8217;s so-called fourth-generation network, which enables
faster Web browsing and video downloads than some other
standards. T-Mobile&#8217;s own network uses a different technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearwire said last month it may not have enough funding to
keep operating and announced a debt sale of at least $1.1
billion today. On Nov. 4, the company said it would pare 15
percent of jobs, reduce sales and marketing spending and delay
its Clear-branded smartphone to help it save as much as $400
million through the first half. Sprint has a 54 percent stake in
Clearwire and sells service over the Kirkland, Washington-based
carrier&#8217;s network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint continues to negotiate with Clearwire though &#8220;there
was no commitment to a resolution by year-end,&#8221; said Armstrong.
The carrier &#8220;does not appear to have shareholder support for a
full buy-in of Clearwire, making an equity infusion most
likely,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearwire Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike DiGioia, a Clearwire spokesman, said the carrier had
previously held discussions with T-Mobile, though he declined to
say if the carriers have held recent talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cristi Allen, a Sprint spokeswoman in Overland Park,
Kansas, and Reid Walker, a T-Mobile spokesman in Bellevue,
Washington, both said they had no comments to add. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sprint gained 9 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $3.86 at 4 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Clearwire fell 92
cents, or 13 percent, to $5.90 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading,
its lowest since Dec. 10, 2009. Deutsche Telekom lost 4 cents to
10.02 euros in Frankfurt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petroplus Holding AG, Europe&#8217;s
largest independent oil refiner, rose the most in more than a
year in Swiss trading after analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended investors buy the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares gained 13 percent to 10.93 francs in Zurich, the
biggest gain since August 2009. That gives the Zug, Switzerland-
based company a market value of 1 billion francs ($1 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The key drivers of performance for EU refiners will be an
increase in the diesel margin and the light-heavy spread,&#8221;
according to a Goldman research note published today. Petroplus
is termed a &#8220;favorite pick&#8221; due to its &#8220;operational
leverage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petroplus owns and operates six European refineries and has
its main markets in Swizerland, Germany, France, the U.K. and
Benelux countries, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stock was previously rated &#8220;neutral&#8221; by Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, hired retired Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. partner Robert Cummings Jr. as a vice chairman in the
firm&#8217;s investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummings, who most recently worked at GSC Capital Group as
a senior managing director, spent 27 years at Goldman Sachs
advising clients on strategic financing and mergers and
acquisitions, New York-based JPMorgan said today in a statement.
He will take on a similar role at JPMorgan, reporting to Jeffrey Urwin and Kevin Willsey, who co-run investment banking in the
Americas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bob brings to the firm a vast array of deep relationships
from working with large multinational companies across various
industries over the past three decades,&#8221; Willsey said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank was the top equity underwriter
in 2009 and the first three quarters of this year among U.S.
banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummings joined GSC in 2002 and sits on the boards of
Corning Inc. and Viasystems Group Inc., according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cummings, who has a master&#8217;s degree in business
administration from the University of Chicago, studied art
history at Columbia University after retiring from Goldman Sachs
in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. agreed to sell a stake

China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 18 percent farm-down is subject to regulatory approval
in Indonesia and China, Singapore-based Chevron spokesman Gareth
Johnstone said in an e-mail today. Chevron currently has an 80
percent interest in the project, which is located in the deep-
water Makassar Strait and may eventually produce 1.1 billion
cubic feet of gas and 31,000 barrels of condensate a day.
Financial details weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron said that it awarded
front-end engineering and design contracts for the development
to Technip Indonesia, PT Worley Parsons Indonesia, and PT
Singgar Mulia, according to a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The completion of this project will strengthen our

&lt;p&gt;Nigerian workers at Exxon Mobil
Corp.&#8217;s local unit have begun an &#8220;indefinite strike&#8221; to
protest the firing of members and the high number of expatriate
employees, a union leader said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No work is going on at the company&#8217;s headquarters in
Lagos and its operational base in Eket,&#8221; Jude Nwaogu, chairman
of the company&#8217;s branch of the Pengassan union, said by phone 
today from the southeastern town of Eket. &#8220;If management allows
this strike to degenerate, we shall pull out our members from
the oil platforms and stop oil loading at the terminal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official who answered the phone at Exxon Mobil&#8217;s
Nigerian office said no one was available to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil holds a 40 percent stake in a joint venture it
operates for state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. The
venture produces 720,000 barrels a day of crude, condensate and
natural gas liquids from 90 offshore platforms, according to its
website. Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s biggest crude producer and the
fifth-biggest source of U.S. oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expatriates hold 13 percent of management positions in
Exxon Mobil&#8217;s local unit, more than the 5 percent stipulated by
Nigerian law, the Pengassan union said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A law signed by President Goodluck Jonathan in April
specifies oil and gas industry jobs and services that must be
reserved for Nigerians. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and credit-
ratings companies lost a bid to throw out lawsuits over the sale
of $2.8 billion of mortgage-backed securities to the Federal
Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania state Judge R. Stanton Wettick Jr. in
Pittsburgh said some claims could proceed against JPMorgan and
ratings companies Moody&#8217;s Corp., Fitch Group Inc. and McGraw-
Hill Cos., which owns Standard  Poor&#8217;s Financial Services LLC,
according to a Nov. 29 court order. The judge dismissed other
claims against the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are very pleased with the judge&#8217;s ruling and we look
forward to stating our viewpoints as the case goes forward in
court,&#8221; Neil Cotiaux, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan
Bank of Pittsburgh, said today in a phone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision affects four lawsuits filed by Federal Home
Loan Bank over the purchase of mortgage-backed securities,
according to the judge&#8217;s ruling. The bank claims it wouldn&#8217;t
have bought the bonds if JPMorgan, which sold them, and the
ratings companies &#8220;had provided complete and accurate
information regarding the risks of nonpayment,&#8221; the judge said
in his description of the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defendants in the cases are the three ratings
companies, JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Countrywide
Financial unit, according to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana Yealy, general counsel for the Federal Home Loan Bank
of Pittsburgh, said in a phone interview that the bank spent
$2.8 billion for the mortgage-backed securities involved in the
four cases. He declined to comment about their value now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the lawsuits involves $1.7 billion of mortgage-
backed securities bought by the Federal Home Loan Bank from May
2006 to December 2007, the judge wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Predictions&#8217; Protected &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re pleased that the court has dismissed all but one of
the claims against SP,&#8221; Ed Sweeney, a spokesman for the
company, said today in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;In doing so, the
court has reaffirmed the protection afforded to ratings because
they are predictions about future creditworthiness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The remaining claim against SP is &#8220;without any factual or
legal merit,&#8221; Sweeney said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wettick said the Federal Home Loan Bank&#8217;s fraudulent
misrepresentation claims against the ratings companies could
proceed. The judge dismissed claims against them for negligent
misrepresentation and violations of the Securities Act of 1933,
according to the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation claims were
dismissed against a group of JPMorgan units except J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. Claims based on the Securities Act of 1933 were
dismissed against some JPMorgan units. They can proceed against
the parent company and J.P. Morgan Securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the other ratings companies and JPMorgan didn&#8217;t
immediately return calls seeking comment. Bill Halldin, a Bank
of America spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh v. J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, GD09-016892, Court of Common Pleas of
Allegheny County, Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Wyeth unit
properly warned a Virginia woman&#8217;s doctors about the risks of
its Prempro menopause drug, a jury ruled today in rejecting her
claim for damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jurors in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia,
deliberated about four hours over two days before finding that
Georgia Torkie-Tork couldn&#8217;t show that Wyeth officials
downplayed the breast-cancer risks associated with Prempro, a
hormone-replacement drug. The decision was Wyeth&#8217;s fourth
straight victory in a Prempro suit weighed by a jury. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe the verdict in this case affirms that Wyeth
communicated the risks and benefits of Prempro,&#8221; Chris Loder, a
spokesman for New York-based Pfizer, said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 6 million women took Prempro and related
menopause drugs to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and mood
swings before a 2002 study highlighted their links to cancer.
Wyeth&#8217;s sales of the medicines, which are still on the market,
topped $2 billion before the release of the Women&#8217;s Health
Initiative, a National Institutes of Health-sponsored study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until 1995, many menopausal women combined Premarin,
Wyeth&#8217;s estrogen-based drug, with progestin-laden Provera, made
by Pfizer&#8217;s Upjohn unit, to relieve their symptoms. Wyeth
combined the two hormones in its Prempro pill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zoe Littlepage, one of Torkie-Tork&#8217;s lawyers, didn&#8217;t return
calls for comment on the jury verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Litigation Record &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s Wyeth and Upjohn units have now won seven of the
14 Prempro cases decided by juries since trials began in 2006.
The drugmaker got some of those verdicts thrown out after trial
or had the awards reduced. It resolved some of the verdicts
through settlements, while other decisions are on appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wyeth also has won dismissals of more than 3,000 cases
before trial, according to court filings. Pfizer, the world&#8217;s
largest drugmaker, completed its $68 billion purchase of Wyeth
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevada&#8217;s Supreme Court last week upheld a $57.6 million
jury award to three women who alleged Prempro caused their
cancers. That award included $35 million in punitive damages the
panel handed down in 2007 over Wyeth officials&#8217; mishandling of
the drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torkie-Tork, 65, took Prempro for at least three years
before being diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002, her lawyers
contended in court papers. The Reston, Virginia, resident works
at a Starbucks Corp. coffeehouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Records Destroyed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer&#8217;s lawyers argued that Torkie-Tork couldn&#8217;t prove she
and her doctors received inadequate warnings about Prempro&#8217;s
cancer risks because she couldn&#8217;t show which of her doctors
prescribed the menopause drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence in the case showed that some of her physicians
destroyed their records as part of normal business practices and
couldn&#8217;t remember prescribing the drug for the woman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Torkie-Tork v. Wyeth, 04-cv-945, U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia (Alexandria). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's rare that a technological innovation creates debate both in the Anthony household and among my colleagues, but Microsoft's Kinect had done just that. The core issue: did Microsoft over-stretch in its effort to transform the gaming market?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who haven't seen the ubiquitous commercials, Kinect is a new way to interface with Microsoft's Xbox video game console. Instead of a traditional controller, Kinect uses a range of motion sensing technology to allow motions like arm waves, kicks, and jumps to control the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft hopes the $150 device one-ups Nintendo, which created a new market of gamers with its simple-to-use Wii system and console. Nintendo's strategy substantially changed the video gaming market and created billions of dollars of profits for the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife saw a commercial for Kinect, and said, "I assume you'll want that for Christmas." 
Later that week, a colleague who knows that I've written extensively (and, largely positively) about the Wii said, "I assume you are a big fan of the Kinect."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the questioner was surprised by my ambivalence. I told them that I absolutely loved what Microsoft was trying to do, and I have little doubt that motion-based interfaces will open up amazing new applications in the coming years. But I'm worried that Kinect isn't quite ready to pass the Charlie test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Charlie test involves giving a new technology to a child under the age of four, and seeing if they can start using it within a minute. When my son Charlie was two, the gap between him first holding the Wii remote and playing baseball was about three seconds. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple's iPad passed the Charlie test as well; my two-year-old daughter Holly very quickly figured out how to use the device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over the weekend Charlie (who is now five) and I wandered over to the Kinect demonstration unit at Selfridges department store on Oxford Street in London to try out bowling. The screen told him to move to the left. Then back. Then left again. Then he had to raise his hand. I had to explain to him how to pick up the ball. I could see his frustration growing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, this was an in-store demonstration unit, and I think the odds remain high that Kinect will be under my tree. But I suspect that Kinect will only be a true breakout hit if it turns out that it can in fact pass the Charlie test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Microsoft could have explored a different commercialization strategy. Maybe it could have positioned the first generation Kinect as something for hard core gamers who don't mind dealing with quirky interfaces before introducing a more streamlined version for the mass market. The risk in trying to introduce a revolutionary technology in the mass market is that Microsoft could potentially poison the market, limiting Kinect's long-term potential. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have little doubt that Microsoft is on to something huge with motion as a transformational way to interact with games, data, and a whole range of other applications. However, I think there might just be enough rough edges around Kinect that it might not live up to the hype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Co. named Ben Sherwood
president of ABC News to replace David Westin, who announced in
September he would step down at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood, 46, will oversee editorial, programming and
digital operations at ABC&#8217;s global news business, including
broadcast TV, radio and the Internet, Burbank, California-based
Disney said today in an e-mailed statement. He will report to
Anne Sweeney, president of the Disney/ABC Television Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney cited Sherwood&#8217;s entrepreneurial background. In
addition to working previously at ABC and NBC news, Sherwood is
a novelist whose works include &#8220;The Death and Life of Charlie
St. Cloud,&#8221; which became a film. In 2009, he founded
TheSurvivorsClub.org for people coping with disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, gained 1 cent to
$37.35 at 12:08 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares had gained 16 percent this year before
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC announced a restructuring of the news workforce in
February, increasing its reliance on freelance journalists and
requiring staffers shoot and edit more of their own material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sherwood, a graduate of Harvard College and a Rhodes
Scholar, began his journalism career with internships at KCET in
Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Times Washington bureau and &#8220;CBS
Evening News&#8221; in New York, Disney said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners LLC, the buyout
arm of JPMorgan Chase  Co., plans to sell U.S. carbon black
manufacturer Columbian Chemicals Co., said two people with
direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s Aditya Birla Group is among potential bidders for
the world&#8217;s third-largest maker of the material used in tires
and synthetic rubber, said one of the people, declining to be
identified because the matter is confidential. A transaction may
be valued at more than $500 million, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbian Chemicals, based in Marietta, Georgia, may
compete for bidders with the carbon black unit of Germany&#8217;s
Evonik Industries AG. Billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla&#8217;s company
and India&#8217;s Phillips Carbon Black Ltd. are considering making
offers for Evonik, the world&#8217;s No. 2 maker of carbon black, in a
deal likely to be valued at more than $700 million, two people
familiar with the matter said earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pragnya Ram, a Birla Group spokeswoman in Mumbai, declined
to comment on &#8220;market speculation.&#8221; JPMorgan spokesman Justin Perras also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbian Chemicals is the world&#8217;s third-largest maker of
carbon black behind Cabot Corp. and Evonik, according to a
Standard  Poor&#8217;s report in October. The closely held company
has a market share of about 9 percent, and the three biggest
companies jointly account for about one-third of worldwide
capacity, the ratings company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Columbian Chemicals operates 11 plants in nine countries
including U.S, Canada, Brazil, Germany, Spain, South Korea and
China, according to its website. Carbon black is a material used
to increase durability of tires, paints and plastics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four Nations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Birla Group is the world&#8217;s fourth-largest producer of
carbon black with operations spread across four units including
Alexandria Carbon Black Co. in Egypt; Hi Tech Carbon, a division
of Aditya Birla Nuvo Ltd. in India; Thai Carbon Black Public Co.
in Thailand and Liaoning Birla Carbon Co. in China, according to
its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DC Chemical Co., a South Korean maker of petrochemicals and
solar-power components, and One Equity Partners jointly bought
Columbian Chemicals for about $600 million from Phelps Dodge
Corp. in 2006. One Equity agreed to acquire DC Chemical&#8217;s 67
percent stake for about $150 million in January 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity, established in 2001, manages $8 billion of
investments for New York-based JPMorgan in direct private-equity
transactions, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evonik, which has operations in 12 countries, said its
global production capacity will reach more than 1.4 million
metric tons a year by end of 2010, according to a statement in
June. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Corp. is completing the
cleanup of a crude oil pipeline leak in Salt Lake City,
according to a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company doesn&#8217;t anticipate
any impact from the shutdown of the line on its 49,000-barrel-a-
day Salt Lake City refinery, Mickey Driver said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Today we will be inspecting the leak site with all the
appropriate officials and government agencies,&#8221; Driver said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron workers reported the spill at 11:23 p.m. local time
Dec. 1, Captain Michael Harp of the Salt Lake City Fire
Department said yesterday. Firefighters were able to contain the
fuel before it reached Red Butte Creek, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the second leak in six months on the 10-inch line,
according to Lisa Harrison Smith, a spokeswoman for the mayor&#8217;s
office. The pipe was shut from June 12 to June 21 and the
mayor&#8217;s office reported an estimated 800 barrels of crude
leaked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company doesn&#8217;t have a restart date for the pipeline,
Justin Higgs, another Chevron spokesman, said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro Corp.&#8217;s 58,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Salt Lake
City receives a small volume of crude from the common carrier
Chevron pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tesoro doesn&#8217;t expect any difficulty supplying customers
and meeting contractual obligations while the line is out of
service, Mike Marcy, a Tesoro spokesman, said yesterday. Tesoro
could not immediately be reached for comment today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc., a southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal, agreed to buy Canada&#8217;s
Western Coal Corp. for C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) to add
reserves and boost production of the commodity as prices rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy offered C$11.50 a share in cash or 0.114 of a
Walter Energy share, the companies said today in a joint
statement. The deal, which has unanimous approval from both
boards, follows a Nov. 18 announcement that they were in
exclusive talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mergers and acquisitions in the coal industry are
increasing as demand from steelmakers in China, the biggest
producer of the alloy, drives up prices for the raw material.
Prices for coking, or steelmaking, coal sold to Asia will rise 8
percent next quarter, according to UBS AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do love coking coal,&#8221; said Ian Henderson, who manages
about $7 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. including Western Coal
shares. &#8220;We were long-term investors in this particular
project, but we thought the company was too lowly valued. We are
not expecting anybody else to come in and counter bid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter previously agreed to pay C$630 million for a 19.8
percent stake in Western Coal from largest shareholder Audley
European Opportunities Master Fund Ltd., it said Nov. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Coal soared $1.03, or 10 percent to C$11.33 in
Toronto trading. The stock jumped as much as 51 percent on Nov.
18. Walter Energy rose 84 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $106.44 at
9:48 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer price is a 26 percent premium to the 20-day
average price of Vancouver-based Western Coal through Nov. 17.
That&#8217;s in line with the average premium for coal-industry deals
announced this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The offer price is a decent premium to where it was
trading beforehand,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Henderson said. &#8220;For
shareholders it&#8217;s probably the best that they can get.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising coal consumption has prompted Rio Tinto Group, the
world&#8217;s third-largest mining company, to team up with Aluminum
Corp. of China on coking-coal projects in China. In the U.S.,
Massey Energy Co., the largest coal producer in Central
Appalachia, has received bids from companies including Alpha
Natural Resources Inc., two people with knowledge of the matter
said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The outlook for coking coal is good,&#8221; Richard Knights,
an analyst at Liberum Capital Ltd., said by telephone from
London. &#8220;The big picture is all about China&#8217;s move to become a
net importer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financing Committed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The total amount of cash paid to Western Coal holders is
expected to be about C$2.1 billion, with an estimated 9 million
shares to be issued, according to today&#8217;s statement. Financing
for the offer is fully committed, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a transformative transaction at a time when
global demand for metallurgical coal is surging,&#8221; Joe Leonard,
interim chief executive officer of Tampa, Florida-based Walter
Energy, said in the statement. &#8220;Western Coal has an attractive
high-quality metallurgical coal asset base and has embarked on
an organic growth strategy that is expected to increase
production more than 60 percent by fiscal 2013.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder Audley said other parties, including
steelmakers, were interested in its Western Coal stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Walter is the best match because there were a lot of
synergies, geographically, in terms of customers and
management,&#8221; Julian Treger, managing partner of Audley Capital,
said in an interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s likely the other shareholders will
follow in accepting Walter&#8217;s offer in due course. In the absence
of another alternative I don&#8217;t see why they wouldn&#8217;t approve.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deal Completion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy plans to maintain its listing on the New York
Stock Exchange and will apply to sell shares in Toronto. The
company expects the deal to be completed by the second quarter
of 2011. Morgan Stanley is advising Walter, and RBC Capital
Markets is advising Western Coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With its size and financial strength, the combined
business will have future growth opportunities that neither one
of us would have on our own,&#8221; Keith Calder, president and CEO
of Western Coal, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined entity will have total coal reserves of about
385 million tons and be the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded
&#8220;pure-play&#8221; metallurgical coal producer, according to the
statement. The company expects to produce more than 20 million
tons a year by 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strategically, this kind of fits,&#8221; said Jim Rollyson, an
analyst at Raymond James Financial Inc. in Houston. &#8220;I like it.
They now have access into Asia that they didn&#8217;t have before.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rollyson said barring another global economic setback,
prices for metallurgical coal will remain strong and the
combined company will be poised to benefit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Western Coal will hold a shareholder vote to approve the
transaction, according to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil will advance to $120 a barrel
before the end of 2012 as consumption grows in emerging
economies, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which is
responsible for about 40 percent of global supplies, is unlikely
to increase production in the first half of next year unless
prices surge through $100 a barrel, the bank said in a report
today. Futures traded around $87 a barrel in New York today,
near their highest price in two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Strong emerging oil demand growth over the next 24 months
is very likely to lift the call on OPEC production to levels
last seen at the peak of the oil price spike in 2008,&#8221; analysts
led by Lawrence Eagles in New York said. &#8220;We expect oil
inventories to continue their drawing trend over the first
quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan boosted 2011 price forecasts for oil contracts in
New York and London. West Texas Intermediate on the New York
Mercantile Exchange will average $93 a barrel next year, up 3.6
percent from a previous estimate of $89.75, it said. Brent crude
traded in London will average $95 a barrel next year, up from an
earlier assessment of $91.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank said the North Sea benchmark, used to price two-
thirds of global crude, will average $105 in 2012. It expects
futures to reach $100 a barrel in the first half of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude for next month is trading at a 4-cent premium
to the February future, a price situation known as backwardation
that suggests immediate supplies are more in demand than later
deliveries. This is a &#8220;structure that is likely to remain in
place for much of 2011 and 2012,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy Inc., a southern
Appalachia producer of steelmaking coal, is the &#8220;best match&#8221;
for Canada&#8217;s Western Coal Corp., according to Julian Treger,
managing partner of Audley Capital Advisors LLP. Treger spoke in
a phone interview from London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There were several interested parties; some were coal,
some were steel producers. They were very close and very keen to
make a bid. They didn&#8217;t publicly make a competitive bid. Walter
is the best match because there were a lot of synergies,
geographically in terms of customers and management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s likely the other shareholders will follow in
accepting Walter&#8217;s offer in due course. In the absence of
another alternative, I don&#8217;t see why they wouldn&#8217;t approve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It will be very accretive to Walter earnings and its
shares will reflect that. And Western shareholders can capture
benefits by owning Walter shares. I expect every Western
shareholder, including us, will opt for the Walter shares
because the shares will be worth about C$12, more than the cash
offer of C$11.50. But Walter offers only about 30 percent of the
transaction as shares and the rest as cash, so we&#8217;ll likely end
up with no more than 30 percent of our share.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The timetable for the whole deal to be completed is about
three months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Russia will balance its budget next
year, four years earlier than the government estimates, and post
a surplus in 2012 as oil prices &#8220;move sharply higher,&#8221; Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economy of the world&#8217;s biggest energy supplier will
grow 5.3 percent next year and 5.6 percent in 2012, Clemens Grafe, a Moscow-based economist at Goldman Sachs, said today in
an e-mailed report. Annual inflation will accelerate to 8.7
percent by July before slowing to 7 percent in the second half,
the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect Russia to see a year of two halves,&#8221; Grafe
wrote. &#8220;The key game changers in the course of the year will be
higher oil prices, some clarification on hydrocarbon policies
and eventually more clarity on the future political
leadership.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil futures traded in New York will average $100 a barrel
next year and $110 a barrel in 2012, according to Goldman. Oil
for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose as
much as 33 cents to $88.33, the highest price since Nov. 11, on
speculation U.S. fuel demand will increase as the economic
recovery gathers pace in the world&#8217;s biggest oil consumer. The
January contract closed at $88 a barrel yesterday, the highest
since October 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget Deficit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian government expects the budget to remain in
deficit through 2014 based on an average price for Urals crude,
Russia&#8217;s chief export blend, of $75 a barrel this year and 2011
and $78 in 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia&#8217;s budget deficit was 5.9 percent of gross domestic
product last year, it&#8217;s first since 1999. The shortfall will
narrow to about 4.6 percent this year, according to Finance
Minister Alexei Kudrin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annual inflation will probably slow to between 6.5 percent
and 7 percent next year, Deputy Economy Minister Andrei Klepach
said Nov. 30 in an interview in London. He also forecast a
&#8220;slight acceleration&#8221; in the pace of economic growth to as
much as 4.2 percent in 2011 from about 3.8 percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural gas account for about 25 percent of
Russia&#8217;s GDP, according to Kudrin. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Bernard
Madoff&#8217;s &#8220;primary banker,&#8221; was sued for $6.4 billion by the
trustee liquidating the imprisoned con man&#8217;s former firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Irving H. Picard, the lawyer appointed as trustee by a New
York bankruptcy court, said in a statement that he sued JPMorgan
yesterday over claims the bank aided and abetted Madoff&#8217;s fraud.
Picard said his suit seeks $1 billion in fees and $5.4 billion
in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan was willfully blind to the fraud, even after
learning about numerous red flags surrounding Madoff,&#8221; David J.
Sheehan,&#8217;&#8217; counsel to Picard, said in the statement. &#8220;JPMC was
at the very center of that fraud, and thoroughly complicit in
it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any money recovered from JPMorgan will be returned to
Madoff&#8217;s victims on a pro rata basis, said Picard, who has so
far recovered about $1.5 billion for Madoff creditors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The complaint filed today by the trustee for the Madoff
estate blatantly distorts both the facts and the law in an
attempt to grab headlines,&#8221; JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S.
bank, said in a statement. &#8220;JPMorgan did not know about or in
any way assist in the fraud orchestrated by Bernard Madoff.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, based in New York, said it has assisted Picard in
his investigation of Madoff&#8217;s firm and called his claims
&#8220;irresponsible and over-reaching.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed under seal in U.S. Bankruptcy Court
in Manhattan, according to Picard&#8217;s statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan &#8220;has designated virtually all of their
information as confidential,&#8221; Picard said. &#8220;We intend to move
to have the complaint made public as soon as possible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit is the second-biggest filed by Picard in the
Madoff bankruptcy, after a $7.2 billion claim he filed against
investor Jeffry Picower in May 2009. Picower died in October
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co., 10-ap-4932,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gundlach&#8217;s DoubleLine Trust Faces New Lawsuit by TCW &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A trust created by DoubleLine Capital LP&#8217;s Jeffrey
Gundlach was sued by TCW Group Inc., which already sued its
former investment chief after he brought more than half of its
fixed-income professionals to his new firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DoubleLine Funds Trust was started to market DoubleLine
Capital&#8217;s mutual funds and to &#8220;generate fees and profit for
Gundlach and the money management firm he had formed,&#8221; TCW said
in a new complaint filed Nov. 1 in state court in Los Angeles.
TCW provided a copy of the complaint to Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, a Los Angeles-based money management firm, accuses the
trust and its trustees of misappropriation of trade secrets and
unfair competition, among other allegations, and seeks
unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jeffrey Gundlach and his co-conspirators built a business
based on the wholesale theft of huge amounts of TCW&#8217;s
proprietary data and analytical systems, and that business
includes DoubleLine Funds Trust,&#8221; Steve Madison, a lawyer for
TCW, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;When DoubleLine
Funds was launched last spring, TCW notified the funds and their
trustees of TCW&#8217;s intent to name the trust as a defendant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TCW, a unit of Societe Generale, in January accused
Gundlach and several former employees who joined DoubleLine of
breach of fiduciary duty, unfair competition and
misappropriation of confidential information and demanded more
than $200 million in damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;TCW has made false claims against DoubleLine for 11
months,&#8221; Lew Phelps, a spokesman for DoubleLine, said
yesterday. &#8220;Their case is going not at all well. This latest
legal action by TCW is redundant and meaningless.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Trust Company of the West v. DoubleLine Funds
Trust, BC450413, Los Angeles County Superior Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypercom Sued Over $485 Million VeriFone Bid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypercom Corp., the maker of electronic-payment software
being acquired by VeriFone Systems Inc. for $485 million, was
sued in Delaware Chancery Court by an investor who contends the
shares are undervalued in the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies said in a Nov. 17 statement that Hypercom
shareholders will receive 0.23 share of VeriFone stock for each
of their shares, or about $7.32 a share -- a 19 percent premium
at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The offer price reflects an inadequate premium to the
trading price of the company&#8217;s common stock given that Hypercom
continues to have record revenue growth,&#8221; said shareholder Chad
Small in a complaint filed yesterday in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;San Jose, California-based VeriFone, with $844.7 million in
revenue for fiscal 2009, said it&#8217;s buying Hypercom, based in
Scottsdale, Arizona, to help expand in European markets.
Hypercom reported $406.9 million in 2009 sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small asks a judge to grant the lawsuit class or group
status, on behalf of outside shareholders, and to halt the
transaction as structured, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypercom spokesman Pete Schuddekopf didn&#8217;t immediately
return voice and e-mail messages seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Small v. Hypercom, CA6031, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infineon Sued for Damages by Qimonda Administrator (Update1) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infineon Technologies AG was sued by the insolvency
administrator of Qimonda AG who filed an action in a Munich
court seeking a liability judgment for an unspecified amount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit asserts Infineon made a filing mistake when
transferring its memory business to a shell company that was to
become Qimonda. The administrator, Michael Jaffe, seeks a
judgment that Infineon needs to refund the difference between
Qimonda&#8217;s assets and its capital at the time insolvency
proceedings began, Infineon said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Infineon regards the action as without merit,&#8221; the
company said. &#8220;The contribution of the memory business to
Qimonda was carried out in compliance with all requirements.
Infineon intends to defend itself vigorously against this action
through all stages of the proceedings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qimonda filed for insolvency in 2009 after being hurt by
sliding memory-chip prices. Infineon completed an initial public
offering of Qimonda in August 2006 to reduce its dependence on
businesses with volatile demand and prices. Infineon was itself
a unit of Siemens AG, Europe&#8217;s largest engineering company,
until an IPO in March 2000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munich Regional Court spokesman Tobias Pichlmaier confirmed
the suit was filed yesterday. Sebastian Brunner, a spokesman for
Jaffe didn&#8217;t immediately return a call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is LG Muenchen, 3 O 22476/10. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey&#8217;s Blankenship Must Face Mine Widows&#8217; Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massey Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Don Blankenship
must face two lawsuits holding him personally responsible for a
West Virginia mine explosion that killed 29 people, a judge
ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widows of William Griffith and Ronald Maynor, who were
killed in the April 5 blast at Massey&#8217;s Performance Coal unit,
claim the Richmond, Virginia-based company and Blankenship were
responsible for violations of federal and state safety
regulations that led to the explosion. The CEO was &#8220;willfully
negligent&#8221; in his direction of the company subsidiaries
operating the mine, they said in separate complaints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blankenship asked to be dismissed from the lawsuits,
contending they failed to state a valid claim. West Virginia
Circuit Court Judge William Thompson denied the motion in a Nov.
24 order. He didn&#8217;t rule on the merits of the widows&#8217; claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Plaintiff&#8217;s complaint provides fair notice to defendant
Blankenship of the plaintiff&#8217;s claim made against him, one that
states a valid claim under West Virginia law,&#8221; Thompson wrote
in his order in the Maynor case. He entered an identical
decision in the Griffith suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosion at Performance Coal&#8217;s Upper Big Branch
operation in Montcoal, West Virginia, the worst U.S. mine
disaster in 40 years, set off federal and state investigations
into its cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuits were filed by Marlene Griffith, the widow of
William Griffith, 54, who had worked at the mine since 1992, and
Helen Maynor, widow of Ronald Maynor, 31, who started there in
2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claims against the Massey CEO are &#8220;a judicial lynching
of Don Blankenship,&#8221; his lawyer, Thomas Flaherty, said at an
Oct. 20 hearing on the motion to dismiss the lawsuits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flaherty and Jeff Gillenwater, Massey spokesman, didn&#8217;t
return calls yesterday for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are Griffith v. Performance Coal Co., 10-C-91,
and Maynor v. Performance Coal Co., 10-C-122, Circuit Court,
Boone County, West Virginia (Madison). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensco Asks Judge to Reinstate Claim Over Drilling Ban &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensco Offshore Co. asked a judge to revive its challenge to
the Obama administration&#8217;s deep-water oil drilling rules,
claiming regulators are preventing rigs from returning to work
even after lifting a ban in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;None of the work that was being done by the 33 rigs
suspended when the initial moratorium was issued has been
allowed to resume, no permits for previously suspended
activities have been issued, and there are no indications that
defendants will unfreeze the permit process in the near
future,&#8221; Ensco said in a Nov. 30 court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensco asked U.S. District Judge Martin Feldman of New
Orleans to reinstate dismissed claims and enjoin the government
from enforcing the drilling moratorium &#8220;by any means.&#8221; Ensco
also asked the judge to require regulators to act within 30 days
on all pending applications for permits to drill in waters
deeper than 500 feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration initially banned deep-water
drilling in May, after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded while
drilling for BP Plc off the Louisiana coast. Interior Secretary
Kenneth Salazar said regulators needed time to study
improvements to drilling safety and spill containment after the
worst offshore oil spill in U.S. history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensco lawyer George Fowler didn&#8217;t immediately respond to
requests for comment. Kendra Barkoff, Salazar&#8217;s spokeswoman,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ensco Offshore Co. v. Salazar, 2:10-cv-01941,
U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Louisiana (New
Orleans). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. May Appeal Sugar Beet Crop Destruction Order &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. may appeal a court order requiring the destruction
of sugar beet crops engineered to be resistant to Monsanto
Co.&#8217;s herbicide Roundup, according to a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department said it is seeking the
Solicitor General&#8217;s permission to appeal a Dec. 1 order by a San
Francisco federal judge in a lawsuit brought by organic farmers
and a food safety group. U.S. District Judge Jeffrey White found
that &#8220;plaintiffs have made a strong showing that they and the
environment are likely to suffer irreparable harm if this court
does not issue an injunction.&#8221; He put his order on hold to
allow an appeal to be filed by Dec. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of seeds engineered to resist St. Louis-based
Monsanto&#8217;s weed killer was deregulated by the Bush
administration&#8217;s U.S. Agriculture Department five years ago,
according to court filings. Today more than 90 percent of the
U.S. sugar beet crop comes from the genetically engineered
seeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Center for Food Safety v. Schafer, 3:08-
cv-0484, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Post May Lose Bid to Block Belgian Post Aid &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Post AG should lose its bid to block 297.5 million
euros ($391 million) in state aid to Belgium&#8217;s La Poste SA, an
adviser to the European Union&#8217;s top court said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A ruling in favor of Deutsche Post last year &#8220;should be
canceled&#8221; and the challenge &#8220;be declared inadmissible,&#8221;
Advocate General Niilo Jaeaeskinen of the EU&#8217;s Court of Justice
said in a non-binding opinion yesterday. The Luxembourg-based
court follows such advice in a majority of cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Belgium appealed after Deutsche Post, the world&#8217;s biggest
transporter of air and sea freight by volume, won a lower-court
ruling to annul EU backing for the aid. The February 2009 ruling
triggered an in-depth review by the European Commission, the 27
nation EU&#8217;s antitrust regulator, into all state aid received by
Belgium&#8217;s state-controlled postal service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is one of the hurdles La Poste has to clear before
it can proceed with a planned initial public offering. CVC
Capital Partners Ltd., which owns almost 50 percent of La Poste,
in June hired JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Nomura Holdings Inc. to
advise on a possible stock sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Post sued the commission in November 2003 after
the regulator approved the capital injection by the Belgian
government. A ruling by the court usually follows within six
months after an opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Post must study the reasoning of the advocate
general before it can comment, Uwe Bensien, a spokesman for the
company, said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is C-148/09 P, Belgium v Deutsche Post and Others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-UBS Municipal-Bond Banker Charged in Bid-Rig Probe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former co-head of UBS AG&#8217;s municipal-derivatives group
was arrested on a fraud charge connected to a nationwide bid-
rigging probe of contracts used by states and local governments
to invest municipal-bond proceeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peter Ghavami, a Belgian national living in Moscow, was
charged with one count of wire fraud in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan after being arrested Dec. 1 at a New York airport.
Ghavami worked at UBS from 1999 until 2007, according to records
filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. He ran a
sham auction of a municipal investment contract in exchange for
a $100,000 kickback, according to a federal complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pernicious fraud schemes like the one alleged in this
complaint undermine the public&#8217;s confidence and trust in the
municipal bond and derivatives markets,&#8221; Christine Varney, the
head of the Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division, said
yesterday in a statement posted on its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conspiracy included more than 200 deals involving state
agencies, local governments and nonprofits across the country,
according to documents filed in federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At his arraignment yesterday, Ghavami didn&#8217;t enter a plea
and is being held, according to Alisa Finelli, a Justice
Department spokeswoman. She said he is due back in court Jan. 3. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Mitchell, a lawyer with Stillman, Friedman 
Shechtman representing Ghavami, didn&#8217;t return a call to his
office after regular business hours seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly Smith, a UBS spokeswoman in New York, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perelman Owes Ex-Wife Barkin&#8217;s Company $4.3 Million &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire Ronald Perelman must pay $4.3 million to his
ex-wife Ellen Barkin&#8217;s Applehead Pictures LLC after reneging on
an agreement to invest in the film production company, a New
York appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barkin, an actress who starred in &#8220;Palindromes&#8221; (2004)
and &#8220;The Big Easy&#8221; (1987), founded New York-based Applehead
Pictures with her brother George Barkin in November 2005. The
decision by the Appellate Division, First Department affirmed a
trial court&#8217;s January ruling on the 2007 suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perelman, the chairman of cosmetics maker Revlon Inc.,
agreed to make capital contributions to Applehead Pictures in
2006 and 2007, totaling $3.4 million, according to the decision.
Perelman didn&#8217;t approve of Barkin&#8217;s acting career, and they
agreed the company would let her continue working in film, the
decision said. The couple married in 2000 and entered into a
separation agreement and divorce in February 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The primary issue presented is whether two separately
executed agreements -- a marital separation agreement and a
business operating agreement -- can be deemed to be one
integrated contract,&#8221; Justice Eugene Nardelli wrote in the
unanimous opinion. &#8220;We hold in the negative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court rejected Perelman&#8217;s argument that Barkin&#8217;s
alleged breaches of the separation agreement relieved him of his
obligations in the business agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an unfortunate decision,&#8221; Christine Taylor, a
spokeswoman for Perelman, said in an e-mail. &#8220;We still maintain
Ms. Barkin should not be entitled to any additional money beyond
the enormous settlement she received five years ago. She said
Perelman had &#8216;&#8216;moved on&#8217;&#8217; and left it to his attorneys to handle
the &#8216;&#8216;still-pending claims against Ms. Barkin and others based
on their misconduct in managing and controlling Applehead
Pictures.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perelman had countersued in New York state Supreme Court,
alleging Barkin misappropriated Applehead funds to finance
personal expenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York attorney Jacob Buchdahl, who represents Applehead,
said his clients were &#8216;&#8216;thrilled&#8217;&#8217; with the appeals court
decision. The $4.3 million award includes more than $900,000 in
interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Applehead Pictures LLC v. Ronald O. Perelman,
602606/2007, New York Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tyco Ex-CEO Kozlowski Can&#8217;t Get Benefits, Court Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Tyco International Ltd. Chief Executive Officer L.
Dennis Kozlowski, imprisoned for stealing from the company,
can&#8217;t collect tens of millions of dollars in benefits he claims
Tyco owes him, a judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Thomas P. Griesa in New York ruled Nov.
1 that Kozlowski&#8217;s 2005 state-court conviction on 22 criminal
counts shows that he was disloyal to Tyco and isn&#8217;t entitled to
any pay he claims he earned from September 1995 to June 2002,
when he was forced out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;&#8216;Kozlowski&#8217;s multiple breaches of his fiduciary duty over
several years clearly demonstrate his faithless service,&#8221;
Griesa wrote. &#8220;Kozlowski must therefore forfeit all
compensation and benefits, deferred or otherwise, earned during
his period of disloyalty.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling comes in a suit Tyco filed against Kozlowski in
2002. Griesa ruled in favor of several Tyco claims before trial,
while dismissing all of Kozlowski&#8217;s counterclaims for pay and
benefits after 1995. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of October 2008, the value of Kozlowski&#8217;s retirement
account was $75.9 million, according to court papers in the
suit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kozlowski and former Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz
were convicted in 2005 of securities fraud, grand larceny and
falsifying business records. A jury in New York State Supreme
Court found they stole about $137 million from Tyco through
unauthorized bonuses and the abuse of company loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kozlowski was sentenced to a prison term of eight years and
four months to 25 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Tyco v. Kozlowski, 02-cv-07317, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RBS Cleared by U.K. FSA in Probe of Taxpayer Bailout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and former executives,
including ex-Chief Executive Officer Fred Goodwin, were cleared
by U.K. regulators in a report that faulted the bank for &#8220;a
series of bad decisions&#8221; before the financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Services Authority said it won&#8217;t take
any enforcement action and has closed the probe into conduct by
RBS executives, the acquisition of ABN Amro Holding NV in 2007
and a 2008 rights offering, the regulator said in a statement
yesterday. The FSA didn&#8217;t publish the contents of the review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The review confirmed that RBS made a series of bad
decisions in the years immediately before the financial
crisis,&#8221; the FSA said. &#8220;The review concluded that these bad
decisions were not the result of a lack of integrity by any
individual and we did not identify any instances of fraud or
dishonest activity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is unacceptable to suggest that the behavior of the
management in this iconic U.K. bank did not &#8216;lack integrity&#8217;
when they brought RBS to its knees,&#8221; Rob MacGregor, a national
officer at Unite, said in an e-mailed statement. &#8220;By failing to
bring any formal charges against the RBS executives they have
allowed some of the biggest villains of the financial crisis to
go on enjoying their millionaire lifestyles.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Strachan, a spokesman for the bank, said it
welcomed the conclusion of the review. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grandi, based in Milan, will report to Eva Lindholm, head

makers, including the ECB, to prevent any systemic event is
unquestionable,&#8221;Dirk Schumacher, an economist in Frankfurt,
wrote in a research report dated yesterday. &#8220;We could easily
see the ECB stepping up its bond purchases aggressively if
things do not start to normalize.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs pushed back its forecast for the first
increase in the ECB&#8217;s main rate to the fourth quarter of next
year from the third quarter &#8220;on the back of renewed tensions
and the ECB&#8217;s resolve to tackle these,&#8221; analysts including
Schumacher wrote in the note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Maritime Union of Australia said
concerns that worker safety is inadequate at Chevron Corp.&#8217;s
A$43 billion ($42 billion) Gorgon gas project may halt
construction if the issue isn&#8217;t resolved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The union wants a &#8220;safety audit&#8221; of contractor Royal
Boskalis Westminster NV&#8217;s cranes and equipment at the site off
Australia&#8217;s northwest coast, it said in an e-mailed statement
today. The organization represents about 12,000 Australian
workers, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron and partners Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc agreed last year to proceed with the Gorgon liquefied
natural gas venture, Australia&#8217;s largest resources investment,
to gain from increasing Asian demand for the fuel. Gorgon is
among Australian resources developments competing for workers as
a looming skills shortage confronts the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s not about money -- it&#8217;s about safety concerns around
high-risk work and high-risk machinery,&#8221; Chris Cain, the
union&#8217;s Western Australia secretary, said by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicole Hodgson, a Chevron spokeswoman in Perth, and Guy Houston, a company spokesman also based in Perth, didn&#8217;t
immediately return phone calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor disputes in Western Australia have disrupted
construction of the A$14 billion Pluto LNG project operated by
Woodside Petroleum Ltd., the country&#8217;s second-largest oil and
gas producer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PT Pertamina and Exxon Mobil Corp.,
the largest U.S. oil company, signed an agreement today to
jointly develop the Natuna D-Alpha natural gas block in
Indonesia, officials said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first step for the development of Natuna,&#8221;
Karen Agustiawan, president director of Pertamina, told
reporters in Jakarta. &#8220;With this signing, hopefully we can
immediately start the project.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jakarta-based Pertamina is in final talks with other
potential partners and expects to sign similar deals next week,
Mochamad Harun, a spokesman at the state-owned oil and gas
company, said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision on the partners may help Indonesia to speed up
the development of the project, which had been delayed after the
government canceled Exxon&#8217;s drilling rights in October 2006,
saying the company failed to provide a feasibility study. Irving,
Texas-based Exxon, which previously held a 76 percent stake,
denied the claim. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pertamina has shortlisted six other potential partners for
the Natuna block including Chevron Corp., Total SA and Royal
Dutch Shell Plc, Edy Hermantoro, a director at the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources, said in July. Indonesia expects
gas production from Natuna, off the western coast of Borneo
island, to start in 2018, Hermantoro said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natuna, discovered in 1973, is estimated to hold 46
trillion cubic feet of the fuel, according to estimates by
Pertamina. That&#8217;s about 41 percent of the country&#8217;s reserves of
112.5 trillion cubic feet as of the end of 2009, based on the BP
Statistical Review of World Energy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiger Woods tops the leaderboard by
four strokes entering the final round of the Chevron World
Challenge in Thousand Oaks, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods, who hasn&#8217;t won a tournament in 2010, shot a four-

&lt;p&gt;Woods has won the Chevron World Challenge four times. It&#8217;s
an unofficial tournament with a field of 18 players selected
from the top 50 in world rankings and has a top prize of $1.2
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods last victory was 13 months ago at the Australian

&lt;p&gt;Tiger Woods tops the leaderboard by
four strokes going into the third round of the Chevron World
Challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s former No. 1 golfer yesterday shot a six-under
66 to put himself at 13-under 131 at Sherwood Country Club in
Thousand Oaks, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s ten par-5s so far and I&#8217;ve played them 10-under,
so that&#8217;s pretty good,&#8221; Woods said. &#8220;(Today) is the same game
plan, just go out there and plot my way along and take care of
the par-5s.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet to win in 2010, Woods had his best 36-hole start of the
year. Behind him is U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell at nine-
under 135 and Luke Donald with an eight-under 136. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I like this golf course,&#8221; McDowell said. &#8220;I love the
way the greens set up here, and you feel like you can make those
eight-, ten-footers, the greens are so pure here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods is a four-time winner at the Chevron World Challenge,

&lt;p&gt;Graeme McDowell beat Tiger Woods in
the first playoff in the 12-year history of golf&#8217;s Chevron World
Challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods failed to end his 13-month winless run, his longest
as a professional golfer, after giving up a four-shot overnight
lead at Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woods sank a two-foot putt on the final hole of regulation
play to tie McDowell at 16-under and force extra holes after the
U.S. Open champion made a birdie from about 25 feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;McDowell then birdied  the first extra hole to claim the
title from four-time winner Woods, whose charitable foundation
hosts the tournament. &lt;/p&gt;
