<p>''''Wall-E,'''' the movie about a trash-compacting robot, may end a slide in U.S. box-office sales for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS) and its Pixar animation studio. </p>
<p>The film, opening in about 4,000 theaters today, probably
will exceed Pixar''s 2007 release ''''Ratatouille,'''' which garnered
$47 million in its first weekend, according to Steve Mason, an
analyst in Los Angeles at FantasyMoguls.com, a box-office Web
site. He estimated weekend sales of $55 million. </p>
<p>Disney, which bought Pixar in 2006, needs a hit to climb
from last place among the largest studios in 2008 U.S. sales.
''''The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian'''' missed Box Office
Mojo LLC''s $86.9 million estimate last month, taking in $55
million in its opening weekend. Through June 22, Disney''s
domestic ticket sales dropped 36 percent to $457.4 million,
according to the Burbank, California-based film tracker. </p>
<p>''''`Wall-E'' translates well around the world because of the
physical comedy and emotional aspects,'''' Mark Zoradi, president
of Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures Group, said in an
interview. ''''Nothing binds it to the United States. It''s a
creative project that will work in 100 countries around the
world.'''' </p>
<p>The movie from ''''Finding Nemo'''' creator Andrew Stanton
follows Wall-E, short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class, who clears garbage left by humans who fled the planet to
live on space ships. He falls in love with another robot, Eve,
the Extra-terrestrial Vegetation Evaluator sent to Earth to look
for signs of life. </p>
<p>`Love Story'' </p>
<p>The film may take in as much as $210 million in ticket
sales during its U.S. run, said David Joyce, an analyst at
Miller Tabak  Co. in New York, who recommends shares of
Burbank, California-based Disney and doesn''t own them. That
would pass the $206 million of ''''Ratatouille,'''' according to
Internet Movie Database Inc., a unit of Amazon.com Inc. that
provides film data. </p>
<p>''''`Wall-E'' boasts the best love story I''ve seen in 2008,''''
said Gitesh Pandya, editor of industry newsletter
BoxOfficeGuru.com in New York. ''''Word of mouth will be terrific
with all ages and this will last a long time.'''' </p>
<p>Disney, the second-largest U.S. media company, rose 4 cents
to $31.57 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares have slipped 2.2 percent this year, compared
with a 13 percent drop in the SP 500 Index. </p>
<h2>2003 Peak </h2>
<p>Since 2003''s ''''Finding Nemo,'''' the No. 2 animated film of
all time according to Box Office Mojo, each Pixar release has
produced lower U.S. box-office sales, a benchmark for subsequent
sales of DVDs and television revenue. </p>
<p>''''U.S. box office is the most important factor in
anticipating all the other ancillary revenue streams,'''' said
David Davis, founder of Arpeggio Partners LLC, a Santa Monica,
California-based consultant to Hollywood studios. ''''It''s not the
only factor, but it''s the best indicator.'''' </p>
<p>U.S. box-office sales for Pixar, which Disney bought for
$8.06 billion, peaked in 2003 with ''''Finding Nemo,'''' which was
produced for $94 million and took in $340 million, according to
Internet Movie Database. ''''Ratatouille'''' cost $150 million,
while ''''Wall-E'''' cost $120 million, IMDB said. </p>
<p>''''The jury is still out'''' on the Pixar purchase, said Tuna Amobi, an analyst at Standard  Poor''s in New York who
recommends Disney shares and doesn''t own them. ''''It was a hefty
price, no doubt about it. Disney is looking at it as a marathon,
not a sprint.'''' </p>
<h2>Fewer Films </h2>
<p>Since buying Pixar, Disney has cut film production overall,
betting it could boost profit by making fewer, more popular
movies. Last year, filmed entertainment generated profit of $1.2
billion, a sixfold increase over two years, on slightly lower
sales of $7.49 billion. </p>
<p>The company produced 13 films last year, down from 17 in
2005, and will release 11 in 2008. </p>
<p>This year is proving tougher. Through the first half of
fiscal 2008, studio profit rose 6.5 percent to $891 million,
while sales gained 6.7 percent to $4.46 billion. For the year
ending in September, the unit''s profit is likely to fall 1
percent to $1.19 billion, as sales dip 1.8 percent to $7.36
billion, according to Michael Nathanson, an analyst with Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co. in New York. </p>
<p>Robert Iger, Disney''s chief executive officer, said last
month at an investor conference that Hollywood makes too many
movies. </p>
<p>''''It shouldn''t surprise anybody in the business why there
is so much failure and why the returns on investment are so
modest,'''' Iger said. </p>
<p>The following table ranks Pixar movies by their worldwide
box-office sales. Figures are in millions of dollars. </p>
