<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s plan to
offer clients up to $1.5 billion in Facebook Inc. equity may
invite U.S. regulators to take a closer look at whether the
owner of the world''s most popular social-networking site is
circumventing disclosure rules, securities lawyers said. </p>
<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission, whose rules require
any company with more than 499 investors to disclose financial
information, is already scrutinizing the market for trading
shares of closely held companies including Facebook, according
to a person familiar with the inquiry, who declined to be
identified because the matter isn''t public. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs invested $450 million in Facebook and is
planning to create a special purpose vehicle for its clients to
make additional investments worth as much as $1.5 billion,
according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the deal is private. Some private
companies avoid crossing the disclosure threshold when
investors'' funds are channeled through a single entity, such as
a private equity firm or hedge fund. </p>
<p>The real question is, what are the details of this
special purpose vehicle? said James Angel, a finance professor
at Georgetown University''s business school in Washington. If the
investment is designed to circumvent the rule, the SEC should
be looking very closely at it. </p>
<p>The investment and the plans for the special purpose
vehicle were previously reported by the New York Times. </p>
<p>SEC Request </p>
<p>Further public confirmation of the SEC''s interest in such
investment funds came yesterday when SecondMarket Inc., which
matches buyers and sellers of shares in private companies such
as Facebook and Twitter Inc., received a request for
information from the agency. </p>
<p>We have now received a voluntary request for information
from the SEC regarding pre-IPO pooled investment funds,'' 
said Mark D. Murphy, a spokesman for the New York-based broker-
dealer. We are fully cooperating. </p>
<p>The law of the 500-owner limit was created to make sure
those who invest in larger companies are provided sufficient
information about the firm. The rule applies to companies with
more than $10 million in assets. The Goldman Sachs investment
values Facebook at about $50 billion. </p>
<p>Facebook told the SEC in 2005 that it had under 500
shareholders and asked for an exemption from making public
disclosures about the restricted stock units it was giving
employees. The SEC granted the exemption. </p>
<p>Beneficial Holders </p>
<p>While the law counts so-called owners of record toward the
500-shareholder threshold, people who invest in a private
company through a fund -- the so-called beneficial holders --
aren''t included in the tally. </p>
<p>The company only has to count record holders; that''s sort
of neutral terminology, said David Martin, a former director
of the SEC''s Division of Corporation Finance who is co-head of
the securities practice at Covington  Burling LLP in Washington. A private company can officially be well under the
limit while exceeding it in practice by being owned by
thousands of people, he said. </p>
<p>Investment funds generally are treated as single owners of
record. Still, the SEC''s rules state that if a vehicle is set up
primarily to circumvent securities law, the beneficial
holders will be counted as individual owners of record. </p>
<p>If the Goldman Sachs vehicle is established only to invest
in Facebook, the SEC may interpret it as a deliberate attempt to
dodge its rules, said John Mahon, a former lawyer in the SEC''s
Division of Corporation Finance who is now a partner at
Sutherland, Asbill and Brennan LLP in Washington. </p>
<p>Potential Risk'' </p>
<p>There''s that potential risk that the SEC, in essence,
could basically look through that vehicle and count the
investors individually, Mahon said. </p>
<p>The danger for Facebook is that if it improperly manages
the investor interest, it could accidentally cross the 500
shareholder threshold, going public without an initial public
offering, Angel said. </p>
<p>A spokesman for Facebook, Larry Yu, declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs didn''t immediately respond to a request for
comment. </p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Goldman Sachs can sell up to $75
million of its stake to Russia''s Digital Sky Technologies, which
it partly owns. Digital Sky Technologies also added $50 million
to an earlier stake in Facebook. </p>
<p>The whole venture capital industry is based upon funds
investing in private companies, said Paul N. Roth, a partner
at Schulte, Roth and Zabel LLP in New York, who leads the hedge
funds subcommittee at the American Bar Association''s Committee
on Federal Regulation of Securities. They tend to count as a
single investor. </p>
<p>SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. retained its
place for a third year as the top underwriter of U.S.
investment-grade corporate bonds, leading banks managing $845
billion of sales in 2010. </p>
<p>The second-largest U.S. lender by assets managed 13.8
percent of the new issues with $101.6 billion of offerings in
496 transactions, excluding self-led sales, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.
retained the second and third places, respectively, while Barclays Capital displaced Morgan Stanley for the fourth spot. </p>
<p>We had periods where things felt like a bull market with
respect to market appetite and receptivity to deals, and then we
had periods of time when it was very difficult to get
transactions done, said Therese Esperdy, head of global debt
capital markets at JPMorgan Chase in New York. </p>
<p>Company bond supply ranged last year from as low as $33
billion in May to as much as $162 billion in September amid
concern surrounding Europe''s sovereign debt crisis. Average
investment-grade yields reached a high of 4.86 percent in
January and a record-low 3.53 percent in November. Overseas
issuers, led by corporations in Canada and England, accounted
for 41 percent of offerings, the biggest portion ever. </p>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch underwrote 12.5 percent of
issues, or 552, valued at $91.6 billion, Bloomberg data show.
Citigroup had a 9.6 percent market share, with 364 transactions
totaling $70 billion, the data show. Barclays managed 328 issues
that came to $62.7 billion, an 8.5 percent share. Barclays
boosted its share from 8 percent in 2009, the data show. </p>
<p>Cross-Border Financing'' </p>
<p>Our cross-border financing business is a very significant
component of our business, and it''s one of our core
competencies, Esperdy said. That played a big part in our
market presence in the U.S. dollar market. </p>
<p>Investment-grade debt sales may decline 6 percent this year
as companies borrow to fund takeovers and share buybacks rather
than refinance outstanding debt, Bank of America strategists
wrote in a Dec. 28 note. </p>
<p>Our goal is certainly to be number one, said Andrew Karp, head of investment-grade debt syndicate for the Americas
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. We''ll look to maintain our
traditional areas of strength and continue to innovate and push
into new areas. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s 10.1 percent market share from 2009
declined to 8 percent in 2010, pushing the bank from the fourth
spot to the sixth, Bloomberg data show. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
remained fifth with an 8.2 percent market share, managing $60
billion worth of sales, the data show. </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, infringed a patent on technology used to deter
piracy, an appeals court ruled in a decision that may change how
damages are calculated in future cases. </p>
<p>The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington today upholds the validity of a patent
owned by Uniloc USA Inc. and Uniloc Singapore Private Ltd.,
while ordering a new trial to reassess the damages Microsoft
should pay. </p>
<p>It''s a strong validation of the value of the patent,
Brad Davis, chief executive officer of Irvine, California-based
Uniloc USA, said in a telephone interview. The damages issue
is what it is, and we''ll live with it. We have a sense of how
much we contributed to Microsoft''s bottom line. </p>
<p>The ruling throws out a common tool used to calculate
infringement awards, and will likely reduce the amount Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft will have to pay closely held Uniloc.
The Federal Circuit called for a new trial on damages, saying a
2009 lower-court verdict of $388 million was fundamentally
tainted by the use of a legally inadequate methodology. </p>
<p>This is an important and helpful opinion with respect to
the law of damages, and it may signal the end of unreasonable
and outsized damages awards based on faulty methodology, David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said in an e-
mailed statement. We look forward to the new trial. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Smith in Providence, Rhode
Island, had thrown out the 2009 verdict Uniloc won. The company
was appealing Smith''s decision, while Microsoft was seeking a
court ruling that would limit the ability of patent owners to
seek big damage awards from large technology companies. </p>
<p>$19 Billion Chart </p>
<p>Uniloc''s lawsuit, filed in October 2003, targeted
Microsoft''s Windows XP operating system and some Office
programs. Microsoft argued that it used a different method for
registering software and that the patent was invalid. </p>
<p>The Federal Circuit''s decision to uphold the validity of
the patent may boost Uniloc''s efforts to collect royalties from
additional companies including Symantec Corp. and Adobe Systems
Inc. Uniloc Singapore owns the patent and Uniloc USA is the
exclusive licensee, Davis said </p>
<p>Lawyers for Uniloc showed jurors during the 2009 trial a
pie chart with $19 billion in revenue from the Windows XP
operating system and some versions of Word. Uniloc was seeking
2.9 percent of that total, or about $564 million. The jury
awarded $388 million. </p>
<p>The award was the third-largest jury verdict in 2009 and
the second-biggest patent verdict, behind a $1.67 billion award
that Johnson  Johnson won against Abbott Laboratories. </p>
<p>Rule of Thumb'' </p>
<p>Smith ruled that, even if the Federal Circuit decided the
jury verdict on infringement was appropriate, Microsoft would be
entitled to a new trial on the damages because Uniloc shouldn''t
have been able to use the $19 billion figure in front of jurors. </p>
<p>The Federal Circuit said courts shouldn''t allow damages to
be based on a common calculation that has as a starting point
the rule of thumb that 25 percent of a product''s value goes
to the patent owner. </p>
<p>That method fails to tie a reasonable royalty base to the
facts of the case at issue, the Federal Circuit ruled.
Beginning from a fundamentally flawed premise and adjusting it
based on legitimate considerations specific to the facts of the
case nevertheless results in a fundamentally flawed
conclusion. </p>
<p>The appeals court also agreed with Microsoft that Uniloc
shouldn''t have been able to show the chart. </p>
<p>Skew the Verdict </p>
<p>The disclosure that a company has made $19 billion
dollars in revenue from an infringing product cannot help but
skew the damages horizon for the jury, regardless of the
contribution of the patented component to this revenue,
Circuit Judge Richard Linn wrote for the court. </p>
<p>A Uniloc lawyer, Paul Hayes of Mintz Levin in Boston, said
Microsoft would have lost $5 billion in sales were it not for
the piracy-deterrent invented by Uniloc''s founder. That
estimate, combined with the additional two years of infringement
since the jury verdict, may result in another big award against
Microsoft, he said. </p>
<p>I don''t think the decision by the Federal Circuit
necessarily means there will be any difference in the amount,
it''s just the methodology, Hayes said in a telephone
interview. There are many ways you can figure this out. </p>
<p>Additional Lawsuits </p>
<p>Uniloc has filed suit over the same patent against software
companies in federal court in Tyler, Texas. Davis said the
company has settled with about 40 companies and has claims
pending against 100 more. </p>
<p>The decision today builds on a 2009 ruling won by Microsoft
in another case that limited the amount technology companies
have to pay when they lose patent trials over features of their
products. In that case, the Federal Circuit ruled that damage
awards have to be linked to the extent the feature is used by
consumers and whether it drives demand for the overall product. </p>
<p>The case is Uniloc USA v. Microsoft Corp., 10-1035, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower
court case is Uniloc USA Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 03cv440, U.S.
District Court, District of Rhode Island (Providence). </p>

<p>General Electric Capital Corp., the
finance arm of General Electric Co., sold $6 billion of debt in
the largest U.S. corporate bond offering in 11 months. </p>
<p>The four-part transaction comprised $2.25 billion of
floating-rate debt and $3.75 billion of fixed-rate securities,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stamford, Connecticut-
based GE Capital led at least $19.1 billion of corporate bond
sales today, the most in almost four months. </p>
<p>GE Capital, which accessed nine major debt markets last
year, plans to issue $25 billion to $30 billion of long-term
securities in 2011, GE Treasurer Kathryn Cassidy said in a Dec.
7 conference call with investors. The company faces $62 billion
of debt coming due this year and heavy maturities of $81
billion in 2012, Cassidy said. </p>
<p>GE has methodically gotten ahead of its debt schedule
during the last couple of years, said Daniel Holland, an
equity analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, in a telephone
interview. It''s giving them the flexibility to do what they
need to do. </p>
<p>The offering included $1 billion of two-year floating-rate
notes that yield 57 basis points more than the London interbank
offered rate and $1.25 billion of three-year floating-rate debt
that pays a spread of 85 basis points, according to Bloomberg
data. </p>
<p>Fixed-Rate Notes </p>
<p>Also included in the transaction was $1.75 billion of 2.1
percent, 3-year notes that yield 110 basis points more than
comparable-maturity Treasuries and $2 billion of 4.625 percent,
10-year debt that pays a 135 basis-point spread, Bloomberg data
show. </p>
<p>The sale was the biggest since Feb. 4, when Kraft Foods
Inc. sold $9.5 billion of bonds and Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
issued $8 billion of debt, Bloomberg data show. Companies sold
$20 billion of debt in the U.S. on Sept. 8. </p>
<p>Bonds issued by GE Capital may outperform those of rivals
this year, according to Barclays Capital, which named the
company''s debt its top pick for 2011 in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold GE Capital''s debt,
compared with similar-maturity Treasuries, will narrow in 2011,
Barclays strategists led by Jonathan Glionna said in the report. </p>
<p>GE Capital sold $12.8 billion of dollar-denominated bonds
in 2010, making it the leader in corporate bond sales without
government guarantees, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The unit last sold U.S. dollar-denominated 10-year debt in
benchmark size on Sept. 13, issuing $2 billion of 4.375 percent
notes that were priced to yield 140 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, or 4.475 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley, the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets, named Jim Rosenthal chief operating officer
to succeed Thomas Nides, who left the firm to take a position in
the U.S. State Department. </p>
<p>Rosenthal will lead the New York-based company''s operations
and technology groups, as well as head its marketing, human
resources and communications efforts, according to an internal
memo from Chief Executive Officer James Gorman obtained today by
Bloomberg News. Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, confirmed
the memo. </p>
<p>Nides, 49, was confirmed by the U.S. Senate last month as
deputy secretary of state for management and resources.
Rosenthal, who currently serves as the firm''s head of strategy
and COO for its brokerage unit, will continue in those roles in
addition to his new responsibilities. </p>
<p>He has been overseeing the company''s integration of its
brokerage joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith Barney unit.
Morgan Stanley bought a controlling stake in the joint venture
in 2009, giving it the largest brokerage force with more than
18,000 financial advisers. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s government-relations group, which is led
by Michael Stein, will report to Frank Barron, the firm''s chief
legal officer who joined in September, according to the memo.
The global sustainable finance group will report to Chief
Financial Officer Ruth Porat. </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp. said the next version
of its Windows personal-computer operating system will run on ARM Holdings Plc''s chip technology for the first time, marking a
deeper push into the market for tablet computers. </p>
<p>Windows will work with ARM-based chips made by Nvidia
Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc., Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new operating system is
designed for smaller, thinner devices with longer battery life. </p>
<p>Microsoft is playing catch-up to Apple Inc. in the market
for devices that are larger than smartphones yet less powerful
than laptops, and it''s facing pressure from Google Inc., also
making a foray into tablets. The system marks a shift in
Microsoft''s alliance with semiconductor maker Intel Corp., which
has also struggled in the area of tablets and mobile devices. </p>
<p>ARM chips are very friendly towards mobile devices and
they''re available now, said Katherine Egbert, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. in San Francisco. Intel is clearly working on
lower power chips, but it''s one thing to get the processor out
of manufacturing. Then you have to build the software code. </p>
<p>Microsoft Windows President Steven Sinofsky previewed the
new software running on chips at a press conference at the show.
He also showed Office software running on the chips. </p>
<p>Tailored for Mobile </p>
<p>The Windows software will be tailored for battery-powered
devices, such as tablets, netbooks and other handhelds. </p>
<p>Microsoft declined to comment on timing for the release
other than to say the company is sticking with its previous
timeline for a new Windows every two to three years. The last
version went on sale in October 2009. </p>
<p>The sooner Microsoft can introduce the software, the better
chance it has to prevent Apple and Google from amassing an
insurmountable lead. Getting the new system into devices in time
for Christmas 2011 would be sooner than many analysts have
projected, said Egbert, who rates Microsoft a buy. </p>
<p>The software will also work with Intel and Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. chips, as have previous versions of Windows. </p>
<p>ARM chips are used in most smartphones, as well as Apple''s
best-selling iPad tablet, which was introduced last year. </p>
<p>While other versions of Microsoft programs aimed at phones
and mobile devices already work on ARM chips, this is the first
time the software maker will produce a full version of Windows
available on that technology. </p>
<p>Intel is trying to make its own forays into tablets and
smartphones, squaring off against ARM''s technology. ARM, based
in Cambridge, England, sells the rights to use its patents and
chip designs and doesn''t manufacture the electronic components. </p>
<p>Apple sold 7.46 million iPads from the product''s April
debut through September. The device accounted for 95 percent of
the tablet market last quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. </p>

<p>Defense Secretary Robert Gates has
canceled General Dynamics Corp.''s $15.5 billion Expeditionary
Fighting Vehicle program as part of his drive to shift as much
as $100 billion through 2016 to more urgent needs, according to
officials. </p>
<p>We think that Gates tomorrow is going to announce that
this will not be in his budget request, that it''s canceled,
Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican and former Marine on
the House Armed Services Committee, said in a telephone
interview. </p>
<p>He predicted the House committee will reject Gates''
decision because it appears to be a repudiation of the Marine
Corps'' central mission. The EFV is designed for amphibious
landings on hostile shores. </p>
<p>The termination decision was confirmed by administration
and Congressional officials, who asked not to be identified
since the action has not been formally announced. </p>
<p>Gates is expected to make the announcement to lawmakers
tomorrow as one part of the $100 billion in efficiency savings
and weapons program cuts that he plans in order to shift
resources to other priorities. </p>
<p>The EFV project is at least five years behind schedule and,
at $24 million apiece, 176 percent over its original per-vehicle
price tag, the U.S. Government Accountability Office reported in
July 2010. It faces additional cost, schedule and performance
risks, said the report. </p>
<p>Failed Earlier Tests </p>
<p>The transport program has been in development since 1996
and was reorganized in 2007, cutting the number to be purchased
and extending the development period, after the vehicle failed
earlier reliability tests. </p>
<p>Congress, through this fiscal year, has approved $3 billion
of the program''s $15.5 billion cost. Even with fewer transports
to be purchased, the overall price tag has grown more than 70
percent over an original $9 billion estimate, according to GAO
and Pentagon figures. </p>
<p>The transports are designed to deploy from ships up to
almost 30 miles (46 kilometers) out and carry 17 Marines, moving
them to shore three times faster than the Corps'' current, 35-
year-old transports. </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, infringed a patent on technology used to deter
piracy, an appeals court ruled in a decision that may change how
damages are calculated in future cases. </p>
<p>The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington yesterday upholds the validity of a patent
owned by Uniloc USA Inc. and Uniloc Singapore Private Ltd.,
while ordering a new trial to reassess the damages Microsoft
should pay. </p>
<p>It''s a strong validation of the value of the patent,
Brad Davis,  chief executive officer of Irvine, California-based
Uniloc USA, said in a telephone interview. The damages issue
is what it is, and we''ll live with it. We have a sense of how
much we contributed to Microsoft''s bottom line. </p>
<p>The ruling throws out a common tool used to calculate
infringement awards, and will likely reduce the amount Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft will have to pay closely held Uniloc.
The Federal Circuit called for a new trial on damages, saying a
2009 lower-court verdict of $388 million was fundamentally
tainted by the use of a legally inadequate methodology. </p>
<p>This is an important and helpful opinion with respect to
the law of damages, and it may signal the end of unreasonable
and outsized damages awards based on faulty methodology, David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said in an e-
mailed statement. We look forward to the new trial. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Smith in Providence, Rhode
Island, had thrown out the 2009 verdict Uniloc won. The company
was appealing Smith''s decision, while Microsoft was seeking a
court ruling that would limit the ability of patent owners to
seek big damage awards from large technology companies. </p>
<p>Uniloc''s lawsuit, filed in October 2003, targeted
Microsoft''s Windows XP operating system and some Office
programs. Microsoft argued that it used a different method for
registering software and that the patent was invalid. </p>
<p>The Federal Circuit''s decision to uphold the validity of
the patent may boost Uniloc''s efforts to collect royalties from
additional companies including Symantec Corp. and Adobe Systems
Inc. Uniloc Singapore owns the patent and Uniloc USA is the
exclusive licensee, Davis said. </p>
<p>Lawyers for Uniloc showed jurors during the 2009 trial a
pie chart with $19 billion in revenue from the Windows XP
operating system and some versions of Word. Uniloc was seeking
2.9 percent of that total, or about $564 million. The jury
awarded $388 million. </p>
<p>Smith ruled that, even if the Federal Circuit decided the
jury verdict on infringement was appropriate, Microsoft would be
entitled to a new trial on the damages because Uniloc shouldn''t
have been able to use the $19 billion figure in front of jurors. </p>
<p>The Federal Circuit said courts shouldn''t allow damages to
be based on a common calculation that has as a starting point
the rule of thumb that 25 percent of a product''s value goes
to the patent owner. </p>
<p>That method fails to tie a reasonable royalty base to the
facts of the case at issue, the Federal Circuit ruled. </p>
<p>The case is Uniloc USA v. Microsoft Corp., 10-1035, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower
court case is Uniloc USA Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 03cv440, U.S.
District Court, District of Rhode Island (Providence). </p>
<p> India Rejects Patent Application for Abbott''s Kaletra </p>
<p> Abbott Laboratories was refused patent protection on its
AIDS drug Kaletra by India''s patent office, allowing Cipla Ltd.
and other generic-drug companies to continue selling copies. </p>
<p>Steps involved in making Kaletra do not constitute an
invention, the agency''s Mumbai office said in documents dated
Dec. 30. The patent application by Abbott Park, Illinois-based
Abbott was challenged by the Initiative for Medicines, Access 
Knowledge, as well as Cipla and Matrix. </p>
<p>Abbott is reviewing the patent decision and determining its
next steps, spokesman Scott Stoffel said yesterday. Newer
versions of the drug don''t require refrigeration and needn''t be
taken with food, making them better suited for patients in
developing countries, he said. </p>
<p>Kaletra, a combination of two antivirals, is in the class
of drugs known as protease inhibitors, which block viral
replication by inhibiting an enzyme essential for reproduction
of the virus. </p>
<p>It''s a preferred second-line treatments to fight drug-
resistant AIDS, according to the World Health Organization,
which recommends governments include it on their list of
essential treatments for the disease caused by the human immune
deficiency virus. </p>
<p>The product generated about $1.37 billion in sales in 2009,
making it Abbott''s second-best seller after the arthritis drug
Humira. </p>
<p>The patent application is 339/MUMNP/2006. </p>

<p>Trademark </p>
<p>Website Operator Issues Challenge to Hon'' Trademark Owner </p>
<p>A Baltimore restaurateur''s registration of hon as a
trademark faces a challenge from the operator of the Welcome
to Baltimore, Hon! website. </p>
<p>Bruce Goldfarb posted the Hon Manifesto on his site,
taking exception to Denise Whiting''s registration of the term
for use with her Cafe Hon and annual Honfest celebration of all
things Baltimorean. </p>
<p>In December, Baltimoreans became aware that White had
registered the mark and said publicly that she would enforce it.
Hon is a term of endearment frequently used in Baltimore. </p>
<p>In his manifesto, Goldfarb said Whiting''s claim to
exclusive commercial rights to the term unreasonably inhibits
speech and restrains business. </p>
<p>The near universal surprise to the news that Whiting
had registered hon as a trademark speaks loudly to the
absence of lineage between the word and Whiting or any of her
business interests, Goldfarb wrote. Hon has zero brand
identity. </p>
<p>He said he plans to set up an online shop to sell t-shirts,
mugs, stickers and other Baltimore-related items in connection
with his Welcome to Baltimore, Hon! website and invited
Whiting to try to enforce the trademark against him. </p>
<p>Whiting didn''t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment. She had no comment on Goldfarb''s challenge, the
Baltimore Sun reported. </p>

<p>Copyright </p>
<p>Chicago Alderman Candidate Sued for Copyright Infringement </p>
<p>A Chicago photographer sued a political candidate for
copyright infringement. </p>
<p>Proco Moreno is running for re-election as alderman for
Chicago''s First Ward. Photographer Mark Joseph Whaley is suing
over the unauthorized use of his photo of Moreno''s opponent,
Deborah Lopez, in what the complaint refers to as the Moreno
Negative Flyer. </p>
<p>The flyer was distributed the day before the deadline for
filing petitions with the Chicago Election Board and alleged
unethical conduct by Lopez related to her job with the Chicago
Transit Authority, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Lopez received an exoneration letter from the transit
authority on Dec. 23, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Whaley -- who  uses the pseudonym Mark Joseph --accused
Moreno of being behind the negative flyer, saying the candidate
at all relevant times stood to benefit directly and to the
greatest extent from the creation and distribution. </p>
<p>Use of the photo without Whaley''s consent caused the
photographer irreparable damage, he said in his pleadings.
He asked the court to bar further use of the photo, and for
awards of money damages and any profits Moreno derived from his
alleged acts of infringement, in addition to attorney fees and
litigation costs. </p>
<p>The Moreno campaign didn''t immediately return an emailed
request for comment. </p>
<p>Whaley is represented by William F. Zieske of Zieske Law of Chicago. </p>
<p>The case is Mark Joseph Whaley v. Proco Moreno, 1:11-cv-
00024, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). </p>
<p>Adult-Film Maker Sues 109 Defendants for Infringement </p>
<p>Serious Bidness LLC, a Las Vegas-based maker of adult
films, sued 109 unidentified defendants for copyright
infringement. </p>
<p>According to the complaint filed Jan. 2 in Dallas, the
defendants infringed the copyright for Serious Bidness''s film
Kayla Kleevage by downloading and sharing the content
through the use of BitTorrent technology. </p>
<p>The distribution of even one single unauthorized digital
copy of the film can result in worldwide distribution of that
single copy to a limitless number of people in a matter of
hours, Serious Bidness said in its court papers. </p>
<p>In December, a federal judge in West Virginia told Axel
Braun Productions it had to sue defendants one-by-one in a case
alleging infringing of its Batman XXX: A Porn Parody. Braun
sued more than 7,000 unidentified defendants in that court in
October. </p>
<p>Serious Bidness asked the court for orders barring future
infringement of the copyrights of Kayla Kleevage and any of
its other films, together with awards of money damages, attorney
fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>The case is Serious Bidness LLC v. Does 1-109, 3:11-cv-
00002-K, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas
(Dallas). The earlier case brought by Axel Braun is Axel Braun
Productions v. Does 1-7098, 3:10-cv-00112-JPB, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of West Virginia (Martinsburg). </p>

<p> Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase
 Co. and other U.S. banks told a New Jersey court that defects
in their processes for seizing homes in the state can be
remedied without halting foreclosures. </p>
<p>The banks have taken steps to improve their procedures,
making a suspension unnecessary, they said in documents filed
yesterday in state court in Trenton, New Jersey, and made public
today. The filings came in response to a proposal to freeze
foreclosures in the state by six U.S. banks while their
procedures are reviewed. </p>
<p>The banks'' practices came under scrutiny after bank
employees signed court documents in foreclosure cases without
verifying their accuracy, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Bank of America fully appreciates the court''s concerns
and looks forward to working with the court to address them,
the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said. The court
should not take the steps outlined in the order because they are
unnecessary and will cause a wholesale delay in administering
foreclosure cases that is not in the public interest. </p>
<p>Judge Mary Jacobson scheduled a Jan. 19 hearing to consider
suspending uncontested foreclosure cases and staying foreclosure
sales by the banks: Ally Financial Inc., Bank of America,
JPMorgan, Wells Fargo  Co., Citigroup Inc. and OneWest Bank,
according to a Dec. 20 order. </p>
<p>Protect Integrity'' </p>
<p>The move is necessary to protect the integrity of the
judicial foreclosure process in New Jersey and to assure the
public that the process going forward will be reliable,
Jacobson said in the order. </p>
<p> Newark, New Jersey, law firm Greenberg Dauber Epstein 
Tucker was appointed to respond to the arguments made by the
banks and to present arguments supporting the foreclosure
suspension. Thomas Slocum, an attorney at the firm, couldn''t be
reached for comment. </p>
<p>The New Jersey actions add to the legal challenges banks
are facing across the country. The 50 state attorneys general
are investigating foreclosure practices by banks and mortgage
servicers, while homeowners in several states have filed
potential class-action lawsuits against the companies. </p>
<p>Another 24 banks and mortgage companies also are under
scrutiny in New Jersey. Those companies, including government-
owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, must demonstrate
affirmatively that there are no irregularities in their handling
of foreclosure proceedings, Judge Glenn Grant said in a
separate Dec. 20 order. Foreclosures by those companies may be
suspended after they make submissions to a special master,
according to the order. </p>
<p>Reformed Procedures </p>
<p>The banks said in their court filings that they have
reformed their procedures for preparing foreclosure documents
and imposed new safeguards to avoid defective paperwork. They
said they will submit revised documents in foreclosure cases
when necessary. </p>
<p>With such oversight in place, Chase submits that there is
no need to impose a stay of proceedings pending a review of past
practices, New York-based JPMorgan said. To date, Chase has
not identified or become aware of any systemic deficiencies in
its processes that caused it to pursue foreclosure actions
without merit. </p>
<p>Citigroup, also based in New York, said a review of its New
Jersey foreclosure cases found that affidavits in 210 cases need
to be corrected. Those cases, and any others that require
corrected paperwork, will be dismissed and refiled using
enhanced foreclosure documentation procedures, the bank
said. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, argued that suspending
foreclosures and appointing a special master to review
foreclosure procedures would violate New Jersey''s constitution. </p>
<p>The case is In the Matter of Residential Mortgage
Foreclosure Pleading and Document Irregularities Superior Court
of New Jersey, Chancery Division-General Equity Part, F-59553-
10, Mercer County (Trenton). </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp. has shipped more than
8 million Kinect sensors for its Xbox device, topping the
company''s forecasts, and now has 30 million users for the
related Xbox Live online service. </p>
<p>The company also plans to add the Hulu Plus online-
television service to Xbox Live and Kinect in the U.S. this
spring. Windows Phone 7 software, meanwhile, will be available
for Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel Corp. in the first half,
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said yesterday at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas. </p>
<p>Microsoft is relying on Kinect and Xbox Live to squeeze
more profit from its gaming division and extend the product life
of the Xbox console. Kinect lets players control games through
the movement of their bodies -- an approach that''s also been
embraced by rivals Nintendo Co. and Sony Corp. </p>
<p>With Kinect, you are the controller -- and there''s
nothing else like it in the world, said Ballmer, 54. Xbox
360, Xbox Live and Kinect have made 2010 the biggest year in
Xbox history. </p>
<p>Microsoft has sold virtually all of the 8 million Kinects
that were shipped, the company said yesterday. </p>
<p>Sony said in November it has shipped 4.1 million Move
motion controllers to retailers. </p>
<p>Apple, Google TV </p>
<p>Jack Tretton, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America,
said in an interview this week that the vast majority of those
have been purchased by consumers and many stores are sold out.
He declined to provide an updated number for shipments. </p>
<p>The Xbox''s television, sports and movie features also are
becoming more critical amid competition from Apple Inc.''s Apple
TV and Google Inc.''s Google TV. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has sold more than 50 million Xbox 360 consoles,
which debuted in November 2005. </p>
<p>In the mobile-phone market, Microsoft is trying to build
support for its new Windows Phone 7 software, which came out
last year. Verizon and Sprint versions of Windows Phone 7
handsets weren''t available because those companies'' networks use
CDMA technology, which Microsoft opted not to support in the
first version of the underlying software. Ballmer didn''t specify
when the two companies would start selling phones with the
operating system. </p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, Microsoft said the next version of its
Windows personal-computer operating system will run on ARM
Holdings Plc''s chip technology for the first time, marking a
deeper push into the market for tablet computers. At a press
conference at the show, Microsoft showed the upcoming Windows
running on ARM-based chips made by Nvidia Corp., Qualcomm Inc.
and Texas Instruments Inc. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 82 cents to $28.82 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares declined 8.4 percent
last year. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, named Colm Kelleher to lead operations in Europe, the Middle East and Asia outside Japan, while Paul J. Taubman will take on responsibility for Latin America and Japan. </p>
<p>Both Kelleher, 53, and Taubman, 50, will remain co-
presidents of the firm''s institutional securities group,
according to an internal memo from Chief Executive Officer James Gorman obtained today by Bloomberg News. Mark Lake, a Morgan
Stanley spokesman, confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated 20 percent of its revenue in the
first nine months of 2010 from Europe, the Middle East and
Africa, and 10 percent from Asia. Expanding internationally is a
key priority for the firm, and much of its hiring has been
in emerging markets, Kelleher said in a presentation in May. </p>
<p>Kelleher will relocate to London as part of the changes.
Walid Chammah, the bank''s former co-president, will retain his
title of chairman of Morgan Stanley International. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and the biggest
U.S. banks face billions of dollars in legal costs related to
their role in the financial crisis, threatening their profits
and the stock price gains they made in 2010, analysts said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second biggest bank by assets, reported $5.2
billion of legal costs in the first nine months of last year,
compared with a gain of $10 million in the same period a year
earlier. The costs would rise if the bank reserves for
multibillion-dollar lawsuits by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
and the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff''s firm. </p>
<p> Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. bank, and Citigroup
Inc., ranked third, are also besieged by lawsuits stemming from
the credit crisis, brought by plaintiffs ranging from
foreclosed-upon homeowners to institutional investors whose
mortgage-backed bonds turned out to be money-losers. </p>
<p>They''re under legal attack, said Richard Bove, an
analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida, who rates
JPMorgan''s stock a buy. They''re similar to the asbestos or
the tobacco industry, and they''re going to be repeatedly sued in
the next few years. </p>
<p>JPMorgan rose about 1.8 percent in 2010, while the Standard
 Poor''s 500 Bank Index climbed 18.7 percent and Citigroup
gained 43 percent. Both banks are based in New York. Bank of
America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, fell 11.4 percent,
while San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. rose 14.8 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. clients
considering whether to buy shares in closely held Facebook Inc.
should take heed: Wall Street''s most profitable securities firm
could unload its own holdings without letting them know. </p>
<p>In the last sentence of a one-page investment profile sent
to private wealth clients, the firm explains: GS Group may at
any time further reduce its exposure to its investment in
Facebook (through hedging arrangements, sales or otherwise),
without notice to the fund or investors in the fund. </p>
<p>The offering document, obtained by Bloomberg News, shows
that $75 million of the $450 million investment in Facebook by
Goldman Sachs is coming from Goldman Sachs Investment Partners,
a hedge fund that handles client money. The firm''s own $375
million investment will probably be cut to $300 million because
Goldman Sachs expects to sell $75 million to third parties or to
the fund it created so clients could buy a stake in Facebook. </p>
<p>There may be conflicts of interest relating to the
underlying investments of the fund and Goldman Sachs,
according to the Facebook offering document''s disclosures
section. Material in the documents is not guaranteed as to
accuracy or completeness. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs paid $550 million in July to settle fraud
charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating
to the 2007 sale of a mortgage-linked investment called Abacus.
The company said it made a mistake by failing to inform
clients in the 2007 deal that it allowed a hedge fund betting
against the investment to help put together the deal. </p>
<p> Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York,
declined to comment yesterday. Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for
Facebook, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Rules for Clients </p>
<p>To get a stake in Facebook, Goldman Sachs clients are
required to make a minimum investment of $2 million by Jan. 7 in
what''s described as limited partnerships based in the Cayman
Islands and Delaware. Goldman Sachs is charging 0.5 percent of
any capital committed to the partnership as an expense
reserve as well as a 4 percent placement fee and 5 percent of
any gains, according to the document. </p>
<p>Richard A. Friedman, head of an internal investment group
in the firm called Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, turned down
an opportunity to invest in Facebook because he decided it
wasn''t right for his funds, according to a person familiar with
the decision. The New York Times reported Friedman''s decision
earlier today. </p>
<p>Friedman thought the investment wasn''t appropriate because
of its high valuation and because it didn''t match his investing
criteria, the newspaper said. The Goldman Sachs deal values
Facebook at $50 billion. </p>
<p>Active Users </p>
<p>Facebook has more than 600 million monthly active users, of
whom more than 230 million access the site on mobile devices,
the document shows. Statistics available on Facebook''s website
indicate it has more than 500 million monthly active users and
more than 200 million access from mobile devices. </p>
<p>A letter addressed to potential investor that
introduces the Facebook investment profile ends with a two-
sentence paragraph. The first asks potential investors to
contact a Goldman Sachs representative for further information.
The second says: </p>
<p>Do not contact Facebook. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is selling
its stake in Accordia Golf Co., ending an almost decade-long
investment in the sport in Japan as player numbers fall. </p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs investment unit will sell 470,587 shares in
Accordia, the Tokyo-based golf operator said in a statement
today. The stake is worth about 37 billion yen ($445 million)
based on today''s closing price. Accordia''s stock has lost 60
percent since Goldman Sachs took the company public in 2006. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs spent more than 3 trillion yen since 1997 on
assets in Japan, including golf facilities and office buildings.
The nation''s golf-course industry has been in decline since an
asset bubble burst 20 years ago, and is unlikely to return to
its former glory as the population shrinks and the economy
stagnates, said Daisuke Seki of IB Research and Consulting Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman must have judged it''s time to sell as it can''t
expect any upside from the shares, and the move suggests the
bank will exit from other real estate investments in Japan,
said Seki, chief executive officer at the Tokyo-based firm.
Golf is a luxury. Playing numbers are falling because of the
declining population and weakening economy, as well as companies
choosing not to entertain clients on the course. </p>
<p>Accordia shares, sold in the IPO for 195,000 yen, fell 1
percent to 78,900 yen in Tokyo today before the announcement.
Goldman Sachs owns a 45 percent stake in the company. Goldman
raised about 100 billion yen from the IPO. </p>
<p>Bankrupt Clubs </p>
<p> Daiwa Securities Group Inc.''s investment banking unit and
Goldman Sachs will underwrite the share sale, according to the
statement. They will sell the shares to investors in Japan, Asia
and Europe, and decide the price as early as Jan. 17. </p>
<p>Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the sale. She also declined to
comment on returns from its investment in the golf business. </p>
<p>Accordia last month cut its profit forecast to 11.4 billion
yen for the year ending March 31, from 12.1 billion yen. It
posted a 10.4 billion yen profit a year earlier. The stock
slipped 19 percent in the past year while the Topix Index was
little changed. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which made its first investment in Japan''s
golf industry in 2002, owned 131 courses as of Dec. 31 according
to its website. </p>
<p>Golf membership prices soared in Japan during the 1980s
bubble economy, then slumped as the country fell into four
recessions in the past two decades. At least 800 golf clubs have
gone bankrupt since 1991, according to Meiji Golf, which trades
club memberships in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Membership values at Accordia-owned courses have fallen
faster than the nationwide average, Kazunari Tsutsumi,
executive director of Meiji Golf, said in July last year. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs at times faced challenges to acquire and
operate the golf courses. It lost management control of bankrupt
Nanso Country Club outside Tokyo last year after a court
accepted a petition by members to remove executives appointed by
the U.S. firm. </p>

<p>Liquefied natural gas production from Exxon Mobil Corp.''s Arun plant in Indonesia''s Aceh province may
drop 24 percent in 2011 from a year earlier as deposit of the
cleaner-burning-fuel dwindle, a company official said. </p>
<p>Output from Arun, the country''s oldest LNG plant, may fall
to 29 cargoes this year from 38 cargoes produced in 2010, said
Maman Budiman, a spokesman at Exxon''s Indonesian unit. Twenty-
six cargoes will be sold to overseas buyers and the rest to
local fertilizer producer PT Pupuk Iskandar Muda, he said. </p>
<p>The lower output is because of a natural decline in gas
production, Budiman said in a telephone interview from Jakarta
today. When a field has produced continuously for so many
years, over time the reserves will be depleted. </p>
<p>Indonesia, the world''s third-largest LNG supplier, exports
the frozen fuel from three plants to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan
and China under term contracts. Arun and Bontang in East
Kalimantan produced more than 95 percent of the country''s LNG in
2009, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official data. </p>
<p>Arun, which shipped its first cargo to Japan in 1978, will
cease exports by 2014, according to Indonesia''s Gas Balance
2010-2025 document. LNG is natural gas chilled to liquid form
for transportation by ships to places not connected by pipelines. </p>
<p>LNG demand in Asia is poised to rise for a second year in
2011. Imports may increase 5 percent this year, after jumping
almost 12 percent in 2010 and falling 2.9 percent the previous
year, according to Sook Ching Wong and Alexis Aik of FACTS
Global Energy, a Singapore-based energy consultant. Japan, the
world''s biggest LNG buyer, paid $9.40 per million British
thermal units for deliveries in November, compared with about
$14 a year earlier, according to Japanese customs data. </p>

<p>Foreign investment banks seeking a
greater share of stock underwriting in China must focus more on
smaller initial public offerings, said the head of JPMorgan
Chase  Co.''s Chinese operations. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, got
regulatory approval to set up investment banking joint ventures
in China this week, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG
in gaining access to a market where companies raised $74 billion
through IPOs last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Foreign-backed joint ventures were laggards in that market
in 2010, with UBS Securities Co. claiming the highest
underwriter ranking at No. 18 overall, Bloomberg data show. As
smaller deals dominated, local firms with more employees in the
country such as Ping An Securities Co. benefited. </p>
<p>Certain adjustments in (foreign firms'') business model
will need to be made, but the shift will be relatively
gradual, Shao Zili, hired by JPMorgan in November 2009 as
chief executive officer for China, said in an interview. Small
and mid-sized IPOs is traditionally not an area the foreign
firms focused on. However, it is a market that presents a great
deal of potential and no one can ignore the SME market now. </p>
<p>Todd Marin, JPMorgan''s head of investment banking in Asia,
defined such IPOs as those that raise up to $150 million.
JPMorgan expects those offerings to account for a greater share
of IPOs in Shanghai and Shenzhen as some of the largest state-
owned companies, such as Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., have
already gone public, Marin, 48, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Headcount Expansion </p>
<p>JPMorgan plans to expand its investment-banking workforce
in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan by 5 percent to 10
percent this year, in part to grow in China, Marin said. He
declined to say how many employees the unit has now. </p>
<p>The U.S. bank, the world''s third-biggest manager of equity
sales in 2010, received regulatory approval to set up an
investment banking joint venture in China with First Capital
Securities Co., according to a table posted on the China
Securities Regulatory Commission''s website yesterday. Morgan
Stanley said today in a statement it got the CSRC''s approval for
a venture with Huaxin Securities Co. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s local venture will likely be up and running
in the second quarter, Shao, 52, said. </p>
<p>Tying up with a local firm is a prerequisite for arranging
share sales in China, which is poised to overtake Japan as the
world''s second-largest economy. Deutsche Bank AG and Credit
Suisse AG are among other global banks that have started
ventures with local partners. </p>
<p>Underwriter Sponsors </p>
<p>One bottleneck for foreign investment banks in China is
staffing. Under Chinese rules, each underwriting firm must have
two so-called sponsors -- bankers who have passed an
underwriting test administered by the securities regulator and
have relevant experience in equity offerings -- sign off on each
deal. A single sponsor can''t work on more than two IPOs
simultaneously. </p>
<p>UBS Securities has 20 qualified sponsors, putting it at No.
25 among the 71 firms that can underwrite local IPOs by that
measure, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said Sept.
3. Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co. ranked No. 40 with 11
sponsors at the time. </p>
<p>Guosen Securities Co. employed the most such professionals
at the time with 113, the regulator said. </p>

<p>Just as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
prepares to unveil business standards aimed at improving its
reputation after settling fraud charges last year, the Facebook
Inc. stock sale to clients shines new light on the firm''s
potential conflicts of interest. </p>
<p>In pitching as much as $1.5 billion in stock in the closely
held social-networking company to wealthy investors, Goldman
Sachs disclosed that it might sell or hedge its own $375 million
investment without warning clients. The company''s disclosures
didn''t reveal that one of its star fund managers, Richard A. Friedman, rejected the deal as inappropriate for his clients. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, created a
business standards committee last May after the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs for fraud. The SEC
alleged that the firm misled investors in a 2007 mortgage-linked
investment by failing to inform them of a hedge fund''s plan to
bet against the investment. The committee''s report, which could
be released as soon as next week, will address how the company
can reinforce the firm''s client focus and improve upon the
transparency of our activities, according to a May statement. </p>
<p>The committee was undertaken in the hope and the
commitment to do some things that were going to help restore and
improve trust, said James Post, a professor at Boston
University''s School of Management who focuses on corporate
governance and ethics. Instead, people are going to look at it
and say do those standards seem credible in light of the
Facebook deal? </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp. said President Bob Muglia, head of the software maker''s server and tools division,
will leave this summer because Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer decided the unit needed new leadership. </p>
<p>Muglia, a 23-year veteran, will run the group while
3Microsoft conducts a search for his replacement, Ballmer said
in an e-mail posted on the Redmond, Washington-based company''s
website. </p>
<p>The business, which generated sales of $14.9 billion in the
most recent fiscal year, includes database software, the Azure
cloud-computing programs and a version of Windows software for
corporate networks. Ballmer said the unit needs to accelerate
growth and that requires a new executive team. Muglia is the
company''s fourth senior manager to announce his departure since
May. </p>
<p>All businesses go through cycles and need new and
different talent to manage through those cycles, Ballmer said
in the message. He said he is making the switch now because
the best time to think about change is when you are in a
position of strength. </p>
<p>Muglia took over the division in October 2005. The
business''s revenue rose more than 50 percent under his
leadership. It accounted for 24 percent of Microsoft''s total
sales in the year ended in June, making it the third-largest
division. </p>
<p>Overcame Demotion </p>
<p>Muglia survived a demotion earlier in the decade after the
Hailstorm Internet services effort he was overseeing failed amid
questions from potential partners and privacy advocates. He
fought his way back to head the server and tools division three
years later and in 2009 was named one of Microsoft''s presidents. </p>
<p>"He has done amazing," said Rob Horwitz, research chair and
co-founder of market research firm Directions on Microsoft.
"He''s built that business up against formidable competition from
the likes of Oracle and IBM." </p>
<p>Many executives would have quit after the demotion, said
Horwitz, who had the office next to Muglia''s at Microsoft in
1988. Bob is "a company man," and it''s entirely possible that he
was willing to admit to Ballmer that he wasn''t the right man for
the CEO''s future plans, Horwitz said. </p>
<p>The departure, coming after those of Chief Software
Architect Ray Ozzie, Office division chief Stephen Elop and Xbox
unit president Robbie Bach, adds to concern that Ballmer is
losing senior executives too quickly. </p>
<p>"It is a bummer to lose that much institutional talent,"
Horwitz said. "There''s a natural cleaning process of replacing
executives but it''s never good to have it that compressed. There
were probably different reasons for each departure. Whether it''s
a symptom of something larger, I don''t know." </p>
<p>Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said Muglia
wasn''t available for an interview. </p>
<p>Shares of Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker,
fell 38 cents to $28.22 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The stock declined 8.4 percent last year. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) completed a third

<p>Exxon, the world''s largest oil company, finished the Sabia-1 well after finding signs of crude in December, Brazil''s oil
regulator, known as the ANP, said today on its website. Exxon
has found oil in two of the three wells it drilled at the BM-S-22 exploration block, which it operates with partners Hess Corp. (HES)

<p>We are now analyzing the well, and we will work with the
ANP and our partners Hess and Petrobras to define the next
steps, Exxon said today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Santos contains the government''s Libra oil field with
estimated deposits of up to 15 billion barrels, and the 6.5-billion-barrel Lula field, the largest oil finds in the Americas
since Mexico discovered Cantarell in 1976. </p>
<p>Exxon operates the block with a 40 percent stake, while New
York-based Hess has 40 percent and Petrobras holds 20 percent. </p>
<p>Brazil is one of the few growth prospects around that all
of the integrated majors have their eyes on, Gianna Bern,
president of Brookshire Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago-based adviser to oil producers and investors, said in a
telephone interview today. </p>

<p>We have a little glint in our eye that we would love to

Exploiting Marvel properties on multiple platforms such as film

<p> Morgan Stanley plans to break off
its largest proprietary-trading group, Process Driven Trading,
to create an independent advisory firm by the end of 2012. </p>
<p>The bank, the sixth-largest U.S. lender by assets, will
have the option to acquire a preferred stake in the new company,
to be known as PDT Advisors, New York-based Morgan Stanley said
today in a statement. The company said it expects the unit''s
full staff of about 60 employees to join the new firm. </p>
<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. are among Wall Street firms breaking off or winding down proprietary
trading units to comply with a provision of the U.S.''s Dodd-
Frank financial rules that prohibits banks from betting capital
for their own accounts. PDT is led by Peter Muller, a so-called
quant manager who uses mathematical models to trade securities. </p>
<p>PDT has generated an enviable track record within Morgan
Stanley since its inception in 1993, Chief Executive Officer
James P. Gorman, 52, said in the statement. We are delighted
to continue our partnership with PDT as it looks to expand its
business by taking on third-party investors. </p>
<p>Under the plan announced today, PDT employees will acquire
certain assets from Morgan Stanley, according to the statement.
Before it becomes independent, the unit will continue to trade
with Morgan Stanley''s capital. </p>
<p>All prop trading is going to be much more constrained, so
for the very best prop traders in the world, the very best seats
to sit in will no longer be at a major brokerage firm, said
Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New
York. So we''re seeing a migration. </p>
<p>PDT''s Positive Returns </p>
<p>PDT produced a quarter of Morgan Stanley''s earnings in some
years during the late 1990s and early 2000s before losing as
much as $500 million in less than a month in the third quarter
of 2007, according to The Quants: How a New Breed of Math
Whizzes Conquered Wall Street and Nearly Destroyed It, by Scott Patterson. </p>
<p>PDT has posted positive returns every year since its
inception, including 2007, according to two people close to the
firm. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley will still have some piece of this, though
it will be limited, Hintz said. It isn''t as good as having
them in their trading operation, but it''s still not a total
loss. </p>
<p>Ariel Roskis and Daniele Benatoff, traders for Goldman
Sachs''s principal strategies desk in London, are preparing to
start their own hedge fund in the second quarter, said a person
with direct knowledge of the matter. The pair has secured a $300
million investment from Brummer  Partners, the largest
Scandinavian hedge fund, the person said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs already shut down an equity proprietary-
trading group, Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies, to comply
with the Volcker rule. New York-based Goldman Sachs lost two
quant managers, Robert Litterman and Robert C. Jones, from its
asset-management unit last year. Pierre-Henri Flammand, the
former head of Goldman Sachs''s Principal Strategies group,
retired last year to start his own hedge fund. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley scaled back proprietary-trading after
posting its first quarterly loss as a public company in 2007.
The firm reported $9.4 billion of writedowns tied to mortgage
holdings in the fourth quarter of that year, driven from bets
made by a prop-trading desk in its fixed-income unit. </p>

<p>Two Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traders
are preparing to start their own hedge fund after new financial
regulations restricted banks from risking capital on speculative
bets, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Ariel Roskis and Daniele Benatoff, who work for New York-
based Goldman Sachs''s principal strategies desk in London, plan
to start the fund in the second quarter, said the person, who
declined to be identified before the plans are announced. The
pair have secured a $300 million investment from Brummer 
Partners, the largest Scandinavian hedge fund, the person said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is losing traders as it moves to comply with
a provision of the U.S.''s Dodd-Frank financial rules that
prohibits banks from betting capital for their own accounts.
Nine employees left in October to start a unit at private equity
firm KKR  Co. that will invest in stocks. Pierre-Henri Flamand,
the former head of Goldman Sachs''s Principal Strategies group,
retired last year to start his own hedge fund. </p>
<p>Roskis and Benatoff didn''t immediately return phone calls
seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London
declined to comment. Jacob Lannero, a spokesman for Brummer 
Partners, declined to discuss Roskis and Benatoff''s plans. The
departures were reported earlier by the Financial Times. </p>
<p>Morgan Sze, who succeeded Flamand as Goldman Sachs''s global
head of the principal strategies unit, is starting a hedge fund
that will mostly invest in Asia. </p>
<p>Threadneedle Hire </p>
<p>Separately, Threadneedle Asset Management, a unit of Ameriprise Financial Inc., today hired Irina Miklavchich, an
executive director in Goldman Sachs''s Principal Strategies
group. Based in London, she will manage funds investing in
equities in emerging markets, the firm said in a statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs initially planned for most members of the
Principal Strategies unit to leave together and form a hedge
fund. The company then decided to disband the group, which had
about 70 employees, people familiar with the matter said in
September. Wall Street''s most profitable investment bank made
about 10 percent of its revenue from proprietary trading, Chief
Financial David Viniar said a year ago. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank Act, signed by U.S. President Barack Obama
in July, allows banks at least four years to bring their
proprietary trading into compliance with the law, according to
law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP. Congress approved the
legislation in an attempt to limit risky trading and investing
by depositary institutions in response to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression. </p>

Stanley said in a research note today. </p>
<p>We expect oil markets to tighten through this year,

<p> International Business Machines
Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Microsoft Corp. led the
winners of U.S. patents in 2010 during a 31 percent record jump
in grants of a main safeguard of intellectual property. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider, became
the first company to get more than 5,000 patents in a single
year, according to data from researcher IFI Claims Patent
Services. Samsung trailed IBM''s 5,896 patents with 4,551, while
Microsoft received 3,094, IFI said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office improved turnaround
times by processing applications more efficiently, contributing
to the most significant annual increase on record, IFI said.
The gain also shows the effects of the worst recession since the
Great Depression failed to deter companies from continuing to
innovate, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT, a
Hayward, California-based information technology researcher. </p>
<p>Significant temporary blips in the economy can''t be
something that derails dedication to technical excellence and
the next new thing, King said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The top 10 companies on IFI''s list -- all technology
related -- each saw an increase from the year earlier. In all,
the U.S. issued a record 219,614 utility patents in the calendar
year, according to the Wilmington, Delaware-based researcher. </p>
<p>Earthquake, Traffic Patents </p>
<p>IBM, the largest owner of U.S. patents, received protection
last year for an earthquake detection system, a way to predict
traffic and a computer chip that combines electrical and optical
devices on a single silicon wafer. IBM''s number of new patents
rose 20 percent in 2010, putting the Armonk, New York-based
company at the top of IFI''s list for the 18th straight year. </p>
<p>Not all of our inventions get commercialized, but
virtually all start with the research and intent to
commercialize them, Manny Schecter, IBM''s chief patent
counsel, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>The company spends $6 billion a year on research and
collects about $1 billion from its intellectual property, with
patent licensing the most common part, Schecter said. </p>
<p>Camera company Canon Inc. and plasma-TV maker Panasonic
Corp., both of Japan, rounded out the top five companies on the
IFI list. Apple Inc., maker of the iPad and iPhone, broke into
the top 50 for the first time, at No. 46, by almost doubling its
number of new patents to 563, according to IFI. Samsung''s number
increased 26 percent, while Microsoft''s rose 6.5 percent. </p>
<p>Micron Falls </p>
<p>Just one of the top 50 companies saw a decrease, computer-
memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc., IFI said. </p>
<p>IFI, a unit of Wolters Kluwer NV, conducts the survey each
year to rank 2,000 companies as part of its database system. </p>
<p>The tremendous increase in patent issues in 2010 suggests
that so far the economy doesn''t appear to have slowed patent
flow significantly in the U.S., Darlene Slaughter, general
manager of IFI, said in the statement. The bottom line: There
is still a backlog of patents pending, but the number of grants
continues to grow even after a period of economic downturn. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is changing
the way it discloses financial information, breaking up the unit
known as trading and principal investments that has provided
most of the firm''s earnings in the past decade. </p>
<p>A new division called institutional client services will
report revenue and pretax earnings from bond, currency,
commodity and stock trading as well as prime brokerage, New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in a report today. A unit called
investing and lending will show results from investments with
the firm''s own money. </p>
<p>The new system, which takes effect immediately, is a result
of the report issued today that also spells out efforts to
enhance the firm''s focus on clients. Providing separate figures
for how much Goldman Sachs makes from trading and investing with
its own money, considered a risky and unpredictable business,
may lead investors to assign more value to the rest of the
firm''s trading business, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at
Portales Partners in New York. </p>
<p>You''re going to get a better sense of what is really more
of a constant in terms of revenues versus what is volatility,
Peabody said. People will gain greater confidence on the
reproducibility of that trading revenue. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. may begin
restoring its dividend, cut during the height of the financial
crisis, in the second quarter, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. </p>
<p>We''re waiting for guidance from regulators about on what
basis are they going to let firms pay dividends, buy back stock
or do other things, Dimon said in an interview today on CNBC
television from the company''s annual health-care conference in San Francisco. Now it looks more like the second quarter. </p>
<p>The board hasn''t decided on a specific increase, with the
New York-based bank hoping eventually to pay 30 percent to 35
percent of normalized earnings, Dimon said earlier at the
conference. </p>
<p>We''re not going to do it in one jump. So we may do
something like 75 cents or a dollar, he told attendees. I
think we''re going to be allowed to pay a dividend, but I could
be sitting here a year from now and be embarrassed. </p>
<p>Dimon, 54, said in October that he was reasonably
hopeful the firm, which cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents
in 2009, will be able to raise that payment in 2011''s first
quarter and that regulators were open to the idea. JPMorgan has
been buying back its own stock in the meantime, repurchasing
$2.6 billion of shares through the third quarter. The bank is
scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings Jan. 14. </p>
<p>The biggest threat to the U.S. economy is the huge
fiscal deficit, which could crimp our style if not
addressed, Dimon said. While some municipalities may default on
their debts, it won''t be a disaster, he said. </p>
<p>Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$1.83 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis and the
highest U.S. jobless rate in 26 years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of new overdue loans eased over
the second and third quarters as the U.S. economy recovered. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will
disclose more financial information and change the way it sells
some products, according to a report prepared by a committee of
employees created after a U.S. regulator sued the firm for fraud
last year. </p>
<p>The report makes 39 recommendations about how New York-
based Goldman Sachs should change its business practices. </p>
<p>We act in many capacities, including as an advisor,
fiduciary, market maker and underwriter, the report said. We
must be clear to ourselves and our clients about the capacity in
which we are acting and the responsibilities we have assumed. </p>
<p>The recommendations emerged eight months after the firm
established a committee of employees led by E. Gerald Corrigan
and J. Michael Evans to review business standards in the wake of
the Securities and Exchange Commission''s fraud lawsuit. The
company settled the matter in July by agreeing to pay $550
million, and said it made a mistake in omitting disclosure
to investors. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will begin providing plain language
explanations to our clients about the firm''s conflicts-
resolution and business-selection processes, including
describing activities we may continue to conduct while we are
advising or financing a particular client, the report said. </p>
<p>The Business Standards Committee was established by Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein to examine the firm''s
responsibilities to clients, review how Goldman Sachs identifies
and manages conflicts of interest, and consider whether
financial reporting and public disclosure could improve. The
committee also looked at whether the firm was properly selling
complex products, adequately training employees and whether
firmwide operating committees could become more effective. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs will start breaking out four revenue areas
instead of three and will begin providing a simplified balance
sheet that shows assets by business unit and activity, the
report said. The firm will also begin providing more detail on
credit risk, operational risk and capital adequacy, the report
said. </p>

<p> Fujifilm Holdings Corp. won reversal of a 2004 verdict in

computer memory. </p>
<p>A judge erred in his interpretation of the patents owned by
closely held St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants Inc.,

with Fujifilm on the definition of key terms in the patents,
then there was no infringement. </p>
<p>In a 2-1 decision, the appeals court said that under the
correct interpretation of patent terms, there was no
infringement, and reversed the jury verdict. </p>

<p>Intel to Pay Nvidia $1.5 Billion; Both Cross-License Patents </p>
<p> Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. agreed to a long-term cross-
license agreement, ending a legal dispute over the use of each
other''s technology. </p>
<p>Intel will pay Nvidia $1.5 billion over the next five
years, and the companies will receive a license to each other''s
patents, subject to certain terms, Santa Clara, California-based
Intel said yesterday in a statement. </p>
<p>The dispute centered around Intel''s assertion in February
2009 that a license held by Nvidia didn''t cover future products.
Nvidia, a maker of graphics chips, then accused its larger rival
of breaching a contract that let the companies use each other''s
capabilities. </p>
<p>Nvidia supplied so-called chipsets that support older model
Intel microprocessors, providing a link to the rest of the
computer and graphics. Intel now includes that functionality in
its processors. </p>
<p>The agreement comes after Intel settled an antitrust case
with rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the U.S. government.
Intel is also fighting fines imposed by the European Union. </p>

deputy chief executive officer, said by phone today. The company
last year bought about 5.6 billion kilowatt-hours from China, he
said. The utility generated 97.3 billion kilowatt-hours in 2010,
a 15 percent increase from 2009, according to the company''s
report. </p>
<p>Electricity demand may rise about 15 percent as the economy
expands, according to Thanh. Vietnam''s gross domestic product
grew 6.8 percent last year, up from 5.3 percent in 2009. The
government is aiming for increase of about 7 percent for 2011
GDP growth. </p>
<p>The utility is asking the government to provide guarantee
to help it obtain loans from foreign banks as it will need at
least 13 trillion dong ($667 million) to develop its power
projects this year, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Electricity Vietnam has also asked the government to
provide assistance as it plans to sell $1 billion of bonds
abroad, according to the statement, without having a timeframe
for the sale. </p>
<p>The company was in talks with some international banks to
seek an adviser to help it sell up to $1 billion in overseas
bonds in 2011, Mai Quoc Hoi, head of finance and accounting at
the state-owned utility, said by phone in September. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. renewed its
November recommendation to buy gasoil futures as cold weather
spurs demand in Europe and China, even as blizzards undercut
consumption in the U.S. Northeast. </p>
<p>Investors should buy March 2011 contracts in London as
Europe consumes more heating fuel, Goldman analysts led by New
York-based David Greely said in a weekly report dated yesterday.
Continued power disruptions in China and floods in Australia''s
Queensland state, which may affect supply of thermal coal, will
boost diesel-fired power generation in the Asian country,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>Extreme weather is undercutting U.S. demand while
supporting demand in Europe and China, Goldman said in the
report. We continue to expect improving fundamentals to
provide additional support to prices. </p>
<p>Crude futures in New York rose for a fourth month in
December as arctic temperatures in Europe boosted demand for
heating fuels. Conversely, New York''s heaviest December
snowfalls in six decades cut transportation-fuel use in the
U.S., the world''s largest oil consumer, according to the Goldman
report. A new storm that forced the cancellation of thousands of
flights across the U.S. South yesterday may bring as much as 14
inches (36 centimeters) of snow to the East Coast. </p>
<p>Goldman on Nov. 10 said investors should buy January gasoil
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contracts,
which expire Jan. 31, have made a profit of $35.25 a metric ton,
the bank said. Its latest recommendation is to buy March
futures. </p>
<p>Heating Demand </p>
<p>Europe still relies quite heavily on oil for heating
purposes, the analysts said. The U.S. storms dumped between
12 and 32 inches of snow, crippling both private and public
transportation, grounding aircraft and trapping motorists at
home, Goldman said in the report. As a consequence, U.S.
demand for transportation fuels dropped. </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate, the crude traded in New York, may
remain discounted to London-traded Brent oil because stockpiles
are rising in the U.S. Midwest contrary to a wider drop in
supply, according to Goldman. </p>
<p>U.S. crude inventories shrank for a fifth week in the seven
days ended Dec. 31 to 335.3 million barrels, the Energy
Department said last week. That''s the longest stretch of
declines since July 2009. </p>
<p>Supplies from Canada and increased production has led to a
surplus in the U.S. Midwest that needs to be shifted to the Gulf
Coast through a realignment of pipeline infrastructure,
Goldman said. </p>
<p>The discount of West Texas to Brent yesterday widened to
$6.45 a barrel, the most since February 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was at $6.24 today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, on Dec. 16 said investors should sell West Texas
contracts and buy Brent to profit from the widening spread. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
biggest brokerage, is struggling to prove its new model works
after failing to ride a surge in equity and bond markets. </p>
<p>The firm''s post-crisis strategy of relying more on its
18,000 brokers and less on debt-fueled risk-taking has yet to
lure investors to the stock, which slid 8 percent last year,
underperforming rivals. As the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index rose
13 percent and corporate bonds returned almost 11 percent in
2010, analysts cut estimates for the bank''s full-year earnings. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, shortly after he took
over the top job last January, said 2009 was a year of
transition for the firm and that 2010 would be the year of
execution for Morgan Stanley. By October, that outlook had
changed, as Gorman, 52, said Morgan Stanley was still in a
transition period and remains a work in progress. </p>
<p>When a CEO says that, it means he knows he still has some
near-term challenges and that he''s very conscious of not trying
to encourage unrealistic expectations, said Chris Kotowski, an
analyst at Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. To me, that''s better
than saying reassuring things and then not delivering. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which reports fourth-quarter results next
week, lagged behind Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. in fixed-income trading in the first nine months, the
second year it has done so. The New York-based firm, the sixth-
largest U.S. bank by assets with more than 62,000 employees,
backed off its profit-margin goals for the brokerage in July,
blaming the May 6 market crash that briefly wiped out $862
billion in equity market value for scaring away retail investors. </p>

<p> Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, is seeking to sell stakes held by subsidiary XTO in
certain North Sea blocks off the U.K. coast. </p>
<p>The company is offering its 15 percent stake in blocks that
include the Platypus natural-gas discovery, operated by Dana
Petroleum, as well as a 33 percent stake in a Witch Ground
Graben block, according to a posting on a Schlumberger Ltd.-
operated website. </p>
<p>The North Sea auction is part of Exxon Mobil Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson''s plan to shed assets acquired
during its purchase of XTO last year that won''t generate high
enough returns to meet Exxon''s internal profit targets. </p>
<p>We will test the interest of other companies in
particular assets that we think could have relatively higher
value in their portfolios than in ours, Patrick McGinn, a
spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mail
today. McGinn declined to comment on a potential price for the
assets. </p>
<p>The Platypus well found about 130 billion cubic feet of
gas, according to a filing from the operator, Dana Petroleum,
which was acquired last year by Korea National Oil Corp. The
well was drilled in a water depth of about 142 feet (43 meters)
to a total depth of 11,048 feet, Exxon said in today''s posting.
Dana holds a 45 percent interest in the Platypus discovery,
according to its website. </p>
<p>Exxon said it was willing to consider a transaction that
includes an asset exchange, cash or some combination. Offers on
the blocks are due by March 31, McGinn said. </p>
<p>Online and physical data rooms will open Jan. 24, according
to Exxon''s posting. A data room is where potential suitors can
get more information about the geological features and other
characteristics of oil fields. </p>
<p>Exxon rose 89 cents to $76.58 as of 4:09 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable Wall Street firm, and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.
continue to do business together even as the insurer sues the
bank for securities fraud. </p>
<p>They''re really smart and good people, Edmund Ted Kelly, chief executive officer of Boston-based Liberty Mutual,
said yesterday in an interview. We just have some
differences. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs misled investors in 2007 when it sold Fannie
Mae preferred shares and bet against the U.S. mortgage market,
according to a July 8 complaint by Liberty Mutual. The lawsuit
is without merit and Goldman Sachs will contest it
vigorously, spokesman Michael DuVally said at the time. He
declined to comment today. </p>
<p>Liberty Mutual''s lawsuit came after New York-based Goldman
Sachs was criticized in Congress and sued by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission for transactions tied to the mortgage
market. The Fannie Mae shares that Goldman Sachs helped sell in
2007 were virtually worthless the next year when the
mortgage-financing firm fell into government conservatorship,
Liberty Mutual said in the lawsuit. </p>
<p>Kelly didn''t elaborate on the business Liberty Mutual does
with the bank. He declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was
filed in U.S. District Court in Boston and transferred in
December to New York. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs agreed in July to pay $550 million and change
its business practices to settle the SEC''s claim that the bank
sold a collateralized debt obligation without disclosing that a
hedge fund helped pick underlying securities and bet against the
vehicles. </p>
<p>The case is Liberty Mutual v. Goldman Sachs, 10-cv-09184,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, closed fundraising for its first corporate
mezzanine fund, Morgan Stanley Credit Partners LP, with $956
million in capital commitments. </p>
<p>The fund, which invests in fixed-income securities issued
by mid-sized corporations, has already invested more than $160
million in five companies, New York-based Morgan Stanley said
today in a statement. The fund will focus on companies in North
America and Western Europe, according to the statement. </p>
<p>The fund is part of the firm''s merchant-banking business,
which includes real estate, private equity and infrastructure
funds and accounts for $24 billion of Morgan Stanley Investment
Management''s $273 billion in assets under management. MSIM, run
by Gregory Fleming, returned to profitability in 2010 after two
years of pretax losses. </p>
<p>The market for mezzanine-debt investing is benefiting
from favorable secular trends resulting from an underlying
imbalance between the demand for and the supply of capital,
particularly for middle market companies, Hank D''Alessandro,
head of Morgan Stanley Credit Partners, said in the statement.
We already have a robust investment pipeline in place, and we
believe the fund is well-positioned to continue to benefit from
these dynamics. </p>
<p>The fund''s target investment size is $20 million to $50
million and it may partner with other funds for larger
transactions, according to its website. D''Alessandro, who joined
Morgan Stanley in 1997, was previously head of the firm''s U.S.
financial sponsor leveraged-finance business. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is changing
the way it discloses financial information, breaking up the unit
known as trading and principal investments that has dominated
revenue in recent years. </p>
<p>A new division called institutional client services will
report revenue and pretax earnings from bond, currency,
commodity and stock trading as well as prime brokerage, New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in a report yesterday. A unit
called investing and lending will show results from investments
with the firm''s own money. </p>
<p>Under the previous reporting system, Goldman Sachs said
third-quarter 2010 pretax earnings from trading and principal
investments were $2.37 billion, or 84 percent of the total.
Under the new reporting system, institutional client services
accounted for $1.5 billion of pretax earnings and investing and
lending accounted for $846 million, New York-based Goldman Sachs
said in a regulatory filing yesterday. </p>
<p>Fixed-income, currencies and commodities, known as FICC,
the company''s largest revenue source, shrinks under the new
reporting system, and equities-trading revenue increased under
the new disclosures. Investment-banking revenue that totaled
$1.12 billion under the old reporting system changes to $1.16
billion. </p>
<p>The changes were part of a series of recommendations
prepared by a committee of employees created after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud last
year. </p>
<p>The report makes 39 recommendations about how Goldman Sachs
should change its business practices. </p>

<p>Money Funds Push $24 Billion Backstop as Rules Clash Looms </p>
<p>The mutual-fund industry fleshed out a plan for a private
backstop to money-market funds, rejecting alternatives
considered by U.S. regulators that include abolishing the funds''
stable $1 net asset value. </p>
<p>The industry''s plan, proposed in a letter by the
Washington-based Investment Company Institute, calls for fund
companies to finance a private bank with $350 million in assets
that would grow to $24 billion after 10 years. Other options are
impractical, unworkable or fail to address the most important
risk to money funds, the ICI said in its letter. </p>
<p>The rejection puts the fund industry on a collision course
with officials from the Treasury Department and the Securities
and Exchange Commission, who said several ideas laid out in
October by a White House advisory body remain on the table.
Regulators last year enacted one round of rule changes for the
funds to prevent a repeat of the run on money funds that
followed the collapse of the Reserve Primary fund in the
financial crisis. </p>
<p>The ICI''s submission included a new outline for a private
liquidity facility, first pitched in March. The plan would
create an emergency pool of cash, chartered as a bank or trust,
that would buy commercial paper at full value from prime funds
in the event of another crisis. All prime funds would be
required to participate. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank financial overhaul signed into law in July
has made it more difficult for the Fed to make similar emergency
bailouts, and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, under which the
Treasury insured money funds, has expired. </p>
<p>Following the public comment period that ended Jan. 10, the
issue goes to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. </p>

<p>U.S. Government Contractors Face New Minority Hiring Mandate </p>
<p>U.S. financial regulators are required to open 20 offices
this month endowed with new powers to force government
contractors and subcontractors to diversify their staffs or risk
losing federal business. </p>
<p>The Dodd-Frank law orders U.S. financial regulators to set
up Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion to monitor whether
they and their contractors are hiring enough women and
minorities -- a mandate that could have far-reaching effects on
public and private-sector hiring. </p>
<p>The offices are being established at agencies ranging from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to each of the 12 Federal
Reserve banks. Among other duties, staff will scrutinize hiring
at firms that do business with the regulators and take steps to
terminate contracts if the companies haven''t made an adequate
effort to employ women and minorities. </p>
<p>Congressional Democrats pushed to include the new offices
in the law because some were unhappy that few of the major
contracts awarded by government agencies in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis went to minority-owned firms. </p>
<p>The law requires each new office to develop and apply a
policy that will ensure to the maximum extent possible the
fair inclusion of women and minorities in the contracting
process. The federal government defines a minority-owned
business as one that is at least 51 percent-owned and operated
by U.S. citizens who are Asian, black, Hispanic or American
Indian. </p>

<p>Wall Street Lobbyists Fight Ownership Caps on Swaps Exchanges </p>
<p>Capping banks'' ownership stakes in clearinghouses,
exchanges or so-called swap execution facility would have
potentially profound implications for future market
structure, financial-industry lobbyists said yesterday. </p>
<p>They made the statement in a letter to regulators drafting
rules to govern derivatives markets. </p>
<p>The letter was written in response to Justice Department
support for more stringent regulation and urges the
Commodity Future Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange
Commission in the strongest possible terms to forego the
adoption of any aggregate ownership limits. It was signed by
groups including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association, International Swaps and Derivatives Association and
Financial Services Roundtable. </p>
<p>Christine A. Varney, assistant attorney general in the
Justice Department''s antitrust division, expressed support for
aggregate ownership caps in a Dec. 28 letter to regulators. </p>
<p>The CFTC is scheduled to meet on Jan. 13 to complete a
proposal for ownership and governance limits as part of new
regulations required under the Dodd-Frank Act. </p>
<p>Basel to Set Rules on Debt Securities for Bank Rescues </p>
<p>Global banking regulators may decide as soon as this week
on criteria that debt securities must meet to count as capital,
ensuring they contribute to rescuing international lenders on
the brink of failure. </p>
<p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is seeking to
ensure the instruments can absorb losses or be converted to
common equity to aid a bank in distress when they are counted as
part of a lenders'' capital. The proposals are scheduled to be
published in the next few days, the Basel group said in an
e-mail yesterday. </p>
<p>Regulators are aiming to avoid a repeat of the financial
turmoil that followed the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. The European Commission on Jan. 6 proposed that
authorities may be allowed to write down senior debt before
relying on the taxpayer to save a failing lender. </p>
<p>It''s a likely outcome that this month''s proposal will
include the main ideas of a draft version that was put out for
consultation last August, according to Jonas Niemeyer, who
represents the Swedish central bank at the Basel committee. He
made the remarks in a telephone interview. </p>

<p>SEC Inspector General Probes Khuzami''s Role in Citi Settlement </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission''s internal
watchdog is reviewing an allegation that Robert Khuzami, the
agency''s top enforcement official, gave preferential treatment
to Citigroup Inc. executives in the agency''s $75 million
settlement with the firm in July. </p>
<p>Inspector General H. David Kotz opened the probe after a
request from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican,
who forwarded an unsigned letter making the allegation. Khuzami
told his staff to soften claims against two executives after
conferring with a lawyer representing the bank, according to the
letter. Jon Diat, a Citigroup spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Citigroup agreed in July to pay $75 million to resolve SEC
claims that the bank understated investments linked to subprime
mortgages as the housing crisis unfolded. The two men settled
without admitting or denying the SEC''s allegations. </p>
<p>The settlement appropriately held the company and
individuals accountable, John Nester, an SEC spokesman, said
Jan. 10 in a statement issued after Khuzami was asked to
comment. We stand ready to assist and cooperate with the IG''s
review. </p>
<p>The agency''s settlement was questioned in August by U.S.
District Judge Ellen Huvelle, who eventually approved it. </p>

<p> Shanghai Removes Exchange Hurdle for Foreign Private Equity </p>
<p>Shanghai''s government said it will allow foreign private-
equity firms to convert money raised overseas into yuan for
local investments, removing a key hurdle for firms including Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle Group. </p>
<p>The pilot program will initially be open to qualified
foreign investors with at least $1 billion of assets under
management or $500 million of owned assets, according to a
statement on the website of the Shanghai Financial Services
Office. </p>
<p>Foreign private-equity investors have been faced with
restrictions on buying in China, which limits access to
industries it designates as strategic and imposes capital
controls. </p>
<p>Korea Tightens Derivatives Rules After Nov. 11 Tumble </p>
<p>South Korea''s financial regulators will limit the number of
derivative equity contracts an investor can hold as authorities
continue investigating the cause of a plunge in the Kospi Index
on Nov. 11. </p>
<p>Institutional investors will be allowed a maximum of 10,000
futures and options contracts in any speculative, or open
and unhedged transaction, the Financial Services Commission, the
government''s policy-making body, said in an e-mailed statement,
without saying when the new rule will become effective. While
institutions are now limited to 7,500 futures contracts and
individuals can hold 5,000 futures contracts, there are no
limits on options. </p>
<p>Laos Regulator Expects Companies to Raise $8 Billion </p>
<p>Laos, Southeast Asia''s smallest economy, expects private
companies and state-run enterprises to raise at least $8 billion
in equity and bond sales in the next five years to fund
investments, the market regulator said. </p>
<p>The communist country opened a stock exchange yesterday,
aiming to integrate with the global economy and join the World
Trade Organization. The exchange will facilitate trading of
government and corporate debt under its five-year plan, allowing
bonds and equities to replace bank loans as the biggest source
of capital for local companies, said Vathana Dalaloy, the acting
secretary general of Laos''s Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Swiss Banks See Tax as Bigger Threat Than Basel, Survey Finds </p>
<p>Swiss banks see measures to curb secrecy and tax evasion as
a bigger threat in 2011 than higher capital-adequacy
requirements, according to a survey by Ernst  Young AG. </p>
<p>Twenty-four percent of the lenders consider Switzerland''s
double-tax and fiscal information-sharing agreements to be their
biggest concern, the consultants'' firm said in a study released
yesterday in Zurich. That compares with 5 percent who cited new
capital and liquidity rules. </p>
<p>Switzerland has signed information-exchange treaties with
countries wanting to know about their nationals'' holdings in
Swiss banks, and agreed to start talks on taxing the Swiss
assets of people living in the U.K. and Germany. Moves to end
Switzerland''s bank secrecy will force shareholders to accept
lower returns, said Iqbal Khan, an Ernst  Young partner. </p>
<p>A panel appointed by the Swiss government last year
proposed that UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG should have
capital equivalent to at least 19 percent of their assets,
compared with the 10.5 percent needed under the Basel III rules. </p>
<p>Banks Said to Face EU Tests on Capital, Liquidity </p>
<p>European Union regulators are scheduled to discuss plans to
conduct separate stress tests on bank capital and liquidity
provisions at a meeting today, a person familiar with the
negotiations said. </p>
<p>Supervisors at the European Banking Authority in London
will decide what sort of information lenders should provide for
this year''s EU-wide stress tests on capital, as well as possible
exams on liquidity, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the meetings are private. Regulators will
also choose an interim chairman to manage the EBA until a
permanent chief is installed later this year. </p>
<p>The 2010 European stress tests were criticized for not
being stringent enough because lenders were shown by regulators
to need only 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of new capital,
about a 10th of the lowest analyst estimate. The European
Commission is pushing to include tests on bank liquidity in this
year''s stress tests in the wake of Ireland''s financial turmoil. </p>
<p>Lenders may escape examination of their sovereign debt
holdings in this year''s round of European stress tests,
according to a document from the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors. </p>

<p>Schwab Agrees to Pay $119 Million to Settle SEC Claims </p>
<p> Charles Schwab Corp. will pay $119 million to settle U.S.
regulatory claims that the San Francisco-based brokerage misled
investors in its YieldPlus Fund and changed investment strategy
without shareholder approval. </p>
<p>The YieldPlus Fund fell to $1.8 billion in assets in 2008
from a peak of $13.5 billion in 2007 after deviating from its
stated policy by investing more than 25 percent of fund assets
in private-issuer, mortgage-backed securities, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said yesterday in a complaint filed at
federal court in San Francisco. Schwab executives Kimon Daifotis
and Randall Merk committed fraud in offering, selling and
managing the fund, the SEC said. </p>
<p>Schwab, the largest independent brokerage by client assets,
settled the regulator''s claims without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. The case against Daifotis and Merk is continuing,
said the SEC, which is seeking unspecified fines and
disgorgement of any ill-gotten profits from the two men. </p>
<p>Daifotis''s attorney David Bayless said his client plans to
contest the SEC''s allegations in court. Merk also plans to fight
the SEC''s claims, his attorney Susan Brune said in a statement. </p>
<p>Schwab would never seek to profit at the expense of its
own clients, and will continue to work to bring the matter to
a conclusion, the company said in a statement. </p>
<p>The SEC settlement also resolves related claims by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Illinois regulators. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street''s most profitable investment bank, predicts the Standard
 Poor''s 500 Index will rally 18 percent to 1,500 by the end of
December and Treasuries will have a decent year. </p>
<p>We have a very out-of-consensus view for how much the
economy can grow before this growth generates higher inflation
and interest rates, Jan Hatzius, the company''s New York-based
chief U.S. economist, wrote in a report he distributed by e-mail
today. If we''re right, the likely implication is a decent
environment for the Treasury bond market and a very good
environment for the equity market. </p>
<p>The SP 500 has climbed 12 percent over the past year,
rising to the highest level since Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.''s bankruptcy in September 2008 as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pumps $600 billion into the economy and President Barack Obama extends tax cuts. An advance to 1,500 would result
in a 19 percent gain for the year. The index has only risen that
much twice in the past decade, gaining 23 percent in 2009 and 26
percent in 2003. </p>
<p>U.S. three-month bill rates will average 0.2 percent in
2011 and 0.3 percent in 2012, the report said, compared with
0.14 percent today. Ten-year Treasury yields will rise to 3.75
percent by Dec. 31 from 3.35 percent now, according to Goldman,
which is one of the 18 primary dealers that are authorized to
trade directly with the Federal Reserve. </p>
<p>Quicker Growth </p>
<p>The world''s biggest economy will expand 3.4 percent this
year, the report said, quickening from 2.6 percent in the third
quarter of 2010, which are the most recent figures available. </p>
<p>The U.S. consumer price index will increase 1.7 percent,
Goldman predicts, versus 1.1 percent that the government
reported for November from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Low inflation helps preserve the value of a bond''s fixed
payments. Ten-year real rates, what investors get after
accounting for costs in the economy, have doubled over the past
year to 2.24 percent. </p>
<p>Today''s report reiterated forecasts for the SP 500 and 10-
year yields that Goldman Sachs issued at the end of 2010 and
earlier this year. </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he expects more U.S.
municipalities to declare bankruptcy and urged caution when
investing in the $2.9 trillion public-debt market. </p>
<p>There have been six or seven municipal bankruptcies
already, Dimon, 54, said yesterday at his company''s annual
health-care conference in San Francisco. I think unfortunately
you will see more. </p>
<p>Cities including Detroit and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, have
raised the prospect of bankruptcy. Still, the number of filings
has declined. Five municipal entities sought protection in 2010
compared with 10 in 2009, according to data compiled by James Spiotto, head of the bankruptcy practice at Chapman  Cutler, a
Chicago law firm. The biggest last year was a South Carolina
toll road with more than $300 million in debt, he said. </p>
<p>U.S. states will contend with about $140 billion in
deficits in the next fiscal year, the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, said in a report
issued Dec. 16. Edmund Ted Kelly, CEO of Liberty Mutual
Holding Co., said yesterday that his firm had reduced holdings
of municipal debt in Connecticut, California and Illinois. </p>
<p>The market is being held up to some extent by the belief
that the federal government will bail out state and local
issuers, Kelly said in an interview. </p>
<p>Vallejo, California, filed for bankruptcy in 2008 after
failing to win union pay cuts. Detroit Public Schools, which
considered bankruptcy protection last year, said this month the
district may try a restructuring to deal with a $327 million
deficit. </p>
<p>Yield Soars </p>
<p>Tax-exempt municipal-bond yields soared amid a U.S.
Treasury selloff and expiration of the federally subsidized
Build America Bond program in last year''s fourth quarter. The
securities lost 4.5 percent in that period, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Municipal Master Index, the worst
performance in more than 16 years. </p>
<p>If you are an investor in municipals you should be very,
very careful, Dimon said at the conference. </p>
<p>Companies including Allstate Corp., the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, have been reducing holdings
of municipal debt. Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
trimmed its investment in municipal debt, predicted last year a
terrible problem for the bonds. </p>
<p>Liberty Mutual had about $13.7 billion in municipal
securities as of Sept. 30, or about 20 percent of invested
assets, compared with $15.5 billion and 23 percent at the end of
2009, according to company statements. The Sept. 30 total
includes $372 million from the state of Florida and $278 million
from the state of California. </p>
<p>States'' Ratings </p>
<p>The company, based in Boston, still has holdings from the
three states, Kelly said. California and Illinois are rated A1
by Moody''s Investors Service, the lowest among the states and
the company''s sixth-highest ranking. Connecticut is rated Aa2,
Moody''s fourth-highest. </p>
<p>Gregory Whiteley, U.S. government portfolio manager at Los
Angeles-based investment firm DoubleLine Capital LP, suggested
in a report yesterday that investors consider municipal bonds
because the risk of bankruptcy is low. </p>
<p>The financial stress of state and local governments has
given rise to an unusual investment opportunity, he wrote. </p>

<p>Nintendo Co.''s Wii edged out Microsoft Corp.''s Xbox 360 as the best-selling video-game
console in the U.S. after Microsoft was unable to meet demand
for its Kinect motion-sensing peripheral, the companies said. </p>
<p>Nintendo sold more than 2.3 million Wii consoles in
December, the Kyoto, Japan-based company said in a statement,
citing figures from researcher NPD Group Inc. The company said
it sold more than 2.5 million Nintendo DS handheld systems. </p>
<p>Total industry sales for the month fell 9 percent to $5.06
billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier, when Nintendo and Sony Corp. cut prices of their video-game consoles, Port Washington, New York-based NPD said in a statement. </p>
<p>Microsoft sold 1.9 million consoles in December, the
biggest one-month total for the Xbox 360, David Dennis, group
product manager with Xbox, said today, citing NPD. The figures
track sales in the five-week period beginning Nov. 28. </p>
<p>We would have sold more had we not run out of supply in
late December, Dennis said in an interview. We
air-freighted stuff in December, but you can only sell as many
as you can make. </p>
<p>Retailers will continue to see pockets of
supply constraints through early February, he said. </p>
<p>Industry sales of software fell 8 percent to $2.37 billion,
while sales of accessories including Kinect and Sony''s Move
motion-controller jumped 10 percent to $853.2 million, NPD said. </p>
<p>Online Sales </p>
<p>Including games sold or rented digitally and online, video-
game sales for the year were unchanged to down 1 percent at
$15.4 billion to $15.6 billion, NPD estimated. </p>
<p>The increasing number of ways to acquire the content has
allowed the industry to maintain total consumer spend on content
as compared to 2009, Anita Frazier, an NPD analyst, said in
the statement. </p>
<p>Xbox 360, released in November 2005, is benefiting from a
June console redesign, followed by the Nov. 4 introduction of
the Kinect add-on. Consumers spent $6.2 billion on Xbox hardware
and software last year, more than any other console, the company
said, citing NPD figures. </p>
<p>Microsoft,  based in Redmond, Washington, has shipped more
than 8 million Kinect sensors for its Xbox device, topping the
company''s forecasts, and now has 30 million users for the
related Xbox Live online service. </p>
<p>NPD stopped reporting unit sales of consoles in September.
The industry tracker now releases monthly revenue for video-game
hardware, software and peripherals. Console makers are free to
report their own unit sales. </p>

<p> General Maritime Corp., the second-
largest U.S. owner of oil tankers, may be forced to sell one or
more of its vessels to pay $22.8 million of debt due Jan. 18,
according to a person with knowledge of the company''s plans. </p>
<p>The New York-based company may sell a supertanker or three
smaller oil-product carriers to raise funds to meet outstanding
obligations to Nordea Bank Finland Plc of Helsinki and DnB Nor
Bank ASA of Oslo, said the person, who declined to be named
because the plans haven''t been made public. </p>
<p>The two lenders agreed on Dec. 14 to extend the due date,
originally set for Dec. 15, to Jan. 15, according to a General
Maritime filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As
Jan. 15 falls on a weekend, the debt will be due on Jan. 18, the
day after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, the person said. </p>
<p>General Maritime''s total debt was $1.4 billion at the end
of September, or about 74 percent of its total assets, according
to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Without a rebound in ship prices, the company could
remain under pressure until a longer-term liquidity solution is
reached, Michael Webber, senior analyst at Wells Fargo
Securities LLC in New York, wrote in a report to clients last
month. </p>
<p>The logical candidates for sale are tankers without
mortgages or debt, the person said. The Genmar Vision, a
supertanker built in 2001, currently has no mortgage, according
to the company. </p>
<p>Another Extension </p>
<p>General Maritime might request another debt extension if it
fails to sell a vessel by Jan. 18, the person said. </p>
<p>As we have previously disclosed, the company is
considering potential asset disposition, said Chief Financial
Officer Jeffrey Pribor. However we won''t comment on any
particular potential transaction. </p>
<p>Prices of five-year-old supertankers averaged $85.3 million
in the week ended Jan. 10, according to the London-based Baltic
Exchange. That''s down 47 percent from a 2008 high of $162
million. The ships, also known as very large crude carriers, can
carry about 2 million barrels of oil. </p>
<p>An 11-year-old VLCC was sold for $55 million in December,
according to Wells Fargo''s Webber. </p>
<p>Asset prices are going south, said Basil Karatzas,
managing director at ship sale and purchase broker Compass
Maritime Services in Fort Lee, New Jersey. There are not many
drivers for now, and supply keeps increasing. Likely more tanker
owners will have problems. </p>
<p>General Maritime owns 38 tankers, including seven VLCCs,
according to the company. New York-based Overseas Shipholding
Group, which operates about 110 ships, is the biggest U.S.
tanker owner. </p>
<p>General Maritime fell 5 cents to $3.34, or 1.5 percent, at
11:53 a.m. in the New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Earlier it rose as much as 7 cents to $3.46. The shares have
declined 60 percent over the last year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will probably report record
earnings of about $16.7 billion for last year boosted by a
reduction in reserves for future losses. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter results, which the New York-based company
plans to announce tomorrow, are likely to show a profit of $4.2
billion, or $1 per share, based on the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. About 40 percent of earnings for
the first nine months came from money taken from loss reserves
as U.S. banks dip into their funds, at least temporarily, and
mask a revenue squeeze. </p>
<p>Don''t pay attention to the bottom line EPS numbers,
said Chris Kotowski, managing director of research at
Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. Reserve accounting distorts
what''s reported as earnings. It''s not like it''s just JPMorgan.
It''s the entire industry. </p>
<p>Reserves are typically released back into earnings if the
losses they were meant to cover don''t materialize or if the
company''s outlook improves. Such reserve bleeds will also
boost 2011 results, especially if the economy continues to
rebound, Betsy Graseck, a bank analyst at Morgan Stanley, said
in a Dec. 1 research report. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. may benefit the most from releasing reserves
in 2012, according to Graseck, who estimated a 19 percent boost
to per-share profits for the New York-based bank based on
historical reserve practices. </p>
<p>Bank of America </p>
<p>Among the largest U.S. lenders, JPMorgan, Bank of America
Corp. and Wells Fargo  Co. stand to derive 4 percent, 10
percent and 5 percent of their 2012 earnings from reserve
releases alone, Graseck said. </p>
<p>If the economy accelerates, the reserve bleed could punch
EPS even higher in 2011 and 2012, Graseck said. </p>
<p>Banks got dinged when they were building reserves, so
when you release reserves it goes directly to the capital
account, said bank analyst Jason Goldberg of Barclays Capital
in New York. It is real capital even if it''s not considered
real earnings. </p>
<p>Reserves hurt bank earnings while they''re being built up.
JPMorgan said it added about $5.2 billion to its litigation
reserves during the first three quarters last year. Reserve
accounting will probably continue to distort earnings over the
next year or two, analysts said. </p>
<p>Foreclosures, Litigation </p>
<p>The banking industry is still struggling with escalating
foreclosures, increasing litigation costs and anemic loan
growth, which are all eating into revenue. JPMorgan''s revenue,
which slumped 11 percent in the third quarter, remained weak in
the fourth quarter, Goldberg said. </p>
<p>Profit margins at JPMorgan, the first of the largest U.S.
banks to report earnings, narrowed in the third quarter as
revenue from investment banking and card services tumbled from a
year earlier and non-interest expenses rose 7 percent. </p>
<p>While they benefit from reserve releases, you''re still
facing the detriment of elevated loan-loss provisioning, some
more subdued loan growth, the impact of prolonged low interest
rates and elevated mortgage repurchase costs, Goldberg said. </p>
<p>Investors should expect some bumpiness or lumpiness in
trading results in the fourth quarter, although it should be
better than the previous three months, Kotowski said. Fixed-
income revenue was $3.1 billion in the third quarter, compared
with $5 billion a year earlier and $3.6 billion in the second
quarter. </p>
<p>Price Targets </p>
<p>Kotowski is among analysts who have raised their price
targets and earnings estimates on JPMorgan and other banks in
the past month amid signs that the improving economy may benefit
bank stocks. </p>
<p>It''s more important to focus on the fundamentals rather
than the noise, Kotowski said. JPMorgan''s core earnings
power is quite stable and robust. He said that pre-provision
earnings, which back out all reserving, were running at an
annual rate of $47 billion during the first nine months last
year, compared with $48 billion for all of 2009. </p>
<p>Credit card charge-offs dropped from 8.35 percent in the
third quarter to 7.51 percent in October and November, which is
a broadly positive indication, Kotowski said. </p>
<p>Loan growth is shrinking at a slower pace. Loan volumes
dropped 0.5 percent from September to December, which is an
improvement from a 1.1 percent decrease the quarter before and a
4.4 percent quarterly drop at its worst pace in late 2009,
Kotowski said, citing Federal Reserve data. </p>
<p>Shrinking Loans </p>
<p>Credit quality is steadily getting better, Kotowski
said. Loans are still shrinking but a lot less than they were
and they show every sign of turning around in the next two
quarters. </p>
<p>Mike Mayo, an analyst at Credit Agricole, increased his
earnings estimate for JPMorgan from 97 cents to 99 cents a share
on Jan. 7 due to the better economic outlook. Matt O''Connor, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, upped his estimates on
the expectation that banks will use excess reserves to raise
dividends or buy back stock. </p>
<p>JPMorgan investors may see their quarterly dividend, which
was cut to 5 cents in 2009, rise in the second quarter, Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a Jan. 11 interview on
CNBC television. </p>
<p>We''re waiting for guidance from regulators about on what
basis are they going to let firms pay dividends, buy back stock
or do other things, Dimon, 54, said from the company''s annual
health-care conference in San Francisco. </p>
<p>The board hasn''t decided on a specific increase, with the
bank hoping eventually to pay 30 percent to 35 percent of
normalized earnings, Dimon said. </p>
<p>Dividend, Buybacks </p>
<p>Dimon said in October that he was reasonably hopeful
the firm will be able to raise the payment in 2011''s first
quarter and that regulators were open to the idea. JPMorgan has
been buying back its own stock in the meantime, repurchasing
$2.6 billion of shares through the third quarter. </p>
<p>The KBW Bank Index of 24 stocks has dropped 56 percent
since its February 2007 peak after the U.S. housing bubble burst
and left banks grappling with the worst economy since the Great
Depression. Investors in JPMorgan, the only major Wall Street
firm to post profits in every quarter throughout the recession,
lost 14 percent during the same period. </p>
<p>Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank behind JPMorgan and
Bank of America, may report fourth-quarter earnings of $2.2
billion when it releases results on Jan. 18, the survey of
analysts shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
may report a profit of $2.5 billion on Jan. 21. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, posted a record $4.83 billion
profit, buoyed by $2 billion in reserves added back to earnings
as credit quality and the U.S. economy improved. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter net income, which rose 47 percent, was $1.12
a share, compared with $3.28 billion, or 74 cents, in the same
period of 2009, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. The results compared with an average per-share
estimate for adjusted earnings of $1 projected by 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The shares rose as much as 2.9 percent to
a nine-month high. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, was
the only major U.S. bank to remain profitable throughout the
financial crisis. The company''s record $17.4 billion in earnings
last year were boosted by about $7 billion in pretax reserve
releases on the better economic forecast, an improvement that
Dimon, 54, said he doesn''t count as actual earnings. </p>
<p>We only take down reserves pretty much when we have to
because of accounting requirements, Dimon told reporters on a
conference call today. We don''t really want to. It isn''t like
we''re doing it to report earnings. I don''t look at it as
earnings. </p>
<p>JPMorgan rose 46 cents, or 1 percent, to $44.91 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The cost to protect the
company''s debt declined as credit-default swaps fell 1.4 basis
points to 79.1 basis points, according to broker Phoenix
Partners Group. </p>
<p>CDS Prices Rise </p>
<p>Five of the six businesses are showing improvements,
said Richard Bove, a bank analyst at Rochdale Securities in
Lutz, Florida. The revenue momentum is positive. </p>
<p>Dimon reiterated his desire to restore the company''s
quarterly dividend, which was cut to 5 cents a share in 2009, as
soon as regulators allow. For Bove, these are the factors that
will push the stock up or down ultimately, not the accounting
mumbo-jumbo with reserves. </p>
<p>The credit-card division, which lost money for all of 2009,
generated 27 percent of JPMorgan''s net income for the quarter.
The investment bank accounted for 31 percent. </p>
<p>While Dimon called the U.S. housing market still
terrible, he said it''s better than it was a year ago. The
bank put $1.5 billion in litigation reserves to cover costs
related to buying back faulty mortgages. It also set aside $2.1
billion more against soured loans from Washington Mutual, the
lender JPMorgan bought in 2008. </p>
<p>Private Label </p>
<p>Dimon said most of the new litigation reserves are intended
for so-called private-label mortgages, which are not insured by
the federal government or federally controlled mortgage
companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He said it will take years
to resolve those disputes and to determine the ultimate cost to
JPMorgan. </p>
<p>It''s going to be a long ugly mess, but it won''t be life-
threatening to JPMorgan, he told analysts on a separate call.
We will be talking about this for every quarter over the next
three years. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. lender behind
JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp., may report fourth-quarter
profit of $2.19 billion when it releases results on Jan. 18, the
survey of analysts shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank
of America may report a profit of $2.61 billion on Jan. 21. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter revenue at JPMorgan rose 13 percent to $26.1
billion. Fixed-income and equity markets revenue was $4 billion,
compared with $3.7 billion a year earlier and $4.3 billion in
the third quarter. </p>
<p>Credit Cards </p>
<p>While home-lending and credit-card losses continued to
weigh on earnings, the company set aside fewer provisions for
future losses in both divisions and released $2 billion in
reserves against credit-card loans. </p>
<p>Fewer consumers fell behind on their credit-card payments
in the fourth quarter. Thirty-day delinquency rates dropped to
4.1 percent from 6.3 percent in the same quarter in 2009 and 4.6
percent in the third quarter. The rate of credit cards charged
off as bad debt also fell to 7.8 percent from 9.3 percent the
prior year and 8.9 percent in the previous quarter. </p>
<p>Consumer credit continues to improve across the board,
said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve Bank and analyst at FBR Capital Markets. </p>
<p>Retail banking earned $708 million, compared with $907
million during the third quarter and a $399 million loss a year
earlier. The division benefited from a $1.8 billion reduction in
provisions to $2.5 billion, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>Card Services </p>
<p>Credit-card services earned $1.3 billion, compared with
$735 million in the prior three months and a $306 million loss a
year earlier. JPMorgan reduced provisions against future losses
by $3.5 billion. </p>
<p>Net income in investment banking declined 21 percent, to
$1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.9 billion the year
before, even after benefiting from the release of $271 million
in reserves back into earnings, compared with a $181 million
gain the prior year. </p>
<p>The numbers don''t look nearly as strong as the headlines
would suggest, a group of strategists led by Michael Reiner at
Societe Generale SA wrote in a note today after the earnings
report. A large portion of the earnings beat came from a large
drop in loss provisions at JPM''s credit-card segment. </p>
<p>Margin Squeeze </p>
<p>JPMorgan and other large banks, which have benefited from
record low costs of funding mortgages and other assets, face a
squeeze on net interest margins -- the difference between what
they pay to borrow money and what they get for loans and on
securities. </p>
<p>The net yield on interest-earning assets -- what the bank
collects on interest on loans and securities minus what it pays
out on deposits and other borrowings -- dropped to 2.88 percent
in the fourth quarter, from 3.01 percent in the third quarter
and 3.02 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
at least $1.82 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis
and the highest U.S. jobless rate in 26 years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of new problem loans eased over
the last two quarters as the U.S. economy recovered, even after
the federal government withdrew support from financial markets. </p>

<p> Richard Berner is leaving Morgan
Stanley after 11 years as the firm''s chief U.S. economist. </p>
<p>Berner will remain at the sixth-largest U.S. bank by assets
in the near term as an adviser, New York-based Morgan
Stanley said today in an internal memo obtained by Bloomberg
News and confirmed by Sandra Hernandez, a spokeswoman for the
firm. David Greenlaw will serve as active chief U.S. economist,
according to the memo. </p>
<p>It will take a couple of years for the unemployment
rate to drop below 8 percent, Berner said last week in an
interview on Bloomberg Television''s Surveillance Midday with
Tom Keene. Berner and Greenlaw were the most accurate
forecasters of unemployment in a Bloomberg survey of 65
economists covering the four quarters ending in June 2009, the
month the recession ended. </p>
<p>Berner was also co-head of the firm''s global economics
team, and Joachim Fels will become sole head of the group,
according to the memo. </p>
<p>Berner holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, and previously worked at the
Federal Reserve. Berner has said he expects that the U.S.
economy expanded by 4.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last
year. </p>
<p>Dow Jones Newswires reported the departure earlier today. </p>

<p>The cost to protect debt issued by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. climbed, pulling credit-default swaps on
its peers higher, after the bank reported a fourth-quarter
profit based heavily on changes to loss reserves. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets rose 3.5 basis points to 84 basis points at 9:35 a.m. in New York, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The bank''s
net income increased to $4.83 billion, or $1.12 a share, from
$3.28 billion, or 74 cents, a year earlier as it released $2
billion in reserves while adding to a cushion against future
losses tied to its 2008 purchase of Washington Mutual Inc., the
New York-based company said. </p>
<p>The numbers don''t look nearly as strong as the headlines
would suggest, a group of strategists led by Michael Reiner at
Soceite Generale SA wrote in a note today after the earnings
report. A large portion of the earnings beat came from a large
drop in loss provisions at JPM''s credit card segment. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps on Wells Fargo  Co., based in San
Francisco, increased 5.4 basis points to 112 and contracts on Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. climbed
6.5 basis points to 175, Phoenix data show. Both companies are
due to report next week. Contracts on Morgan Stanley added 4.8
basis points to 164, the data show. </p>
<p>Reports that JPMorgan plans to sell three-year debt in a
two-part benchmark offering as soon as today is also helping to
push the swaps higher, according to Rizwan Hussain, a New York-
based analyst at Morgan Stanley. Increasing loan loss provisions
in some portfolios also sparked concern, he said. </p>
<p>Digging Into Details </p>
<p>Investors will be trying to decipher a lot of details
that aren''t necessarily captured in the bottom line,
particularly regarding which way loss provisions are going
across different types of risk that they hold, he said. </p>
<p>While JPMorgan said it reduced reserves overall, it also
added $2.1billion for loan losses from its purchase of WaMu
during the credit crisis. </p>
<p>The impairment of the purchased credit-impaired portfolio
reflected an increase in estimated future credit losses and was
largely related to home equity and, to a lesser extent, option-
ARM loans, the bank said. </p>
<p>High-Yield Outperforms </p>
<p>The cost to protect U.S. corporate bonds from default fell.
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 1.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 83.5 basis points as of 1:16 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North America High Yield Index climbed 0.175
percentage point to 103.5 percent of face value, Markit data
show. That means the annual cost to protect against a default by
the 100 companies in the index dropped to 415.3 basis points,
the lowest since October 2007, according to prices from Markit
and CMA. The high-yield index rises as investor confidence
improves. </p>
<p>We see good reason for the strong performance of high
yield considering improving fundamentals, the wide-open primary
markets, and our expectations for defaults of only 2 percent,
credit strategists Bradley Rogoff and Jeffrey Meli at Barclays
Capital in New York wrote in a note to clients. However, at
current levels, there appears to be little upside. </p>
<p>Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. </p>

<p>A building that''s part of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.''s London headquarters was purchased by Chinese
Estates Holdings Ltd. for about 280 million pounds ($444
million), the broker that advised on the sale said. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank has about 10 years left on its
lease at River Court, a building on Fleet Street in the U.K.
capital''s main financial district, Gresham Down Capital Partners
said in a statement today. Warren  Partners bought the office
for 246.5 million pounds in 2001 on behalf of a group of Irish
investors, Gresham Down said. </p>
<p>These large, high-profile assets continue to attract
strong interest from overseas investors who view London as their
preferred investment location and a safe haven during this
period of global economic uncertainty, Stephen Down, managing
partner of Gresham Down, said in the statement. </p>
<p>London''s commercial property market probably received the
most investment for the second straight year in 2010 as
prospects of rising rental income attracted cash from as far
afield as Hong Kong, Qatar and Canada, according to Real Capital
Analytics Inc. Low interest rates and concern that the global
economy may deteriorate have made other investments more risky. </p>
<p>Chinese Estates -- a Hong Kong-based property developer and
investor controlled by its billionaire chairman, Joseph Lau --
will pay about 38 million pounds in cash and assume a 240.5
million-pound bank loan and 1.7 million pounds of other
liabilities, Chinese Estates said in a separate statement. </p>
<p>River Court has annual rental income of 15.6 million
pounds, according to Chinese Estates. Gresham estimated its net
yield at about 5.25 percent. The building has 430,000 square
feet (40,000 square meters) of space. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s investment
bank hired employees faster than it expanded the compensation
pool last year, leading to a drop in average pay per worker. </p>
<p>Funds set aside to reward traders, deal makers and the
unit''s other personnel increased 4 percent to $9.73 billion, or
an average of $369,651 for each of the 26,314 workers, the
company said today in an earnings supplement. That''s 2.4 percent
less than the average of $378,600 a year earlier, when 24,654
people worked there. Compensation amounted to 37 percent of
revenue last year, up from 33 percent in 2009. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54,
added workers last year even as it generated less revenue from
fixed-income trading and investment banking. Pressure to limit
compensation mounted at the unit as revenue slipped 7 percent to
$26.2 billion and non-compensation expenses jumped 24 percent. </p>
<p>The economy hasn''t fully recovered, said David Schmidt,
a senior consultant at New York-based executive pay firm James
F. Reda  Associates. You still have to pay your stars, but
they probably feel like they don''t have to go crazy to keep
people. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s investment bank added 1,660 employees in 2010,
boosting headcount by 6.7 percent, according to today''s report.
Headcount at the entire New York-based company rose 8 percent to
239,831 at the end of the year. </p>
<p>Rising Expenses </p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, the investment bank''s net income
declined 21 percent from the year-earlier period to $1.5
billion, according to the bank''s statement. An 84 percent surge
in non-interest costs, including litigation expenses, overcame a
26 percent increase in revenue. </p>
<p>Companywide, fourth-quarter profit rose 47 percent to $4.83
billion as the lender cut provisions for future credit-card and
real-estate losses. The investment bank contributed 31 percent
of the firm''s total net income. That compares with 29 percent in
the third quarter and 58 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. </p>
<p>Investment banks set aside revenue throughout the year to
pay employees and typically decide bonuses at the end of the
year. The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the number of employees with the overall compensation pool and
don''t represent individual workers'' actual pay. </p>

<p> General Motors Co. contributed
60.6 million shares, valued at $2.32 billion at yesterday''s
closing price, to U.S. pension plans that the automaker wants
fully funded as soon as 2013. </p>
<p>The 40.4 million shares contributed to the plan for hourly
workers and 20.2 million shares for salaried pensions completes
a $6 billion contribution that the company announced in October,
the Detroit-based automaker said today in a statement. </p>
<p>GM''s pension obligations could be funded as soon as 2013,
Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in a Jan. 11
interview at the Detroit auto show. Reducing debt and pension
obligations will help the largest U.S. automaker to maintain
spending on vehicle development through downturns. </p>
<p>You can''t have this huge tail wagging the small dog,
Liddell said. You can''t be a $100 billion pension plan with a
car company attached to it. The value of the company should be
driven by the quality of the vehicles and the margins we make on
them, not what the discount rate is. </p>
<p>The U.S. plans were underfunded by $17.1 billion at the end
of 2009. Calculations of pension liabilities are sensitive to
assumptions about interest rates used to calculate the present
value of projected future expenditures. </p>
<p>Liddell said it is reasonable to think we''re in an
interest rate-increasing environment over the next three to five
years, which would help GM to fund its pension. He said GM
is not relying on that. </p>
<p>The first call on GM''s cash is engineering and
marketing, he said, while repaying debt and making pension plan
contributions are secondary. </p>
<p>GM has gained 16 percent since the automaker''s $33 initial
public offering in November. The shares fell 35 cents yesterday
to $38.27. </p>

Gareth Johnstone, a Chevron spokesman based in Singapore, said

<p>Indonesian petroleum regulator BPMigas received a letter

<p>The Siak Block is a crucial part of Chevron''s Sumatra

Rokan Block, Johnstone said. </p>
<p>Chevron holds a 100 percent stake in the Rokan and Siak
blocks in southern Sumatra, according to its website. The
company, which also has interests in Borneo, Java and Papua

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
released for the first time details of about $5 billion of
investment losses it suffered during the financial crisis, the
Financial Times reported. </p>
<p>The figures, issued as part of internal reforms undertaken
to placate the bank''s critics, show that Goldman suffered losses
of $13.5 billion from investing and lending with its own funds
in 2008, the newspaper said. </p>
<p>The company''s regulatory filings and comments by its
executives to investors at the time indicated that $8.5 billion
of losses were incurred on the bank''s investments in bonds and
equity, the FT said. </p>
<p>The discrepancy, which doesn''t change Goldman''s 2008
results overall, arose from the fact that the bank hasn''t
provided until now a full breakdown of profits and losses from
activities carried out with its own resources, according to the
newspaper. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. halted an
offering of Facebook Inc. shares to U.S. investors on concern
that intense media attention on the deal may violate rules
limiting marketing of private securities. </p>
<p>Instead, the sale, first reported Jan. 2, will be
restricted to non-U.S. investors, the New York-based bank said
in an e-mailed statement today. Goldman Sachs and funds it
manages had agreed to buy $450 million of closely held Facebook
before the bank began seeking investors. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs concluded that the level of media attention
might not be consistent with the proper completion of a U.S.
private placement under U.S. law, it said in the statement.
The move was based on the sole judgment of Goldman Sachs and
was not required or requested by any other party. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the biggest U.S. securities firm before
converting to a bank in 2008, had been trying to sell as much as
$1.5 billion in Facebook shares to investors inside and outside
the U.S. before making the change announced today. The company
didn''t say whether it still expects to raise that amount. The
target is still achievable, according to a person with knowledge
of the bank''s plan who declined to be identified because it
isn''t public. </p>
<p>Client Disappointment </p>
<p>Goldman''s U.S. clients will be disappointed, said Randy Hawks, a managing director of Oakland, California-based venture
capital firm Claremont Creek Ventures, which has $300 million
under management. </p>
<p>A Facebook spokesman, Jonathan Thaw, said Goldman Sachs is
in the best position to answer any questions. </p>
<p>It certainly is not going to be happy for the people who
put the time into analyzing the investment and didn''t get any,
said Peter Hahn, a lecturer on corporate finance at Cass
Business School in London. But this transaction seems like a
unique enough one that it''s hard to think there will be any
long-lasting damage for Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The limited sale may raise questions about whether it makes
sense for the U.S. to restrict marketing of securities offerings
that are only for sophisticated investors, Hahn said. </p>
<p>Does this suggest that U.S. laws are prohibiting a
certain group of investors from funding U.S. companies? he
said. You might see some significant U.S. investors suggest
that this is a negative for the U.S. economy. </p>
<p>If Goldman Sachs had proceeded with the sale to U.S.
investors, there was a risk that regulators could later conclude
that media coverage had violated rules for a private placement,
said the person with knowledge of the bank''s decision. If that
had happened after the deal, Facebook might have been told to
repurchase shares or register as a public company, the person
said. </p>
<p>In its statement, Goldman Sachs said we regret the
consequences of this decision, but Goldman Sachs believes this
is the most prudent path to take. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street''s most profitable investment bank, promoted Jan Hatzius
and Dominic Wilson to oversee its global economics research
division, succeeding Jim O''Neill. </p>
<p>Hatzius, 42, was named chief economist and Wilson chief
markets economist, according to an internal memo dated Jan. 12
and obtained by Bloomberg News. Both will run economics,
commodities and strategies research in the Americas, with Jeff Currie and Peter Oppenheimer responsible for Europe, according
to the memo from Steven H. Strongin, global head of investment
research. Sophie Bullock, a London-based spokeswoman for the
bank, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The promotions split up the responsibilities of O''Neill,
who served as head of global economics, commodities and strategy
research until becoming chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management at the end of last year. O''Neill, 53, is best known
for devising the term BRIC to describe the growing economic
power of Brazil, Russia, India and China. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs economists are becoming more optimistic about
the outlook for the U.S. economy and said in a report this month
that 2011 will be the year of recovery globally. They
predict the world''s largest economy will expand 3.4 percent this
year after growing 2.8 percent in 2010, and that the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index will rally to 1,500 from 1,293 at the end of
last week. </p>
<p>People continue to underestimate just how powerful the
world economy is, O''Neill told a conference in London today. </p>
<p>Kathy Matsui and Tim Moe will become co-heads of economics,
commodities and strategy research in Asia. Oppenheimer will
become chief global equity strategist, the memo said. </p>
<p>Hatzius became chief U.S. economist in 2005 after joining
the bank in 1997 in Frankfurt. He moved to New York two years
later. Wilson joined Goldman Sachs in 2000 in Hong Kong and then
transferred to New York as a global economist. Both studied at
Oxford University and became managing directors in 2004. </p>

<p> Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest
drugmaker, denied allegations that it may have evaded value
added tax in Germany. </p>
<p> Der Spiegel reported that prosecutors in Mannheim have been
probing Pfizer on tax evasion allegations since 2006, citing a
document from the investigation. The company may have failed to
properly register units in Germany for valued added tax
purposes, aiming to evade tax payments, the magazine said. </p>
<p>Pfizer rejects the accusation that it set up a system to
avoid paying VAT, the company''s German unit said in a
statement on its website. The handling of deliveries as
practiced by the company didn''t cause Germany to generate less
tax. </p>
<p>The company paid the VAT bills issued by the state
financial authorities, Pfizer said. After paying them, it
contested the bills and it expects tax courts to resolve the
disputes, the company said. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s largest computer-services provider, posted
fourth-quarter profit and sales that topped analysts'' estimates
as companies spent more on computer systems and software. The
shares climbed in late trading. </p>
<p>Per-share profit rose to $4.18, the Armonk, New York-based
company said today in a statement, topping the $4.08 average
estimate of analysts'' surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 6.6
percent to $29 billion as hardware revenue got a boost from
IBM''s newest mainframe and companies bought more analytics
software. Analysts estimated sales of $28.3 billion on average. </p>
<p>Services signings rose 18 percent to $22.1 billion, the
first increase in a year. Full-year profit this year, excluding
some costs, will be at least $13 a share, the company said. </p>
<p>IBM''s well positioned as the economies around the world
are starting to pick up and IT spending starts to pick up,
said Collins Stewart Plc analyst Lou Miscioscia, who rates the
shares buy and doesn''t own them. </p>
<p>The company is the second technology bellwether whose
earnings suggest an uptick in information-technology spending.
Last week, Intel Corp., the world''s biggest chipmaker, forecast
first-quarter sales that may top estimates, as companies buy
more computers and servers. </p>
<p>IBM climbed as much as 2.9 percent to $155.05 in late
trading, after rising 65 cents to $150.65 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 2.7
percent this year. </p>
<p>Fourth-Quarter Sales </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter hardware revenue climbed 21 percent to $6.3
billion, as the mainframe introduced in July helped boost sales
in that product category by almost 70 percent. Sales from the
software division gained 7 percent to $7 billion. </p>
<p>Net income for the quarter increased 9.2 percent to $5.26
billion from $4.81 billion, or $3.59 a share, a year earlier. </p>
<p>Starting with the 2011 full-year forecast, IBM is moving to
an operating reporting format, which excludes acquisition and
retirement costs. Per-share earnings on that basis will be at
least $20 in 2015, the company said today, up from its May
prediction of $20 per share. </p>
<p>Revenue will increase by about $20 billion in that
timeframe, the company said. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing in
analytics software that predicts trends, which will be a $16
billion business for IBM by 2015, and cloud computing, expected
to generate $3 billion annually by then. Smarter Planet,
Palmisano''s initiative to digitally monitor anything from roads,
buildings and hospitals to make them more efficient, should grow
to a $10 billion business. </p>
<p>Palmisano also plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions through 2015. He announced 15 deals last year,
including storage-computer maker Netezza Corp. for $1.7 billion. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s EMC Mortgage,
facing homeowner lawsuits over foreclosures, was sued by the
trustee of a mortgage portfolio for refusing to turn over
documents detailing the quality of loans bought by the trust. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co., the trustee, is seeking access to files
for more than 2,000 underlying mortgages in the Bear Stearns
Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, according to the complaint
filed today in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. </p>
<p>The trustee has repeatedly requested that EMC provide
access to the subject documents, Wells Fargo said in the
complaint. EMC has played proverbial rope a dope'' and
otherwise continued to drag its feet, and has produced nothing. </p>
<p>Claims of wrongdoing by banks and loan servicers triggered
a 50-state investigation last year into whether hundreds of
thousands of foreclosures were properly documented as the
housing market collapsed. Lending practices have also pitted
mortgage-bond investors against banks over misrepresentations
such as overstatements of borrowers'' income and inflated
appraisals. </p>
<p>Christine Holevas, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo said it needs access to the documents to answer
serious questions raised by investors in the trust about
whether EMC breached representations and warranties regarding
the quality of option-adjustable rate mortgage loans the trust
bought. </p>
<p>Investor Questions </p>
<p>An investor in the trust, who owns 42 percent of the
outstanding face amount of the portfolio''s certificates,
questioned the condition of underlying loans, Wells Fargo said
in the complaint, citing an August letter it received from David Grais, the investor''s attorney. </p>
<p>Grais, a partner at New York-based Grais  Ellsworth LLP,
represents the federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and San
Francisco and Charles Schwab Corp. in litigation seeking to
force banks including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan to
repurchase mortgage-backed securities because they allegedly
misrepresented the quality of the loans. </p>
<p>In a September interview, Grais said he was also working
with two hedge funds that hadn''t filed suits and had contacted
trustees with similar complaints. He wouldn''t name the funds. </p>
<p>In the Aug. 31, 2010, letter to San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, Grais said he had investigated 1,317 of the loans held by
the trust and determined that EMC appeared to have violated its
representations with respect to 938 loans, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>Grais didn''t immediately return a phone call today seeking
comment on the complaint. </p>
<p>400 Loans </p>
<p>Wells Fargo began requesting the documents in January last
year and reached an agreement with EMC in December on access to
files for 400 loans. EMC had until Jan. 12 to produce documents
on the first 100 loans, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>EMC failed to produce the documents culminating more than
a year of good-faith negotiations and misplaced patience by the
trustee in a futile attempt to avoid litigation, Wells Fargo
said in the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank N.A. as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage Corp., CA6132,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington) </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it is mailing $2 million in
refunds to military families who were overcharged on mortgages
or wrongfully lost their homes. </p>
<p>We made mistakes here and we are fixing them, Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said today in
a telephone interview. JPMorgan''s mortgage unit is refunding
excessive interest and fees charged to 4,000 active-duty
personnel and reimbursing or reversing foreclosures for 14 other
families who lost homes while on active duty, she said. </p>
<p>Marine Captain Jonathon Rowles, a pilot flying missions in South Korea, filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan July 6 in U.S.
District Court in South Carolina. He claims military personnel
were overcharged and subjected to aggressive collection
practices. He accused the bank of violating the Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act, which protects active-duty personnel from
foreclosure and prohibits banks from charging more than 6
percent for a mortgage. NBC News reported the lawsuit and
JPMorgan''s refunds on Jan. 17. </p>
<p>Rowles said in the complaint that Chase Manhattan Mortgage
Corp., a subsidiary that serviced his loan, didn''t adjust the
interest rate on a $255,000 loan for his Colorado home even
after Rowles repeatedly provided proof of military service. The
bank began to pursue aggressive collection methods, calling
his mother''s home, his workplace and his home up to three times
a day, after midnight and sometimes at 4 a.m., he said. </p>
<p>Internal Review </p>
<p>JPMorgan conducted an internal review and has since put
into place a team of mortgage specialists dedicated to servicing
military loans, Lemkau said. They deserve nothing less,
Lemkau said. While any customer mistake is regrettable, we
feel particularly bad about the mistakes we made here. </p>
<p>Rowles is still pursuing his case, seeking damages,
attorney''s fees and other costs, said Richard Harpootlian,
Rowles'' lawyer in Columbia, South Carolina. </p>
<p>Chase not only charged them too much, but harassed
them, Harpootlian said. We''re looking for our day in
court. </p>
<p>Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on the
Senate Banking Committee, asked Attorney General Eric Holder in
a letter yesterday to investigate. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase was violating the law, and I am concerned
other banks may also be wrongly overcharging our troops or
taking unfair advantage of their situation, Reed said in a
statement. I urge all the banks to review, acknowledge, and
rectify any and all violations. </p>
<p>The Rowles lawsuit has been stayed pending a decision by
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in a case on
whether private individuals can bring actions under this law. </p>
<p>The case is Rowles v. Chase Home Finance LLC, 9:10-cv-
01756, U.S. District Court, District of South Carolina
(Beaufort). </p>

Office on mobile phones. </p>
<p>The app will be available starting today as a free trial.
The company hasn''t decided when and how much it will charge,
said Jason Bunge, senior director for Office Product Management,
in an interview. It''s the first Office program for the iPhone
and the third iPhone application from Microsoft. </p>
<p>While Microsoft''s mobile-phone division aims to lure
customers to smartphones based on its Windows software and away
from the iPhone, units like Office and the Bing Internet search

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s Kevin Connors, co-head of global foreign-exchange sales for Group of
10 currencies, is leaving the firm, a person with knowledge of
the situation said. </p>
<p>His departure follows a breach of internal compliance
procedures, which didn''t involve anyone else, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the details are private. A
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London declined to comment
today. Connors''s mobile phone was turned off. He was named a
partner in 2008 and initially joined the bank in 1990. Connors
is still listed as active on the U.K. Financial Services
Authority''s register. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is trying to improve its reputation after the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm and
employee Fabrice Tourre in April over claims the company misled
investors in a collateralized debt obligation linked to subprime
mortgages. Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million in July to
settle the lawsuit. The FSA also fined the New York-based bank
in September for failing to report to U.K. regulators the U.S.
investigation that led to the suit. The fine was the second
largest levied by the FSA. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs dismissed Alexandre Harfouche, co-head of the

<p>Atlantis Resources Corp., an ocean-
current turbine maker backed by Morgan Stanley, expects to spend
$150 million on Asia''s first commercial plant to generate
electricity jointly from the wind and tides. </p>
<p>The current estimated capital expenditure for the first
phase of 50 megawatts is $150 million, Chief Executive Timothy Cornelius said in a telephone interview from Atlantis''s office
in Singapore. </p>
<p>Atlantis, which also counts Norway''s Statkraft SF among its
investors, signed an agreement last week with Gujarat Power
Corporation to develop as much as 250 megawatts of tidal-current
power. The company plans to launch tenders for components
shortly for the first 50-megawatt plant, which should be
completed by 2013, he said. </p>
<p>If successful, it may pave the way for similar wind-tidal
projects in Canada and South Korea, he said. </p>
<p>Ocean currents, one of the largest untapped sources of
renewable energy worldwide, may have the potential to produce
450 gigawatts of power, representing a $550 billion market,
according to the American Council on Renewable Energy. </p>
<p>The company won a bid in the U.K. last year to build the
world''s largest tidal-power project. It plans to use its 1-
megawatt AK1000 turbine at the site. </p>
<p>Those turbines may be built in India, Cornelius said.
Atlantis is in talks with Indian companies about setting up a
plant to take advantage of local manufacturing capabilities in
Gujarat because tidal power equipment shares much of the same
technology used in the oil and wind industries, Cornelius said. </p>
<p>The northwestern Indian state is home to the world''s
biggest oil refining complex owned by Reliance Industries Ltd.
as well as a rotor-blade plant belonging to Suzlon Energy Ltd.,
the nation''s largest wind turbine maker. </p>
<p>Cornelius said more studies were needed to determine the
cost of power from the project. The company says tidal power
with economies of scale could be comparable with offshore wind. </p>

<p> Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. sold A$175
million ($175 million) of bonds in the first domestic currency
debt sale by Australia''s biggest soft-drink maker in almost five
years. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola Amatil marketed the notes to investors in Asia
and Europe, and priced them to yield 60 basis points more than
the mid-swap rate, a person familiar with the transaction said,
asking not to be named as the details are private. The 6.125
percent notes are due in May 2014, and the sale was managed by
Credit Suisse Group AG and BNP Paribas SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The Sydney-based company has bonds in U.S. dollars, yen and
its home currency outstanding, the data show. It last sold
Australian-dollar bonds in March 2006, when it priced A$100

drink maker, is rated A3 by Moody''s Investors Service, the

<p> International Business Machines
Corp., the world''s largest computer-services provider, and Apple
Inc., maker of the iPhone and iPad, reported earnings that beat
analysts'' estimates, adding to evidence of a rebound in
corporate spending on technology. </p>
<p>IBM reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue yesterday
that topped analysts'' predictions, buoyed by demand for computer
systems and software. Apple said more than 80 of the world''s top
100 companies are using the iPad tablet computer, contributing
to the company''s record quarterly sales. </p>
<p>Businesses are spending more on products ranging from IBM
mainframes to smartphones and tablet computers. That bodes well
for results due in coming weeks from Hewlett-Packard Co., Microsoft Corp., Dell Inc. and other companies that supply
corporations with computers, services and software. Last week, Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, forecast sales that may top
estimates as companies upgrade computer and server fleets. </p>
<p>As companies have gotten through a couple of years of
underinvestment, they really need to refresh their
infrastructure, said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at ISI Group in
New York. The December quarter was really great for servers. </p>
<p>After slashing spending in the wake of the worst U.S.
economic recession since the 1930s, corporations are now
updating their aging hardware. </p>
<p>Reports last week on retail sales and industrial production
supported prospects for quickening growth that may boost demand
for products as varied as cars from Ford Motor Co. cars and
computer products made by Apple and IBM. </p>
<p>Employee Demand'' </p>
<p>Per-share profit rose to $4.18, Armonk, New York-based IBM
said yesterday, topping the $4.08 average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 6.6 percent to $29 billion
as hardware revenue got a boost from IBM''s newest mainframe and
as companies bought more analytics software. Analysts estimated
sales of $28.3 billion on average. </p>
<p>Apple said sales increased 71 percent to $26.7 billion,
exceeding the $24.4 billion predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The company sold 7.33 million iPad tablet computers in
the first holiday season for the device, Apple said yesterday.
That topped the 6 million projected by Mike Abramsky at RBC
Capital Markets LLC. </p>
<p>Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment
continues to be significant, Apple Chief Financial Officer
Peter Oppenheimer said yesterday. Enterprise CIOs are adding
iPads to their approved device list at an amazing rate. </p>
<p>Testing IPads </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and Wells Fargo
 Co. are among companies now testing or using the device, he
said. </p>
<p>I don''t think anyone thought they could sell 7 million
iPads, said Jane Snorek, who helps oversee about $75 billion
at Nuveen Asset Management and said Apple is Nuveen''s biggest
holding. I don''t think anyone thought they could even make 7
million iPads. </p>
<p>Companies are using the iPad for product demonstrations,
approving shipping orders and calling up finance options to help
sell products ranging from cars to loans, customers such as
Wells Fargo, SAP AG and Tellabs Inc. said after its introduction
last year. </p>
<p>Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fell $1.81 to
$338.84 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The company is the world''s second-most valuable company behind
Exxon Mobil Corp. </p>
<p>IBM added $5.04, or 3.4 percent, to $155.69 on the New York
Stock Exchange, setting a record for a third straight day. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s Results </p>
<p>Microsoft, scheduled to announce quarterly earnings on Jan.
27, may report sales rose 1 percent as corporate demand for
Office and server software makes up for weaker-than-expected
personal-computer sales to consumers. Sales will be $19.1
billion, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>That trade-off was evident in Intel''s earnings. The Santa
Clara, California-based company said demand for chips used in
so-called cloud-computing centers, which provide network
services over the Internet, bolstered fourth-quarter sales and
profit even as consumer demand for notebooks remained sluggish. </p>
<p>IBM said fourth-quarter hardware revenue climbed 21 percent
to $6.3 billion, as a mainframe computer introduced in July
helped boost sales in that product category by almost 70
percent. Sales from the software division gained 7 percent to $7
billion. Signings for services rose 18 percent to $22.1 billion,
the first increase in a year. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. shares climbed to their third record in as many days as
analysts raised their price estimates for the stock on
increasing spending by corporations. </p>
<p>The shares rose 3.4 percent today after IBM posted sales
and profit that topped estimates after-market yesterday. More
than half of IBM analysts tracked by Bloomberg increased their
price targets, including six who predict the stock will reach at
least $175. </p>
<p>IBM reported sales growth in every division, as well as a
bump in services contracts -- the first in a year -- and said it
is on track to hit a goal of almost doubling operating earnings
to $20 or more by 2015. The company has boosted per-share profit
for more than 30 straight quarters, and investors are starting
to take notice, said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Caris  Co. </p>
<p>IBM steadily was able to even grow during the downturn,
and IBM is slowly starting to get credit for that, said New
York-based Cihra, who rates IBM above average and has a 12-
month price target of $175. </p>
<p>The world''s largest computer-services provider, which has
its 100th anniversary this year, is also benefiting as
corporations resume spending after the recession, said Chris Whitmore, a Deutsche Bank AG analyst, who predicts companies''
information-technology budgets will grow 6 percent this year. He
boosted his price target for IBM by $20 to $175 today. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter sales climbed 6.6 percent to $29 billion,
with hardware revenue rising more than 20 percent as a mainframe
computer introduced in July helped boost sales in that product
category. Sales from the software division, accounting more than
40 percent of total profit, climbed 7 percent $7 billion. </p>
<p>Analytics, Cloud Computing </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, forecast that operating
earnings, which exclude acquisition and some retirement costs,
will increase 11 percent to $13 a share this year. </p>
<p>The shares rose $5.04 to $155.69 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading for the biggest jump since May. </p>
<p>Since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer in March
2002, he''s divested hardware units, including the personal-
computer business sold to China''s Lenovo Group Ltd., and

including the purchase of storage-computer maker Netezza Corp.
for $1.7 billion. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shares fell
the most in almost nine months after the firm reported its third
straight quarterly earnings decline, led by a slowdown in
trading and investment banking revenue. </p>
<p>Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading, the
firm''s largest source of revenue, tumbled 48 percent from a year
earlier to $1.64 billion, the New York-based company said today
in a statement. Equities-trading revenue dropped 5 percent to $2
billion and investment banking fell 10 percent to $1.5 billion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s clients bought and sold fewer stocks, bonds
and other securities during the quarter because of the European
debt crisis, regulatory changes and concern the economic rebound
would stall, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said on a
conference call. While business picked up in January, Viniar
said it''s too early to make predictions for the year. </p>
<p>It was just a very weak environment for fixed-income
trading and to a certain extent equity trading as well, said
Keith Davis, an analyst at Farr, Miller  Washington LLC in Washington, which manages about $700 million, including Goldman
Sachs shares. I don''t think one poor quarter from a trading
perspective makes a trend. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs declined $8.19, or 4.7 percent, to $166.49 at
4:15 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
the biggest drop since a 9.4 percent tumble on April 30. The
shares had gained 3.9 percent this year through yesterday. </p>
<p>Investment Banking </p>
<p>David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in New York
who has an outperform rating on Goldman Sachs stock, said in
an interview that the results raise questions about whether
firms like Goldman Sachs will have to depend more on investment
banking and equity trading as revenue from fixed-income,
currencies and commodities, known as FICC, erodes. </p>
<p>The idea that clients had no conviction -- they''ve been
saying that for three quarters now, he said. Within the
context of client activity there seems to be something
structural going on that would suggest that the FICC cycle is
kind of over. </p>
<p>The results prompted some analysts to reduce estimates for
2011 fixed-income trading revenue and earnings per share.
Richard X. Bove at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida, said in
a note to investors that he cut his 2011 profit estimate to
$14.70 per share from $20.32 previously. He reduced his price
target on the stock to $188 from $214. </p>
<p>Structural Changes'' </p>
<p>It has been my thinking to this point that the businesses
would regain their peak performance, driven by increases in money supply and economic activity, Bove wrote. This is
still possible, but I now believe that there have been
structural changes in the market which will delay regaining the
peak for a number of years. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter net income fell to $2.39 billion, or $3.79 a
share, from $4.95 billion, or $8.20, a year earlier. Estimates
of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg averaged $3.79 a share. </p>
<p>In the conference call with analysts, Viniar said the firm
was still adding employees, especially in high-growth markets,
because it expects a rebound in demand from clients after an
unusually slow fourth quarter. While he said some credit-market
products that were popular before the financial crisis are
unlikely to return quickly, he doesn''t expect those businesses
to disappear permanently. </p>
<p>Out of Favor'' </p>
<p>I don''t tend to think most things are permanent, he
said. Some products that were in favor are now out of favor
and are likely to stay out of favor for at least some period of
time, but other products are likely to be developed to replace
them. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, worked to
maintain Goldman Sachs''s profitability and reputation last year
as trading revenue declined from a record in 2009 and the bank
settled a civil fraud lawsuit filed by a U.S. regulator. Last
week Goldman Sachs released a set of new business practices and
changed financial reports to separate client-trading revenue
from gains and losses generated by bets with its own money. </p>
<p>We are seeing signs of growth and more economic activity
and we are well-positioned to help our clients expand their
businesses, manage their risks and invest in the future,
Blankfein said in the statement. </p>
<p>Revenue Estimates </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s full-year revenue fell 13 percent to $39.2
billion in 2010 from $45.2 billion in 2009, the firm said. In
the fourth quarter, revenue dropped 10 percent to $8.64 billion.
The average estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was
$8.86 billion in revenue. </p>
<p>Compensation and benefits, the bank''s biggest expense,
decreased 5 percent to $15.4 billion from $16.2 billion as the
number of employees rose 10 percent from a year earlier to
35,700. Goldman Sachs, which took a $600 million charge in the
second quarter related to a one-time tax on bonuses in the U.K.,
recouped $135 million of that in the fourth quarter after
determining it had overestimated the cost. </p>
<p>JMP Securities'' Trone said that the firm made up for a
weaker-than-expected revenue figure by reducing compensation
costs more than investors and analysts were anticipating. </p>
<p>Fixed-income traders had a tougher time making money in
2010 as volume fell and prices improved at a slower pace from
the previous year. The extra yield investors demanded to own
investment-grade debt instead of Treasuries tumbled 414 basis
points in 2009 to end the year at 190 basis points, the biggest
annual drop in Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
beginning in 1996. In 2010 spreads narrowed 24 basis points, the
data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, Citigroup </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Citigroup Inc., the second- and third-biggest U.S. banks by
assets, showed that fixed-income trading revenue fell compared
with the prior quarter and for 2010 as a whole. Average weekly
trading volume in corporate debt dropped 11 percent in 2010 from
2009, according to Federal Reserve data. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s FICC revenue fell 37 percent for the full
year to $13.7 billion. Full-year equities-trading revenue
dropped 25 percent to $8.09 billion. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs cut the size of its trading bets during the
year. Average value-at-risk, an estimate of how much the firm
could lose trading in a single day, fell to $134 million in 2010
from $218 million in 2009. In the fourth quarter, the measure
dropped to $120 million from $121 million in the prior quarter
and from $181 million a year earlier. </p>
<p>Most of the decline in risk-taking was in bets on interest
rates, where value at risk dropped to an average $93 million in
2010 from $176 million in 2009. </p>
<p>Investing and Lending </p>
<p>Viniar said on the conference call that some parts of the
firm''s investing and lending unit may be prohibited under new
rules being drafted by U.S. regulators. The firm, which has
traditionally invested more than 3 percent of its own money into
private equity and hedge funds it manages, will have to reduce
those holdings under the new rules, he said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s investment bank and money-management
divisions have been in the spotlight this month after the firm
and some of its funds invested $450 million in closely held
Internet social networking site Facebook Inc. and tried to sell
$1.5 billion of the company in a private placement to wealthy
clients. On Jan. 17, the firm said it would restrict the sale to
clients outside the U.S. on concern media coverage of the deal
would run afoul of rules governing private offerings. </p>
<p>Viniar declined to answer questions about the Facebook deal
posed by analysts on today''s conference call. </p>
<p>The firm said its investment-banking transaction backlog
decreased compared with the end of the third quarter, which
JMP''s Trone said he thought was surprising. </p>
<p>You would have thought the pipeline would have been up,
he said. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, said Jay Mantz is leaving the firm four
months after being named vice chairman of its real-estate
investing group. </p>
<p>Mantz is departing after more than 17 years at the company,
according to an internal memo obtained today by Bloomberg News
and confirmed by Mark Lake, a spokesman for the sixth-largest
U.S. bank by assets. In September, John Klopp and Olivier de Poulpiquet were named co-chief executive officers and co-chief
investment officers of the real-estate investing business as
Mantz moved from president and CIO to vice chairman. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had $45.6 billion of property assets under
management as of Sept. 30, according to its website. The unit
has contributed more than $300 million of gains this year after
New York-based Morgan Stanley recorded about $4.4 billion of
real-estate losses in 2008 and 2009 amid the worst commercial
property rout in about 20 years. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley remains fully committed to the real-estate
investing business, Greg Fleming, head of Morgan Stanley''s
asset-management business, wrote in the memo. We believe that
a client-focused private equity real estate platform is a
compelling business for the firm. </p>
<p>Mantz became president and CIO of the real-estate unit in
February 2009, after previously serving as co-head of merchant
banking. He ran property investing from 2000 to 2005. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley recorded gains of $203 million in the third
quarter related to the firm''s investments in its real-estate
funds as the asset-management unit posted its second-highest
pretax profit margin in the last five years. The asset-
management unit had pretax losses in every quarter of 2008 and
2009. </p>
<p>Real Estate Fund </p>
<p>Klopp joined the firm as head of investing in Americas real
estate and global property debt in February after more than 20
years at Sam Zell''s Capital Trust Inc. and its predecessor. De
Poulpiquet, who began his career at Morgan Stanley in 1994,
rejoined the firm in May after leaving for Pirelli  C. Real
Estate SpA in 2003. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley raised $4.7 billion for a new global real
estate fund earlier this year, the largest fund to close since
2008. The total funds raised were less than half the firm''s
target before the financial crisis. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. climbed the most in six months in New York trading,
extending yesterday''s record, after reporting fourth-quarter
profit and sales that topped analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Per-share profit rose to $4.18, the Armonk, New York-based
company said yesterday in a statement, beating the $4.08 average
estimate of analysts'' surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales climbed to
$29 billion as hardware revenue got a boost from IBM''s newest
mainframe and companies bought more analytics software. </p>
<p>Services signings jumped 18 percent to $22.1 billion, the
first increase in a year. Full-year profit this year, excluding
some costs, will be at least $13 a share, the company said. </p>
<p>IBM climbed $3.99, or 2.7 percent, to $154.64 at 9:47 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
intraday gain since July 7. The stock rose 12 percent last year. </p>
<p>Investors are encouraged by strengths in the signings
this quarter, said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore, who
rates the shares buy and doesn''t own them. They exited the
year well. There''s not a lot to pick on this quarter. </p>
<p>The company is the second technology bellwether whose
earnings suggest an uptick in information-technology spending.
Last week, Intel Corp., the world''s biggest chipmaker, forecast
first-quarter sales that may top estimates, as companies buy
more computers and servers. </p>
<p>Fourth-Quarter Sales </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter hardware revenue climbed 21 percent to $6.3
billion, as the mainframe introduced in July helped boost sales
in that product category by almost 70 percent. Sales from the
software division gained 7 percent to $7 billion. </p>
<p>Net income for the quarter increased 9.2 percent to $5.26
billion from $4.81 billion, or $3.59 a share, a year earlier.
Analysts estimated sales of $28.3 billion on average. </p>
<p>Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and China, climbed 15 percent. Sales from the regions will make up
at least a quarter of revenue by 2015, the company said in May,
up from 21 percent last year. </p>
<p>Starting with the 2011 full-year forecast, IBM is moving to
an operating reporting format, which excludes acquisition and
some retirement costs. Per-share earnings on that basis will be
at least $20 in 2015, the company said, reiterating its forecast
from May. Revenue will increase by about $20 billion in that
period, the company said. </p>
<p>Reporting operating earnings provides more transparency and
a better comparison to other technology companies, Chief
Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call
yesterday. </p>
<p>Software and Deals </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing in
analytics software and cloud computing, which the company
forecasts will become $16 billion and $3 billion businesses
respectively by 2015. Smarter Planet, Palmisano''s initiative to
digitally monitor anything from roads to hospitals to make them
more efficient, should grow to a $10 billion business. </p>
<p>Palmisano also plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions through 2015. He announced 15 deals last year,
including storage-computer maker Netezza Corp. for $1.7 billion. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s
compensation and benefits expense fell 5 percent to $15.4
billion in 2010 as the firm''s revenue decreased 13 percent and
the number of employees climbed. </p>
<p>The amount, equal to 39 percent of revenue, is enough to
pay each of the firm''s 35,700 employees $430,700, according to a
statement today from the New York-based bank. That''s down 14
percent from an average of $498,246 for the firm''s 32,500
workers a year earlier. </p>
<p>After setting an all-time high for Wall Street pay in 2007,
Goldman Sachs cut compensation costs to 36 percent of revenue in
2009, the lowest ratio ever, as it reported record earnings and
U.S. banks faced pressure from regulators and lawmakers to rein
in bonuses. JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s investment bank cut average
pay for employees 2.4 percent to $369,651 last year, the New
York-based lender said last week. </p>
<p>There are a lot of eyes on what they''re going to do from a
compensation perspective, said Jason Tyler, senior vice
president of portfolio management at Chicago-based Ariel
Investments LLC, on Bloomberg Television''s In The Loop with
Betty Liu. So the numbers are lighter than what they could have
been. </p>
<p>Charitable Giving </p>
<p>Investment banks set aside a portion of revenue throughout
the year to pay employees and typically decide bonuses at the
end of the year based on full-year results. Average compensation
figures, derived by dividing the compensation pool by the number
of employees, don''t represent any individual''s worker''s actual
pay. Bonuses vary widely depending on an employee''s seniority,
job title, and performance. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, and
JPMorgan is the second largest. Goldman Sachs''s compensation
figures don''t include costs tied to the U.K. bonus tax, for
which the firm recorded a $465 million expense in 2010. In
October, it said the cost would be $600 million. </p>
<p>Compensation was reduced to fund a $320 million charitable
contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives, the bank said. The firm had
a negative compensation expense of $519 million in the fourth
quarter of 2009 as it cut pay to fund a $500 million
contribution to the charity. </p>
<p>The following table compares compensation at Goldman Sachs
and JPMorgan''s investment bank. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is moving
French investment banking chief Jean Raby to Moscow to help
oversee its Russian office as the country starts a new round of
asset sales, said two people with direct knowledge of the
transfer. </p>
<p>Raby will work alongside Christopher Barter, who became
sole head of Goldman Sachs''s Russian office last year after co-
country chief David Schwimmer returned to New York, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the information
hasn''t been made public. Raby will run investment banking and
Barter will continue to oversee securities. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Vladimir Putin''s government in October
selected Goldman Sachs and nine other banks to help it raise at
least 1 trillion rubles ($34 billion) selling assets over the
next three years. The privatization list includes OAO Sberbank
and VTB Group, Russia''s two largest lenders. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm, is
rebuilding its Russian business after abandoning Moscow in 1998,
when the country defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt. The
bank was the fifth-largest underwriter of Russian debt and
equity sales last year, with a market share of 11 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. It hired Clemens Grafe from UBS AG
in October as chief economist in Moscow. </p>
<p>Russian share sales may jump to $28 billion this year, the
most since 2007, according to estimates by VTB Capital, last
year''s largest underwriter. Initial public offerings, mainly in
the mining, chemicals and retail industries, will probably total
$20 billion, while the state privatization program may raise
another $7 billion to $8 billion, Elena Khisamova, head of
equity markets at VTB Capital, said in an interview Nov. 12. </p>
<p>Raby joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and was a made a partner
in 2004. He was promoted to run investment banking in France and Belgium alongside Shahriar Tadjbakhsh in 2006. Neither Raby nor
Barter responded to phone messages seeking comment and Elena
Zakrevskaya, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>

<p>(Corrects description of Boston-based group in third
paragraph) </p>
<p>Shareholder groups are pressing Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Southwestern Energy Co. to
disclose the risk the companies face from hydraulic fracturing. </p>
<p>The groups say they want shareholders to know that the
companies could face litigation or fines related to their use of
rock-fracturing techniques to find natural gas and oil. They
plan to introduce resolutions during the annual meetings of nine
companies, calling on them to disclose the chemicals used in
hydraulic fracturing. </p>
<p>The Investor Environmental Health Network in Falls Church,
Va., helped organize groups of investors to file the
resolutions, including the New York State Comptroller''s Office,
the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia and Ceres, a Boston-
based coalition that directs the $9 trillion Investor Network on
Climate Risk. </p>
<p>The same groups, working together as the Investor
Environmental Health Network, filed similar petitions last year
against 12 oil and gas producers. None passed. </p>
<p>More than 20 percent of shareholders voted for the
resolutions at some companies, said Richard Liroff, executive
director of the Investors Environmental Health Network.
Clearly we''re getting our point across, he said. </p>
<p>Some landowners have accused gas companies of polluting
local water supplies with their fracturing activities. </p>
<p>Cabot Oil  Gas Corp. agreed to provide drinking water and
put $4.1 million into escrow for families in Pennsylvania who
said their drinking water was polluted by the company''s oil
wells, settling a claim by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection. </p>
<p>New York has imposed a moratorium on fracturing horizontal
wells until an environmental review is completed. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is also conducting a study of
fracturing''s impact. </p>
<p>Few Problems </p>
<p>Morgan Crinklaw, a Chevron spokesman, said the company is
reviewing the shareholder proposal. We believe that hydraulic
fracturing is critical to accessing the nation''s natural-gas
resources, leading to greater energy security, Crinklaw wrote
in an e-mail. </p>
<p>More than 1 million wells have been hydraulically fractured
over the last 60 years with only a few problems, America''s
Natural Gas Alliance, an industry trade group, says on its
website. </p>
<p>Exxon said it supports the disclosure of hydraulic
fracturing chemicals, without commenting on the shareholder
proposals. We believe the concerns of community members can be
alleviated by the disclosure of all ingredients used in these
fluids, Karen Matusic, an Exxon spokeswoman, wrote in an e-
mail. </p>
<p>Southwestern didn''t return calls seeking comment. </p>
<p>Exxon and Southwestern have looked for ways to reduce the
need for chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. </p>

as co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions, part of
management changes in the investment banking group. </p>
<p>Chris Ventresca, who has co-managed the North American MA
division since 2008, will remain a co-head with Woolery, who is
41, JPMorgan said in a statement today. Jimmy Elliott, who had
been global MA head for five years at JPMorgan, will focus on
working with clients and hold the title of global chairman of
MA. He won''t be replaced as global head of the group. </p>
<p>Jeffrey Stute, who had co-run the North American MA group
while advising on deals in the health-care industry, will move
over to be North American head of JPMorgan''s broader health-care
coverage group. He has advised on deals such as Universal Health
Services Inc.''s acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions Inc. and
Merck  Co.''s takeover of Schering-Plough Corp. </p>
<p>Robbie Huffines, who previously held that health-care post
at JPMorgan, will become a vice chairman of investment banking.
Huffines worked on the sale of Guidant Corp. to Boston
Scientific Corp. and is currently advising Sanofi-Aventis SA on
its proposed acquisition of Genzyme Corp. </p>
<p>MA Lawyers </p>
<p>Woolery is one of a handful of top MA lawyers to attempt a
switch to investment banking. In 2000, Cravath partner Robert Kindler left to become a banker at Chase Manhattan Corp., now
part of JPMorgan, and another partner, George Bilicic, went to
Merrill Lynch  Co. In 2005, Dennis Hersch left Davis Polk 
Wardwell LLP to join JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Kindler now runs MA at Morgan Stanley, Bilicic is at
Lazard Ltd., and Hersch has left banking. </p>
<p>Among bankruptcy lawyers, Harvey Miller of Weil Gotshal 
Manges LLP and James Sprayregen of Kirkland  Ellis LLP both
entered banking in the last decade and later returned. </p>
<p>At Cravath, Woolery has had a hand in several of the
biggest mergers in recent years, counseling Affiliated Computer
Services Inc. on its $5.8 billion sale to Xerox Corp. He is
currently representing a board panel at Massey Energy Co. as the
coal miner weighs selling itself. </p>
<p>Woolery, who starts Feb. 7, was born in Louisville,
Kentucky. He graduated from Wake Forest University and earned
his law degree from the University of Kentucky, according to the
Cravath website. </p>
<p>Cravath had the fifth-biggest market share among U.S. law
firms for merger advice over the past three years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, advising Burlington Northern Santa
Fe on its sale to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Pepsi Bottling
Group Inc. on its sale to PepsiCo Inc. The firm also represented
a special committee of J. Crew Group Inc. on its proposed $3
billion leveraged buyout. </p>
<p>JPMorgan finished third in global MA in 2010 with $381.4
billion in deals, behind Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Bloomberg data show. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp. chief Sam Palmisano is giving non-executive workers $1,000
in long-term stock incentives after the company posted fourth-
quarter earnings that sent shares to a record high. </p>
<p>We are continuing to outperform the market and our
competitors and to make encouraging progress against our
strategic growth initiatives, Palmisano wrote in a memo to
employees. Our long-term success is the product of the work,
innovation and superior execution of more than 400,000 IBMers. </p>
<p>He said that all non-executive employees who performed
consistently during the execution of the company''s 2010
strategic plan, covering the years from 2007 to 2010, would
receive the IBM stock. The shares will vest in 2015. </p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of workers will receive the awards,
said a person familiar with the situation, who couldn''t be
identified because the number of awards isn''t public. The
Armonk, New York-based company had about 400,000 employees at
the end of December. Doug Shelton, a spokesman for the company,
wouldn''t give the specific number of workers getting the awards. </p>
<p>IBM posted earnings and sales this week that topped
analysts'' estimates, with revenue rising in every division as
companies spend more on hardware and software. The company is on
track to meet its long-term goal of almost doubling operating
earnings per share to $20 or more by 2015, it said. </p>
<p>IBM rose 11 cents to $155.80, the company''s highest closing
price ever, at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares climbed 12 percent last year. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley sold $5.25 billion of
bonds in the biggest debt offering by a U.S. bank since April
2009. </p>
<p>The owner of the world''s largest brokerage followed
Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. in tapping the U.S.
corporate bond market after foreign financial firms dominated
issuance of the securities during the first two weeks of this
month. Morgan Stanley''s sale, the third-biggest in the U.S. this
year, comes after the New York-based firm reported fourth-
quarter earnings climbed 35 percent. </p>
<p>It shows that the market has come back almost all the
way, said Mirko Mikelic, a senior money manager who helps
oversee $13 billion of fixed-income assets at Fifth Third Asset
Management in Grand Rapids, Michigan. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s offering includes $1 billion of three-year
fixed-rate debt that pays 187.5 basis points more than similar-
maturity Treasuries and $1.5 billion of three-year floating-rate
notes that yield 160 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The bank also issued $2.75 billion of 10-year securities
that pay a spread of 237.5 basis points, Bloomberg data show. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The sale is the largest by a U.S. bank since JPMorgan sold
$5.9 billion of debt in April 2009, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>General Electric Capital Corp., the finance arm of General
Electric Co., and Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, as the
Rio de Janeiro-based state-owned oil company is known, each sold
$6 billion of bonds this month, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Fell Short </p>
<p>Net income at Morgan Stanley rose to $836 million, or 41
cents a share, from $617 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier,
the bank said today in a statement. Earnings from continuing
operations, excluding a 17-cent gain on the sale of a stake in
China International Capital Corp. and a tax gain of about 6
cents, were 20 cents a share. That fell short of the 28-cent
average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Citigroup issued $1 billion of three-year floating-rate
notes on Jan. 6 that yield 145 basis points more than the three-
month London interbank offered rate, Bloomberg data show. Libor
is the rate banks charge to lend to each other. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold $3.25 billion of debt on Jan. 14 in an
offering that included three-year floating-rate notes that pay
an 80 basis-point spread and fixed-rate bonds of the same
maturity that yield 110 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Foreign banks have issued $46.9 billion of corporate bonds
in the U.S. this year, accounting for 57 percent of the $83
billion of investment-grade company debt sold through yesterday,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Moody''s Investors Service ranks Morgan Stanley A2 and

<p> Morgan Stanley reported a 35 percent
increase in fourth-quarter earnings on record revenue from its
brokerage, the world''s biggest. Fixed-income trading revenue was
the lowest since the fourth quarter of 2008. </p>
<p>Net income rose to $836 million, or 41 cents a share, from
$617 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based
company said today in a statement. Earnings from continuing
operations, excluding a 17-cent gain on the sale of a stake in
China International Capital Corp. and a tax gain of about 6
cents, were 20 cents a share. That fell short of the 28-cent
average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley had higher investment-banking revenue than
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for the second time in the past three
years and the highest brokerage profit margin since it bought a
controlling stake in a joint venture with Citigroup Inc.''s Smith
Barney unit in 2009. Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 52,
replaced fixed-income trading head Jack DiMaio with Ken DeRegt
last week as fourth-quarter revenue from that business was less
than half its rivals. </p>
<p>The recovery of the market seems to be making Gorman''s
bet on retail look much more achievable, said Brad Hintz, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. in New York who rates the
stock outperform. The only issue is fixed income, and I
think they have the man in the job to fix it. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley rose $1.19, or 4.3 percent, to $28.94 in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading at 1:12 p.m., the biggest
jump in almost six months. The stock was up 2 percent this year
through yesterday. </p>
<p> Wealth Management </p>
<p>The global wealth-management division, which includes the
brokerage joint venture, had $3.35 billion in revenue, up 7
percent from a year earlier, and a 12 percent pretax profit
margin. The unit had $14.1 billion of net new assets, bringing
the annual total to $22.9 billion and meeting Gorman''s target of
more than $20 billion of inflows in 2010. </p>
<p>While the firm is taking steps toward Gorman''s goal of a 20
percent pretax margin by the end of this year, it remains
market dependent, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in
an interview. A 100-point move on the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index and a 50-basis-point change in the Fed funds rate each
affect the margin by 1 percentage point, Porat said on a
conference call with analysts. </p>
<p>The improving pretax margin in retail is very, very good
news and the promise of that 20 percent pretax margin from
retail is looking more achievable in a recovering market,
Hintz said. </p>
<p>Fixed Income </p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, Morgan Stanley''s revenue from fixed-
income sales and trading was negative $29 million. Excluding
gains or losses from its own credit spreads, fixed-income
revenue was $813 million, compared with $1.64 billion at Goldman
Sachs and $2.88 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>While we made progress in building out our fixed-income
business through investments in both people and technology,
there is more to be done to drive revenue and market share
growth, Gorman said in the statement. </p>
<p>In equities trading, Morgan Stanley posted fourth-quarter
revenue of $1.08 billion, up 17 percent from the third quarter
and 40 percent from a year earlier. The unit''s revenue, which
was $1.18 billion excluding debt-valuation adjustments, compares
with $1.13 billion at JPMorgan and $808 million at Citigroup. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley generated $1.52 billion in revenue from investment banking in the fourth quarter. It reaped $661 million
in fees from equity underwriting, higher than any of its closest
rivals. </p>
<p>In Transition'' </p>
<p>This is a company that''s still in transition in some of
its businesses, Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC in New York, said in an interview on Bloomberg
Television''s In the Loop. Yet in equities and MA, that''s
where Morgan Stanley really showed some strength in the quarter
and where its platform is strong. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, cut the investment bank''s compensation pool 2
percent last year to $7.08 billion, decreasing the share of
revenue used to reward employees. </p>
<p>Pay at the firm''s institutional securities unit, which
employs traders and bankers, was 43 percent of revenue including
a U.K. bonus tax, compared with 56 percent in 2009, according to
the firm''s website. The unit''s revenue rose 27 percent to $16.4
billion. The company set aside $16 billion for overall
compensation and benefits, up 11 percent from 2009. It owned its

<p> James Gorman, Morgan Stanley''s chief
executive officer since last January, was awarded deferred stock
and options valued at about $7.4 million for his performance in
2010, when the firm''s shares trailed rivals. </p>
<p>Gorman''s total compensation for last year is less than what
he received for 2009, when he got a $15.1 million package,
according to a person briefed on the matter who declined to be
identified because the figures aren''t yet public. The company''s
shares slid 8.1 percent in 2010. The stock and options awards
were disclosed in regulatory filings. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s largest brokerage, set
aside 51 percent of overall revenue for pay, meeting Gorman''s
promise to reduce the ratio after it surged to 62 percent in
2009. The firm''s shares have risen 10 percent this year after
the bank had record brokerage revenue in the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Gorman, 52, was co-president of the firm in 2009 and became
CEO in 2010. He will get 129,809 restricted shares, valued at
$3.9 million at yesterday''s closing price of $30.01, plus stock
options worth $3.5 million, according to a U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission filing yesterday. Cash bonuses and at-risk
performance stock units weren''t disclosed in the filings. He got
restricted shares worth $5.7 million for 2009. </p>
<p>Chairman John Mack, 66, received 66,912 restricted shares,
valued at $2 million. Mack declined a bonus for 2007, 2008 and
2009, his final three years as CEO. New York-based Morgan
Stanley more than doubled Mack''s salary to $2 million in May,
from the $800,000 annual salary he had received since he
rejoined the firm in 2005. </p>
<p>Deferred Pay </p>
<p>Members of the firm''s operating committee, which includes
Gorman and Mack, have an average of more than 80 percent of
their pay deferred, the firm said Jan. 20. The average amount of
all employees'' pay that will be deferred is 60 percent, up from
40 percent for 2009, the firm said. The stock options become
exercisable in three installments beginning in 2012. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat was awarded 123,787
restricted shares worth $3.7 million and options worth $1.5
million, according to a filing. </p>
<p>Colm Kelleher, co-president of the institutional securities
group, which includes investment banking and trading operations,
received 137,072 of the restricted shares valued at $4.1
million, a filing shows. Paul J. Taubman, co-president with
Kelleher, was granted 137,170 restricted shares worth $4.1

<p>Last week, Gorman named Fleming to replace Charles Johnston

vice chairman of Morgan Stanley Smith Barney until he retires at
the end of 2011. </p>
<p>Ken deRegt, who was chief risk officer before being named

restricted shares valued at $2.9 million, plus options worth
$500,000, the filing shows. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said Jan. 20 that compensation and benefits
expenses rose 11 percent to $16 billion in 2010 as it owned its

<p>U.S. equity strategists at JPMorgan
Chase  Co. say this week''s slump is a buying opportunity
because monetary policy is supportive and the economy has
positive momentum. </p>
<p>The group led by Thomas J. Lee identified 19 stocks, which
they forecast to gain at least 10 percent, including Citigroup
Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Newmont Mining Corp. The Standard
 Poor''s 500 Index declined 1 percent on Jan. 19, the biggest
one-day drop since November, and slipped 0.8 percent to 1,283.35
this week. The measure closed at the highest level since August
2008 on Jan 18. </p>
<p>While we ultimately expect a correction in the
March/April timeframe, we are buyers of this current dip, New
York-based Lee said in a report today. </p>
<p>Faster inflation in other countries means that the U.S.
fully capitalizes on economic growth surprise, because the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates before 2013,
the strategists said. In contrast to a year ago, indicators for
the U.S. such as the Economic Cycle Research Institute''s U.S.
Weekly Leading Index have been gaining strength, the report
said. Money supply also is growing at a faster rate than a year
ago, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>The strategists favor financial and consumer cyclical
companies, a view they said is widely held. Within the groups,
they recommended 19 companies with out-of-favor characteristics
including high market value, low price, low price-to-earnings
ratios, low price momentum and high quality. </p>

<p>An unidentified Morgan Stanley
banker provided information on Advanced Micro Devices Inc.''s
purchase of ATI Technologies Inc., U.S. prosecutors in the Raj Rajaratnam insider-trading case said. </p>
<p>In a letter to lawyers for Rajaratnam, the Galleon Group LP
co-founder who goes on trial next month for insider trading,
U.S. prosecutors said the Morgan Stanley banker in May 2006 gave
the information to an unnamed person who passed the tip on to
Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>A public copy of the letter contains redactions obscuring
the identities of the Morgan Stanley banker and the person who
allegedly passed Rajaratnam the tip. </p>
<p>In or about May 2006, [redacted], a banker with Morgan
Stanley, provided [redacted] with information regarding AMD''s
acquisition of ATI, said the letter, signed by Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jonathan Streeter. [Redacted] provided this
information to Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>Prosecutors filed a superseding indictment against
Rajaratnam yesterday. Morgan Stanley has put the banker on
leave. </p>
<p>We have placed the banker on leave and are fully
cooperating with the government''s investigation, said 
Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley. 
Pendleton declined to identify the banker or say when he was 
put on leave. </p>
<p>Victim'' </p>
<p>We believe we are the victim of an insider trading
scheme, AMD spokesman Mike Silverman said in an e-mail today.
We have been cooperating with the U.S. attorney''s office and
will continue to do so. Beyond that, we have no comment. </p>
<p>The letter was filed as an attachment to papers filed by
Rajaratnam asking U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell, who is
presiding over Rajaratnam''s criminal case, to block a document
subpoena prosecutors are trying to issue to Galleon Management
LP. Prosecutors on January 13 asked Holwell for permission to
serve the subpoena, according to Rajaratnam''s motion. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley isn''t the only Wall Street bank to be drawn
into the Rajaratnam case. As of April, Rajat Gupta, then a
member of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. board, was under
examination by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as
part of the case, according to a person familiar with the
Galleon investigation who asked not to identified. </p>
<p>Gupta has not been accused of wrongdoing. His lawyer, Gary Naftalis, has said that Gupta''s record of ethical conduct is
beyond reproach. Naftalis didn''t immediately respond to an e-
mail request for comment today. </p>
<p>Dozens of Companies </p>
<p>Today''s court filing and earlier ones list dozens of
companies that Rajaratnam is alleged to have traded illegally. </p>
<p>When Rajaratnam was arrested on Oct. 16, 2009, prosecutors
cited trades in Google Inc., Polycom Inc., Hilton Hotels Corp.,
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Akamai Technologies Inc., Clearwire
Corp. and PeopleSupport Inc. A Dec. 15, 2009 indictment added
two more: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. and Atheros
Communications Inc. </p>
<p>A superseding indictment on Feb. 9, 2010 increased the
number of stocks to 12, with the addition of ATI Technologies
Inc. eBay Inc., and Intel Corp. </p>
<p>Beginning on March 22, prosecutors said in letters to John Dowd, a lawyer for Rajaratnam, that they had evidence about 21
more stocks. Those include Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Cisco
Systems Inc. ATT Inc., Clear Channel Corp., NetLogic
Microsystems Inc., International Business Machines Corp., @Road
Inc., Integrated Circuit Systems Inc., PF Chang''s China Bistro
Inc., Spansion Inc., Xilinx Inc., Broadcom Corp., Nvidia Corp.,
and others. </p>
<p>PG, Smuckers </p>
<p>Beginning on Dec. 2, prosecutors added Procter  Gamble Co.
and The JM Smucker Co. to the list, according to Dowd''s filing
today, which also cites Intersil Corp. and CA Inc. </p>
<p>Other stocks cited in court papers include Cavium Networks
Inc., Garmin Ltd, MEMC Electronic Materials Inc., Synaptics
Inc., Nuance Communications Inc. and Business Objects SA. The
court filing today also indicates that prosecutors know the
identities of others who allegedly leaked tips. The names are
redacted in the public court filing. In addition to the Morgan
Stanley banker, it cites employees at Intersil, Nvidia, and
Intel. Prosecutors also say they''re aware of the source of leaks
about Vishay Intertechnology Inc. </p>
<p>In his filing, Dowd says prosecutors in April sought
documents about two Galleon employees allegedly involved in
schemes to swap illegal tips about Xilinx, Spansion and @Road.
He doesn''t identify those employees or say whether prosecutors
were referring to other Galleon employees previously charged. </p>
<p>The billionaire Rajaratnam is the central figure in a
three-year probe in which more than 20 people have been
criminally charged. </p>
<p>Phone Taps </p>
<p>The case is the first in which prosecutors and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation have made extensive use of the phone
tapping techniques used to battle organized crime against
significant Wall Street insider-trading scheme. </p>
<p>The Sri Lankan-born Rajaratnam, who has pleaded not guilty,
is accused of making more than $40 million in illegal schemes
dating back to 2003. Both he and his co-defendant Danielle Chiesi were accused of profiting from tips provided by company
executives, hedge-fund employees and other insiders. </p>
<p>He is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 28. Other stocks cited
in court papers include Cavium Networks Inc., Garmin Ltd, MEMC
Electronic Materials Inc., Synaptics Inc., Nuance Communications
Inc. and Business Objects SA. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-1184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York  Manhattan). </p>

<p> General Electric Co. climbed the
most in almost two years after fourth-quarter profit growth
topped analysts'' estimates, industrial equipment orders rose and
sales increased for the first time since September 2008. </p>
<p>Earnings from continuing operations gained 31 percent to
$3.93 billion, or 36 cents a share, from $2.99 billion, or 27
cents, a year earlier, GE said today. That topped average
estimates from analysts of 32 cents a share. Sales rose 1
percent to $41.4 billion, also surpassing projections. </p>
<p>The results reflected a rebound in finance, health-care and
transportation units that mitigated a drop in the energy
division. Orders in the Energy Infrastructure segment rose 4
percent, a signal that Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Immelt
may be able to post future revenue gains. </p>
<p>Our performance is accelerating and I think our results
show that, Immelt said on a call with investors to discuss
results. The company is really well positioned for long-term
organic growth. </p>
<p>GE shares rose $1.31 to $19.74 in New York Stock Exchange
composite trading, the highest closing price since November
2008. The 7.1 percent increase was the largest since March 2009. </p>
<p>Profit from discontinued operations, including the sale of
the BAC-Credomatic GECF Inc. bank to Colombia''s biggest
financial holding company, was $605 million, or 6 cents a share.
That brought net income to $4.54 billion, or 42 cents a share. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $2.5
billion of 30-year debt in its first sale of the securities in
more than three years, as investors accept the lowest premiums
since April for bank bonds with similar credit grades. </p>
<p>The 6.25 percent notes from the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets pay 170 basis points, or 1.7 percentage points, more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The bank sold the debt after reporting on Jan. 19 that
earnings dropped 52 percent as a slowdown in trading and investment banking reduced revenue more than analysts estimated.
Relative yields for banks ranked A by Standard  Poor''s, such as
New York-based Goldman Sachs''s, have still tumbled from last
year''s high of 305 basis points in June to 214 basis points as
of yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>As far as U.S. banks go, the sentiment really is that
they do have a lot of liquidity on their balance sheets, but
rates continue to be quite low, said Rajeev Sharma, a money
manager at First Investors Management in New York who helps
oversee $1.5 billion of investment-grade credit. </p>
<p>The spreads on bank bonds graded A are at the lowest since
the level was 208 basis points on April 23, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. Spreads on overall A rated
corporate notes were at 159 basis points yesterday. </p>
<p>Looking for Spread'' </p>
<p>With A rated debt, the sentiment continues to be you''re
looking for spread, and a lot of the bank paper continually has
more spread than industrial paper, Sharma said. It makes it
very attractive if you compare it to a regular industrial out
there. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs may use proceeds for general corporate
purposes with the debt rated A1 by Moody''s Investors Service and
A by Standard  Poor''s, according to a person familiar with the
offering who declined to be identified, citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly about the transaction. </p>
<p>The bank last issued 30-year U.S. dollar bonds in benchmark
size in September 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In that offering, the bank sold $2.5 billion of 6.75 percent
debt due in October 2037 at a spread of 190 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. Benchmark
sales are typically at least $500 million. </p>
<p>The transaction is also the first benchmark offering of 30-
year debt by a U.S. bank since October, when JPMorgan Chase 
Co. sold $1.25 billion of 30-year bonds in October, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, issued
5.5 percent debt maturing in October 2040 in that offering at a
spread of 165 basis points, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sold $1.3 billion of 50-year debt on Oct. 26,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds were offered in $25 denominations
and can''t be called, or redeemed, for five years, the bank said

<p> Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest

<p>The $14.25-a-share offer is now scheduled to expire at 5:00

<p>The acquisition would be Pfizer''s biggest since its $68

<p>It''s bonus season for Wall Street,
and while Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s employees are learning the
extent of their 2010 pay cuts, they''ll still take home more than
rivals at JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>JPMorgan started telling employees of year-end payouts this
week, while Morgan Stanley will do it today, people told of the
banks'' plans said, requesting anonymity because the timing isn''t
public. Citigroup Inc., which awarded executive bonuses on Jan.
18, started telling traders and investment bankers about payouts
the next day, said Jon Diat, a spokesman. Yesterday, it said it
gave about $50 million in stock to 15 top executives. London-
based Barclays Plc''s bankers will get the news mid-February, two
people said. </p>
<p>U.S. and European banks are under pressure to curb bonuses
after taxpayers were forced to bail out the industry during the
financial crisis. JPMorgan''s investment bank set aside enough
money to pay an average of $369,651 to each employee for 2010,
or 2.4 percent less than in 2009, according to the company''s
year-end financial statements. Goldman Sachs''s pool equates to
an average of $430,700, a reduction of 14 percent. </p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, bonuses are going to be down 5
percent to 10 percent on last year as revenues have fallen,
said Shaun Springer, chief executive officer of London-based
Square Mile Services Ltd., which advises firms on compensation. </p>
<p>Employee Rewards </p>
<p>Investment banks set aside a portion of revenue to reward
employees and typically decide bonuses at the end of the year
based on annual results. Average pay per worker doesn''t reflect
the amount of money each employee actually receives. Top
executives sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards, while
clerical workers get less. </p>
<p>The four New York-based banks will spend a combined $84.4
billion, or an average of $141,192 apiece, on their 598,073
workers, according to financial reports released since Jan. 14. </p>
<p>That figure is pulled down by the average at Citigroup --
$93,962 last year -- because the bank has 260,000 employees,
many of them tellers, commercial bankers and transaction
processors, who earn lower pay. Citigroup doesn''t break out pay
for its investment-banking and trading division, where workers
get multiples of what most retail banking employees receive. </p>
<p>Newly promoted Chief Operating Officer John Havens received
stock worth $4.75 million as of the share''s closing price on
Jan. 18, when the bonuses were awarded, according to yesterday''s
disclosures. Brian Leach, the chief risk officer, got stock
worth $5.16 million. </p>
<p>Bonus Declined </p>
<p>Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach got $2.33
million and Vice Chairman Lewis Kaden received $4.29 million.
Americas consumer banking chief Manuel Medina-Mora got $4
million. Mike Corbat, head of Citi Holdings, got $4.88 million,
as did the bank''s chief administrative officer, Don Callahan.
The bank disclosed last year that Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit declined a 2010 bonus. Shannon Bell, a Citigroup
spokeswoman, declined to elaborate on payouts. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut the investment bank''s compensation pool
by 2 percent to $7.08 billion. The firm doesn''t disclose the
number of employees in the unit. Companywide, Morgan Stanley
paid its 62,542 employees an average $256,596 last year, up from
$238,602 for each of the 60,494 employees at the end of 2009,
figures released yesterday show. The company''s 2010 pay accounts
for a full-year ownership of the Smith Barney brokerage,
compared with seven months in 2009. </p>
<p>The firm has told some employees to expect investment-
banking bonuses to decline 10 percent to 30 percent, two people
briefed on the matter said last month. </p>
<p>New Rules </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which reported earnings Jan. 14, set aside $9.73
billion for 26,314 workers at its investment bank. </p>
<p>Employees at Bank of America Corp., based in Charlotte, North Carolina, will be told their bonuses Jan. 26, a person
with knowledge of the plan said. The bank reports fourth-quarter
earnings today. </p>
<p>The U.K. Financial Services Authority last month approved
new rules agreed by European Union regulators restricting
guaranteed bonuses and up-front cash payments for banks''
proprietary traders and broker dealers. The regulations allow
bankers to receive about 25 percent of their bonuses in
immediate cash payouts and require the rest to be deferred or
held in shares for a minimum of three years. </p>

<p>An unidentified Morgan Stanley
banker was placed on leave related to allegations the employee
provided inside information on Advanced Micro Devices Inc.''s
purchase of ATI Technologies Inc. that was passed on to Galleon
Group founder Raj Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>The banker was referred to in a letter written by U.S.
prosecutors and filed in Rajaratnam''s criminal case yesterday.
The public copy of the letter contains redactions obscuring the
identities of the Morgan Stanley banker and the person who
allegedly passed the tip to Rajaratnam, who is scheduled to go
on trial next month for securities fraud. </p>
<p>In or about May 2006, [redacted], a banker with Morgan
Stanley, provided [redacted] with information regarding AMD''s
acquisition of ATI, said the letter, signed by Assistant U.S.
Attorney Jonathan Streeter. [Redacted] provided this
information to Rajaratnam. </p>
<p>Bloomberg data shows that Morgan Stanley acted as an
adviser to AMD on the ATI acquisition. The bank also provided a
$2.5 billion loan to finance the deal. </p>
<p>We have placed the banker on leave and are fully
cooperating with the government''s investigation, said Pen Pendleton, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley.
Pendleton declined to identify the banker or say when he was put
on leave. He had no immediate comment on the bank''s connection
to the AMD acquisition of ATI. </p>
<p>Victim'' </p>
<p>We believe we are the victim of an insider trading
scheme, Mike Silverman, an AMD spokesman, said yesterday in an
e-mail. We have been cooperating with the U.S. attorney''s
office and will continue to do so. Beyond that, we have no
comment. </p>
<p>Prosecutors filed a superseding indictment dated Jan. 20
against Rajaratnam that added a new securities-fraud count and
provided additional details about stocks he is alleged to have
traded illegally. </p>
<p>Rajaratnam is charged with five counts of conspiracy to
commit securities fraud and nine counts of securities fraud.
He''s the central figure in an insider-trading probe in which
more than 20 people have been criminally charged. Rajaratnam has
pleaded not guilty and is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 28. </p>
<p>The prosecutors'' letter was filed as an attachment to
papers filed by Rajaratnam asking U.S. District Judge Richard Holwell, who is presiding over his criminal case, to block a
document subpoena prosecutors are trying to issue to Galleon
Management LP. Prosecutors on January 13 asked Holwell for
permission to serve the subpoena, according to Rajaratnam''s
motion. </p>
<p>Wall Street Banks </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley isn''t the only Wall Street bank to be drawn
into the Rajaratnam case. As of April, Rajat Gupta, then a
member of the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. board, was under
examination by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as
part of the case, according to a person familiar with the
Galleon investigation who asked not to identified. </p>
<p>Gupta hasn''t been accused of wrongdoing. His lawyer, Gary Naftalis, has said that Gupta''s record of ethical conduct is
beyond reproach. Naftalis didn''t immediately respond to an
e-mail seeking comment yesterday. </p>
<p>In addition to using tips about the 2006 ATI acquisition,
Rajaratnam traded on tips about AMD''s plan to spin off two
plants in 2008, prosecutors said. </p>
<p>Former CEO </p>
<p>Prosecutors claimed that Danielle Chiesi, Rajaratnam''s
former codefendant who pleaded guilty to insider trading charges
this week, received inside tips from an unidentified AMD
executive, later identified by a person familiar with the
investigation as Hector Ruiz, the company''s former chief
executive officer. </p>
<p>Former McKinsey  Co. director Anil Kumar, who pleaded
guilty in January 2010, admitted leaking tips to Rajaratnam,
including information about AMD''s spinoff and the ATI
acquisition. </p>
<p>Prosecutors claim that, in a wiretapped conversation in
2008, Rajaratnam boasted to Chiesi that he had better
information about AMD than she did. </p>
<p>Tell me I''m the best in AMD, Rajaratnam allegedly said. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s court filing and earlier ones list dozens of
companies whose stock Rajaratnam is alleged to have traded
illegally. </p>
<p>When Rajaratnam was arrested on Oct. 16, 2009, prosecutors
cited trades in Google Inc., Polycom Inc., Hilton Hotels Corp.,
Advanced Micro Devices Inc., Akamai Technologies Inc., Clearwire
Corp. and PeopleSupport Inc. A Dec. 15, 2009, indictment added
two more: Marvell Technology Group Ltd. and Atheros
Communications Inc. </p>
<p>New Charge </p>
<p>A superseding indictment on Feb. 9, 2010 increased the
number of stocks to 12, with the addition of ATI Technologies
Inc., EBay Inc. and Intel Corp. </p>
<p>Beginning on March 22, prosecutors said in letters to John Dowd, a lawyer for Rajaratnam, that they had evidence of about
21 more stocks. Those included Goldman Sachs Group, Cisco

<p> Microsoft Corp., the world''s biggest
software maker, filed a U.S. trade complaint seeking to prevent TiVo Inc. from importing television set-top boxes. </p>
<p>The complaint submitted today to the U.S. International
Trade Commission in Washington accuses TiVo of infringing four
patents. Microsoft is asking that TiVo be barred from importing
the digital-video recorders, which are primarily made in Mexico
and sold in the U.S. </p>
<p>The ITC case opens a new front in a battle that began more
than a year ago when Microsoft challenged TiVo patents that were
being asserted against ATT Inc., a customer of the Redmond,
Washington-based software maker. A separate lawsuit was filed
claiming TiVo infringed seven Microsoft patents. The two sides
are in talks to settle the dispute, according to Microsoft. </p>
<p>We remain open to resolving this situation through an
intellectual property licensing agreement, and we look forward
to continued negotiations with TiVo, Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft
spokesman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>Krista Wierzbicki, a spokeswoman for TiVo, said the
Alviso, California-based company has no comment on the dispute. </p>
<p>The four patents in the ITC case relate to program
schedules and selection, controlling the interface, and a way to
restrict use of the DVR based on the program''s rating. Microsoft
said the technology is used in its Mediaroom software that runs
on competing set-top boxes including ATT''s U-Verse service. </p>
<p>2009 Lawsuit </p>
<p>TiVo filed a patent-infringement suit against Dallas-based
ATT in August 2009, and Microsoft was allowed to join the case
to argue on behalf of its customer. That case is pending, as is
the suit accusing TiVo of infringing seven patents. </p>
<p>The ITC is a quasi-judicial agency that has the power to
block imports of products found to infringe U.S. intellectual
property rights. </p>
<p>Microsoft said it also filed a civil suit making the same
allegations in federal court in Seattle. </p>
<p>The new case is In the Matter of Set-Top Boxes, and
Hardware and Software Components Thereof, Complaint No. 2782,
U.S. International Trade Commission  Washington). </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling in
favor of a JPMorgan Chase  Co. unit, shielded banks from some
lawsuits by credit-card consumers whose interest rates were
increased after they went into default. </p>
<p>The justices today unanimously said that a since-changed
Federal Reserve Board regulation let Chase Bank USA raise James
A. McCoy''s interest rates without notifying him. Chase''s
cardholder agreement said the company could impose higher rates
in the event of a default. </p>
<p>In siding with Chase, the court said it was deferring to
the Fed''s interpretation of the rule, known as Regulation Z.
Although the Fed changed the regulation in 2009 to require
notification to defaulting customers, the Obama administration
argued that companies before then didn''t have to provide notice. </p>
<p>Because the interpretation the board presents in its
brief is consistent with the regulatory text, we need look no
further in deciding this case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote
for the court. </p>
<p>The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had ruled against Chase in a decision that led to similar suits
being filed in California against other banks. </p>
<p>Regulation Z implements a consumer-protection provision in
the U.S. Truth in Lending Act. </p>
<p>The case is Chase Bank v. McCoy, 09-329. </p>

<p>A lawyer for Yonni Sebbag, the
California man who pleaded guilty in a scheme to leak Walt
Disney Co. earnings information, asked a court to sentence his
client to time served, or eight months in jail, in what he
called a hare-brained scheme. </p>
<p>The attorney, Steven R. Kartagener, wrote to U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood today asking for less than the 27 to 33 months
recommended by federal guidelines when she sentences Sebbag, 30,
on Jan. 28. Sebbag turned to crime after failing in the
restaurant business then losing money in day-trading and
gambling, the lawyer wrote. </p>
<p>Defendant''s foolhardy undertaking was driven by
defendant''s desperation in the face of his failing business, and
by a gambling addiction which began to take control of his
life, Kartagener said in a letter to Wood. </p>
<p>Sebbag and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, pleaded guilty to
attempting to sell confidential information about the
entertainment company''s quarterly earnings. Hoxie, a former
executive assistant to Disney corporate communications chief Zenia Mucha, is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 22. </p>
<p>Sebbag, a Moroccan citizen, faces deportation in addition
to prison time, Kartagener said in the letter. </p>
<p> Hedge Funds </p>
<p>Prosecutors claimed Sebbag sent letters in March to at
least 33 investment companies, including hedge funds, offering
to sell confidential information about Burbank, California-based
Disney. </p>
<p>On March 11, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation began reaching out to the pair, according to the
charging document filed in New York. On May 8, the two gave
undercover FBI agents internal Disney documents, according to
the filing. </p>
<p>None of the funds acted on the tips, a person familiar with
the matter said. Disney said it cooperated with prosecutors. </p>
<p>This hare-brained scheme was obviously doomed to fail
from the start, said Kartagenerin the letter. Defendant is
extremely remorseful, and knows that what he did was stupid and
wrong. </p>

<p> Walt Disney Co.''s money-losing
interactive media unit cut 29 percent of its workers in video-
game development for consoles, according to a person with
knowledge of the decision. </p>
<p>Disney fired about 200 of the 700 workers who design games
for consoles such as Nintendo Co.''s Wii, said the person, who
sought anonymity because the move isn''t public. Disney
Interactive Media has about 3,000 workers, the person said. </p>
<p>John Pleasants and James Pitaro, installed as the unit''s
co-presidents last year by Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger, are cutting console jobs as they add online and mobile
games. Iger, 59, told investors in November the company
shouldn''t be in the interactive business if we''re not going to
be able to make money. </p>
<p>Disney''s interactive unit lost $234 million in the most
recent fiscal year. In a 2006 interview, Iger said it would take
as long as five years before the division would be profitable. </p>
<p>In a statement, Disney said the restructuring began this
week at the interactive division, which includes games, online
worlds and websites aimed at parents and kids. The Burbank,
California-based company said it''s setting a strategic
direction for future success in the digital-media space. </p>
<p>Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Disney, declined to
comment on the number of jobs cut. </p>
<p>Austin, Vancouver </p>
<p>Dana Henry, a Disney spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today
that Propaganda Games in Vancouver were shuttered last week and
Junction Point Studios in Austin, Texas, had a minor reduction
in workforce, as part of an overall restructuring of the Disney
Interactive Media Group. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s biggest media company, fell 8 cents to
$39.86 today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares climbed 16 percent in 2010, exceeding the 13 percent
increase in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>The job cuts were reported previously by the Los Angeles
Times and others. </p>
<p>Pleasants, who oversaw Playdom Inc. before its acquisition
by Disney, and Pitaro, who ran entertainment assets at Yahoo
Inc., replaced Steve Wadsworth, who left Disney last year. Both

<p>Jay Dweck, head of a quantitative
software and modeling group in Morgan Stanley''s sales and
trading division, is leaving the firm. </p>
<p>Dweck, head of the strats and modeling group, is departing
after more than three years at the New York-based company,
according to an internal memo obtained today by Bloomberg News.
Mark Lake, a Morgan Stanley spokesman, confirmed the contents of
the memo. Dweck joined Morgan Stanley in 2007 after 13 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to build and manage software programs
to handle trading. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 52, is making changes
in the firm''s trading unit after fourth-quarter revenue from the
fixed-income business was less than half its rivals. The company
replaced fixed-income trading head Jack DiMaio with Ken deRegt
earlier this month and last week hired Glenn Hadden from Goldman
Sachs as global head of interest rates. </p>
<p>Christine Murphy and Michael Sternberg will become co-heads
of the global sales and trading strats group, according to the
memo. The unit is a quantitative group within the firm''s trading
operations, according to the firm''s website. </p>
<p>Dweck, 55, was previously head of equity strategies and
head of core strategies at Goldman Sachs. He received degrees in
math and chemical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in Cambridge. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s fourth-quarter revenue from fixed-income
sales and trading was negative $29 million. Excluding gains or
losses from its own credit spreads, fixed-income revenue was
$813 million, compared with $1.64 billion at Goldman Sachs and
$2.88 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>DeRegt, the firm''s chief risk officer, is becoming global
head of fixed-income sales and trading, excluding commodities.
DiMaio, who was head of interest rate, credit and currency

<p>Bear Stearns Bid to Get Securities Suit Tossed Denied by Judge </p>
<p>Bear Stearns Cos. once the world''s fifth-largest investment
bank, lost a bid to dismiss a federal securities lawsuit when a
judge ruled there is sufficient reason to take parts of the
consolidated case to trial. </p>
<p>An investor originally sued the New York-based firm in
November 2007 alleging mismanagement, in part for buying risky
subprime mortgage loans for collateralized debt obligations,
according to court papers. Other lawsuits followed. </p>
<p>The incantation of fraud-by-hindsight will not defeat an
allegation of misrepresentations and omissions that were
misleading and false at the time they were made, wrote U.S.
District Judge Robert W. Sweet in a 398-page opinion Jan.19. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. bought Bear Stearns in March 2008,
with the firm on the brink of collapse. </p>
<p>In his opinion, Sweet refused to dismiss a case alleging
misstatements by Bear Stearns and auditor Deloitte  Touche, and
agreed to dismiss a so-called derivative suit seeking damages
for the company and a suit filed by former Bear Stearns
employees over a stock ownership plan. </p>
<p>It is important to recognize that in ruling on the
defendants'' motions to dismiss, the court was required to assume
that the allegations in plaintiffs'' complaint were true, and
Deloitte believes that the claims asserted against it are
meritless, said company spokesman Jonathan Gandal in an
e-mailed message. </p>
<p>We believe that the Bear Stearns-related security law
claims that survived the motion to dismiss are entirely without
merit and we intend to seek their dismissal at an appropriate
juncture, said JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli
in a telephone interview. </p>

Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>
<p>HP Can Proceed With Hurd Departure Investigation, Judge Rules </p>
<p>A federal judge allowed a probe of Mark Hurd''s departure
from Hewlett-Packard Co. to go forward, overriding Hurd''s
objection to the investigation based on claims he deserves to
see documents HP''s board refuses to share. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge James Ware, in San Jose, California,
canceled a hearing on the matter scheduled for yesterday,
finding good cause to let the company investigation go
forward while halting the lawsuit that prompted it for 45 days.
The suit alleges that directors at the largest maker of
computers wasted company money by awarding Hurd as much as
$53 million in severance when he resigned as chief executive
officer in August. </p>
<p>Hurd quit after the Palo Alto, California-based company
found that he violated business conduct standards in trying to
conceal a personal relationship with a contractor. </p>
<p>Ware scheduled a new hearing in March, requiring an
update on the investigation beforehand, according to his
Jan. 20 order. </p>
<p>Ware''s order doesn''t say whether Hurd was able to see the
documents he seeks. The new probe would be conducted by a
committee of directors who joined HP after Hurd''s departure and
by lawyers not involved in the shareholder litigation, according
to a case-management statement filed Jan. 14. </p>
<p>Mylene Mangalindan, an HP spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the judge''s ruling yesterday. Glenn Bunting, a spokesman for
Hurd, didn''t immediately return calls and e-mails seeking

<p> Singapore Criticizes Fund Managers'' Window Dressing'' </p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it won''t tolerate
window dressing by fund managers in its response to an
appeal against the civil stock-rigging lawsuit it won last year
against Pheim Asset Management Sdn. </p>

<p>Verdicts/Settlement </p>
<p>SEC Settles Foreign Bribe Case With Ex-Innospec Chief </p>
<p>The former chief executive officer of Innospec Inc., Paul
W. Jennings, agreed to settle foreign bribery allegations
brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. </p>
<p>Jennings agreed to pay about $229,000 in penalties to
resolve claims that he bribed Iraqi and Indonesian officials to
win contracts for the company''s specialty chemicals, the SEC
said in a statement. The agency filed a civil complaint
yesterday against Jennings in federal court in Washington. </p>
<p>The SEC claimed that Jennings actively participated in
bribery schemes in Iraq and Indonesia since 2004. The agency
said that from 2000 to 2008 Innospec Inc. paid more than
$6 million in bribes in exchange for about $177 million in
revenue, which generated $60 million in profit. </p>
<p>Jennings''s attorney, Jay Holtmeier, didn''t immediately
return a telephone message seeking comment. </p>
<p>Innospec spokesman Brian Watt declined to comment on
Jennings''s settlement, saying the company resolved its matter
with authorities last year. </p>
<p>The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Jennings, 11-cv-00144, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia

<p>JPMorgan Wins at U.S. High Court in Credit-Card Case </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling in favor of a JPMorgan Chase
 Co. unit, shielded banks from some lawsuits by consumers whose
rates were increased after they went into default. </p>
<p>The justices yesterday unanimously said that a since-
changed Federal Reserve Board regulation let Chase Bank USA
raise James A. McCoy''s interest rates without notifying him.
Chase''s cardholder agreement said the company could impose
higher rates in the event of a default. </p>
<p>In siding with Chase, the court said it was deferring to
the Fed''s interpretation of the rule, known as Regulation Z.
Although the Fed changed the regulation in 2009 to require
notification to defaulting customers, the Obama administration
argued that companies before then didn''t have to provide notice. </p>
<p>Because the interpretation the board presents in its
brief is consistent with the regulatory text, we need look no
further in deciding this case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote
for the court. </p>
<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled against
Chase in a decision that led to similar suits being filed in
California against other banks. </p>
<p>Regulation Z implements a consumer-protection provision in
the U.S. Truth in Lending Act. </p>
<p>The case is Chase Bank v. McCoy, 09-329, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). </p>
<p>Worker Retaliation Suits Backed by U.S. Supreme Court </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court bolstered the ability of employees
to sue for retaliation, ruling in favor of a man who was fired
after his fiance complained about alleged sex discrimination at
the same company. </p>
<p>The justices yesterday unanimously said that Title VII, the
federal law that covers gender and racial discrimination in the
workplace, protects third parties from retaliation in addition
to the person pressing the original complaint. </p>
<p>The anti-retaliation provision in Title VII is worded
broadly, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court. We
think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded
from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fianc
would be fired, he wrote. </p>
<p>The ruling lets Eric L. Thompson press ahead with a lawsuit
against his former employer, North American Stainless LP.
Thompson was fired in 2003, three weeks after the company
learned that his fiance, Miriam Regalado, had filed a complaint
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and claimed she
had suffered discrimination by her supervisor. </p>
<p>A federal appeals court had barred the suit from going
forward. The Obama administration backed Thompson in the case. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. demanded that a
lender repurchase bad mortgages even as it resisted calls to buy
back the loans from bonds created by Bear Stearns Cos., an
insurer said in court papers. </p>
<p>That would be pretty bad if true, said Joshua Rosner, an
analyst at New York-based research firm Graham Fisher  Co. He
said such allegations show why investors and consumers have a
right to be distrustful of the banks'' statements. </p>
<p>Ambac Assurance Corp., the debt guarantor partly seized
last year by Wisconsin''s insurance commissioner, made the claim
in a proposed amended complaint in its lawsuit against Bear
Stearns''s EMC Mortgage unit, now owned by JPMorgan. Ambac,
seeking to add a fraud claim to the case, referenced
depositions, e-mail and letters in the filing, which was
unsealed Jan. 14 in Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>Mortgage-bond investors and other insurers, including
Allstate Corp., Pacific Investment Management Co. and MBIA Inc.,
have accused loan sellers or bond underwriters of sometimes
misrepresenting the quality of the underlying debt enough to
trigger contractual or legal provisions requiring repurchases.
So-called mortgage putbacks may cost banks and lenders as much
as $90 billion, JPMorgan bond analysts said in an October
report. </p>
<p> Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the filing, which the company
had fought to keep secret. A federal judge must still rule on
whether to allow the amended complaint to go forward. </p>
<p>Insured Bonds </p>
<p>Bear Stearns sought on March 11, 2008 -- just weeks before
the collapsing company agreed to be bought by JPMorgan -- to
have a lender buy back mortgages in bonds insured by Syncora
Guarantee Inc., according to the filing. Bear Stearns said the
mortgages failed to meet promised standards of quality. </p>
<p>At the same time, Bear Stearns was denying demands from
Syncora that it repurchase the loans, even though the insurer
cited the same flaws, according to the filing. Bear Stearns had
bought the loans and packaged them into bonds to sell to
investors. </p>
<p>JPMorgan later maintained that it is EMC''s position that
these breaches materially and adversely affect the value of
the loans, according to the complaint, which cited a June 26,
2008, letter from Alison Malkin, an executive director in
JPMorgan''s securities unit, to the lender, a now-closed unit of
Capital One Financial Corp. </p>
<p>Diametrically Opposing'' </p>
<p>Remarkably, Malkin took diametrically opposing positions
in repeatedly refusing to comply with all but 4 percent of
Syncora''s repurchase demands, Ambac said in the proposed
amended complaint. </p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in November 2008. New York-based Ambac Financial Group Inc., Ambac Assurance''s parent, filed for bankruptcy protection last year. Syncora, which was ordered to
stop paying claims by New York regulators in 2008, is also suing
EMC Mortgage. </p>
<p>On Dec. 16, U.S. Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz issued a
report and recommendations to U.S. District Court Judge Richard Berman in New York, who is presiding over the Ambac case. Katz,
who is handling pretrial matters, recommended that Ambac be
allowed to add a fraudulent-inducement claim against EMC. </p>
<p>EMC''s lawyers on Jan. 14 argued against letting Ambac file
the proposed amended complaint. EMC has also asked Katz to
reconsider his ruling. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last quarter set aside $1.5 billion in litigation
reserves to cover costs related to buying back faulty mortgages.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said it will take years to
resolve the disputes and to determine the ultimate cost to his
bank. </p>
<p>Ugly Mess'' </p>
<p>It''s going to be a long ugly mess, but it won''t be life-
threatening to JPMorgan, he told analysts on a Jan. 14
conference call. </p>
<p>The bank also ignored the findings of mortgage-review firm
Clayton Holdings LLC in abandoning mortgage repurchases that
Bear Stearns had been considering in early 2008 stemming from a
pool of 596 of loans in bonds guaranteed by Ambac, according to
the insurer''s amended complaint. </p>
<p>Clayton found that 56 percent of the loans involved
material breaches of Bear Stearns''s contractual promises,
according to the filing, which cited a copy of a November 2007
document from the review firm to the company. </p>
<p>As Malkin overruled Bear Stearns decisions on which
mortgages to repurchase to limit JPMorgan reserve expenses, the
portion of those loans that were approved for repurchase fell to
2.2 percent by September 2008, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Proof that the bank ignored a third-party review is
major, that''s hugely newsworthy, said Isaac Gradman, a San
Francisco-based consultant and formerly a lawyer at Howard Rice
Nemerovski Canady Falk  Rabkin. </p>
<p>Both Sides </p>
<p>With the Syncora loans, if they''re making an argument out
of one side of their mouth and a different argument out of the
other, that is arguably a breach of an implied covenant of good
faith and would be very strong evidence to prove repurchase
demands, he said in a telephone interview. Gradman represented
mortgage insurer PMI Group Inc. in a now-settled lawsuit over
similar issues against General Electric Co. and its defunct
mortgage unit </p>
<p>Ambac also alleges in its proposed complaint that, as early
as 2005, Bear Stearns was making a strategy out of earning
double money on shoddy mortgages. First Bear Stearns sold
securities backed by the debt, then forced the mortgage lender
that sold it the loans to pay up when they turned delinquent in
the first few months or were otherwise proved to have breached
originators'' representations, Ambac said. </p>
<p>Bear Stearns generally wouldn''t refund investors with that
second pool of money, Ambac said in the filing. </p>
<p>Early Payment </p>
<p>While such so-called early payment defaults may not require
repurchases of mortgages out of securities by the issuers of the
bonds, because of differences between securitization contracts
and those entered into by lenders, Bear Stearns''s policy raised
questions at the time, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>External auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP advised Bear
Stearns in August 2006 that it needed to review loans that were
defaulting or defective to see if their quality breached its
obligations and begin the immediate processing of the buy-out
if there is a clear breach in order to match common industry
practices, the expectation of investors and to comply with its
mortgage bonds'' contracts, according to the amended complaint. </p>
<p>Its own lawyers by early 2007 were making similar
suggestions, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Securitized Loans </p>
<p>By the end of 2005, Bear Stearns had moved to making sure
to securitize home loans before their early payment default
periods ended, without informing investors and insurers of the
switch, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Then, if the loans went delinquent or were otherwise found
defective, the company would seek settlements from lenders,
rather than repurchases, which would have required the cash paid
by originators to flow through to the securitization trusts so
the debt could be passed back, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>That is how we pay for the lights, one employee told
another in an Aug. 11, 2005, e-mail cited in Ambac''s filing. </p>
<p>In 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, Bear Stearns
resolved repurchase claims to lenders on more than $1.3 billion
of mortgages through settlements or for other consideration,
according to the complaint, which cited the deposition of an
employee. The securities firm received more than $367 million of
economic value, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo Suit </p>
<p>Also this month, EMC Mortgage was sued by Wells Fargo 
Co., which is acting as the trustee for another set of mortgage
bonds, for refusing to turn over documents detailing the quality
of loans packaged into those securities. </p>
<p>An investor believes the files show some of the loans
should be repurchased, according to the complaint filed Jan. 18
in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. Wells Fargo has
repeatedly requested that EMC provide access to the subject
documents, the San Francisco-based bank said in the complaint. </p>
<p>EMC has played proverbial rope a dope'' and otherwise
continued to drag its feet, and has produced nothing,
according to the complaint. </p>
<p> Washington Mutual Inc., the Seattle-based bank whose assets
were mostly acquired by JPMorgan after it failed in 2008, has
been another source of litigation. Last September, Deutsche Bank
AG, acting as a trustee for bondholders, refiled a lawsuit over
allegedly misrepresented loans in $34 billion of WaMu mortgage
securities, with $165 billion in original balances. </p>
<p>The suit, filed in federal court in the District of
Columbia, included JPMorgan as a defendant after the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. said that JPMorgan was wrongly claiming
its insurance fund had agreed to cover the liabilities,
according to the amended complaint. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is balking at turning over loan files to the
trustee, according to Deutsche Bank. Either JPMorgan or the FDIC
owes investors $6 billion to $10 billion, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Ambac v. EMC Mortgage, 08-cv-9464, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc., pressed by
a congressionally appointed panel to describe its use of
derivatives during the financial crisis, said it relied on the
instruments for most mortgage trades and for revenue from
commodities, interest rates and currencies. </p>
<p>Derivatives accounted for about 70 percent to 75 percent of
revenue in the firm''s commodities business from 2006 to 2009,
and half or more of revenue from interest rates and
currencies, the firm estimated, according to a report by the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. From May 2007 to November
2008, about 86 percent of $155 billion in trades made by the
firm''s mortgage business involved derivatives, the FCIC said. </p>
<p>The commission examined derivatives as part of an
investigation of the credit crisis, which sparked the worst
recession since the 1930s and the loss of more than 8 million
U.S. jobs. Derivatives -- contracts whose value is derived from
assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies or commodities -- may
have contributed to the turmoil by making it hard for
regulators, responding to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.''s 2008
bankruptcy, to gauge the interconnectedness of financial firms. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, estimated in August that 25 percent to 35 percent of
its revenue came from derivates. The New York-based firm''s
executives had previously said they didn''t know how much of
earnings were from the instruments. The company''s estimate
applies to the period from 2006 to 2009, according to the FCIC. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Response </p>
<p>The FCIC is set to officially release its report today in Washington. The panel''s findings are outlined in a 545-page
book, a copy of which was book obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p> Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. The company yesterday posted on its website a copy of
its response to the panel''s questions on derivatives, listing
the share of revenue generated through derivatives in different
types of trading. The figures are based on a rough analysis of
our major businesses from 2006 to 2009, it said. </p>
<p>To be clear, these percentages do not accurately reflect
the percentage of aggregate firm-wide revenues from derivative
transactions, since each individual business is a mix of
derivative and non-derivative activity, the firm wrote to the
FCIC. The estimates were prepared solely for the purposes of
your request, and we would not (and do not) use this information
in the management of our businesses. </p>
<p>The following is a table of the trading figures included in
the firm''s response to the FCIC. </p>

<p>A JPMorgan Chase  Co. unit refused
to give mortgage trust investors more than 500,000 loan files
that would show them how many of the loans are bad and must be
repurchased, a trustee said in a court filing. </p>
<p>A unit of Deutsche Bank AG said it has a right to the files
as trustee for the investors. The investors own 99 mortgage-
backed-securities trusts that were built on loans made by
Washington Mutual Bank before it was seized by regulators and
sold to JPMorgan in 2008 for $1.9 billion. </p>
<p>These access rights are unqualified and have been
unequivocally breached by JPMC, Deutsche Bank said in court
papers filed in federal court in Washington on Jan. 14. </p>
<p>Mortgage-bond investors and bond insurers have accused loan
sellers like WaMu and JPMorgan or bond underwriters of often
misrepresenting the quality of the underlying debt. Those
misrepresentations can trigger contractual or legal provisions
requiring repurchases, investors claim. So-called mortgage
putbacks may cost banks and lenders as much as $90 billion,
JPMorgan bond analysts said in October. </p>
<p>Thomas A. Kelly, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Lost Value </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.''s suit on behalf of
investors against New York-based JPMorgan and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. claims the trusts have lost $6 billion
to $10 billion in value. WaMu expected some of the loans it put
in the trusts to go bad, according to a U.S. Senate
investigation cited by Deutsche Bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan and the FDIC have asked a judge to throw out the
case. The Deutsche Bank filing is the trustee''s response to the
motion to dismiss the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The outcome of the case could affect Washington Mutual Bank
noteholders, who have filed claims in the receivership case
being overseen by the FDIC, Kevin Starke, senior vice president
with CRT Capital Group LLC said in an interview today. </p>
<p>Should Deutsche Bank win the case on behalf of the trusts,
it would either have a claim against JPMorgan or the FDIC,
depending on how the judge rules, Starke said. That claim would
compete with other creditors of Washington Mutual Bank. </p>
<p>EMC Mortgage </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s EMC Mortgage said this week that it plans to
turn over documents detailing the quality of loans in a mortgage
trust managed by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. in an
attempt to resolve a lawsuit. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo sued seeking access to files for more than
2,000 underlying mortgages in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding
Trust 2007-AR2. The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court,
accused EMC of playing rope a dope and dragging its feet. </p>
<p>The case is Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., 09-01656, U.S. District Court, District

<p> Microsoft Corp. said it shipped more
than 2 million copies of the Windows Phone 7 operating system
last quarter, as the company tried to reverse sliding smartphone
market share. </p>
<p>Customer satisfaction for the product is at 93 percent and
brand awareness has jumped 22 points to 66 percent since it was
released, Greg Sullivan, a senior product manager at Microsoft,
said in an interview, citing internal measures. </p>
<p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, aims to stem
market-share declines to Apple Inc.''s iPhone and handsets based
on Google Inc.''s Android operating system. Apple sold 16.2
million iPhones in its most recent quarter, which ended Dec. 25.
For now, Microsoft is measuring success more in terms of
customer feedback than raw sales figures, said Sullivan, who
predicted sales will accelerate. He declined to give a forecast. </p>
<p>Sales are an important measure, but for a new platform we
think customer satisfaction and active developer support are
more important indicators of how sales will be over the long
term, he said. </p>
<p>There are now 6,500 applications for Windows Phone and
24,000 developers have signed up to build them, Sullivan said. </p>
<p>The shipment figure isn''t all that rosy, said Kevin Burden,
an analyst at ABI Research. </p>
<p>The number shows there''s a lot of competition in this
space and Windows Phone 7 is having a hard time being heard over
the crowd, said Burden, who is based in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. </p>
<p>Market Share </p>
<p>Microsoft''s share of the smartphone operating-system market
declined to 2.8 percent in the third quarter, from 7.9 percent a
year earlier, according to Gartner Inc. Android''s share
increased to 25.5 percent from 3.5 percent, while Apple''s iOS
share declined to 16.7 percent from 17.1 percent. </p>
<p>Phones with the new Microsoft software went on sale Oct. 21
in Europe and Nov. 8 in the U.S. </p>
<p>The company plans to ship an update to the software in the
next few months that adds features such as cut and paste and the
ability to work with the CDMA technology used by Verizon
Wireless and Sprint Nextel Corp., Sullivan said. </p>
<p>Microsoft rose 44 cents to $28.89 as of 2:26 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares fell 8.4 percent
last year. </p>
<p>The company will throw a lot more resources at its mobile
efforts and can leverage exclusive features like connectivity to
its Xbox online gaming service, Burden said. Still, Microsoft
needs to show steady progress soon. </p>
<p>Can they build on this number? Yeah, Burden said. But
they need to show an uptick in the first quarter and an uptick
on top of that in the second quarter. They have the ability to
do some smart things with Windows Phone 7, but as always it
comes down to execution. </p>

<p> Vivendi SA received a final $3.8
billion payment from General Electric Co. for its former 20
percent stake in NBC Universal entertainment group, gaining cash
for a bid to gain full control of mobile-phone division SFR. </p>
<p>The transaction, which pays for the remaining 12.3 percent
holding in NBC following an initial $2 billion transfer in
September, was completed Jan. 25, Paris-based Vivendi said in a
statement today. The payment will allow the completion of a
separate deal shifting GE''s control of NBC, whose assets include
the U.S. television network of the same name, to Comcast Corp. </p>
<p>Vivendi Chief Executive Officer Jean-Bernard Levy is
seeking to buy the 44 percent of SFR, France''s second-biggest
mobile-phone operator, that Vodafone Group Plc controls. Levy
said in November that Vivendi, owner of the world''s largest
video-game and music companies, would wait for the full payment
for NBC before talking with Vodafone about the SFR stake. </p>
<p>It would almost be a disappointment at this stage if
Vivendi didn''t manage to pull it off, Conor O''Shea, an analyst
at Kepler Capital Markets in Paris, said of an SFR deal. 2011
is shaping up to be a difficult year in the French mobile
market, so it''s a sensible time for Vodafone to want to exit. </p>
<p>Simon Gordon, a spokesman for Newbury, England-based
Vodafone, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Share Performance </p>
<p>Vivendi shares fell 0.25 percent to 21.77 euros in Paris
trading, giving the company a market value of 26.9 billion euros
($36.8 billion). Vodafone gained 0.64 percent in London to
180.65 pence. </p>
<p>Since becoming CEO in 2005, Levy has reoriented Vivendi
toward telecommunications and fast-growing emerging markets,
with acquisitions in countries including Mali, Brazil and Gabon.
The French company also owns Universal Music Group and video-
game producer Activision Blizzard. </p>
<p>SFR generated more than half of Vivendi''s operating profit
last year. Analysts value Vodafone''s stake, which is among
minority holdings being considered for sale by CEO Vittorio Colao, at 6 billion euros to 9 billion euros. </p>
<p>France''s mobile-phone market, in which consumers pay prices
higher than the European average, is preparing for the entry
next year of Iliad SA, a discount broadband provider that won a
wireless license in 2009. Iliad founder Xavier Niel, who made
his name offering 30-euro-per-month packages for broadband
Internet, television and fixed-line phone service, has pledged
to drive down mobile prices. </p>
<p>Appetite'' For Sale </p>
<p>Receiving cash from the NBC sale will allow Vivendi to
test Vodafone''s appetite to sell its SFR stake, Levy said in
an interview in Cannes, France, on Jan. 22. </p>
<p>Selling the NBC holding ends Vivendi''s decade-long presence
in the U.S. film and television business, begun under former CEO
Jean-Marie Messier''s $77 billion acquisition spree that nearly
bankrupted the company. Vivendi''s stake in NBC Universal stemmed
from the merger of the French company''s Universal movie-
production assets with GE''s NBC television network in 2004. </p>
<p>Vivendi and Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE valued NBC
Universal at about $43 billion when they announced the

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s EMC Mortgage
said it plans to turn over documents detailing the quality of
loans in a mortgage trust managed by Wells Fargo  Co. in an
attempt to resolve a lawsuit, according to court papers. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo sued last week seeking access to files for more
than 2,000 underlying mortgages in the Bear Stearns Mortgage
Funding Trust 2007-AR2. The complaint, filed in Delaware
Chancery Court, accused EMC of playing rope a dope and
dragging its feet. </p>
<p>Despite Wells'' unreasonable demands, EMC intends to make
the requisite materials pertaining to 400 loans available to
Wells today, Daniel Rath, an attorney for EMC, wrote in a
letter yesterday to Daniel Ward, an attorney for Wells Fargo.
The letter was filed with the court and made public today. </p>
<p>Christine Holevas, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo said in its complaint that it needs access to
the documents to answer questions raised by investors about
whether EMC breached representations and warranties regarding
the quality of option-adjustable rate mortgage loans the trust
bought. Claims of wrongdoing by banks and loan servicers
triggered a 50-state investigation last year into whether
hundreds of thousands of foreclosures were properly documented
as the housing market collapsed. </p>
<p>Investors Against Banks </p>
<p>Lending practices have also pitted mortgage-bond investors
against banks over misrepresentations such as overstatements of
borrowers'' income and inflated appraisals. </p>
<p>Rath said in his letter that EMC had committed to making
the documents available to San Francisco-based Wells Fargo and
was in the process of reviewing a confidentiality letter when
the trustee filed suit. EMC, in its capacity as servicer for the
trust, is under no obligation to acquire, maintain, or produce
any underwriting guidelines, Rath said. </p>
<p>Accordingly, while we remain willing to discuss a
cooperative way forward, we first need to understand Wells''
contractual basis for its request for underwriting guidelines,
Rath said in the letter. He asked Wells to reconsider the
litigation given EMC''s commitment to work cooperatively. </p>
<p>The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage Corp., CA6132,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). </p>

<p> General Dynamics Corp., the maker of
Abrams battle tanks and Gulfstream business jets, said fourth-
quarter profit rose 19 percent aided by higher profits at the
Aerospace unit. </p>
<p>Net income increased to $729 million, or $1.91 a share,
from $614 million, or $1.57 a share, a year earlier, the Falls
Church, Virginia-based company said today in a statement.
Analysts predicted $1.85, the average of 20 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. Sales gained 8.9 percent to $8.6 billion. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jay Johnson has said demand for
Gulfstream jets is rising and the unit will witness a double-
digit sales growth this year. The Combat Vehicles unit was dealt
a setback when Defense Secretary Robert Gates on Jan. 6 proposed
canceling the Marine Corps'' Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle; the
loss may be offset by Gates''s proposal to upgrade Abrams and the
Army''s Stryker vehicles, both also made by General Dynamics. </p>
<p>We give the company credit for continuing to churn out
earnings despite the top-line challenges, Joel Levington, a
bond analyst at Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New
York, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>General Dynamics, which also makes Virginia-class nuclear
submarines, forecast profit this year of $7 to $7.10 a share,
its first 2011 projection. Analysts'' average estimate was for
profit of $7.10 a share on sales of $34.1 billion. </p>
<p>General Dynamics gained 13 cents to $74.30 at 10:27 a.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 4
percent last year. </p>
<p>Gulfstream </p>
<p>Sales at the Aerospace unit, maker of Gulfstream jets, rose
7.4 percent to $1.27 billion and operating profit rose 26
percent to $210 million, the company said in the statement. The
unit delivered 44 planes during the quarter compared with 41 in
the same period last year, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Combat Systems sales rose 8.4 percent to $2.7 billion aided
by a $500 million order from the U.S. Army for Stryker vehicles,
the company said. Segment profit rose 9 percent to $400 million. </p>
<p>Information Systems and Technology unit revenue increased
9.6 percent to $2.94 billion, making it the largest of the four
units. Segment profit increased 10.3 percent to $311 million. </p>
<p>Sales at Marine Systems, maker of submarines and destroyer
ships, rose 9.7 percent to $1.7 billion and profit increased
13.5 percent to $177 million. </p>

<p>Eric Grubman''s style of football
won''t be on ESPN''s SportsCenter. </p>
<p>On a November day at the National Football League''s
Manhattan offices, Grubman -- a former Goldman Sachs Group
investment banker who is the NFL''s executive vice president of
business operations -- shuttles between meetings about foreign
television deals, overseas games and stadium improvements. Along
the way he''s often looking out for the customer. He wants
universal Wi-Fi access at the stadiums. He''s also in favor of
in-stadium broadcasts of the footage game officials use to
review challenged plays. </p>
<p>Grubman, however, may soon become the bane of football
fans, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its Jan. 31 issue. As
the league''s top money man, reporting directly to Commissioner
Roger Goodell, he''s at the center of a labor dispute that could
make the Super Bowl between the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh
Steelers the last NFL game for a long time. While the Feb.6
matchup is the biggest date on the football calendar, players
and team owners have their eyes fixed on March3. That''s when
their collective bargaining agreement expires. Until a new one
is in place, there likely won''t be any more games, raising the
prospect of a lost 2011-2012 season. </p>

<p> General Motors Co., the automaker
one-third owned by the U.S. Treasury Department, is withdrawing
an application for $14.4 billion of government loans to develop
fuel-efficient vehicles as the company works to reduce its debt. </p>
<p>The low-interest U.S. Energy Department loans aren''t needed
because GM is in a strong financial position and can invest in
new vehicles without aid, the Detroit-based automaker said today
in a statement. GM applied for the loans in October 2009. </p>
<p>GM''s balance sheet and cash flow allow the company to fund
projects without taking on debt, said David Whiston, an analyst
with Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. The automaker had net income
of $4.77 billion in the first three quarters of 2010 and
$27.5 billion of cash and near-cash items as of Sept. 30. </p>
<p>They will be printing money as sales volume comes back,
said Whiston, who predicts GM could generate $4 billion to $7
billion in cash a year. It''s also a political thing where they
don''t want to be seen taking any public money. </p>
<p>GM raised more than $23 billion in an initial public
offering of common and preferred shares in November that lowered
the government''s ownership from 61 percent. The stake was
acquired as part of the $50 billion GM received in its
bankruptcy in 2009. </p>
<p>GM rose 78 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $38.67 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have
gained 17 percent from their $33 initial offering price. </p>
<p>Volt Sales </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Dan Akerson is looking to at least
triple the company''s target for electric-car sales by expanding
the market for the Chevrolet Volt and adding models that would
share similar technology, three people familiar with the plan
said last month. </p>
<p>The withdrawn loan application will not affect our
aggressive investment in new products and technology, Ed Welburn, GM''s vice president for global design, said today at
the Washington Auto Show. </p>
<p>Like most Americans, we believe that a self-sufficient,
globally relevant GM is the best solution, he said. </p>
<p>GM''s foregoing the loans will allow the government to
support a range of other companies it is working with to
develop technologies, Stephanie Mueller, an Energy Department
spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The Volt will be available in every U.S. state by the end
of the year, GM''s Welburn said today. The automaker, which
originally planned to sell the Volt nationwide next year, is
looking for ways to boost production to meet nationwide demand,
Welburn said. He declined to give output targets for the Volt. </p>
<p>Volt Capacity </p>
<p>Akerson, 62, has asked his engineering team to double Volt
production capacity starting next year, two people familiar with
the plan said earlier this month. That would enable GM to make
120,000 Volts a year. The company is working with suppliers to
get enough parts to meet the increased targets, the people said. </p>
<p>GM''s public perception may benefit from the company not
having an Energy Department loan while Ford Motor Co. does,
Welburn said today. </p>
<p>Ford, based in Dearborn, Michigan, received $5.9 billion of
the loans in June 2009. Yokohama, Japan-based Nissan Motor Co.
borrowed $1.6 billion, and Palo Alto, California-based Tesla
Motors Inc. was given $495 million at that time. </p>
<p>Chrysler Group LLC sought $3 billion from the Energy
Department''s $25 billion pool. The Auburn Hills, Michigan-based
company''s effort to get the loans has taken longer than
expected, CEO Sergio Marchionne said Jan. 19, adding that he
thinks the automaker will receive the loans. </p>
<p>Obama''s Goal </p>
<p>President Barack Obama called for 1 million advanced-
technology vehicles on the road by 2015 earlier this week in his
State of the Union address. U.S. Energy Information
Administration figures compiled by Bloomberg Government show
automakers will sell about 281,000 electric cars and light
trucks from 2011 through 2015. </p>
<p>Representative Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the House
Ways and Means Committee, said yesterday he is working to expand
tax incentives for electric vehicle purchases at the behest of
GM''s Akerson. </p>
<p>The GM board approved the withdrawal of its application in
a meeting last week, according to an executive familiar with the
decision who declined to be identified because the meeting was
private. The company was within a few months of finishing the
loan-approval process, another executive said. </p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell has said GM wants to
repay all debt by 2015. GM owed $15.6 billion in debt and
preferred stock at the end of third quarter. The company
announced plans in October to reduce debt and other obligations
by $11 billion and said it had arranged a $5 billion, five-year
revolving credit facility. </p>
<p>Withdrawing our DOE loan application is consistent with
our goal to carry minimal debt on our balance sheet, Liddell
said today in the statement. </p>

<p> Microsoft Corp. options traders made
the most bullish bets in four years before the world''s largest
software maker released earnings today. The shares rose 0.3
percent following the report. </p>
<p>The ratio of outstanding calls to buy the stock versus puts
to sell jumped 31 percent this week and reached 2.1 yesterday,
the highest since July 2006, after investors allowed bearish
positions to expire instead of renewing them using contracts
with longer maturities. The number of outstanding puts has
fallen 49 percent from last week to 902,650 contracts and calls
decreased 33 percent to 1.77 million for the biggest drops since
January 2010. </p>
<p>It''s a pretty one-sided boat, and everyone''s in the bull
side, said Jay Shartsis, director of options trading at R.F.
Lafferty  Co. in New York. It''s the coming earnings, it''s the
general trend of the market, and Microsoft has been moving up. </p>
<p>Microsoft, which has beaten profit estimates eight straight
quarters, beat estimates as corporate customers bought more
Office and server programs and consumers purchased Xbox Kinect
motion sensors. Net income rose to 77 cents a share, Peter
Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft,
said today. That compares with 68 cents, the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shares rose to $28.87 at 4
p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Microsoft has risen 21 percent while the Standard  Poor''s
500 Index has surged 24 percent since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in August that he was prepared to take
action to boost the economy. The company trades for 12.3 times
earnings from the past year, 22 percent less than the SP 500,
the benchmark measure of U.S. shares. During the past 10 years,
Microsoft has on average had a price-earnings multiple 15
percent higher than the Samp;P 500''s, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Biggest Increase </p>
<p>The biggest open interest increase among all options of
Microsoft since last week is a weekly option giving the right to
buy the shares at $29 before the contract expires Jan. 28,
according to data from Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based
provider of options-market analytics. The call''s open interest
has risen to 11,082 since it began trading on U.S. exchanges
Jan. 20. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s total open interest has dropped 39 percent
after last week''s expiration to 2.67 million contracts
yesterday, about the same as the 38 percent decline for all
exchange-traded U.S. options, according to Jim Binder, a
spokesman for Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp., which
settles all trading of exchange-listed contracts. Microsoft''s
2010 options volume of 37 million contracts accounted for 1
percent of all U.S. trades and ranked sixth among all companies,
according to the OCC. </p>
<p>Implied Volatility </p>
<p>Investors are paying less for options to protect against a
decline in the shares. Implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days has
fallen to 25.12 from last year''s peak of 38.52 in July. </p>
<p>Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. </p>

<p>Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. trader accused by U.S. regulators of misleading
investors in a product linked to subprime mortgages, asked a
judge to halt pretrial interviews scheduled to begin on Feb. 1. </p>
<p>Tourre can''t effectively participate in the depositions
until he gets documents from Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, a purported victim'' of the alleged
fraud, his lawyer said today in a court filing. Tourre also is
awaiting other material and must review about 300,000 documents
he already received, according to the filing. </p>
<p>If Mr. Tourre is compelled to proceed with depositions
beginning on Feb. 1, 2011, it will be without the benefit of
anything like adequate document discovery, Pamela Chepiga,
Tourre''s lawyer, wrote in the filing in federal court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs and Tourre on April 16, accusing them of failing to tell
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick underlying
securities for a collateralized debt obligation and planned to
bet against them. The SEC reached a $550 million settlement with
New York-based Goldman Sachs in July. </p>
<p>Florence Harmon, a spokeswoman for the SEC, declined to
comment. </p>
<p>Dismissal Request </p>
<p>Tourre is awaiting a judge''s ruling on his request to
dismiss the lawsuit on grounds that the transactions involving
the collateralized debt obligations called Abacus 2007-AC1
occurred outside the U.S. Tourre can''t be held liable under U.S.
securities law, his lawyers have argued. </p>
<p>The SEC opposes the request, saying in court papers that
unlawful securities transactions occurred in the U.S. Tourre
worked at the Goldman Sachs headquarters in New York during
the relevant period and did business in New York, the agency
said. </p>
<p>The court filing provides a window into the course of the
litigation. Tourre''s lawyers have hired 25 attorneys to review
1 million documents with about 10.5 million pages. Attorneys for
the SEC say they plan to depose about 25 witnesses, including
representatives of Goldman Sachs and IKB. </p>
<p>The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. received
$2.9 billion for its own account as a taxpayer bailout enabled American International Group Inc. to make good on credit-default
swaps linked to mortgages, a congressionally appointed panel
said. </p>
<p>The money was included in about $3.4 billion in swap-
related payments, most of which AIG made following the
government''s bailout, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission
wrote in a book outlining its findings. That was in addition to
about $14 billion that Goldman Sachs collected from AIG and
passed to other counterparties, according to the report. </p>
<p>The $2.9 billion was for proprietary trades (that is,
trades made solely for Goldman''s benefit rather than on behalf
of a client), the panel wrote. The payout was largely
relating to collateralized debt obligations known as Abacus, a
series of mortgage-linked investments the firm helped create,
the FCIC said, without specifying the relationship. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, acted as a market intermediary and bought
protection from AIG to hedge transactions with clients, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar told reporters on a conference
call in 2009. The trades at issue in the FCIC''s report were
hedged, and most of the payments were used to cover offsetting
bets, a person with direct knowledge of them said, declining to
be identified because the transactions weren''t public. </p>
<p>The FCIC, which set out to determine the causes of the
financial crisis, released its report today in Washington,
simultaneously publishing a 545-page book. </p>
<p>Contracts Retired </p>
<p> Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the panel''s findings. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told a Congressional
panel last year that the firm lost about $1.2 billion from
residential mortgage transactions in 2007 and 2008. </p>
<p>The $3.4 billion in AIG guarantees weren''t included in a
government bailout of the New York-based insurer that retired
$62.1 billion in contracts by fully reimbursing banks, including
Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale SA, through Federal Reserve
vehicles called Maiden Lane. </p>
<p>AIG extinguished the additional swaps, which guaranteed
Abacus CDOs, in 2009, taking writedowns of $1.5 billion to $2
billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said last April.
AIG originally had about $6 billion in Goldman Sachs trades that
weren''t covered by the rescue, that person said. </p>
<p>Mark Herr, an AIG spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs agreed last year to pay $550 million to
settle a Securities and Exchange Commission fraud lawsuit
alleging that it misled investors by underwriting and marketing
a mortgage-related security called Abacus 2007-AC1 without
disclosing to clients that a hedge-fund customer, Paulson  Co.,
was involved in creating it and planned to bet against it. </p>

<p>Global energy demand will climb 35
percent by 2030 from 2005 levels amid rapid economic growth and
an improvement in living standards in developing nations, an Exxon Mobil Corp. forecast shows. </p>
<p>Consumption of natural gas will surpass use of coal as the
second-largest global energy source after oil, according to the
company''s Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030, used to guide its
investment decisions. Worldwide electricity consumption will
rise more than 80 percent during the period, it said. </p>
<p>The estimate by the world''s largest publicly traded oil
company is in line with a November forecast by the International
Energy Agency, the Paris-based adviser to 28 nations. The IEA
said energy demand will grow 36 percent from 2008 to 2035, with
93 percent of the gain coming from nations outside the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. </p>
<p>The outlook clearly points to a growing demand for energy
globally, Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
said in a statement. The forecasts also show a shift toward
natural gas as businesses and governments look for reliable,
affordable and cleaner ways to meet energy needs. </p>
<p>Non-OECD countries will see overall demand grow by 70
percent in the 25 years to 2030, while improvements in energy
efficiency will keep consumption flat in the industrialized
nations, according to the Exxon Mobil report, which is issued
annually. The IEA said that Chinese demand alone will rise 75
percent by 2035 compared with 2005 levels. </p>
<p>Non-OECD demand for power will more than double as more
people gain access to electricity, Exxon Mobil said. Demand for
natural gas for power generation will jump around the world and
increase sixfold in China, it said. </p>
<p>Energy Efficiency </p>
<p>Global growth in energy consumption would be even higher
without the projections that efficiency will improve, according
to the Exxon Mobil report, which analyzes energy-use patterns in
100 countries. </p>
<p>The Irving, Texas-based company will continue to invest
in technology and innovation to develop new economic energy

<p> Pfizer Inc., the world''s largest
drugmaker, was ordered to pay a total of $142.1 million in
damages for violating U.S. racketeering laws in the marketing of
its epilepsy drug Neurontin. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston yesterday upheld
a jury''s finding that Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. and
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals deserved the award over the
companies'' claims that Pfizer illegally promoted Neurontin for
unapproved uses. Saris tripled the jury''s award of $47.3 million
under a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act of 1970. </p>
<p>The damages awarded to the plaintiffs by the jury under
RICO are trebled, the judge said in her one-page order. Saris
also denied Kaiser''s request for an estimated $76 million in
interest on the award. </p>
<p>Kaiser officials alleged they were duped into believing
that migraines and bipolar disorder could be treated effectively
with Neurontin, approved in 1993 by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for epilepsy. </p>
<p>Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company was
pleased with Saris'' decision to deny Kaiser''s bid for pre-
judgment interest on the award. As we maintained all along,
Pfizer has strong defenses in this case and intends to appeal,
he said. </p>

<p> Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, fell the most in two months after reporting
fourth-quarter sales and refining profits that failed to meet
analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>The company fell $1.38, or 1.5 percent, to $93.37 at 4 p.m.
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Net income
rose to a record for the quarter of $5.3 billion, or $2.64 a
share, from $3.07 billion, or $1.53, a year earlier, San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a statement today. </p>
<p>Chevron had $54 billion in sales during the last three
months of 2010, $4.8 billion less than analysts'' estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company''s U.S. refineries performed
worse than expected, contributing less to the overall bottom
line than anticipated, said Paul Cheng, a New York-based
Barclays Plc analyst. </p>
<p>The revenue shortfall is disappointing, said Robbert Van Batenburg, head of research at Louis Capital Markets LP in
New York. In their U.S. downstream business they also came up
short. </p>
<p>Chevron found enough new fields last year to replace less
than a fourth of the oil and gas it pumped, the lowest reserve-
replacement ratio in at least eight years for the company. </p>
<p>Higher crude prices triggered contract provisions in some
nations that reduced the amount of untapped oil Chevron is
allowed to claim for itself under production-sharing agreements,
Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson said today during a
conference call with analysts. </p>
<p>Hurdle Rate'' </p>
<p>There''s disappointment with the reserve-replacement
figure, Lysle Brinker, director of research for integrated oil
companies at IHS Inc., said in a telephone interview from Cape
Elizabeth, Maine. It falls short of the 100 percent hurdle
rate you like to see. </p>
<p>Watson, 54, increased 2010 production to the equivalent of
2.76 million barrels a day, the highest in company history, and
last month announced plans to spend more than $71 million a day
in 2011 to discover and tap oil and natural-gas prospects. </p>
<p>Chevron expects full-year oil and gas output to rise 1
percent this year to the equivalent of 2.79 million barrels,
Watson said during the call. The production target is predicated
on an average oil price of $79 a barrel, he said. </p>
<p>Profit in Chevron''s worldwide oil- and gas-production
business jumped 16 percent to $4.85 billion from a year earlier,
the company said. U.S. earnings from the unit fell 13 percent to
$930 million. </p>
<p>Refining Profit </p>
<p>Excluding a $400 million gain from the sale of a stake in
Colonial Pipeline Co., Chevron''s U.S. refining unit earned $75
million. Barclay''s Cheng was expecting the division to generate
$277 million. </p>
<p>Analysts estimated Chevron would earn $2.40 a share,
excluding one-time gains and losses, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Oil futures traded in New York averaged $85.24 a barrel in
the fourth quarter, a 12 percent increase from a year earlier.
Global crude demand is expected to swell this year by 1.4
million barrels a day, or 1.6 percent, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a Jan. 18 report. </p>
<p>Chevron rose 29 percent in the year ended yesterday,
outperforming bigger rivals Exxon Mobil Corp., PetroChina Co., Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. The stock has
18 buy and seven hold ratings from analysts. </p>
<p>During the fourth quarter, Watson revived purchases of
Chevron stock after a two-year hiatus and announced plans to
spend $11.5 billion to begin pumping crude from deep-water
fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The company also agreed to buy
U.S. gas producer Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion. </p>
<p>Oil Demand </p>
<p>Global demand for crude may reach a record 89.4 million
barrels a day this year as prices increase 19 percent to an
average of $95 a barrel, a team of analysts at JPMorgan Chase amp;
Co. led by Lawrence Eagles wrote in a note yesterday to clients. </p>
<p>Chevron intends to give final investment approvals to 15
additional ventures by 2012 with price tags of at least $1
billion each, Watson said in a November presentation to
analysts. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil, the world''s largest oil company by market
value, is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter results on Jan.
31. </p>

<p>A bid by Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman

<p>Tourre yesterday asked a federal judge to postpone the Feb.

from Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, a

<p>Tourre''s highly disruptive 11th-hour request for a stay

<p> Microsoft Corp. shares failed to get
a lift from better-than-predicted second-quarter sales and
profit results yesterday after a shortfall in Windows revenue
raised concerns about future demand for the operating system. </p>
<p>Windows revenue of $5.05 billion missed the $5.2 billion
average of analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That
differed from results showing Microsoft''s Office and Server
businesses exceeded projections, and the Xbox unit posted a 55
percent gain. </p>
<p>The contrast suggests that Microsoft may be losing sales as
customers opt for competing devices, such as Apple Inc.''s iPad
or Macintosh computers, rather than a new Windows-based machine,
said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis Sayles  Co. in Boston.
As rival operating systems gain ground, Microsoft''s other
products, such as Office, may also suffer, he said. </p>
<p>The execution at this company has actually been pretty
good over the last year, said Ursillo, whose firm manages $150
billion, including Microsoft shares. The stock has gotten very
little credit for it because the market is worried about the
continued erosion of the Windows franchise and the potential
erosion of the Office franchise. </p>
<p>Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 18 cents to
$28.69 at 9:35 a.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The shares lost 8.4 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>Microsoft did see a small impact from tablets and other
types of computing devices, though it was not material,
Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview
yesterday. </p>
<p>Tablet Strategy </p>
<p>Apple sold 7.33 million iPad tablet-style machines last
quarter, as well as 4.13 million Mac computers. Apple''s share of
U.S. PC shipments rose to 8.7 percent in the December quarter
from 7.2 percent a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. </p>
<p>Those gains came at the expense of machines that run
Windows. To catch up in tablets, Microsoft said this month it
would make its next version of Windows run on ARM Holdings Plc''s
chip technology for the first time. The aim is to create
smaller, thinner Windows tablets with better battery life. </p>
<p>Klein says the tablet market presents an opportunity rather
than a threat in the long term. </p>
<p>I''m more excited about the opportunity, he said. All
these new devices are market expansive for us. </p>
<p>Excluding the impact of a $1.71 billion in deferred sales
recognized in the year-earlier quarter, Windows unit growth was
in line with growth overall in the PC market of 2.7 percent as
reported by Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. Still, some
analysts had projected more. </p>
<p>Windows Phone 7 </p>
<p>To address mobile market-share losses to Apple and Google
Inc.''s Android operating system, Microsoft released its
overhauled software for mobile phones -- Windows Phone 7 --
during the quarter. The company said this week it shipped 2
million licenses to use the software in handsets, a number that
analyst Kevin Burden at ABI Research called disappointing. </p>
<p>The number was in line with what the company was
expecting, Microsoft''s Klein said. </p>
<p>It''s a good start, he said. I recognize that it''s
early and we have a lot of work to do and we''re going to
continue to focus on that. </p>
<p>Second-quarter unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $13.4 billion, missing analysts'' $14.1 billion
average estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Results in Windows overshadowed signs that Microsoft is
benefiting from rising demand for gaming devices and products
aimed at businesses. </p>
<p>Net income was $6.63 billion, or 77 cents a share, compared
with $6.66 billion, or 74 cents, a year earlier, Microsoft said
in a statement. Sales rose 4.9 percent to $20 billion. </p>
<p>Way Behind'' </p>
<p>The results beat the average projections of 68-cents in
profit and $19.1 billion in sales, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Microsoft has been executing extremely well on the
business side, Robert Breza, an analyst in Minneapolis for
with RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg Television. As people
start to really focus on Microsoft and what they are doing in
cloud computing -- with their Azure platform -- also with their
new Office 365 program that sits in the cloud, hopefully that
will get the company a little bit more respect. </p>
<p>In the Xbox division, the company kept expenses down,
widening margins for a sixth straight quarter. </p>
<p>For some, that doesn''t make up for Windows-related woe. </p>
<p>Microsoft management has to be frustrated -- they''ve
executed well for five quarters in a row and have got little to
show for it in the stock price, Ursillo said. But they have
to take a look at themselves and realize they''re losing share in
their most profitable business and coming from way behind in the
efforts they needed to stem those losses. </p>

<p>OPEC will have to raise oil prices
in coming years to maximize revenue even as it acts to quell
crude''s rally toward $100 a barrel in the short term, according
to JPMorgan Chase amp; Co. </p>
<p>Indications that members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries are raising output unilaterally are the
first signs of a response to rising prices, said analysts at the
second-largest U.S. bank by assets. Crude fell to a five-week
low Jan. 24 after Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister of OPEC''s
biggest member, Saudi Arabia, said the 12-member group will
boost supply this year. </p>
<p>The producer group does not want oil prices to rise too
high, too quickly, JPMorgan analysts, led by New York-based
Lawrence Eagles, said in a monthly report dated yesterday. But
we believe the group has little option but to incrementally
raise prices over the coming years to maximize the revenue from
each barrel of oil produced. </p>
<p>Brent crude has increased 3.4 percent this year on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange amid speculation
strengthening global economic data signals a recovery in fuel
demand. Futures reached $99.20 a barrel on Jan. 14, the highest
since October 2008. Prices, trading near $98 today, are up 0.4
percent this week. </p>
<p>Tightness Subsides </p>
<p>OPEC, which pumps 40 percent of the world''s oil, is moving
to cool oil prices just as physical tightness looks set to
subside from mid-February, according to JPMorgan. Refiners on
the U.S. Gulf and West Coast have started shutting plants for
seasonal maintenance and will be joined by operators in Europe
in the coming weeks, it said. </p>
<p>While the group acts to cap oil''s rise now, it will have to
increase prices in years ahead if it wants to protect its
revenue, according to the bank. End-user prices will rise
regardless of OPEC''s actions, as governments in consuming
countries raise taxes for a greater share of revenue, it said. </p>
<p>A large tax take is a long-standing thorn in OPEC''s
side, the analysts said. </p>
<p>Gasoline prices in the U.K. are about $320 a barrel and
diesel near $330, leaving OPEC with less than a third of
sales revenue, according to JPMorgan. China, the world''s largest
energy user, has also imposed some oil taxes and introduced
policy to reduce energy intensity, it said. </p>
<p>OPEC, next scheduled to review production policy at a
meeting in June, agreed at its last gathering Dec. 11 to
maintain formal output targets at levels set two years earlier.
Current prices are in a comfortable zone, said the group''s
Secretary-General Abdulla El-Badri. </p>
<p>Demand Forecast </p>
<p>JPMorgan increased its forecast for global oil demand
growth next year by 300,000 barrels a day to 1.7 million
barrels. It estimates consumption will average 89.4 million
barrels a day in 2011, higher than the 89.1 million predicted by
the International Energy Agency. It also forecasts oil prices
will increase $15, or about 19 percent, to $95 a barrel. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. this week said oil''s rally from
$75 a barrel since September has partially been driven by OPEC
holding back supply. The group should boost supply to prevent
prices threatening the global recovery, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. </p>
<p>OPEC''s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system. </p>

<p> Exxon Mobil Corp., the world''s
largest company, posted its biggest quarterly profit in more
than two years as energy demand boosted oil and fuel prices. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter net income rose to $9.25 billion, or $1.85 a
share, from $6.1 billion, or $1.27, a year earlier, Irving,
Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today. Per-share earnings
were 25 cents more than the average estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Oil and natural-gas output from Exxon''s wells rose 19
percent during the fourth quarter to the equivalent of 4.97
million barrels a day, the most in the 128-year history of the
company. Refining rebounded from a loss a year ago as demand for
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel rose 3.5 percent, widening margins
from processing crude into fuels. </p>
<p>They''re hitting their production growth at exactly the
right time, Jason D. Gammel, an analyst at Macquarie Capital
Europe Ltd., said today during an interview on Bloomberg
Television''s In the Loop with Betty Liu. Their production
is going to be up over 7 percent this year and when you''re doing
that into the face of a rising commodity-price environment, the
earnings and cash-flow effects are just magnified. </p>
<p>Exxon rose $1.69, or 2.1 percent, to $80.68 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain in
eight weeks. The stock has 10 buy ratings from analysts, 13
holds and one sell. </p>
<p>Fourth-quarter sales climbed 17 percent to $105.2 billion.
For the full year, Exxon''s revenue was $383.2 billion, a figure
that exceeds the gross domestic product of Thailand, Denmark or Chile. </p>
<p>Share Buybacks </p>
<p>Spending on new oil platforms, liquefied gas plants,
exploratory drilling and refinery repairs jumped 19 percent to
$32.2 billion last year, the company said in the statement.
Exxon plans to spend $5 billion to buy back its shares this
quarter, after spending that amount on share repurchases in the
fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Their share repurchase program is back up to very high
levels of activity said Gammel, who has an outperform
rating on Exxon''s stock. That will enhance the earnings
effects as well. </p>
<p>Gammel said he expects the company to maintain the $5
billion quarterly buyback pace for the rest of this year. </p>
<p>Brent Vs. Nymex </p>
<p>Exxon benefited as Brent futures traded in London, the
benchmark for two-thirds of the world''s oil, rose at a faster
pace than New York-traded crude, said Pavel Molchanov, a
Houston-based analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc. who has
a market perform rating on Exxon stock. </p>
<p>Brent crude averaged $87.45 a barrel during the quarter, a
16 percent increase from a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Oil futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange increased 12 percent to average $85.24.
Brent topped $100 a barrel today for the first time since 2008. </p>
<p>Exxon has a great deal of exposure to Europe and Africa,
which tend to price oil off of Brent, Molchanov said in a
telephone interview. </p>
<p>Gas Production Increase </p>
<p>Exxon last year made its biggest acquisition since 1999,
buying XTO Energy as part of Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson''s expansion of its natural-gas portfolio. </p>
<p>Exxon tripled gas production in the U.S. as a result of the
XTO deal and other purchases, including Ellora Energy, a closely
held operator in the Haynesville shale region. Gas accounted for
49 percent of Exxon''s global production during the last three
months of 2010, up from 43 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>The company, which traces its roots to John D. Rockefeller''s Standard Oil Trust of the 1880s, signed a $1
billion accord last week joining Russia''s OAO Rosneft to drill
for crude in the Black Sea. </p>
<p> Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. energy company, on
Jan. 28 said profit from the last three months of 2010 rose 72
percent to $5.3 billion, a record for the company''s fourth
quarter. </p>
<p> ConocoPhillips, the third-biggest U.S. oil company, said on
Jan. 26 that fourth-quarter profit rose 59 percent to $2.04
billion as chemical demand increased and higher oil prices
offset a slump in output. </p>

<p> International Business Machines
Corp.''s head of social networking was in an Indian airport last
year when the client he was meeting changed topics. Unprepared,
Alistair Rennie used his BlackBerry to access IBM''s internal
network and poll colleagues on the matter. </p>
<p>I had everything I needed, Rennie said Jan. 28 in a
telephone interview. It saved me hours. </p>
<p>Rennie is betting IBM''s customers will have the same
reaction. The company is revamping its social-networking
programs for mobile devices, including Apple Inc.''s iPhone and
iPad tablet and Research In Motion Ltd.''s BlackBerry. </p>
<p>As Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. continue to add millions
of users, IBM is aiming to carve its own space in corporate
social networking. Sales of social-business programs should
triple to almost $2 billion by 2014, IBM said, citing research
firm IDC Corp. Adding its collaborative software to mobile
devices will give IBM an extra boost in the industry as it
raises corporate productivity, Rennie said. </p>
<p>The network isn''t at the water cooler anymore, he said. </p>
<p>The software will feature an activity feed, which gathers
information about customers, relevant news and information about
colleagues, Rennie said. Customers also will be able to have
video Web meetings, share pictures and post blogs. </p>
<p>IBM is announcing the software today at its annual
Lotusphere conference in Orlando, Florida. RIM co-Chief
Executive Officer Jim Balsillie will be on stage to talk about
how the software will work with the PlayBook, the company''s
tablet scheduled to come this quarter, he said. </p>
<p>Lotus Symphony </p>
<p>Other supported devices include those on Google Inc.''s
Android platform and Nokia Oyj smartphones. IBM will add devices
as they come out, Rennie said. </p>
<p>IBM climbed 22 cents to $159.43 at 9:56 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares advanced 12 percent
last year. </p>
<p>The company also is introducing a cloud-computing version
of its Lotus Symphony software, which lets users create and edit
documents and presentations. Cloud computing is designed to help
customers save money by letting them store and access data via
the Internet, rather than from their own servers. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, gets more than a fifth of
its revenue from software sales. The division will account for
more than half of the company''s profit by 2015, IBM said in May. </p>

<p>One Equity Partners LLC is
considering options for its Duropack GmbH corrugated board unit,
including a sale, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter. </p>
<p>One Equity, JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s buyout arm, is working
with the New York-based bank and Austria''s Erste Group Bank AG,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
matter isn''t public. A sale of the Vienna-based company may
fetch 350 million euros ($484 million), said another person. </p>
<p>Funds advised by One Equity took control of Duropack when
it bought 91 percent of Constantia Packaging AG in June,
according to One Equity''s website. The remainder of the shares
were transferred in a separate transaction, according to an Oct.
6 regulatory filing. Duropack is wholly owned by Constantia. </p>
<p>Our owner is continuously evaluating options to boost the
further development of Duropack and Constantia''s Austria
Metall GmbH and Flexibles units, said Wolfgang Schwaiger, a
spokesman for Constantia, in a telephone interview. There is
no sales process. </p>
<p>Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for One Equity in New York,
declined to comment. Michael Mauritz, a spokesman for Erste in
Vienna, declined to comment. </p>
<p>One Equity is also preparing a sale of its stake in
aluminum unit Austria Metall, known as AMAG, which it also holds
via Constantia, three people with knowledge of the process said
on Jan. 19. One Equity is weighing a sale or initial public
offering for AMAG and a sale may attract bids of more than 1
billion euros, the people said. </p>
<p>One Equity''s plans to sell Duropack were reported Jan. 30
by Wirtschaftsblatt, citing unidentified people involved in the
deal. </p>
<p>In 2009, Duropack had sales of 262.4 million euros,
Constantia said in its annual report. Constantia Flexibles
Holding GmbH creates packaging for food, pet food,
pharmaceuticals and beverages. It had sales of 976.5 million
euros in 2009. </p>

<p>Developer Steve Samuels and a unit of
JPMorgan Chase  Co. purchased Landmark Center, a 950,000-
square-foot (88,260-square-meter) office and retail complex near
Boston''s Fenway Park, for $530.5 million. The seller was Abbey
Group, a Boston-based real estate company. </p>
<p>Abbey Group, which is also a co-owner of the Boston Celtics
of the National Basketball Association, redeveloped the vacant
property after acquiring it about 15 years ago, Chairman Robert
Epstein said today in a telephone interview. The sale gives the
firm flexibility to take on other projects, he said. </p>
<p>Landmark changed the image of the Fenway, Epstein said,
referring to the neighborhood surrounding the famed baseball
park. It was a very significant development and we''re very
hopeful the new owners will continue to maintain that and enjoy
the tenants. </p>
<p>The sale was reported earlier today the Boston Globe. </p>
<p>Landmark Center, adjacent to Boston''s Longwood Medical
area, is 99 percent leased, Abbey Group said today in an e-
mailed statement. Tenants include Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard
Medical School, Bed Bath  Beyond, Best Buy and Regal
Entertainment Group movie theaters. </p>
<p>The complex, known for decades as the Sears Building, was
built in 1928 as a warehouse and distribution facility for
Sears, Roebuck  Co. and was used by the retailer until the
mid-1980s. Epstein declined to say how much his company invested
in the redevelopment. The property includes 337,000 square feet
of property for expansion. </p>
<p>Samuels''s firm, Samuels  Associates, made the acquisition
in a joint venture with New York-based JPMorgan''s investment
management unit. </p>

<p>Ian Read, the new chief executive
officer of Pfizer Inc., plans to lower costs by closing labs and
reducing research spending by as much as $3 billion as the
company faces declining sales of its best-selling drug. </p>
<p>We have to fix our innovative core, and that''s what this
RD change is about, Read told reporters at Pfizer
headquarters in New York today. The reductions are part of a
plan to overhaul the company''s research operation to focus on
the most-profitable programs, Read said. </p>
<p>Research and development spending will be $6.5 billion to
$7 billion in 2012, the CEO said. That compares with $9.4
billion in 2010 and is $1.5 billion lower than previous Pfizer
forecasts. Pfizer plans to buy back $5 billion in shares next
year as part of a $9 billion repurchase program, he said. </p>
<p>Today was the first earnings report under Read, who
succeeded Jeffrey Kindler in December. Pfizer is counting on
products from the $68 billion Wyeth acquisition in 2009 to
replace sales lost to generic copies of the cholesterol pill
Lipitor, the world''s best-selling drug. Read said Wyeth drugs
won''t be enough to make up for that shortfall, and the company
must rein in its unproductive spending. </p>
<p>No Pennant </p>
<p>It''s like being the New York Yankees and having a huge
bankroll and never being able to win the pennant, said Tony Butler, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, referring to
the Major League Baseball team. This is saying: I''ll take the
Cleveland Indian budget and see what we can do with that.''
Spending more doesn''t mean getting anything out. </p>
<p>This is all good, Butler said. </p>
<p>Pfizer rose $1, or 5.5 percent, to $19.22 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading of 133 million shares,
more than triple the three-month average. It was Pfizer''s
biggest gain in six months, helping the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to its first close above 12,000 since June 2008. Pfizer
shares have climbed 2.3 percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>The company plans to halt funding research in the areas of
allergy, urology, respiratory, internal medicine and tissue
repair, Read said. Pfizer will focus on the more-profitable
areas of cancer, neuroscience, inflammation, vaccines and
immunology, he said. </p>
<p>At some point your shareholders and stakeholders demand
you have a return on investment in research, Read said.
We''re looking at areas where we think it''s not a competitive
advantage. </p>
<p>More Accountability </p>

<p>A JPMorgan Chase  Co. branch in El
Paso, Texas, may have furniture and computers seized by the
sheriff unless the bank complies with a judge''s order to pay the
legal bills of a single mother whose eviction case he dismissed. </p>
<p>The manager of the Chase branch was served on Jan. 26 with
court papers that instructed the New York-based company to pay
attorney Richard A. Roman''s $5,000 in fees, according to
Detective Hector Lara, an El Paso County sheriff''s officer. The
manager, Jose Gomez, told Lara that the branch''s gear is
protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and that he
would contact the bank''s security staff and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, Lara said today in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Lara said he''s waiting for an opinion from the county
attorney on whether the bank''s property can be seized. </p>
<p>They don''t have a problem putting my client out in the
street, Roman said. But when somebody prevails against a
bank, they pull every string in the book to avoid paying. </p>
<p>Roman, a former judge, is representing borrower Judith
French, whose home was sold in a foreclosure auction on Sept. 7
even though the lawyer had obtained a temporary restraining
order the same day. Roman said he''s seeking the legal fees from
JPMorgan because he believes the bank was French''s mortgage
servicer. </p>
<p>Judge Bruce King dismissed French''s eviction case in county
justice court on Dec. 15, saying the restraining was in effect
at the time of the foreclosure sale. </p>
<p>Unusual Strategy </p>
<p>Greg Hassell, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the company was
unaware of King''s judgment because it wasn''t named as the
plaintiff. </p>
<p>Now that we are aware, we are taking steps to pay,
Hassell said. </p>
<p>Roman''s strategy of going after the bank''s property is
unusual, according to April Charney, a senior attorney with
Jacksonville Area Legal Aid in Jacksonville, Florida, who said
she has instructed thousands of lawyers on representing
consumers in foreclosure and bankruptcy cases. </p>
<p>If it was me I wouldn''t go for a desk or chair, I would
execute on their business license, Charney said. When you go
into court and a judge orders you to do something and you don''t
do it, that''s the last step before lawlessness </p>
<p>Lara said he''s never faced a situation like this. </p>
<p>Right now our concern is whether we can go ahead and
seize any equipment in a bank, Lara said. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, is targeting a 2 percentage point market-
share gain in fixed-income trading this year, Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman said. </p>
<p>We''ve spoken about it, we''ve invested behind it, we''ve
met with all our clients, who are encouraging us, Gorman, 52,
said today at an investor conference in New York. Every single
day we talk extensively as a new management team about it. So
that would be priority No. 1. </p>
<p>Gorman replaced fixed-income trading head Jack DiMaio with
Ken deRegt last month as fourth-quarter revenue from that
business was less than half its rivals. The firm also hired
Glenn Hadden from rival Goldman Sachs Group Inc. as global head
of interest rates. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is already ranked in the top three in
commodities and credit sales and trading, Gorman said. The firm
is looking to gain market share in rates, where it increased
headcount by about 20 percent, and foreign exchange, where it
added 40 percent more people, he said. </p>
<p>The macro space -- rates, foreign exchange and emerging
markets -- has pockets that are doing very well and pockets that
are not, Gorman said. There are enormous opportunities, and
we''ve been investing in that space, in headcount and in our
technology. </p>
<p> Morgan Stanley''s fourth-quarter revenue from fixed-income
sales and trading was negative $29 million. Excluding gains or
losses from its own credit spreads, or DVA, fixed-income revenue
was $813 million, compared with $1.64 billion at Goldman Sachs
and $2.88 billion at JPMorgan Chase  Co. All three firms are
based in New York. </p>
<p>Client Survey </p>
<p>While revenue excluding DVA fell from 2009, the firm did
make progress in 2010, Gorman said. About 70 percent of clients
in a Greenwich Associates survey reported using Morgan Stanley
as a fixed-income dealer last year, up from 56 percent in 2009,
according to a presentation accompanying Gorman''s remarks. </p>
<p>DeRegt, the firm''s chief risk officer, became global head
of fixed-income sales and trading, excluding commodities.
DiMaio, who was head of interest rate, credit and currency
trading, left the company. David Moore, head of the structured-
rates unit, also left the firm, a person briefed on the matter
said last month. </p>

<p> General Mills Inc. Chief Executive
Officer Ken Powell said the Cheerios maker expects food
commodity prices to continue rising about 5 percent annually as
demand from emerging markets increases. </p>
<p>Commodity prices have gained about 5 percent to 6 percent a
year for more than a decade, he said today at a press conference
with joint venture partner Nestle SA in Orbe, Switzerland. </p>
<p>If you average it out, it''s about 5 percent, and so we
think this is likely to continue, he told journalists, saying
the company has an assumption of mid-single digit input cost
inflation. We were planning for this. </p>
<p>General Mills, based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has been
trying to offset higher input costs as much as possible by
eliminating waste and improving productivity, Powell said. The
company, which raised prices on about a quarter of its cereal
products in November, aims to minimize price increases, he said. </p>
<p>The consumer is still being pretty careful, Powell
said.  Consumer confidence is rising, but slowly, and it''s
still pretty low. </p>
<p>Nestle, based in Vevey, Switzerland, and General Mills
today inaugurated a cereal research center for their Cereal
Partners Worldwide joint venture. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $3.5
billion of bonds in its biggest dollar-denominated sale since
2009, taking advantage of the lowest-ever short-term financial
company borrowing costs relative to longer-term yields. </p>
<p>The bank, which holds the record for the highest profit
earned by a U.S. securities firm, issued $1 billion of three-
year notes that yield 100 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The New York-based company''s $2.5 billion of 3.625
percent, 5-year fixed-rate securities pay a 158 basis-point
spread to similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show. </p>
<p>The gap in yields between financial company bonds due in
one to three years and those maturing in seven to 10 years
widened to 3.18 percentage points on Jan. 31, the greatest gap
on record, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
going back to 1996. </p>
<p>They are definitely taking advantage of the steep yield
curve, said Nicholas Finkelman, who helps oversee $3.5 billion
of bonds as a money manager at New York-based Ryan Labs Inc.
This general area is great for issuers to lock in low
yields. </p>
<p>The fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets last month sold $2.5
billion of 6.25 percent, 30-year bonds, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Yield Curve </p>
<p>The yield curve has steepened amid signs that economic
growth is gaining momentum and as the Federal Reserve has kept
its benchmark overnight rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent
for two years. Companies in the U.S. added more workers than
forecast in January, data from a private report showed today. </p>
<p>The new issue is the biggest from Goldman Sachs since March
12, 2009, when the bank sold $5 billion of debt under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.''s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
Program. It''s the largest dollar-denominated sale without
government assistance since a $4.05 billion three-part offering
in January 2004, according to Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>The new offering is cheap, compared with outstanding
similar-maturity debt, said Finkelman. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs issued $2.25 billion of five-year, 3.7
percent notes in July that paid 205 basis points, or 2.05
percentage points, more than benchmarks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The spread environment continues to be extremely
favorable for issuers, Finkelman said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s new notes will likely be rated A1 by
Moody''s Investors Service and A+ by Standard  Poor''s, Bloomberg
data show. Libor is the rate banks charge each other on loans. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. put-option
volume surged as an investor took out protection from the bank''s
shares dropping through January, according to Joe Kunkle,
founder of OptionsHawk.com. </p>
<p>The investor bought 25,000 January 2012 $40 puts at 1:19
p.m. in New York and sold 50,000 January 2012 $30 puts, a so-
called spread strategy possibly used as insurance against a
retreat, Kunkle said. The strategy profits most if the shares
fall to $30. The shares haven''t closed below $40 since Dec. 20
or fallen under $30 since April 2009. JPMorgan rose 1 cent to
$45.46 at 4 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>These spreads are often used as hedges to long equity
exposure, Kunkle said. </p>
<p>The cost of buying insurance in the U.S. options market has
fallen toward the lowest levels since 2007, with the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index dropping to 15.45 on
Dec. 22. Shares of New York-based JPMorgan have rallied two
straight years, and the company posted a record fourth-quarter
profit of $4.83 billion last month. </p>
<p>More than 122,000 puts to sell the stock changed hands,
double the four-week average and almost three times the number

<p>"Asia Fueling Global Innovation." That was the theme of the 2-hour panel discussion I moderated as part of a full-day ceremony celebrating the groundbreaking of Procter  Gamble''s SGD 250m Innovation Centre in Singapore. </p>

<p>As promised, I asked Bruce Brown, PG''s CTO, one of the questions readers submitted last week: "As you look forward into the future what do you see as PG''s largest challenges, as seen through your eyes as CTO?" Brown noted three specific challenges.</p>

<p>First, the general challenge of growth. PG is about an $80 billion company. It typically shoots for 4 to 6 percent organic growth every year. Historically, 80 percent of its growth comes from innovation. Run the numbers and you''re looking at close to $4 billion dollars in growth, every year. As a point of comparison, Hasbro  an 87-year-old company  has annual revenues of $4 billion. So PG has to create a new Hasbro, every year. This is a challenge when realizing some of that potential requires smartly re-thinking core systems and structures. (Brown and I are working on a more expansive piece on this very topic.)</p>

<p>Second, Brown highlighted how PG has to deal with the fact that 50 percent of its RD scientists will reach retirement age in the next few years. While that presents a clear challenge  retaining the awesome accumulated knowledge of these scientists  it also creates an opportunity to make sure that RD talent is balanced with global opportunities. </p>

<p>Third, PG has to deal with sustainability issues. It has publicly announced goals to reduce its dependence on petroleum and to increase its use of recycled and renewable materials. He noted how Singapore Agency for Science, Technology  Research (A*STAR) has told PG that sustainability is "no longer a program, it is part of how we do our work."</p>

<p>Brown''s remarks set off a fascinating back-and-forth among the panel about some of the general challenges facing companies in Asia and globally. At the end of the day''s wide-ranging discussion, I shared the eight phrases that had stuck with me:</p>



"For and amongst consumers." Bruce Brown used this phrase to describe how PG will achieve its stated goal of serving 5 billion consumers by the year 2015 (an increase of 800 million from today). Brown described how localizing research activities is a key component of that strategy.


"The Red Dot." A*STAR Managing Director Low Teck Seng used that phrase to describe how Singapore appears on a map. He described how the country''s small size allowed it to be more nimble, reminding the audience that sometimes constraints can foster innovation.


"Florence." PG RD VP for Asia Maurizio Marchesini noted similarities between Singapore and Florence during the Italian Renaissance, with free-flowing ideas and disciplines colliding. He and I both noted how solving tough problems requires this kind of interdisciplinary co-location where people work together in new ways.


"Simplifying technology and new business models." Those are the two ingredients Shamik Dasgupta, the regional head of Medtronic''s Cardiac Rhythm Management business unit, described as vital for driving disruptive growth in markets like India and China.


"Non-consumption." National University of Singapore Professor CC Hang used that term to answer the question of where there are the greatest opportunities for disruptive growth in Asia. He noted how there were more than 20 million electric bikes sold in China in 2010, many of them to women or other non-traditional vehicle purchasers.


"As common as possible, as different as needed." That''s how Deb Henretta, the head of PG''s Asia business, described how she thought about approaching Asian markets. She pointed out some of the real differences between consumers in different markets. For example, "beauty" means fair skin to many Asian consumers and tanned skin to many U.S. consumers. But using scale where appropriate can help companies like PG realize its full global potential.


"Non-obvious disruptions." Marchesini didn''t quite use this term, but it was how I described an example he provided. He described how PG sells a product under the Downy brand that provides long-lasting scent benefits to clothes using microcapsules. In markets like the Philippines, this technology allows PG to bring scent benefits to consumers who can''t afford higher end perfumes.


"Re-frame." Henretta noted how important re-framing was to manage many of the challenges inherent in mastering innovation in today''s economy. One intriguing thing she noted, "You have to make sure your workforce reflects the consumers you are going to serve."
<p>It was great to see the energy around the topic, and the passion that the six leaders had for Asia''s innovation potential.And, at the end of the day after Brown, Henretta, and key government officials officially broke ground on the Innovation Centre, I got a chance to participate in lo hei  the ceremonial tossing of a salad to bring good fortune in the coming Chinese Lunar New Year.</p>

<p> Microsoft Corp., the world''s largest
software maker, plans to sell $2.25 billion of debt as soon as
today as investment-grade companies tap the corporate bond
market to reward shareholders. </p>
<p>Proceeds may be used for working capital, stock buybacks
and acquisitions, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. Microsoft is offering 5-, 10- and
30-year senior unsecured debt, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. </p>
<p>2011 is going to be more the year of the shareholder than
the year of the bondholder, said Tom Murphy, a money manager
who helps oversee about $23 billion of investment-grade credit
at Columbia Management in Minneapolis. Some companies are
going to be taking that treasure trove of cash they have and
rewarding shareholders, whether it''s through share buybacks,
dividends, or doing strategic MA transactions. </p>
<p>Credit quality will weaken among investment-grade issuers
this year as companies facing limited business
opportunities, take advantage of relatively low interest rates
to repurchase stock, according to Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.
Bonds issued by Microsoft in its last U.S. offering in September
have tumbled, while the company''s shares have climbed 14.4
percent. </p>
<p>In today''s offering, a $750 million portion of 5-year notes
may pay 38 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
$500 million of 10-year debt may pay 48 basis points more than
benchmarks and $1 billion of 30-year bonds may pay a spread of
68 basis points, said the person familiar with the offering, who
declined to be identified because terms aren''t set. </p>
<p>Lowest Coupons </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to own industrial
investment-grade debt instead of Treasuries fell to 137 basis
points on Jan. 24, the tightest spread since May, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The spread was 138
basis points yesterday. </p>
<p>Microsoft, one of four non-financial U.S. companies with
AAA ratings, issued $4.75 billion of debt in September,
including 3- and 5-year notes that set records for the lowest
coupons for those maturities. </p>
<p>The offering included $1 billion of 3 percent, 10-year
notes that priced at 99.14 cents on the dollar to yield 55 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The notes have dropped to 93.1 cents as
of yesterday to yield 3.86 percent, or a spread of 36.5 basis
points, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>Windows, Xbox </p>
<p>The company''s 10-year notes lost 5.8 percent since their
first full day of trading on Sept. 23, compared with the 1.73
percent loss on its $1.75 billion of 1.625 percent, 5-year
notes, Bloomberg data show. Bonds rated AAA have lost 2.82
percent since then while overall investment-grade bonds have
declined 1.4 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
show. </p>
<p>The maker of Windows and Xbox repurchased $5 billion of
shares and declared $1.3 billion of dividends in the quarter
ended Dec. 31, the company said in a Jan. 27 earnings call. </p>
<p>The Microsoft bonds fell because the extra yield the debt
pays relative to Treasuries offers little protection as a
shock absorber to rising interest rates, said William Larkin, a fixed income portfolio manager in Salem, Massachusetts, at Cabot Money Management, which manages $500
million. </p>
<p>Super Expensive'' </p>
<p>I would look at this as super expensive, Larkin said in
a telephone interview. As inflation expectations shift and as
Treasuries sell off, basically Microsoft bonds will lose
value. </p>
<p>Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG are
managing today''s offering, said the person familiar with the
issue. Today''s filing didn''t include the size or maturities of
the sale. </p>
<p>Investment-grade issuers are beginning to re-leverage
their balance sheets after cutting debt in 2008 through early
2010, Guy LeBas, strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery
Scott wrote in the broker-dealer''s 2011 outlook on Dec. 20. </p>
<p>Corporate cash balances are at record highs, close to 7
percent of total assets, Barclays Capital said in its global
credit outlook report for 2011. </p>
<p>I don''t necessarily think it''s such a terrible thing for
us, because we''re starting from such a position of strength from
a balance sheet perspective, Columbia Management''s Murphy said
of bond sales fueling buybacks and acquisitions. </p>
<p>AAA Rating </p>
<p>Standard  Poor''s and Moody''s Investors Service also rank
Exxon Mobil Corp., Johnson  Johnson and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. as AAA, or an equivalent Aaa, the same level
they assign to U.S. government debt. </p>
<p> Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies Diapers and Viva
paper towels, sold $700 million of bonds on Jan. 27 that may be
used to buy back common stock, fund the company''s pension plans,
and redeem outstanding commercial paper, according to a
statement from the Dallas-based company. </p>
<p>Moody''s assigned an Aaa to the Microsoft offering, the
ratings company said today in a note. </p>

<p> Morgan Stanley, accused by a group of Singapore investors of fraudulently wiping out their $154.7
million investment, urged a Manhattan judge to dismiss the
lawsuit, arguing New York isn''t an appropriate place for trial. </p>
<p>The investors had agreed that any dispute relating to their
purchase of securities would be resolved in Singapore, Morgan
Stanley said in a filing in federal court in Manhattan
yesterday. </p>
<p>This court should honor the contractual obligation,
Morgan Stanley said. In addition, this case has no nexus to
the United States, the bank said </p>
<p>The complaint by 18 Singapore investors, who seek a judge''s
permission to sue on behalf of all purchasers of Morgan
Stanley''s Pinnacle Notes, alleged the bank created a classic
bait and switch scheme secretly designed to benefit Morgan
Stanley at the customers'' expense. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, based in New York, fraudulently induced the
investors into buying the notes, which the bank intentionally
and materially misrepresented as safe and conservative,
according to the lawsuit filed on Oct. 25. </p>
<p>Several Morgan Stanley units created the scheme to redirect
funds into the bank''s own coffers, the investors including the
Singapore Government Staff Credit Cooperative Society Ltd. said
in the complaint. There may be, at minimum, thousands of class
members, the investors said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley created collateralized debt obligations, a
debt security that''s usually backed by bonds, or corporate
loans, and failed to inform the investors that it was a counter-
party to the agreements, the investors claimed. For each dollar
the investors lost, the bank gained a dollar, the investors
said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley entities stood on both sides of the
agreements, the investors claimed. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said the suit should also be thrown out
because the Monetary Authority of Singapore investigated the
sale of structured financial products and created a resolution
system. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in July agreed to pay $550 million
to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit over
claims it misled investors in CDOs linked to subprime mortgages.
The bank, which said it made a mistake and marketing
materials for the instruments had incomplete information,
didn''t admit to any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. </p>
<p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore banned banks from
selling the structured investments in 2009 following claims by
investors that they were misled on products. The authority
lifted the ban on 10 financial institutions last year after they
boosted internal procedures of their advisory services across
all investment products. </p>
<p>The case is Dandong et al v. Pinnacle Performance Ltd. et
al, 10-08086, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Foley Square). </p>

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. said it will
seek at least $778 million from Jefferson County, Alabama, if it
loses lawsuits brought by companies that insured the county''s
defaulted sewer debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, which underwrote $3 billion of the debt sales and
sold the county derivatives to lower its borrowing costs, is
fighting claims filed by Syncora Guarantee Inc. and a unit of Assured Guaranty Ltd. in New York state court. </p>
<p>The bond insurers accuse the bank of concealing payments of
$3 million to friends of county commissioners in order to win
business. They also said the bank didn''t disclose an engineering
report saying the sewer system wouldn''t be able to pay its debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan demands that Jefferson County agree to indemnify
and hold JPMorgan harmless for any losses or costs, including
attorney''s fees and expenses sustained by JPMorgan, wrote Mary Beth Forshaw, an attorney at Simpson Thatcher  Bartlett LLP
representing JPMorgan, in a letter to the County Commission. </p>
<p>The existence of the letter, dated Jan. 31, was previously
reported by the Birmingham News. Justin Perras, a JPMorgan
spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>Syncora and Assured took JPMorgan to court after Jefferson
County''s refinancing of sewer debt issued in 2002 and 2003
collapsed during the credit crisis and almost bankrupted the
county. Syncora insured about $1.2 billion of the sewer debt and
a $165 million surety policy. Assured provided almost $400
million in coverage. </p>
<p>In response to a lawsuit from Jefferson County, the bank
said the county took on too much debt and knew the financing had
risks. Payments to friends of the commissioners were directed by
the county officials and disclosed in letters to them, according
to the bank. </p>

<p> Chevron Corp.''s Kazakh oil venture
more than tripled crude extraction tax payments as the
government seeks a larger share of resource revenue. </p>
<p>The TengizChevroil venture, Kazakhstan''s biggest crude
exporter, paid 445 billion tenge ($3 billion) in oil extraction
taxes last year, compared with 122 billion tenge in 2009, the
Finance Ministry''s Tax Committee said on its website. The
payments do not include export duties, Raikhan Sharipova, an
Astana-based spokeswoman for the committee, said today by phone. </p>
<p>Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world''s oil
reserves according to BP Plc, introduced the extraction tax in
2009, replacing royalties, as it sought to boost revenue and
narrowed a budget deficit. In August 2010, the government
started levying export taxes on crude oil pumped under 146
contracts, including Chevron''s venture. </p>
<p>TengizChevroil increased oil production to 19 million tons
in the first nine months, compared with 22.5 million tons it
produced in 2009, according to the company''s website. </p>
<p>The venture''s total tax burden more than doubled to 991
billion tenge last year from 452 billion tenge in 2009, the tax
committee said. The venture paid 512 billion tenge in corporate
income tax, compared with 294 billion tenge in 2009. </p>
<p>TengizChevroil made over $8 billion in payments to
Kazakhstan in 2010, Novosti-Kazakhstan reported on Feb. 2,
citing General Director Tim Miller. Linsi Crain, an Atyrau-based
spokeswoman for TengizChevroil, didn''t answer her office phone
or replay to a message seeking comment. </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent

to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Ally, the auto lender majority owned by the U.S.
government, also selected Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
decision isn''t public. The U.S. Treasury Department, which owns
73.8 percent of the lender, will decide how much the
underwriters are paid, the person said. </p>
<p>Ally chose the underwriters after interviewing banks last
week as Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter, 63, positions
the company for an IPO and the government looks to begin
unwinding its stake. The size of the offering hasn''t been
decided, the person said. </p>
<p>Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Ally, declined
to comment, as did spokespeople for the four banks. Earlier this
week, Ally reported a fourth straight quarterly profit, posting
$79 million in net income for the fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have previously advised Ally.
Last March, Ally was said to hire both banks to explore ways to
repay U.S. taxpayers, and helped consider strategic alternatives
for its mortgage unit, which is now complete. </p>
<p>JPMorgan was chosen to participate in the share sales for
General Motors Co., American International Group Inc. and now
Ally, all of which have stakes owned by the U.S. government.
JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs were among those picked to manage the
AIG offering, a person with direct knowledge of the decision
said on Jan. 18. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were
among the firms that helped handle GM''s sale. </p>
<p>Underwriting Fees </p>
<p>The banks are unlikely to earn typical underwriting fees,
based on other transactions involving government ownership.
Treasury''s acting assistant secretary for financial stability,
Tim Massad, said Jan. 19 that underwriting fees in the AIG sale
will be very low by normal standards and that they won''t
be any higher than GM. GM paid 0.75 percent in fees to banks
managing its IPO. </p>
<p>Ally, a former GM unit once called GMAC Inc., benefited
from three rounds of government aid totaling $17.2 billion. In
addition to U.S. taxpayers, so-called third-party investors own
8.5 percent, Cerberus Capital Management LP has about 7.8
percent and GM and an affiliated trust hold 9.9 percent. </p>
