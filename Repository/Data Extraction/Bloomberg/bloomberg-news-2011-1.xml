&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s plan to
offer clients up to $1.5 billion in Facebook Inc. equity may
invite U.S. regulators to take a closer look at whether the
owner of the world&#8217;s most popular social-networking site is
circumventing disclosure rules, securities lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission, whose rules require
any company with more than 499 investors to disclose financial
information, is already scrutinizing the market for trading
shares of closely held companies including Facebook, according
to a person familiar with the inquiry, who declined to be
identified because the matter isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs invested $450 million in Facebook and is
planning to create a special purpose vehicle for its clients to
make additional investments worth as much as $1.5 billion,
according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on
condition of anonymity because the deal is private. Some private
companies avoid crossing the disclosure threshold when
investors&#8217; funds are channeled through a single entity, such as
a private equity firm or hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The real question is, what are the details of this
special purpose vehicle?&#8221; said James Angel, a finance professor
at Georgetown University&#8217;s business school in Washington. If the
investment is designed to circumvent the rule, &#8220;the SEC should
be looking very closely at it.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment and the plans for the special purpose
vehicle were previously reported by the New York Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Request &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further public confirmation of the SEC&#8217;s interest in such
investment funds came yesterday when SecondMarket Inc., which
matches buyers and sellers of shares in private companies such
as Facebook and Twitter Inc., received a request for
information from the agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have now received a voluntary request for information
from the SEC regarding &#8216;pre-IPO pooled investment funds,&#8217; &#8221;
said Mark D. Murphy, a spokesman for the New York-based broker-
dealer. &#8220;We are fully cooperating.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law of the 500-owner limit was created to make sure
those who invest in larger companies are provided sufficient
information about the firm. The rule applies to companies with
more than $10 million in assets. The Goldman Sachs investment
values Facebook at about $50 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook told the SEC in 2005 that it had under 500
shareholders and asked for an exemption from making public
disclosures about the restricted stock units it was giving
employees. The SEC granted the exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneficial Holders &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the law counts so-called owners of record toward the
500-shareholder threshold, people who invest in a private
company through a fund -- the so-called beneficial holders --
aren&#8217;t included in the tally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company only has to count record holders; that&#8217;s sort
of neutral terminology,&#8221; said David Martin, a former director
of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Corporation Finance who is co-head of
the securities practice at Covington  Burling LLP in Washington. A private company can officially be well under the
limit while exceeding it in practice by being &#8220;owned by
thousands of people,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment funds generally are treated as single owners of
record. Still, the SEC&#8217;s rules state that if a vehicle is set up
&#8220;primarily to circumvent&#8221; securities law, the beneficial
holders will be counted as individual owners of record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the Goldman Sachs vehicle is established only to invest
in Facebook, the SEC may interpret it as a deliberate attempt to
dodge its rules, said John Mahon, a former lawyer in the SEC&#8217;s
Division of Corporation Finance who is now a partner at
Sutherland, Asbill and Brennan LLP in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Potential Risk&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s that potential risk that the SEC, in essence,
could basically look through that vehicle&#8221; and count the
investors individually, Mahon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The danger for Facebook is that if it improperly manages
the investor interest, it could accidentally cross the 500
shareholder threshold, going public without an initial public
offering, Angel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Facebook, Larry Yu, declined to comment.
Goldman Sachs didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of the agreement, Goldman Sachs can sell up to $75
million of its stake to Russia&#8217;s Digital Sky Technologies, which
it partly owns. Digital Sky Technologies also added $50 million
to an earlier stake in Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The whole venture capital industry is based upon funds
investing in private companies,&#8221; said Paul N. Roth, a partner
at Schulte, Roth and Zabel LLP in New York, who leads the hedge
funds subcommittee at the American Bar Association&#8217;s Committee
on Federal Regulation of Securities. &#8220;They tend to count as a
single investor.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treasuries fell after the biggest
monthly rout in a year as a report showed manufacturing grew in
December at the fastest pace in seven months and construction
spending increased in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. debt declined before government data later this week
forecast to show the world&#8217;s largest economy added jobs in
December for a third month. Bonds pared losses after the Federal
Reserve bought $7.79 billion of Treasuries in the highest
percentage of debt offered since Dec. 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As long as the economy continues to show signs of a self-
sustaining recovery and supply is kept under control, yields
will move higher, and that&#8217;s what we are seeing in the selling
pressure,&#8221; said Sean Simko, who oversees $8 billion at SEI
Investments Co. in Oaks, Pennsylvania. &#8220;Rates will move high in
2011, but in a choppy fashion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. 10-year note yields rose four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 3.33 percent at 5 p.m. in New York,
according to BGCantor Market Data. Earlier they were up 12 basis
points to 3.42 percent. The price of the 2.625 percent security
due in November 2020 fell 10/32, or $3.13 per $1,000 face
amount, to 94 3/32. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-year bond yields increased as much as 11 basis
points, the most on an intraday basis since Dec. 28, to 4.44
percent before trading at 4.40 percent, up six basis points.
Two-year notes erased a loss to yield 0.59 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury Department will announce on Jan. 6 the amounts
of 3-, 10- and 30-year debt it will sell next week in the first
note and bond auctions of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strong&#8217; Fed Purchase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed bought Treasuries due from February 2018 to August
2020 as part of an asset-purchase program aimed at lowering
borrowing costs and stimulating economic growth. Holders offered
to sell $17 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The buyback amount from the Fed was strong and caused
Treasuries to pull back on their losses on the day, creating
choppy trading conditions in the market, given the slightly
better economic data,&#8221; said Sean Murphy, a Treasury trader in
New York at Societe Generale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed&#8217;s acceptance of 46 percent of the amount offered
compared with an average 34 percent at the last 10 purchases,
and was the highest since Dec. 15. A higher ratio of Fed buys is
supportive for Treasuries because it indicates less desire by
holders to sell the debt under the quantitative easing program, Jim Vogel, head of agency-debt research at FTN in Memphis, Tennessee, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference, or spread, between 2- and 10-year note
yields reached 2.78 percentage points, the widest since Dec. 27. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2010 Gain &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries returned 5.9 percent in 2010 amid record low
inflation and an unemployment rate of 9.8 percent, erasing a 3.7
percent loss in 2009, according to a Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index. Bonds pared the return last month as they slid 1.8
percent, the most since December 2009, on signs the economy is
improving. Global bonds have fallen 1.8 percent since the end of
August, the figures show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Institute for Supply Management&#8217;s manufacturing index
rose to 57 from 56.6 in November, the Tempe, Arizona-based group
said today. A reading greater than 50 points signals expansion.
Construction spending rose 0.4 percent, exceeding the forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey, Commerce Department figures showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. added 140,000 jobs in December, according to the
median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists before the
Labor Department&#8217;s Jan. 7 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question of Strength &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This morning&#8217;s data came in strong and people are
optimistic about the economy, but the question going forward is
if the data is robust enough to generate inflation or employment
growth,&#8221; said Ira Jersey, an interest-rate strategist in New
York at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the 18 primary dealers
that trade directly with the Fed. &#8220;Until you see that happen it
will be hard to generate a sustainable selloff.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between yields on 10-year notes and comparable
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader
expectations for consumer prices over the life of the
securities, touched 2.33 percentage points, the widest since
Dec. 23. This year&#8217;s low was 1.47 percentage points in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin said that while the
central bank will likely complete its $600 billion bond-purchase
program, known as QE2 for the second round of quantitative
easing, a third round is unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The fact that the economy is stronger right now makes it
much less likely we&#8217;re going to see a QE3,&#8221; Mishkin, an
economist at Columbia University in New York, said today in an
interview on Bloomberg TV&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop With Betty Liu.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growth, Not Vigilantes &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The slide in Treasuries reflects prospects for faster U.S.
economic growth rather than concern that rising budget deficits
will drive investors away from government debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the average yield on Treasuries increased to 1.89
percent from 1.42 percent at the end of September, according to
the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Treasury Master index, the
price of credit-default swaps tied to U.S. debt declined to 41.5
basis points from 48.4 basis points at the end of September,
according to Bloomberg data. The dollar rose 1.5 percent against
an index of currencies of six major U.S. trading partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drop in swap prices and the greenback&#8217;s strength show
bond vigilantes aren&#8217;t ready to punish the U.S. for its
spending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. received a $500 million
investment from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Russia&#8217;s Digital
Sky Technologies that values the social-networking company at
$50 billion, according to three people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which invested $450 million, also made an
arrangement that lets its clients buy Facebook equity worth as
much as $1.5 billion, said two of the people, who asked not to
be identified because the deal is private. Digital Sky invested
$50 million, boosting an earlier stake, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, owner of the most popular social network, is
luring investors eager to benefit from its growth among users
and advertisers. The company had about $2 billion in sales last
year, up from $700 million to $800 million in 2009, other people
familiar with the matter said last month. It may use the funding
to expand, said Jeremiah Owyang, an analyst at Altimeter Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a very large investment -- one of the largest
that we&#8217;ve seen in this space,&#8221; said Owyang, whose firm is
based in San Mateo, California. &#8220;They need this money for
growth.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook, based in Palo Alto, California, is increasing
staff to compete with Google Inc., owner of the world&#8217;s most
popular search engine, and other rivals. The company, founded in
2004 by Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, has more than
2,000 employees, while Google has more than 23,000. Facebook has
more than 500 million users, up from about 175 million in
February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LLC
began maintenance on an ethylene unit at its Cedar Bayou
chemical plant in Baytown, Texas, according to a filing with
state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flaring associated with the work started today at 8 a.m.
local time and is expected to last three days, the company said
in a filing with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.
Chevron Phillips is based in The Woodlands, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical plant outages can increase prices for products as
companies turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linda Koenig, a company spokeswoman, couldn&#8217;t immediately
be reached by telephone for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is a joint venture of Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips. Ethylene crackers process natural gas liquids or
naphtha into basic petrochemicals used in plastics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cedar Bayou plant is 32 miles (51 kilometers) east of
Houston. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brent crude may rise above $100 a
barrel &#8220;sooner rather than later&#8221; in the first quarter because
of speculation that the global economic recovery will accelerate
in 2011, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Oil sentiment has turned decidedly bullish, partly driven
by unusually cold weather, but more due to an increasingly
optimistic consensus view&#8221; on the economy, especially for the
U.S., analysts led by Lawrence Eagles said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market shift is reflected in the biggest increase in
the U.S Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index in December since 1991 and a
jump of almost $9 a barrel last month for Brent, the European
benchmark, according to Eagles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude rose $7.27
a barrel, or 8.6 percent, in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global demand is on course to surpass pre-recession highs,
JPMorgan said. &#8220;We are steadily moving back toward the tight
market conditions of 2007-2008, where any spike in oil demand
requires a corresponding spike in oil price to rein in demand.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applications in the U.S. for unemployment assistance
decreased by 34,000 to 388,000 in the week ended Dec. 25,
breaking the 400,000 level for the first time since July 2008,
the Labor Department reported last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The service sector which is concentrated in developed
countries is starting to come to life,&#8221; shifting oil demand
growth from petrochemical feedstocks and towards transport fuels
as commuting increases, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. retained its
place for a third year as the top underwriter of U.S.
investment-grade corporate bonds, leading banks managing $845
billion of sales in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. lender by assets managed 13.8
percent of the new issues with $101.6 billion of offerings in
496 transactions, excluding self-led sales, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc.
retained the second and third places, respectively, while Barclays Capital displaced Morgan Stanley for the fourth spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We had periods where things felt like a bull market with
respect to market appetite and receptivity to deals, and then we
had periods of time when it was very difficult to get
transactions done,&#8221; said Therese Esperdy, head of global debt
capital markets at JPMorgan Chase in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company bond supply ranged last year from as low as $33
billion in May to as much as $162 billion in September amid
concern surrounding Europe&#8217;s sovereign debt crisis. Average
investment-grade yields reached a high of 4.86 percent in
January and a record-low 3.53 percent in November. Overseas
issuers, led by corporations in Canada and England, accounted
for 41 percent of offerings, the biggest portion ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Merrill Lynch underwrote 12.5 percent of
issues, or 552, valued at $91.6 billion, Bloomberg data show.
Citigroup had a 9.6 percent market share, with 364 transactions
totaling $70 billion, the data show. Barclays managed 328 issues
that came to $62.7 billion, an 8.5 percent share. Barclays
boosted its share from 8 percent in 2009, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Cross-Border Financing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our cross-border financing business is a very significant
component of our business, and it&#8217;s one of our core
competencies,&#8221; Esperdy said. &#8220;That played a big part in our
market presence in the U.S. dollar market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment-grade debt sales may decline 6 percent this year
as companies borrow to fund takeovers and share buybacks rather
than refinance outstanding debt, Bank of America strategists
wrote in a Dec. 28 note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our goal is certainly to be number one,&#8221; said Andrew Karp, head of investment-grade debt syndicate for the Americas
at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. &#8220;We&#8217;ll look to maintain our
traditional areas of strength and continue to innovate and push
into new areas.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley&#8217;s 10.1 percent market share from 2009
declined to 8 percent in 2010, pushing the bank from the fourth
spot to the sixth, Bloomberg data show. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
remained fifth with an 8.2 percent market share, managing $60
billion worth of sales, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook Inc. raised $500 million
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and a Russian investor in a deal
that values the company at $50 billion, the New York Times
reported, citing unidentified people involved in the
transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs invested $450 million in the social-network
site operator, while Russia&#8217;s Digital Sky Technologies invested
$50 million, the newspaper reported. Goldman Sachs has the right
to sell as much as $75 million of its stake to Digital Sky,
according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment may enable Facebook to make acquisitions,
develop new services and add employees, New York Times said. The
transaction may allow Goldman Sachs to gain a role in arranging
a possible initial public offering for the Internet company, the
report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Yu, a spokesman for Palo Alto, California-based

&lt;p&gt;Technology companies that fueled more
than $100 billion in acquisitions last year are likely to spend
more in 2011 in a race to harness surging demand for cloud
computing and security services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co. and International Business
Machines Corp. led purchases of more than 2,700 companies and
still spent only a fraction of the cash piles they accumulated
during the recession. The dollar amount of announced tech deals
gained 12 percent, lagging behind a 26 percent jump in worldwide
mergers, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m bullish&#8221; on 2011, said Larry Sonsini, chairman and
co-founder of Wilson, Sonsini, Goodrich  Rosati, the Palo Alto,
California-based law firm that worked with security-software
maker McAfee Inc. on its $7.7 billion agreed sale to Intel.
&#8220;When I look at enterprise clients, I see they are poised to
invest in growth on a global basis.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buyers aim to capture the $3.4 trillion in information-
technology spending projected by researcher Gartner Inc. for
2011, a 3.5 percent increase from 2010. Cisco Systems Inc. and Oracle Corp. are among IT providers driving the convergence of
services, software and hardware as they compete to become the
most relevant to chief technology officers. More companies are
moving to cloud computing, allowing them to access information
over the Internet from external data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sonsini&#8217;s firm worked on 62 technology acquisitions valued
at a total of $16 billion in 2010, including the McAfee takeover
-- the biggest deal in the industry last year. From his vantage
point in Silicon Valley, Sonsini predicts an increase in many
types of tech transactions this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture Capital &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Starting at the bottom of the enterprise ladder such as
venture financing, we will see active investments in important
areas such as cloud computing, clean technology, alternative
energy, life sciences and Internet,&#8221; said Sonsini, whose firm
helped take Google Inc. and Apple Inc. public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Venture capitalists are also pushing for paydays after a
dearth of initial public offerings during 2008 and 2009.
Worldwide, 94 technology companies held IPOs in 2010, up from 54
in 2009, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Groupon Inc., the Internet-coupon service with more than 35
million users, may be among those going public in 2011. The
Chicago-based company walked away from a $6 billion takeover bid
from Google in December and will decide this year whether to
sell shares in an IPO, a person close to the situation said last
month. Groupon has also filed to raise as much as $950 million
from the sale of preferred shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IPO Benefits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The increase in global tech IPOs in 2010 bodes well for
MA in the industry&#8221; in 2011 and beyond, said Drew Guevara,
head of West Coast technology investment banking for Morgan
Stanley, which advised Groupon together with Allen  Co. &#8220;Going
public both establishes a company&#8217;s market valuation and creates
the potential to achieve higher value downstream through a
sale.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley topped the 2010 league table of financial
advisers in the sector with 40 deals worth about $28 billion,
followed by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
New York-based Morgan Stanley advised McAfee in its sale to
Intel, video-storage provider Isilon Systems Inc. in its
takeover by EMC Corp., and ArcSight Inc. in its sale to HP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speculation about who will be next has already boosted the
stocks of the fastest-growing companies. F5 Networks Inc., whose
software helps companies manage Internet traffic, more than
doubled in 2010. Riverbed Technology Inc., a provider of
equipment to boost networks&#8217; speed, more than tripled. Acme
Packet Inc., a maker of devices that help networks transmit
phone calls and video, quintupled as investors bet on continued
revenue growth and a possible sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Managing Expectations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In this environment, managing the market&#8217;s expectations
is always a challenge,&#8221; said Ken Goldman, chief financial
officer of Fortinet Inc., the Sunnyvale, California-based maker
of network-security systems, whose market value increased by
about 80 percent in 2010. &#8220;The risk of missing the targeted
numbers even by a tad is always greater than overachieving.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A buyout of Seagate Technology Plc failed to materialize
last year after the disk-drive maker ended discussions with
private-equity firms, saying the indicated deal value wasn&#8217;t in
the best interest of the company or its shareholders. TPG
Capital, which had taken Seagate private once before already,
couldn&#8217;t find enough equity partners to finance a takeover after
other leveraged buyout firms lost interest, one person with
knowledge of the matter said at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;LBOs will continue to be hard if not harder in 2011, as
financing is getting more expensive&#8221; said Morgan Stanley&#8217;s
Guevara. His firm and Wilson Sonsini worked for Seagate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Storage Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guevara, who is based in Menlo Park, California, said he
anticipates deals in cloud computing will continue to be strong,
followed by security technology. Most of the potential action in
storage computing already has already taken place, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP, the world&#8217;s biggest personal-computer maker, bought
data-storage company 3Par Inc. for $2.35 billion, after an 18-
day bidding war with Dell Inc. more than tripled the company&#8217;s
share price. In total, HP announced 9 purchases last year,
including the $1.2 billion acquisition of once iconic handset
maker Palm Inc. IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services
provider, announced 16 purchases in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the last few years more data has been created and
stored than in all of human history,&#8221; said Eric Mandl, global
head of software banking at UBS AG in New York. His firm advised
IBM on its $1.7 billion purchase of data-warehousing company
Netezza Corp., and Dell on its $960 million purchase of data-
storage company Compellent Technologies Inc. &#8220;Ultimately the
companies that offer technologies to solve problems associated
with the data explosion will be the winners.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, infringed a patent on technology used to deter
piracy, an appeals court ruled in a decision that may change how
damages are calculated in future cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington today upholds the validity of a patent
owned by Uniloc USA Inc. and Uniloc Singapore Private Ltd.,
while ordering a new trial to reassess the damages Microsoft
should pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a strong validation of the value of the patent,&#8221;
Brad Davis, chief executive officer of Irvine, California-based
Uniloc USA, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The damages issue
is what it is, and we&#8217;ll live with it. We have a sense of how
much we contributed to Microsoft&#8217;s bottom line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling throws out a common tool used to calculate
infringement awards, and will likely reduce the amount Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft will have to pay closely held Uniloc.
The Federal Circuit called for a new trial on damages, saying a
2009 lower-court verdict of $388 million was &#8220;fundamentally
tainted by the use of a legally inadequate methodology.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an important and helpful opinion with respect to
the law of damages, and it may signal the end of unreasonable
and outsized damages awards based on faulty methodology,&#8221; David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said in an e-
mailed statement. &#8220;We look forward to the new trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Smith in Providence, Rhode
Island, had thrown out the 2009 verdict Uniloc won. The company
was appealing Smith&#8217;s decision, while Microsoft was seeking a
court ruling that would limit the ability of patent owners to
seek big damage awards from large technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$19 Billion Chart &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniloc&#8217;s lawsuit, filed in October 2003, targeted
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows XP operating system and some Office
programs. Microsoft argued that it used a different method for
registering software and that the patent was invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit&#8217;s decision to uphold the validity of
the patent may boost Uniloc&#8217;s efforts to collect royalties from
additional companies including Symantec Corp. and Adobe Systems
Inc. Uniloc Singapore owns the patent and Uniloc USA is the
exclusive licensee, Davis said &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Uniloc showed jurors during the 2009 trial a
pie chart with $19 billion in revenue from the Windows XP
operating system and some versions of Word. Uniloc was seeking
2.9 percent of that total, or about $564 million. The jury
awarded $388 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The award was the third-largest jury verdict in 2009 and
the second-biggest patent verdict, behind a $1.67 billion award
that Johnson  Johnson won against Abbott Laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Rule of Thumb&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith ruled that, even if the Federal Circuit decided the
jury verdict on infringement was appropriate, Microsoft would be
entitled to a new trial on the damages because Uniloc shouldn&#8217;t
have been able to use the $19 billion figure in front of jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit said courts shouldn&#8217;t allow damages to
be based on a common calculation that has as a starting point
the &#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; that 25 percent of a product&#8217;s value goes
to the patent owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That method &#8220;fails to tie a reasonable royalty base to the
facts of the case at issue,&#8221; the Federal Circuit ruled.
&#8220;Beginning from a fundamentally flawed premise and adjusting it
based on legitimate considerations specific to the facts of the
case nevertheless results in a fundamentally flawed
conclusion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court also agreed with Microsoft that Uniloc
shouldn&#8217;t have been able to show the chart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skew the Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The disclosure that a company has made $19 billion
dollars in revenue from an infringing product cannot help but
skew the damages horizon for the jury, regardless of the
contribution of the patented component to this revenue,&#8221;
Circuit Judge Richard Linn wrote for the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Uniloc lawyer, Paul Hayes of Mintz Levin in Boston, said
Microsoft would have lost $5 billion in sales were it not for
the piracy-deterrent invented by Uniloc&#8217;s founder. That
estimate, combined with the additional two years of infringement
since the jury verdict, may result in another big award against
Microsoft, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the decision by the Federal Circuit
necessarily means there will be any difference in the amount,
it&#8217;s just the methodology,&#8221; Hayes said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;There are many ways you can figure this out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional Lawsuits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniloc has filed suit over the same patent against software
companies in federal court in Tyler, Texas. Davis said the
company has settled with about 40 companies and has claims
pending against 100 more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision today builds on a 2009 ruling won by Microsoft
in another case that limited the amount technology companies
have to pay when they lose patent trials over features of their
products. In that case, the Federal Circuit ruled that damage
awards have to be linked to the extent the feature is used by
consumers and whether it drives demand for the overall product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Uniloc USA v. Microsoft Corp., 10-1035, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower
court case is Uniloc USA Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 03cv440, U.S.
District Court, District of Rhode Island (Providence). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Hypermarcas SA, Brazil&#8217;s fourth-
largest consumer-goods company by market value, declined the
most in two weeks after JPMorgan Chase  Co. cut its rating on
concern the company may struggle to integrate recent
acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypermarcas fell 3.6 percent, the most since Dec. 20, to
21.40 reais at the close of trading in Sao Paulo at 3:15 p.m.
New York time. The stock advanced 13 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said Dec. 19 it will buy Mantecorp Industria
Quimica  Farmaceutica SA for 600 million reais in cash and the
issuance of 78 million shares to its owners, the Mantegazza
family. That represents 14.2 percent of the total shares
outstanding, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The Mantegazzas
sold some shares in December after the deal and are likely to
unload more in coming months, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is bringing considerable pressure on stock
performance,&#8221; Andrea Teixeira, an analyst at JPMorgan who cut
the rating to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;overweight,&#8221; wrote in a note
to clients today. &#8220;We would not add shares now given the
execution risk of integrating past acquisitions is higher now
that earnings growth depends more on organic expansion and
synergies of past acquisitions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypermarcas&#8217;s profit margins may narrow this year because
of higher marketing costs, Teixeira wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. agreed to pay $14 million
to use closely held Santaris Pharma A/S&#8217;s technology to develop
drugs that target ribonucleic acid, a new avenue of research,
expanding on an earlier accord with Wyeth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santaris may get up to $600 million if certain research

Hoersholm, Denmark-based Santaris said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santaris previously signed a development deal with Wyeth,
which Pfizer bought in 2009. Under the original agreement, Wyeth
made a $10 million investment in Santaris, as well as a $7

&lt;p&gt;Digital Sky Technologies co-Founder
Yuri Milner recruited analysts from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
Morgan Stanley to help him pick investments in startups such as
Facebook Inc. (FB) and Zynga Game Network Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Milner now is working with those securities firms to
line up added funding for the Silicon Valley social-media
companies backed by the 49-year-old Russian. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Sky, which counts Goldman Sachs among its
investors, paired with the New York-based securities firm to buy
a $500 million stake that values Facebook at $50 billion, three
people familiar with the matter said yesterday. Groupon Inc.,
another Digital Sky-backed company, plans to take as much as
$950 million in funding from a group that includes Digital Sky
and Morgan Stanley, also based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;DST&#8217;s investments in Facebook, Groupon and Zynga have done
very well and I think Goldman and others are trying to take
advantage of that,&#8221; said Nick Beim, general partner at Matrix
Partners, a venture capital firm based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flush with more than $2 billion for social-media startups,
Digital Sky has been at the forefront of backing some of Silicon
Valley&#8217;s fastest growing businesses. While banks make their own
inroads to potential investments, support from Digital Sky has
helped boost startup valuations and lure other would-be backers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ve been super-aggressive in getting in some of these
hyper-growth Internet companies,&#8221; said Peter Falvey, a managing
director at Morgan Keegan  Co. in Boston. &#8220;So far, they&#8217;ve
proven to be very savvy. If DST is putting money in a company
now, later more people may want to put money into it as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Goldman Sachs Ties &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was one of the earliest investors in Moscow-based Digital Sky. Many of the analysts hired by Digital Sky
formerly worked at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup
Inc., Milner said in an interview last year. Leonid Solovyev, a
spokesman for Digital Sky, didn&#8217;t respond to a request for
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which invested $450 million in Facebook,
also made an arrangement that lets its clients buy Facebook
equity worth as much as $1.5 billion, said two of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the deal is private.
Digital Sky invested $50 million, boosting an earlier stake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan by Goldman Sachs to offer Facebook equity to
clients may prompt U.S. regulators to inquire whether the social
networking site is circumventing disclosure rules, securities
lawyers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities and Exchange Commission rules require companies
with more than 499 investors to make certain financial
information public. Some companies avoid crossing that threshold
when investors&#8217; funds are channeled through a single entity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;IPO Prospects &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The backing also leaves Goldman Sachs in a prime position
to handle an eventual initial public offering for Palo Alto,
California-based Facebook, said Beim at Matrix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment banks are seeking to cement relationships with
promising growth companies in hopes of doing their IPO and being
a longer term adviser,&#8221; Beim said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry Yu, a spokesman for Facebook, and David Wells, a
spokesman at Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. Erica Platt, a
Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any public share sale may not happen soon. Facebook Chief
Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg may put off an IPO until 2012
so he can focus on expansion, three people familiar with the
matter said last year. The company had about $2 billion in sales
last year, up from $700 million to $800 million in 2009, other
people familiar with the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Sky invested $200 million in Facebook in May 2009
at a valuation of $10 billion. It has since increased its stake
by purchasing common shares, including employee shares in a $100
million offer, according to two people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Risks &#8216;Paying Off&#8217; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At $50 billion, Facebook would exceed the valuation of Web
portal Yahoo! Inc. and online commerce site EBay Inc. The
valuation is 25 times Facebook&#8217;s 2010 revenue, compared with 7
times sales for Google and 4.7 times for Netflix Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital Sky&#8217;s investments extend to other Web properties.
The firm led a $135 million investment in daily-deals site
Groupon last year and was part of a group that bought a $180
million stake in Zynga, a social-gaming service, in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A year ago, people thought these guys were nuts,
investing at a crazy valuation,&#8221; said Tom Taulli, an
independent researcher on IPOs. &#8220;They took some risks, and they
are paying off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s stocks, the worst-performing
among major global equity markets last year, will rise this year
and investors should buy when faster inflation triggers rumors
of further tightening measures, JPMorgan Asset Management said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuations for some Chinese shares, such as those of
developers, &#8220;look extremely cheap,&#8221; said Howard Wang, head of
the Greater China team at the JPMorgan unit, which oversees more
than $1.3 trillion of global assets. Shares in the property
industry group on the Shanghai Composite Index trade at an
average 13 times estimated earnings, compared with 16.4 times on
the Hang Seng Property Index and 21.5 times for companies on the MSCI World/Real Estate Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The good news is that China was an absolute dog last year,
so expectations are set particularly low,&#8221; Wang said at a media
briefing in Hong Kong yesterday. &#8220;We expect MSCI China and H
shares to get positive returns this year.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China&#8217;s two stock exchanges, dropped 14 percent last year, the
worst performer among the 14 biggest world benchmark indexes, as
the government stepped up its fight against inflation. Banks&#8217;
reserve ratio requirements were increased six times in 2010 and interest rates were raised twice as price gains accelerated to
5.1 percent in November, a 28-month high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Lousy Friday Selloffs&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When noise is at its highest we&#8217;d want to invest on those
days, those lousy Friday selloffs,&#8221; Wang said, referring to
speculation of policy measures that precedes official data
releases. &#8220;We&#8217;ll wait for that day when rumors go around about
CPI reaching 6.5 percent, and we&#8217;ll go buy that day. That&#8217;s how
we operate on a conceptual basis -- buy when there&#8217;s bad news on
inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; China&#8217;s December home prices rose the most in at least six
months, SouFun Holdings Ltd., the nation&#8217;s biggest real estate-
website owner, said Jan. 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are always big opportunities in China&#8217;s property
space,&#8221; Wang said. &#8220;Overseas investors love buying Chinese
properties. They always look for excuses to buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang said he expects to see &#8220;considerable&#8221; gains in
inflation in the second quarter, with China&#8217;s consumer price
index increasing at a rate of about 5 percent to 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang said he also favors China&#8217;s consumer, alternative-
energy and health-care industries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Valuation of stocks traded on the Shanghai gauge was at
13.5 times estimated profit at the close of trade yesterday.
Those of the MSCI China Index traded at 12.2 times while the
Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of so-called H shares of
Chinese companies traded at 11.2 times. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. said the next version
of its Windows personal-computer operating system will run on ARM Holdings Plc&#8217;s chip technology for the first time, marking a
deeper push into the market for tablet computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows will work with ARM-based chips made by Nvidia
Corp., Qualcomm Inc. and Texas Instruments Inc., Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft said today at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The new operating system is
designed for smaller, thinner devices with longer battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is playing catch-up to Apple Inc. in the market
for devices that are larger than smartphones yet less powerful
than laptops, and it&#8217;s facing pressure from Google Inc., also
making a foray into tablets. The system marks a shift in
Microsoft&#8217;s alliance with semiconductor maker Intel Corp., which
has also struggled in the area of tablets and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;ARM chips are very friendly towards mobile devices and
they&#8217;re available now,&#8221; said Katherine Egbert, an analyst at
Jefferies  Co. in San Francisco. &#8220;Intel is clearly working on
lower power chips, but it&#8217;s one thing to get the processor out
of manufacturing. Then you have to build the software code.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Windows President Steven Sinofsky previewed the
new software running on chips at a press conference at the show.
He also showed Office software running on the chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tailored for Mobile &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows software will be tailored for battery-powered
devices, such as tablets, netbooks and other handhelds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft declined to comment on timing for the release
other than to say the company is sticking with its previous
timeline for a new Windows every two to three years. The last
version went on sale in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sooner Microsoft can introduce the software, the better
chance it has to prevent Apple and Google from amassing an
insurmountable lead. Getting the new system into devices in time
for Christmas 2011 would be sooner than many analysts have
projected, said Egbert, who rates Microsoft a &#8220;buy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software will also work with Intel and Advanced Micro
Devices Inc. chips, as have previous versions of Windows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM chips are used in most smartphones, as well as Apple&#8217;s
best-selling iPad tablet, which was introduced last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other versions of Microsoft programs aimed at phones
and mobile devices already work on ARM chips, this is the first
time the software maker will produce a full version of Windows
available on that technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel is trying to make its own forays into tablets and
smartphones, squaring off against ARM&#8217;s technology. ARM, based
in Cambridge, England, sells the rights to use its patents and
chip designs and doesn&#8217;t manufacture the electronic components. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple sold 7.46 million iPads from the product&#8217;s April
debut through September. The device accounted for 95 percent of
the tablet market last quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy options
&#8220;straddles&#8221; on Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. because
the Detroit auto show may be a bigger catalyst for stock moves
than it has in the past, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists John Marshall and Maria Grant recommended buying Ford&#8217;s February $17 straddles and GM&#8217;s
February $38 straddles. A straddle involves the purchase of a
call and put with the same strike price and expiration and is a
bet that the stock&#8217;s volatility will rise. Calls give the right
to buy a security and puts give the right to sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North American International Auto Show, which runs Jan.
10 to Jan. 23, will be Detroit-based GM&#8217;s first since its
November initial public offering and the first under Chief
Executive Officer Dan Akerson. Ford, of Dearborn, Michigan, will
show new hybrid and electric cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This year&#8217;s auto show is likely to be more important than
most given that the significant investor focus on a continued
recovery in the U.S. auto industry after historically depressed
auto sales,&#8221; the New York-based strategists wrote in a report
to clients today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Performance &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford rose 2.9 percent to $17.89 today, the highest price
since May 2002. GM gained 0.5 percent to $38.07, the highest
price since the IPO. Ford&#8217;s straddle profits if the shares are
below $15.35 or above $18.65 at expiration on Feb. 18, while the
GM trade profits outside of a range of $34.45 to $41.55, the
strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors who bought Ford straddles before the auto show
and the company&#8217;s quarterly reports in January during the past
11 years and held the positions for two weeks achieved a return
of 12 percent on average, Goldman said. Ford is expected to
report its earnings this month, according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ford gained 10 percent in the last two months, while GM&#8217;s
shares rose 15 percent since its IPO. The automakers may extend
gains after they make presentations to analysts on Jan. 11
because they are likely to give &#8220;bullish commentary,&#8221; the
strategists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With shares up sharply in the past two months, we expect
the next few weeks to be more volatile than normal,&#8221; Marshall
and Grant wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 30 new products will be shown for the first time
at the auto show, the largest annually in the U.S., according to
its website. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Google Inc. won a temporary court
order halting the award of a $49.3 million contract favoring Microsoft Corp. for an e-mail system serving the U.S. Interior
Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Washington stopped the U.S. from
proceeding with a Microsoft system for the department&#8217;s 88,000
employees in an order unsealed yesterday. U.S. Court of Federal
Claims Judge Susan Braden the cited deficiencies in the
procurement process in her order freezing award of the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, and Onix
Networking Corp., a licensed Google seller, sued the Interior
Department in October, claiming the department didn&#8217;t provide a
&#8220;full and open&#8221; competition for the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Without a preliminary injunction, the award will put into
motion the final migration of Interior&#8217;s e-mail system, achieve
&#8217;organizational lock-in&#8217; for Microsoft, and cost Google the
opportunity to compete,&#8221; the judge wrote in a 27-page decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Braden said she was informed that the department intended
to award the contract on Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its Oct. 29 complaint, Google said the bid request put
out by Interior &#8220;specified that only the Microsoft Business
Productivity Online Suite-Federal could be proposed,&#8221; making it
impossible for the company to compete for the work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a proponent of open competition on the Internet and in
the technology sector in general, we&#8217;re pleased with the court&#8217;s
decision,&#8221; Google said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Evans, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft, didn&#8217;t immediately respond to requests for comment on
the decision. The U.S. Justice Department also didn&#8217;t respond
immediately to an e-mail seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Blackstone Group LP, Dinamia Capital
Privado SCR SA, and N+1 Private Equity hired banks to arrange
more than 630 million euros ($830 million) of leveraged debt to
fund the buyout of Spanish food-can maker Mivisa Group,
according to two people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors agreed to buy Murcia-based Mivisa from CVC
Capital Partners Ltd., Dinamia said on its website. The deal
values Mivisa at about 900 million euros, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the deal is private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Barclays Capital, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Morgan Stanley are arranging the leveraged financing
package, which may include a 440 million-euro term loan
targeting non-bank lenders, with interest of 500 basis points
more than the euro interbank offered rate and a Euribor floor of
1.75 percent, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natasha Baxter, a spokesman for Blackstone in London,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CVC bought Mivisa in March 2005. The company had 499
million euros of sales in 2008, according to CVC&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ING Groep NV and Societe Generale SA in 2007 arranged 662
million euros of leveraged loans paying an interest margin of
between 200 basis points and 400 basis points to refinance
Mivisa&#8217;s debt and pay a dividend to CVC, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey offered dollar-denominated
bonds maturing in 2041, taking advantage of a drop in borrowing
costs to finance budget spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury in Ankara hired JPMorgan Chase  Co., Deutsche
Bank AG and Barclays Capital to sell the bonds, according to a
statement on its website today which didn&#8217;t specify how much
debt is on offer. They may be priced to yield about 6.15
percent, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.
A November sale of euro-denominated bonds saw yields drop to a
record low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey is borrowing at lower costs than many European
countries because its debt load is decreasing and its banks are
healthy, Deputy Prime Minister Ali Babacan said at a conference
in Ankara today. The country&#8217;s economy probably grew more than 8
percent last year, according to International Monetary Fund
forecasts, and the budget deficit is narrowing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government has planned for about 12.5 billion liras
($8.1 billion) in foreign borrowing this year, including
payments from international lenders such as the World Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury began to raise money to finance this year&#8217;s
budget when it sold 500 million euros ($662 million) of 10-year
euro-denominated bonds on Nov. 12. The yield of 4.25 percent was
the lowest ever for a sale in that currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turkey sold $2 billion of 30-year dollar bonds a year ago
at 6.85 percent, and those securities are currently trading to
yield about 6 percent. Borrowing costs on local markets have
also plunged, with yields on benchmark two-year lira debt
falling to a record low of 6.79 percent earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Debt Burden Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Turkey cut its budget deficit to 4 percent of gross
domestic product last year from 5.5 percent in 2009, according
to government projections, and is targeting a gap of 2.8 percent
this year. The ratio of debt to GDP is forecast to fall to 40.6
percent this year from 42.3 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fitch Ratings on Nov. 24 revised the outlook on Turkey&#8217;s
BB+ local and foreign-currency bond rating to positive from
stable, citing a strong economic recovery and improving public
finances. The Fitch rating is one step below investment grade.
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service also raised the outlook on Turkey&#8217;s
Ba2 rating, two levels below investment, to positive from stable
on Oct. 5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc. Chief Executive
Officer Vikram Pandit and Pramit Jhaveri, head of the bank&#8217;s
Indian unit, were cleared by local police of involvement in an
alleged $66 million fraud at its branch in Gurgaon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup employee Shivraj Puri was taken into custody as
part of an investigation into complaints that he forged
documents to lure investors, S.S. Deswal, commissioner of police
in Gurgaon near New Delhi, told reporters yesterday. The alleged
fraud was confined to Citigroup&#8217;s Gurgaon office and involved 3
billion rupees ($66 million) that was invested over 15 months,
Deswal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Citigroup executives were accused by Helion Advisors
Pvt. Managing Director Sanjeev Aggarwal of conspiring with Puri
to defraud him of 324.3 million rupees, according to an e-mailed
statement yesterday. The New York-based bank last week filed a
police complaint accusing Puri of promising &#8220;extraordinary high interest rates&#8221; to lure clients and siphoning funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Citi identified the fraud and immediately reported the
matter to the regulators and law enforcement agencies,&#8221; Debasis
Ghosh, a spokesman for Citigroup in Mumbai, said in an e-mail.
Aggarwal&#8217;s &#8220;claims against senior executives are completely
without basis and we intend to contest them vigorously.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Citi will continue to work with the authorities on this
investigation,&#8221; Ghosh said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggarwal didn&#8217;t return two calls to his mobile phone and
one to his office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PharmAthene Funded Siga Drug Trial, Official Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PharmAthene Inc. provided funding to Siga Technologies Inc.
to conduct a human safety trial of a drug designed to fight
smallpox outbreaks linked to terrorist attacks, a PharmAthene
official testified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siga was persuaded by PharmAthene to conduct the first
phase of human safety trials for its smallpox antiviral ST-246
without funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health in
order to get human data on the product faster, Valerie Riddle,
PharmAthene&#8217;s senior vice president and medical director,
testified yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;PharmAthene provided the funding to Siga,&#8221; Riddle said
during the second day of a trial in PharmAthene&#8217;s lawsuit
against Siga over a licensing agreement for the smallpox
medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PharmAthene, based in Annapolis, Maryland, sued New York-
based Siga in 2006, asking a judge to affirm the purported
licensing agreement for the drug, which has gotten the attention
of U.S. officials seeking ways to counter potential biological
terror attacks. Siga contends there is no license and the
company isn&#8217;t legally bound by documents prepared for a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riddle testified that PharmAthene also helped Siga prepare
for a site meeting for a contract proposal that it submitted to
the NIH. In addition, PharmAthene advised Siga on applying for a
drug designation that provides for tax credits and marketing
incentives, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Working toward developing 246 was the goal regardless of
the business arrangement,&#8221; Riddle said. &#8220;I always thought we
would get 246 either under a merger agreement or under a license
arrangement.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former PharmAthene Chief Executive Officer David Wright
testified Jan. 3 that Siga officials &#8220;guaranteed&#8221; the two
companies would either merge or that Siga would license the drug
to PharmAthene. He also acknowledged that Siga paid off a $3
million loan that helped fund the drug&#8217;s development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is PharmAthene Inc. v. Siga Technologies Inc.,
CA2627, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Agrees to Delay of Allen Stanford Fraud Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors agreed to postpone the scheduled Jan. 24
criminal trial of financier R. Allen Stanford, who is accused of
leading a $7 billion investment fraud scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said in papers filed with U.S. District Judge
David Hittner in Houston Jan. 3 that while they didn&#8217;t oppose a
defense request to put off the trial, they disagreed on the
duration of any delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The requested continuance of two years is excessive,&#8221;
Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg Costa said in the filing.
Stanford&#8217;s lawyers, who took over his defense in October, say
they need time to prepare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 60, was indicted in 2009 for allegedly
masterminding a securities fraud scheme centered on the sale of
certificates of deposit by his Antigua-based Stanford
International Bank Ltd. He has denied the charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation of his defense has been hampered by changes of
counsel. Stanford fired Houston attorneys Dick DeGuerin and Kent
Schaffer over what both lawyers called personality and strategic
conflicts. He lost the ability to pay lawyer Robert Bennett
after a court said Lloyd&#8217;s of London underwriters didn&#8217;t have to
honor a directors&#8217;-and-officers&#8217; insurance policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford is now represented by court-appointed defense
lawyers, Ali Fazel and Robert Scardino. They have told the court
that their client may be psychologically unfit to stand trial
and have asked for a hearing to assess his competency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hittner is slated to hear arguments on the postponement
tomorrow. Scardino said in a telephone interview that the judge
will consider the length of the delay and hear arguments on
Stanford&#8217;s fitness for trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09cr342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Primary Global Insider Suspects Maintain Bail After Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former sales manager and two ex-consultants for expert-
networking firm Primary Global Research LLC were released on
bail after a hearing before a New York federal judge as part of
their prosecution in a nationwide probe of hedge fund insider
trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Fleishman, 41, a salesman at Primary Global,
consultants Walter Shimoon, 39, formerly of Flextronics
International Ltd., a Singapore-based maker of electronic
components, and Mark Anthony Longoria, 44, formerly with
chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc., made their initial
appearances yesterday in Manhattan after having their cases
transferred from California and Texas, said Ellen Davis, a
spokeswoman for the Justice Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors alleged that the defendants, who haven&#8217;t
entered formal pleas, were part of a &#8220;corrupt network of
insiders&#8221; at leading technology companies who also served as
consultants at expert-networking firms and are accused of
peddling inside information to hedge funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three men were charged Dec. 16 along with another man
in complaints filed by Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara.
Magistrate Judge James Francis, who presided over yesterday&#8217;s
hearing, agreed to continue all the defendants on the same bond
conditions directed by judges last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimoon was released on $150,000 bond secured by $15,000 in
cash, Longoria was continued free on a $50,000 bond and
Fleishman had his $700,000 bond secured by $50,000 in cash and
his home in Santa Clara, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for all three men declined comment after court.
Henry Mazurek, a lawyer for Shimoon, Fleishman&#8217;s lawyer, Ethan
Balogh, and Jonathan Marks, a lawyer for Longoria, all declined
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four defendants were charged with fraud and conspiracy
and face as long as 20 years in prison on the most serious
count, said Edeli Rivera, a spokeswoman for Bharara&#8217;s office. A
fifth man, Daniel DeVore, a former supply manager at Dell Inc.,
pleaded guilty Dec. 10 to conspiracy to commit securities fraud
and wire fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Shimoon, 10-mj-2823, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Madoff Aide Bongiorno Transferred to New York Jail &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annette Bongiorno, who is accused of helping her former
boss, Bernard L. Madoff, run a multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme,
has been moved to a Manhattan jail as she tries to win her
release from U.S. custody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bongiorno, 62, is being held at the Metropolitan
Correctional Center in Lower Manhattan, according to the Bureau
of Prisons&#8217; website. After surrendering to a lockup in Florida
last month, Bongiorno is now in the New York jail as her
attorneys seek to win her freedom by persuading a judge to set
her bail at $2.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former Madoff aide made her request for bail yesterday
while another ex-Madoff worker, Daniel Bonventre, asked a judge
to dismiss criminal charges against him. Bonventre said in court
papers that prosecutors are interfering with his constitutional
right to counsel by threatening to seize his assets -- including
funds paid to his attorney&#8217;s escrow account -- because he
wouldn&#8217;t cooperate with the government in its investigation of
Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors&#8217; &#8220;overriding objective&#8221; is &#8220;to pressure Mr.
Madoff&#8217;s former employees to help the government build a case
against one or more of the people closest to Mr. Madoff and the
principal benefactors of his fraud: longstanding friends who
invested extraordinary sums with him, as well as family members
who worked with him at BLMIS, including his wife, brother,
niece, nephew and two sons,&#8221; Bonventre&#8217;s lawyer, Andrew Frisch,
wrote in a court filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bongiorno is arguing for reduced bail of $2.5 million
because prosecutors last week began seizing bank accounts
belonging to her and her husband. She oversaw about 200 accounts
at Madoff Securities, where she worked with Bonventre and others
charged with aiding Madoff&#8217;s fraud. They deny wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. O&#8217;Hara, 10-cr-00228, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Wins Global Asset Freeze Against Mining Firm Sinaloa Gold &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Britain&#8217;s financial regulator won a court order freezing
890,000 pounds ($1.39 million) held by Sinaloa Gold Plc, a
London-based mining company accused of violations related to the
sale of its shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worldwide freezing order, initially secured by the
Financial Services Authority on Dec. 17, was extended until Jan.
13 by Justice David Richards at the High Court in London last
week. The watchdog said at the hearing that it is seeking to
recover money paid to Sinaloa for its shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which explores for gold in Sinaloa, Mexico,
was incorporated in May and was listed in Frankfurt last month,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA complaint also names one of Sinaloa&#8217;s directors,
Glen Lawrence Hoover, as well as a Frankfurt-based company
called PH Capital Invest, which the FSA in October added to its
list of firms that aren&#8217;t authorized to carry out regulated
activities in the U.K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinaloa&#8217;s lawyer, David Orchard of the firm Stanwyck  Bond
in London, declined to comment after the Jan. 3 hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court documents that include the FSA&#8217;s allegations in the
case aren&#8217;t yet public. Joseph Eyre, a spokesman for the
regulator, said the case doesn&#8217;t involve market manipulation and
declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoover didn&#8217;t return a message left at Sinaloa&#8217;s London
office last week and calls to the number yesterday weren&#8217;t
answered. A call to the company&#8217;s U.S. office in Layton, Utah,
after the hearing last week wasn&#8217;t returned. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China Gas Executives Held for Suspected Embezzlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; China Gas Holdings Ltd., the energy supplier to mainland
homes and businesses, said two board members have been detained
by the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau since Dec. 18
for suspected embezzlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liu Ming Hui and Huang Yong have been held for
investigation for suspected &#8220;embezzlement of the assets of an
organization in which they have duties,&#8221; China Gas said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Gas has conducted an internal review that found &#8220;no
indication of any irregularities involving recent material
movement of cash or funds,&#8221; according to the statement. The gas
supplier, whose shares in Hong Kong were suspended on Dec. 20,
has ordered an independent review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The incident won&#8217;t affect the company&#8217;s day-to-day gas
business, but investors will worry about its corporate
governance and this will affect its image,&#8221; Yuk-kai Lee, an
analyst at Core Pacific-Yamaichi International, said by
telephone from Hong Kong. &#8220;Its shares will be under heavy
selling pressure in the short term.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DeVry Directors Face Lawsuit Over Recruitment Tactics &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DeVry Inc. shareholder sued 14 of the for-profit
education company&#8217;s officers and directors alleging their
failure to properly oversee the schools&#8217; recruitment and
financial aid policies injured the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder Timothy Hald, in a lawsuit filed Jan. 3 in
Illinois state court in Chicago, claims bad recruiting practices
at DeVry schools have left students debt ridden and without
prospects for employment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The improper recruiting tactics allowed DeVry to grow
rapidly, but now threaten the company&#8217;s future profitability and
survival,&#8221; Hald said. He is seeking a court order for the
directors to reform DeVry&#8217;s governance and pay restitution to
the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For-profit education companies including DeVry, Washington
Post Co.&#8217;s Kaplan Inc. and Apollo Group Inc.&#8217;s Phoenix
University have been criticized for their rising student loan
default rates by federal legislators and the non-profit
Education Trust research center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Washington-based Education Trust, in a November report,
said only one in five for-profit college students earns a
bachelor&#8217;s degree within six years and most graduate with
&#8220;enormous debt.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeVry Inc., based in the Chicago suburb of Downers Grove,
operates its namesake university and Carrington College, the
Keller Graduate School of Management and Chamberlain College of
Nursing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman Harold T. Shapiro and Chief Executive Officer
Daniel Hamburger are among the officers and directors named as
defendants in the lawsuit. Joan Bates, a company spokeswoman,
didn&#8217;t immediately respond to voice-mail and e-mail messages
seeking comment after regular business hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Hald v. Hamburger, 11CH00087, Cook County,
Illinois, Circuit Court, Chancery Division (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Loses Appeal in $388 Million Uniloc Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest software maker,
infringed a patent on technology used to deter piracy owned by
Uniloc USA Inc. and Uniloc Singapore Private Ltd., an appeals
court said. A new trial on damages was ordered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in
Washington yesterday called for a new trial on the amount
Microsoft should pay Uniloc, saying a lower-court verdict of
$388 million in damages was &#8220;fundamentally tainted by the use
of a legally inadequate methodology.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a strong validation of the value of the patent,&#8221;
Brad Davis, chief executive officer of Irvine, California-based
Uniloc USA, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The damages issue
is what it is, and we&#8217;ll live with it. We have a sense of how
much we contributed to Microsoft&#8217;s bottom line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Smith in Providence, Rhode
Island, had thrown out a 2009 verdict Uniloc won. The company
was appealing Smith&#8217;s decision, while Microsoft was seeking a
court ruling that would limit the ability of patent owners to
seek big damage awards from large technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniloc&#8217;s suit, filed in October 2003, targeted Microsoft&#8217;s
Windows XP operating system and some Office programs. Microsoft,
based in Redmond, Washington, argued that it used a different
method for registering software and that the patent was invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for closely held Uniloc showed jurors at trial a
pie chart with $19.1 billion in revenue from the Windows XP
operating system and some versions of Word. They were seeking
2.9 percent of that total, or about $564 million. The jury
awarded Uniloc $388 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel&#8217;s award was the third-largest jury verdict in
2009 and the second-biggest patent verdict, behind a $1.67
billion award against Abbott Laboratories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Uniloc USA v. Microsoft Corp., 10-1035, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower
court case is Uniloc USA Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 03cv440, U.S.
District Court, District of Rhode Island (Providence). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul Weiss Partner May Sue Ex-Wife Over Madoff Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A New York law firm partner who said he paid his ex-wife
$2.7 million of the purported value of his account with Bernard
Madoff can sue her to revise their 2006 agreement because of the
Ponzi scheme, an appeals court ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s decision overturns a lower-court ruling
dismissing the suit by Steven Simkin, chairman of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison LLP&#8217;s real estate department. Simkin
sued his former wife, Laura Blank, in state court in Manhattan
in February 2009 after Madoff&#8217;s fraud became public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state&#8217;s Appellate Division, First Department,
reinstated the complaint, citing the doctrines of &#8220;mutual
mistake&#8221; and &#8220;unjust enrichment.&#8221; Two of the five justices
dissented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Even though there is an express contract between the
parties, it is unclear whether it covers the current dispute;
therefore, plaintiff may plead unjust enrichment,&#8221; the court&#8217;s
majority said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision also made a distinction between a mistake in
valuation and Simkin&#8217;s theory of &#8220;mutual mistake&#8221; as to the
existence of the account itself because of Madoff&#8217;s scheme. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simkin said he and his ex-wife believed they owned an
account with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, which
was their largest asset, according to the decision. Of the $6.6
million that Simkin paid Blank under their 2006 agreement, he
said $2.7 million was attributable to her share of a Madoff
account valued at $5.4 million. He&#8217;s seeking restitution from
her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blank&#8217;s lawyer, Richard Emery of Emery Celli Brinckerhoff 
Abady LLP in New York, called yesterday&#8217;s decision &#8220;completely
erroneous&#8221; and vowed to take the case to the New York state
Court of Appeals, the state&#8217;s highest court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Of course, we have sympathy for Simkin&#8217;s loss, but it
doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody he did business with should have
their money clawed back just because he paid them believing he
had more money than he did,&#8221; Emery said in a phone interview.
&#8220;Is every divorce agreement to be revisited when values change
in the future?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simkin and his attorney, Mark Alcott, of counsel to Paul
Weiss, didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Simkin v. Blank, 101501/2009, New York State
Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hermes Buyout Defense Ruling Unlikely This Week, Activist Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A request by the founding family of Hermes International
SCA to set up a defense against a possible takeover by LVMH Moet
Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA without having to bid for the rest of
Hermes won&#8217;t be decided on this week, a French shareholder-
activist group said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France&#8217;s financial markets regulator isn&#8217;t likely to decide
at a Jan. 6 meeting whether the family can set up a holding
company controlling more than half of Hermes&#8217;s equity without
making a public offer for all shares, Colette Neuville, the head
of Minority Shareholder Defense Association, said yesterday
after sending a letter urging the AMF not to allow the plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It would shock me&#8221; if the Autorite des Marches
Financiers reached a decision this week, Neuville said in a
telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s not ripe. There are many, many
questions&#8221; to be addressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Members of the family proposed forming a holding company
after LVMH, the world&#8217;s largest luxury goods maker, announced in
October it had acquired a 17.1 percent stake via equity swaps.
LVMH said on Dec. 21 it increased its stake to at least 20
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defensive move would establish that the family, who own
more than 70 percent of the scarf and bag maker, is acting in
concert and gives them a right of first refusal on the sale of
any shares held directly by other family members. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That should trigger AMF rules requiring the family bid for
the rest of the shares, Neuville said in her third letter to the
AMF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hermes spokeswoman Christel Denef said she had no
information on the matter. An AMF spokeswoman declined to
comment on the meeting of the 16-member board. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, infringed a patent on technology used to deter
piracy, an appeals court ruled in a decision that may change how
damages are calculated in future cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit in Washington yesterday upholds the validity of a patent
owned by Uniloc USA Inc. and Uniloc Singapore Private Ltd.,
while ordering a new trial to reassess the damages Microsoft
should pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a strong validation of the value of the patent,&#8221;
Brad Davis,  chief executive officer of Irvine, California-based
Uniloc USA, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;The damages issue
is what it is, and we&#8217;ll live with it. We have a sense of how
much we contributed to Microsoft&#8217;s bottom line.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling throws out a common tool used to calculate
infringement awards, and will likely reduce the amount Redmond,
Washington-based Microsoft will have to pay closely held Uniloc.
The Federal Circuit called for a new trial on damages, saying a
2009 lower-court verdict of $388 million was &#8220;fundamentally
tainted by the use of a legally inadequate methodology.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is an important and helpful opinion with respect to
the law of damages, and it may signal the end of unreasonable
and outsized damages awards based on faulty methodology,&#8221; David Howard, deputy general counsel for Microsoft, said in an e-
mailed statement. &#8220;We look forward to the new trial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Smith in Providence, Rhode
Island, had thrown out the 2009 verdict Uniloc won. The company
was appealing Smith&#8217;s decision, while Microsoft was seeking a
court ruling that would limit the ability of patent owners to
seek big damage awards from large technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uniloc&#8217;s lawsuit, filed in October 2003, targeted
Microsoft&#8217;s Windows XP operating system and some Office
programs. Microsoft argued that it used a different method for
registering software and that the patent was invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit&#8217;s decision to uphold the validity of
the patent may boost Uniloc&#8217;s efforts to collect royalties from
additional companies including Symantec Corp. and Adobe Systems
Inc. Uniloc Singapore owns the patent and Uniloc USA is the
exclusive licensee, Davis said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Uniloc showed jurors during the 2009 trial a
pie chart with $19 billion in revenue from the Windows XP
operating system and some versions of Word. Uniloc was seeking
2.9 percent of that total, or about $564 million. The jury
awarded $388 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smith ruled that, even if the Federal Circuit decided the
jury verdict on infringement was appropriate, Microsoft would be
entitled to a new trial on the damages because Uniloc shouldn&#8217;t
have been able to use the $19 billion figure in front of jurors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Circuit said courts shouldn&#8217;t allow damages to
be based on a common calculation that has as a starting point
the &#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; that 25 percent of a product&#8217;s value goes
to the patent owner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That method &#8220;fails to tie a reasonable royalty base to the
facts of the case at issue,&#8221; the Federal Circuit ruled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Uniloc USA v. Microsoft Corp., 10-1035, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower
court case is Uniloc USA Inc. v. Microsoft Corp., 03cv440, U.S.
District Court, District of Rhode Island (Providence). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; India Rejects Patent Application for Abbott&#8217;s Kaletra &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Abbott Laboratories was refused patent protection on its
AIDS drug Kaletra by India&#8217;s patent office, allowing Cipla Ltd.
and other generic-drug companies to continue selling copies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steps involved in making Kaletra &#8220;do not constitute an
invention,&#8221; the agency&#8217;s Mumbai office said in documents dated
Dec. 30. The patent application by Abbott Park, Illinois-based
Abbott was challenged by the Initiative for Medicines, Access 
Knowledge, as well as Cipla and Matrix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott is reviewing the patent decision and determining its
next steps, spokesman Scott Stoffel said yesterday. Newer
versions of the drug don&#8217;t require refrigeration and needn&#8217;t be
taken with food, making them better suited for patients in
developing countries, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaletra, a combination of two antivirals, is in the class
of drugs known as protease inhibitors, which block viral
replication by inhibiting an enzyme essential for reproduction
of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s a preferred second-line treatments to fight drug-
resistant AIDS, according to the World Health Organization,
which recommends governments include it on their list of
essential treatments for the disease caused by the human immune
deficiency virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The product generated about $1.37 billion in sales in 2009,
making it Abbott&#8217;s second-best seller after the arthritis drug
Humira. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Website Operator Issues Challenge to &#8216;Hon&#8217; Trademark Owner &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Baltimore restaurateur&#8217;s registration of &#8220;hon&#8221; as a
trademark faces a challenge from the operator of the &#8220;Welcome
to Baltimore, Hon!&#8221; website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruce Goldfarb posted the &#8220;Hon Manifesto&#8221; on his site,
taking exception to Denise Whiting&#8217;s registration of the term
for use with her Cafe Hon and annual Honfest celebration of all
things Baltimorean. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, Baltimoreans became aware that White had
registered the mark and said publicly that she would enforce it.
&#8220;Hon&#8221; is a term of endearment frequently used in Baltimore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his manifesto, Goldfarb said Whiting&#8217;s claim to
exclusive commercial rights to the term &#8220;unreasonably inhibits
speech and restrains business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;near universal surprise to the news&#8221; that Whiting
had registered &#8220;hon&#8221; as a trademark &#8220;speaks loudly to the
absence of lineage between the word and Whiting or any of her
business interests,&#8221; Goldfarb wrote. &#8220;Hon has zero brand
identity.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he plans to set up an online shop to sell t-shirts,
mugs, stickers and other Baltimore-related items in connection
with his &#8220;Welcome to Baltimore, Hon!&#8221; website and invited
Whiting to try to enforce the trademark against him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whiting didn&#8217;t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment. She had no comment on Goldfarb&#8217;s challenge, the
Baltimore Sun reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chicago Alderman Candidate Sued for Copyright Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Chicago photographer sued a political candidate for
copyright infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proco Moreno is running for re-election as alderman for
Chicago&#8217;s First Ward. Photographer Mark Joseph Whaley is suing
over the unauthorized use of his photo of Moreno&#8217;s opponent,
Deborah Lopez, in what the complaint refers to as the &#8220;Moreno
Negative Flyer.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flyer was distributed the day before the deadline for
filing petitions with the Chicago Election Board and alleged
unethical conduct by Lopez related to her job with the Chicago
Transit Authority, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lopez received an exoneration letter from the transit
authority on Dec. 23, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whaley -- who  uses the pseudonym Mark Joseph --accused
Moreno of being behind the negative flyer, saying the candidate
&#8220;at all relevant times stood to benefit directly and to the
greatest extent from the creation and distribution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of the photo without Whaley&#8217;s consent caused the
photographer &#8220;irreparable damage,&#8221; he said in his pleadings.
He asked the court to bar further use of the photo, and for
awards of money damages and any profits Moreno derived from his
alleged acts of infringement, in addition to attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Moreno campaign didn&#8217;t immediately return an emailed
request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whaley is represented by William F. Zieske of Zieske Law of Chicago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Mark Joseph Whaley v. Proco Moreno, 1:11-cv-
00024, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois
(Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult-Film Maker Sues 109 Defendants for Infringement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious Bidness LLC, a Las Vegas-based maker of adult
films, sued 109 unidentified defendants for copyright
infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Jan. 2 in Dallas, the
defendants infringed the copyright for Serious Bidness&#8217;s film
&#8220;Kayla Kleevage&#8221; by downloading and sharing the content
through the use of BitTorrent technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The distribution of even one single unauthorized digital
copy of the film &#8220;can result in worldwide distribution of that
single copy to a limitless number of people in a matter of
hours,&#8221; Serious Bidness said in its court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, a federal judge in West Virginia told Axel
Braun Productions it had to sue defendants one-by-one in a case
alleging infringing of its &#8220;Batman XXX: A Porn Parody.&#8221; Braun
sued more than 7,000 unidentified defendants in that court in
October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serious Bidness asked the court for orders barring future
infringement of the copyrights of &#8220;Kayla Kleevage&#8221; and any of
its other films, together with awards of money damages, attorney
fees and litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Serious Bidness LLC v. Does 1-109, 3:11-cv-
00002-K, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas
(Dallas). The earlier case brought by Axel Braun is Axel Braun
Productions v. Does 1-7098, 3:10-cv-00112-JPB, U.S. District
Court, Northern District of West Virginia (Martinsburg). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By David McLaughlin" date="Jan 06, 2011  6:04 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/jpmorgan-gmac-urge-new-jersey-court-not-to-suspend-home-foreclosures.html"><headline>JPMorgan, GMAC Urge New Jersey Court Not to Suspend Home Foreclosures</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase
 Co. and other U.S. banks told a New Jersey court that defects
in their processes for seizing homes in the state can be
remedied without halting foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks have taken steps to improve their procedures,
making a suspension unnecessary, they said in documents filed
yesterday in state court in Trenton, New Jersey, and made public
today. The filings came in response to a proposal to freeze
foreclosures in the state by six U.S. banks while their
procedures are reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; practices came under scrutiny after bank
employees signed court documents in foreclosure cases without
verifying their accuracy, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bank of America fully appreciates the court&#8217;s concerns
and looks forward to working with the court to address them,&#8221;
the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said. &#8220;The court
should not take the steps outlined in the order because they are
unnecessary and will cause a wholesale delay in administering
foreclosure cases that is not in the public interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Mary Jacobson scheduled a Jan. 19 hearing to consider
suspending uncontested foreclosure cases and staying foreclosure
sales by the banks: Ally Financial Inc., Bank of America,
JPMorgan, Wells Fargo  Co., Citigroup Inc. and OneWest Bank,
according to a Dec. 20 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Protect Integrity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move &#8220;is necessary to protect the integrity of the
judicial foreclosure process in New Jersey and to assure the
public that the process going forward will be reliable,&#8221;
Jacobson said in the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Newark, New Jersey, law firm Greenberg Dauber Epstein 
Tucker was appointed to respond to the arguments made by the
banks and to present arguments supporting the foreclosure
suspension. Thomas Slocum, an attorney at the firm, couldn&#8217;t be
reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey actions add to the legal challenges banks
are facing across the country. The 50 state attorneys general
are investigating foreclosure practices by banks and mortgage
servicers, while homeowners in several states have filed
potential class-action lawsuits against the companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another 24 banks and mortgage companies also are under
scrutiny in New Jersey. Those companies, including government-
owned Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, must &#8220;demonstrate
affirmatively that there are no irregularities in their handling
of foreclosure proceedings,&#8221; Judge Glenn Grant said in a
separate Dec. 20 order. Foreclosures by those companies may be
suspended after they make submissions to a special master,
according to the order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reformed Procedures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks said in their court filings that they have
reformed their procedures for preparing foreclosure documents
and imposed new safeguards to avoid defective paperwork. They
said they will submit revised documents in foreclosure cases
when necessary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With such oversight in place, Chase submits that there is
no need to impose a stay of proceedings pending a review of past
practices,&#8221; New York-based JPMorgan said. &#8220;To date, Chase has
not identified or become aware of any systemic deficiencies in
its processes that caused it to pursue foreclosure actions
without merit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, also based in New York, said a review of its New
Jersey foreclosure cases found that affidavits in 210 cases need
to be corrected. Those cases, and any others that require
corrected paperwork, will be dismissed and refiled using
&#8220;enhanced foreclosure documentation procedures,&#8221; the bank
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo, based in San Francisco, argued that suspending
foreclosures and appointing a special master to review
foreclosure procedures would violate New Jersey&#8217;s constitution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Residential Mortgage
Foreclosure Pleading and Document Irregularities Superior Court
of New Jersey, Chancery Division-General Equity Part, F-59553-
10, Mercer County (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Varian Semiconductor Equipment
Associates Inc. and Forest Oil Corp.&#8217;s options are cheap and
should be purchased because the odds the companies will be
acquired isn&#8217;t adequately factored into their prices, Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists Maria Grant and Katherine Fogertey
recommended buying near-term calls and selling long-dated
&#8220;strangles&#8221; or puts on those companies, as well as on Medicis
Pharmaceutical Corp., WellCare Health Plans Inc., Steel Dynamics
Inc. and Tibco Software Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Options can be an attractive vehicle to trade MA views
due to the combination of generally large stock moves and
predictable volatility patterns around MA announcements,&#8221; the
strategists said in the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takeovers produced average one-day returns of 27 percent
for 37 companies purchased between December 2009 and November
2010, according to data compiled by Goldman Sachs. This supports
owning calls on MA candidates, the strategists wrote. As
investors begin pricing in an acquisition, the cost of shorter-
dated options increases, they said, adding that MA candidates
tend to have cheaper puts relative to calls than the average
stock in the market because of greater potential for gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study also showed that volatility falls by an average
of 50 percent to 60 percent with acquisition announcements,
supporting the selling of longer-dated options, Goldman Sachs
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock Prices &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Varian gained 1 percent to $36.64 today, and its most-
traded options, the January $30 puts, were unchanged at 5 cents.
Forest Oil declined 1.1 percent to $37.01. Its most-traded
contracts, the May $42 calls, dropped 8.2 percent to $1.45. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strangle is the combination of a call option with a
strike price above the current price of the underlying security
and a put option with the same expiration date and a strike
price below the current market price on the same underlying
security. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Jason Kelly" date="Jan 06, 2011  5:00 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/pentagon-s-brinkley-plays-afghan-matchmaker-for-ibm-jpmorgan.html"><headline>Pentagon's Brinkley Plays Matchmaker in Afghanistan for IBM, Kate Spade</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;The skyline of the city of Herat, in
the westernmost corner of Afghanistan, is dominated by the Qala
Ikhtyaruddin, a 700-year-old stone citadel. On a chilly December
afternoon, as the sun begins to dip, the citadel&#8217;s grounds are
largely unoccupied. The general public isn&#8217;t allowed in until
renovations to the time-ravaged site are finished. Paid for in
part by a $725,000 grant from the U.S. government, the project
is scheduled to be completed at the end of 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul A. Brinkley isn&#8217;t the general public. As a U.S.
Defense Department deputy undersecretary, he moves freely behind
the barricades, ushering a handful of American visitors,
including Silicon Valley executives Atul Vashistha of Neo Group
Inc. and Mike Faith of Headsets.com Inc., through dark corridors
and up steep stairways to the highest reaches of the fortress,
Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its Jan. 10 edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tour comes after a morning of meetings with the
provincial governor and the local university&#8217;s chancellor and
students, all of them pushing, along with Brinkley, for the
executives to consider a noble and dangerous proposition:
opening up shop in Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve never regretted taking a businessperson to the
theater,&#8221; Brinkley says. &#8220;This is about getting their eyes on
the problem.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Herat, Kabul and cities large and small, Brinkley serves
as tour guide, ambassador, fixer, motivational speaker and
leader of the unofficial Afghanistan chamber of commerce. With
all of his titles and duties, he prefers to think of himself
primarily as a matchmaker, negotiating high-stakes unions
between multinational companies like International Business
Machines Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Afghan officials and
entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Infusion of Optimism&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a culture of business is the only way Brinkley and
General David Petraeus, commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan,
believe they can counteract the legendary forces of destruction
here -- from decades of war and deprivation to the brutal rule
of the Taliban and a reliance on opium as a chief export. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s an infusion of optimism in what can seem like a
hopeless situation,&#8221; Brinkley says. &#8220;The Afghans say, &#8216;People
actually want to do business with us? Maybe there is something
at the end of the rainbow.&#8217; &#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Task Force for Business  Stability Operations was
launched in 2006 as part of the U.S. Defense Department&#8217;s effort
to link military strategy and economic development in Iraq. For
four years the task force recruited Western companies in an
attempt to modernize Iraq&#8217;s banking system and reopen factories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slow Start &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early results were unsuccessful. Security concerns
prevented staff from restarting most heavy-manufacturing sites,
and overseas companies balked at doing business in Iraq out of
concern that their employees could be wounded or killed. A
former chief information officer at JDS Uniphase Corp., based in
Milpitas, California, Brinkley joined the Defense Department to
help with internal business operations. His work in Iraq spurred
the creation of the task force. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When we started our work in May 2006,&#8221; he says, Iraq
&#8220;was in a complete daily deterioration.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task force sponsored more than 200 visits by corporate
executives and investors, including Honeywell International Inc.
Chief Executive Officer David M. Cote and Boeing Co. CEO James W. McNerney Jr., which generated investment commitments of more
than $5&#160;billion, according to task force data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That doesn&#8217;t include oil-related investments. Iraq, home to
the world&#8217;s fifth-biggest oil reserves, recently has seen some
success in reconstructing its energy industry. On Jan. 3 the
country agreed to build pipelines across its shared border with
Jordan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating Jobs Crucial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The idea of what the military is trying to do is a
constructive one,&#8221; says Isobel Coleman, a senior fellow at the
Council on Foreign Relations in New York. &#8220;If you&#8217;re there for
the long haul, creating jobs and sustainable businesses is
crucial.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Iraq project coming to an end, Brinkley shifted
his focus in 2010 to Afghanistan, an even more daunting task.
More than 30 years of economic and political distress dating to
the Soviet invasion of 1979, and spanning the Taliban era and
almost a decade of war, have turned the country into a synonym
for hopelessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;110th by GDP &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption is rampant -- accusations reach all the way up
to President Hamid Karzai&#8217;s family -- and unlike Iraq,
Afghanistan didn&#8217;t have much of an economic base. Its gross
domestic product in 2009 was $26.9&#160;billion, ranking it 110th in
the world. Iraq is 65th, with a GDP of $109.9&#160;billion, according
to the CIA World Factbook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Iraq, thanks in part to Brinkley&#8217;s efforts, Fairfield,
Connecticut-based General Electric Co. is building power plants
to meet the country&#8217;s electricity shortages; Honeywell, based in
Morris Township, New Jersey, opened an office last year to sell
equipment to the oil and gas industry; and Stuttgart-based Daimler AG, having created a motor-vehicle training workshop in
2008, established a Baghdad office a year later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Success depends on those iconic companies,&#8221; Brinkley
says. &#8220;You augment them with mid-tier companies who are more
risk-oriented. Your agility and speed comes from there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinkley needs to replicate and expand on the process in
Afghanistan, using the military&#8217;s own spending power to promote
local companies and convincing multinationals that Afghanistan
is not just a safe place but also a land of real opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Risk versus Potential &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arriving in Kabul in December on a commercial flight, the
team and one of two business delegations in the country at the
time spent a day in the capital before flying to Herat, then
back to Kabul for three more days of tours and meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the natural resources buried in the mountains and
valleys where blood is still shed almost daily, to the women-run
workshops tucked in corners of Kabul, to the restless students
unwilling to become another lost generation, Brinkley sees huge
potential. Whether he can convince anyone it&#8217;s worth the risk is
another matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his shaved head, tieless suit and black leather
jacket, Brinkley cuts a distinctly non-Afghan figure. He peppers
his conversations with simple phrases such as &#8220;tashakor&#8221;
(thank you) and frequently puts his right hand over his heart,
an Afghan gesture of respect. In meetings, he listens more than
he speaks, usually making introductions and then retreating with
a self-effacing remark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prep Work &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During an encounter with Herat University&#8217;s chancellor, he
introduces executives Vashistha and Faith, plugs their Silicon
Valley credentials, and then says, &#8220;That&#8217;s my entire
contribution, so I&#8217;m going to step back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinkley, 44, grew up outside Dallas and earned
undergraduate and master&#8217;s degrees in engineering from Texas AM
University in College Station. He is now known, to members of
the task force, as &#8220;Mr. Brinkley&#8221; or &#8220;the boss.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinkley&#8217;s pitch to executives starts at home. In the
months before the December trip he was in San Francisco, Los
Angeles, Dallas, Houston and New York -- and working the phones
in between from his Pentagon office -- to make his case. Like
any good salesman, he believes that if he can just get the
customer onto the showroom floor, he can close a deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We tap into something,&#8221; says Brinkley. &#8220;There is a huge
desire to support the mission among all Americans. People want
to help and are at least willing to take a look at it. We just
tell them, &#8216;Come over and see for yourself.&#8217; &#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Matchmaker &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the executives are in the country, Brinkley the
matchmaker emerges. Between meetings one day in Kabul, he
mentions the similarities between his job and eHarmony, a
website that uses technology to figure out which singles will
make the best married couples -- only instead of producing
children, these partnerships are meant to nurture Afghan
industries and generate profits for both parents. Like any good
coupling, what comes of it isn&#8217;t ultimately up to the person who
made the introduction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If there&#8217;s money to be made on a risk-adjusted basis that
makes American CEOs comfortable, they&#8217;re going to do it,&#8221; says
Coleman of the Council on Foreign Relations. &#8220;Having a nice dog
and pony show may speed that process, but it&#8217;s not going to
change the calculus.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nomadic Work Life &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Afghanistan, Brinkley has assembled a 75-person team
with a $150 million annual budget. The group is culled from his
own business network, other parts of the government, political
campaigns and nongovernmental organizations. The camaraderie
between its members stems from the nomadic circumstances of the
job. Stretches of typical Pentagon life back in Washington
alternate with long visits to a country where the mood can swing
from uneasy to scary, depending on the day and location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We live where we work,&#8221; Brinkley says. &#8220;You get to know
aspects of people you normally wouldn&#8217;t see.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The task force&#8217;s work in Afghanistan consists largely of an
endless stream of meetings, many of which are conducted over
platters of nuts and raisins and cups of green tea. Sleep is
elusive. That owes in part to the brutality of time zones: Just
as a Kabul workday ends, Washington and New York, nine and a
half hours behind, are getting started. A second workday
essentially begins after dinner, with BlackBerry smartphones
buzzing throughout the evening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Precautions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#8217;s no delineation between weekday and weekend,
especially given that the Afghan weekend falls on Friday and
Saturday. Clothing retailer Kate Spade&#8217;s chief merchandising
officer, Sydney Price, arrived on a Saturday, had what amounted
to a working dinner with the task force and then started Sunday
morning with meetings and tours. Brinkley and his staff use
their proximity to the guests for the soft sell, talking about
what they saw that day, sharing stories aimed at emphasizing the
country&#8217;s humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security concerns mandate meticulous planning. Over the
course of a two-week period, Wall Street bankers, Silicon Valley
executives and Los Angeles-based investors were ferried around
Kabul and other parts of the country in armored vehicles for
meetings with local business owners, artisans, government
officials and students. To deal with the unpredictability of
airline schedules and traffic, team members and visitors often
leave their quarters before dawn. Most meals are taken inside
the compound; occasionally they are at a hotel restaurant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I expected it to be a lot more chaotic,&#8221; says Vashistha,
founder and chairman of Neo Group, a Pleasanton, California-
based consulting firm focused on outsourcing and globalization.
&#8220;What I saw was much more of a high-security zone than a war
zone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Link to Military &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brinkley team typically isn&#8217;t embedded with the
military, which allows them more freedom to work with a range of
officials and executives. The group is closely connected to the
military mission, though, and Brinkley is exuberant in his
loyalty to Petraeus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He has a phenomenal intellectual range and capacity,&#8221;
Brinkley says of the general. &#8220;We&#8217;re in tight partnership.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of three December days, Petraeus meets with
two separate delegations, including Vashistha&#8217;s, and has a
separate briefing with Brinkley. The general is appreciative of
the visitors&#8217; curiosity about Afghanistan -- and quick to press
them to move beyond interest and into commitment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Just like you can&#8217;t commute to a fight, you can&#8217;t commute
to business,&#8221; Petraeus says. When one member of a delegation
says the task force has provided a keyhole into what&#8217;s happening
here, Petraeus responds: &#8220;We need you to do more than look
through the keyhole. We need you to go through the door.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flashes of Modernity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kabul&#8217;s infrastructure was designed for about half a
million people. The city currently has a population of more than
3&#160;million. Traffic barely moves, and the crumbling roads and
bridges are constant reminders that it will take decades before
Kabul joins the ranks of modern cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet flashes of 21st-century life are evident. Mobile phones,
sold by five different carriers, are everywhere. Afghanistan,
with a population of 29&#160;million, boasts 15&#160;million wireless
subscribers. This gives hope to outside investors that there&#8217;s a
technological backbone to exploit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;My cell service is better here than in the Bay Area,&#8221;
says Faith, CEO of Headsets.com, a San Francisco-based supplier
of office-telephone headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He&#8217;s a colleague of Vashistha&#8217;s through their local chapter
of the Young Presidents&#8217; Organization, a nonprofit group focused
on young CEOs. Faith says Afghanistan&#8217;s not yet a big enough
market for his company, but he&#8217;s surprised by the progress he
sees. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited about the possibilities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobile Phone Infrastructure &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinkley and his visitors troop up several flights of
stairs to visit with Amir Zai Sangin, the minister of
Communications and Information Technology, who has the enviable
job of proselytizing for what is arguably the most advanced
sector of the Afghan economy. An Afghan flag sits in a corner of
his wood-paneled office, a large portrait of Karzai hangs behind
his desk. Over juice, tea and cookies, Sangin recounts how
Afghanistan created a communications infrastructure from nothing
in 2002. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People had to travel to another country to make a phone
call,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Now, in Kabul, even the poorest have mobile
phones. The beggars have mobile phones.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are five major telecommunications companies and
dozens of domestic Internet service providers. About 80&#160;percent
of the population is covered by the telecom infrastructure -- a
bigger portion than in India, he says. &#8220;Our strategy for the
last five years was infrastructure. The next five is
applications.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building Banking System &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Afghans have been busy talking on their phones, their
banking system lay fallow. Historically, Afghans have tended not
to trust banks and have avoided using them. When money needed to
be moved, transfer agents called hawalas were called in. The
notion of a bank as an institution that secures savings and
lends out money is still quite alien. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadia Dawood, an Iraqi-American, left her job on Wall
Street six years ago and started working with the U.S. Agency
for International Development. Eventually she landed alongside
Brinkley and was charged with trying to build a modern banking
system in Iraq. Saddam Hussein&#8217;s government had set up a network
that drove all funds through state-owned and -controlled
financial institutions. The task force automated the banking
sector and helped install modern services at more than 200 bank
branches throughout the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the rest of the task force&#8217;s members, Dawood has
turned her attention to Afghanistan, where among the first
orders of business was persuading the government to pay its
soldiers and police officers through electronic funds transfers.
By the end of last year all of the military and 80&#160;percent of
the police were paid on that basis. The next step was persuading
them to actually leave their money in a bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the banks were -- and where they were -- was a
question not easily answered when Dawood arrived in February
2010. Now she has a spreadsheet detailing banks&#8217; deposits and
the number of branches. Getting that data was crucial for the
next stage: bringing in a global financial-services company that
would connect Afghanistan&#8217;s monetary system to the rest of the
world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first bank the team approached was Citigroup Inc.,
which had played a similar role in Iraq. The New York-based
company was a natural choice, given that it processes the U.S.
government&#8217;s payments abroad and has shown an appetite for
working in emerging markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payment Processing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the work was neither fast nor easy. Citigroup
conducted six months of due diligence in Afghanistan, including
a weeklong roadshow with executives at the country&#8217;s handful of
domestic banks. The company made a deal with Afghanistan
International Bank, and now the two are helping process payments
made by NATO forces to local contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By paying invoices in local currency, it ensures the
money stays in the country to stimulate the economy,&#8221; says
Kevin Fitzgerald, the head of Citigroup&#8217;s public-sector unit in
North America who oversees the company&#8217;s contracts with the U.S.
government. &#8220;The entire amount is deposited directly in a bank
without being diverted or delayed by a local government
agency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the implementation of a modern banking system has
shown promise, Kabul Bank, one of the country&#8217;s largest
institutions, was beset by a corruption scandal in 2010. Last
summer six private security guards were also poisoned and
stabbed at a Kabul bank branch in Mazar-e Sharif. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;California to Kabul &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noorullah Delawari, who returned to his native Afghanistan
in 2002 after a career spent mostly in Southern California,
where he worked at Lloyds Bank&#8217;s operations there, is one of
those pushing to improve the financial system. After a stretch
running Afghanistan&#8217;s central bank, he&#8217;s now an adviser to
Karzai and serves as president of the Afghanistan Investment
Support Agency, whose motto is &#8220;the Silk Road to
Opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AISA is one of the task force&#8217;s many partners, organizing
roadshows and pitching businesses in China, Washington and
India. During a meeting in his office with one of the task
force&#8217;s delegations, Delawari rattles off statistics: Through
August 2010, 3,267 companies were established in the country,
with 38,000 new jobs tied to the investment. &#8220;Any positive
development will help end this vicious war.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Delawari speaks, Brinkley sweeps in, straight from the
airport. The men embrace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the pleasant surprises coming to Afghanistan was
AISA,&#8221; Brinkley tells the group. &#8220;It&#8217;s like a massive
accelerant.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rampant Corruption &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the meeting, Delawari insists that Brinkley
accept a small carpet sample, produced at a new factory that
AISA and the task force worked to get started, as a gift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption is often cited, alongside security concerns and
lack of infrastructure, as one of the biggest obstacles for
companies considering expansion to Afghanistan. Brinkley says
the task force seeks to soothe fears about corruption by
embedding accountants and legal advisers within government
ministries. Ultimately, avoiding corruption is up to the
companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge problem,&#8221; says Erik Malmstrom, co-author of
a November study sponsored by the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas
City, Missouri, on private-sector development in Afghanistan.
The report, titled &#8220;Afghanistan&#8217;s Willing Entrepreneurs&#8221; and
written with Jake Cusack, found something that surprises many
visitors: Afghans worry less about physical threats than about
the integrity of the business environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every step of the way,&#8221; Malmstrom says, &#8220;businesses are
having to deal with corruption.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calm in Herat &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herat is the site of some of Brinkley&#8217;s most successful
matchmaking, and it&#8217;s easy to see why. Located about 50 miles
(80 kilometers) from the relative calm of Iran -- which, despite
its political saber-rattling, is home to the world&#8217;s 19th-
biggest economy -- Herat doesn&#8217;t feel like a city in a war zone.
Its governor, Sayed Hussain Anwari, stresses the quietude during
an enthusiastic sales pitch over a breakfast of traditional
breads and pan-fried eggs served with chilies at his mansion
near the center of town. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People here want to keep their comfortable life. In the
south, they have nothing to lose, so they fight,&#8221; the governor,
dressed in a business suit, says. &#8220;Here, they have something to
lose, so they don&#8217;t fight.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on Jobs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He tells the Americans that he&#8217;s looking to Bangalore as a
model for Herat, an analog that will be repeated throughout the
day. Jobs are the top priority for both the task force and the
locals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These are hotheaded people who want to do something,&#8221;
Bijan R. Kian, a director of the Washington-based Export-Import
Bank of the United States who is Iranian-born, says of the
Afghans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the heavily guarded gates of Herat University, the
male and female students who roam the dusty campus, some dressed
in full burkas, agree. Inside a computer lab with rows of Lenovo
Group Ltd. machines, a group of students in the university&#8217;s
two-year-old computer programming school nervously show off
their projects to Brinkley and his contingent. The Herat IT
program got a boost in November when Armonk, New York-based IBM
signed a letter of intent with the university pledging to help
train students after sending executives on one of Brinkley&#8217;s
tours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Steps &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this visit, Brinkley is trying to augment that. After
the presentations, Neo Group&#8217;s Vashistha offers to hire several
of the students as interns. He also encourages them to look for
ways to make money on what they&#8217;ve already created as student
projects. He spends most of the afternoon and evening counseling
and cajoling a smaller group of students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, he decides that he&#8217;ll start by bringing two of
the students on as contractors to one of his companies; they&#8217;ll
work remotely from Herat. In addition, he plans to make an
investment Citadel Software, a startup company he encountered
during the trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students respond with cautious excitement. Their lives
have been split between Taliban rule and a war that began almost
a decade ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Every day, we want something better,&#8221; Eleena Kakar, a
21-year-old who recently graduated from Herat&#8217;s IT program, says
after a task force-hosted dinner. &#8220;The next generation will be
different if we have peace, and if we get to do what we want.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Spade &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Spade, which is owned by New York-based Liz Claiborne
Inc., wanted to work in Afghanistan as the next step in its
three-year-old partnership with the Washington-based NGO Women
for Women International, a project that has taken the company to
Bosnia. Brinkley&#8217;s team coordinated a visit last August for
executives including Kate Spade CEO Craig Leavitt, who announced
the company&#8217;s plans at an event held at the U.S. Embassy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I was very skeptical,&#8221; Leavitt says in an interview from
his New York office. &#8220;We knew of the logistical problems
because of the instability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four months later, chief merchandising officer Price is
reconnecting with the staff at Turquoise Mountain, a Kabul-based
nonprofit that was created in 2006 through an agreement between
Karzai and Britain&#8217;s Prince Charles, with the goal of reviving
arts and architecture in Kabul and creating an Afghan craft
industry that could thrive locally and abroad. Turquoise
Mountain takes 45 new students a year (970 applied in 2010) and
trains them in traditional crafts. They spend about 60&#160;percent
of their time learning a specialty, such as jewelry making, and
the rest studying business, law and technology to help them
become well-rounded entrepreneurs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cashmere Scarves &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a recent local exhibit the students sold $20,000 of
goods in four hours, all to local buyers, according to Shoshana
Coburn, the group&#8217;s managing director. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If all goes according to plan, Afghanistan-made cashmere
scarves may begin production in Kabul this year and will
eventually appear in Kate Spade stores as part of its &#8220;hand in
hand&#8221; line, alongside pom-pom scarves and other products made
in Bosnia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Spade&#8217;s approach to the products is different from the
traditional &#8220;a portion of the proceeds&#8221; model. The company
buys the goods outright from the workers, typically at a
multiple of local market prices. Kate Spade then handles all the
exporting and marketing costs involved in getting it to its
stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advantages for the producers -- in this case, Afghan
women -- are clear. They get the money once they produce the
wares instead of waiting for their share of the sale to make its
way back to them. If the products sell well, then Kate Spade
will make additional orders. The company aims to employ as many
as 1,500 women in Kabul by the end of 2013. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Market Needed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Afghans feel that any attempts by the Americans to
really change anything would be half done without leaving a
viable economy behind,&#8221; Leavitt says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his August visit, Leavitt arrived at Women for
Women&#8217;s Kabul training institute and sat on the floor among the
participants and asked how he could help. A woman who had been
unable to leave her home for seven years summed it up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;She just needed a market to sell,&#8221; Leavitt says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kate Spade is perfectly suited to working in Afghanistan.
&#8220;Hand in hand&#8221; is equal parts philanthropy, entrepreneurship
and branding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not a cash-aid partnership,&#8221; Leavitt says. &#8220;Our
goal is that this is ultimately a profit center for the women
and for us. This is meant to be good solid economics for
everyone.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it&#8217;ll take a lot of Kate Spades to make Afghanistan
matter in the global economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural Resources &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Brinkley&#8217;s project really needs is scale, and natural
resources are the fastest way to push the country forward.
According to a June Defense Department study, the estimated
gold, copper and iron ore reserves in the hills of Afghanistan
make up a potential trillion-dollar opportunity. The country&#8217;s
Ministry of Mines thinks it could be more than $3&#160;trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s not worth much if it stays in the ground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest single foreign investment came from mining --
and from a Chinese company. Metallurgical Corp. of China Ltd.
was awarded the Aynak copper mine project in 2007. The minister
of mines told investors at a London brief last year that he has
held additional talks with foreign companies including
ArcelorMittal, the world&#8217;s largest steelmaker, and energy
companies Total SA and Eni SpA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Allies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting companies from countries not directly involved in
the military effort is crucial to the long-term success of
economic development, says Thomas P.M. Barnett, chief analyst
for Wikistrat Ltd., a Tel Aviv-based consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The guys who are going to benefit are going to be from
the non-Allied pool,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinkley is agnostic and has recruited foreign companies,
including automaker Daimler, into Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is not just about U.S. companies,&#8221; he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another small mine project stands as a test of the
viability of natural-resources investing in Afghanistan.
JPMorgan Chase, based in New York, assembled investors who
ponied up $50&#160;million for a mine in the rugged fly-over country
between Kabul and Herat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bankers, drawing on knowledge of the country&#8217;s
natural resources from its mining clients in the former Soviet
Union, shared some of that intelligence with Brinkley&#8217;s team in
2008 and during the next two years worked to gather additional
data. The results were presented to Petraeus and Defense
Secretary Robert M. Gates last January. With the money raised,
the mining project was granted a license late in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism&#8217;s &#8216;Good Virus&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ian Hannam, a managing director at JPMorgan who helped
arrange the deal, says a successful mine has profound economic
consequences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With the mine comes a village, with the village comes a
hospital and a school,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Capitalism is like a good
virus. You&#8217;ll be amazed how quickly people turn up once someone
has success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinkley&#8217;s charge is spreading that virus, and while he
stresses realism, progress and patience, he&#8217;s hopeful. Back at
Qala Ikhtyaruddin, Herat spreads out before him, its signature
mosque jutting into the haze. The business tourists, having
taken pictures all the way up, turn quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brinkley stands alone, resting his elbows on a massive
ledge that looms hundreds of feet above a neighborhood of small
homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I came here thinking there was nothing, but there&#8217;s so
much,&#8221; he says. &#8220;This place, they really get it. All we need
is time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; China&#8217;s currency regulator said it

&lt;p&gt;The State Administration of Foreign Exchange will deepen
reform for the yuan exchange rate mechanism and improve foreign-
exchange-reserve management, the regulator said yesterday in a

&lt;p&gt;Separately, China&#8217;s central bank will manage liquidity in
the banking system, guide steady growth of loans and enhance
currency flexibility, the People&#8217;s Bank of China said in a
statement yesterday after its annual work meeting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. has shipped more than
8 million Kinect sensors for its Xbox device, topping the
company&#8217;s forecasts, and now has 30 million users for the
related Xbox Live online service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also plans to add the Hulu Plus online-
television service to Xbox Live and Kinect in the U.S. this
spring. Windows Phone 7 software, meanwhile, will be available
for Verizon Wireless and Sprint Nextel Corp. in the first half,
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said yesterday at the Consumer

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is relying on Kinect and Xbox Live to squeeze
more profit from its gaming division and extend the product life
of the Xbox console. Kinect lets players control games through
the movement of their bodies -- an approach that&#8217;s also been
embraced by rivals Nintendo Co. and Sony Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With Kinect, you are the controller -- and there&#8217;s
nothing else like it in the world,&#8221; said Ballmer, 54. &#8220;Xbox
360, Xbox Live and Kinect have made 2010 the biggest year in
Xbox history.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has sold virtually all of the 8 million Kinects
that were shipped, the company said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sony said in November it has shipped 4.1 million Move
motion controllers to retailers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, Google TV &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jack Tretton, CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America,
said in an interview this week that the vast majority of those
have been purchased by consumers and many stores are sold out.
He declined to provide an updated number for shipments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Xbox&#8217;s television, sports and movie features also are
becoming more critical amid competition from Apple Inc.&#8217;s Apple
TV and Google Inc.&#8217;s Google TV. Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, has sold more than 50 million Xbox 360 consoles,
which debuted in November 2005. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mobile-phone market, Microsoft is trying to build
support for its new Windows Phone 7 software, which came out
last year. Verizon and Sprint versions of Windows Phone 7
handsets weren&#8217;t available because those companies&#8217; networks use
CDMA technology, which Microsoft opted not to support in the
first version of the underlying software. Ballmer didn&#8217;t specify
when the two companies would start selling phones with the
operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier yesterday, Microsoft said the next version of its
Windows personal-computer operating system will run on ARM
Holdings Plc&#8217;s chip technology for the first time, marking a
deeper push into the market for tablet computers. At a press
conference at the show, Microsoft showed the upcoming Windows
running on ARM-based chips made by Nvidia Corp., Qualcomm Inc.
and Texas Instruments Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 82 cents to $28.82 at 4 p.m. New York time
in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares declined 8.4 percent
last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACA Financial Guaranty Corp. sued Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alleging fraud and unjust enrichment in
connection with a synthetic collateralized debt obligation
called Abacus 2007-AC1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman, Sachs  Co. developed and sold the CDO behalf of
hedge-fund client Paulson  Co. in 2007, according to the
complaint filed by ACA today in New York state Supreme Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This fraud action arises from the egregious conduct of
Goldman Sachs,&#8221; according to the complaint. ACA claimed the CDO
was &#8220;designed to fail so that Paulson could reap huge profits
by shorting the portfolio and Goldman Sachs could reap huge
fees.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. and the biggest
U.S. banks face billions of dollars in legal costs related to
their role in the financial crisis, threatening their profits
and the stock price gains they made in 2010, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second biggest bank by assets, reported $5.2
billion of legal costs in the first nine months of last year,
compared with a gain of $10 million in the same period a year
earlier. The costs would rise if the bank reserves for
multibillion-dollar lawsuits by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
and the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp., the largest U.S. bank, and Citigroup
Inc., ranked third, are also besieged by lawsuits stemming from
the credit crisis, brought by plaintiffs ranging from
foreclosed-upon homeowners to institutional investors whose
mortgage-backed bonds turned out to be money-losers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re under legal attack,&#8221; said Richard Bove, an
analyst at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida, who rates
JPMorgan&#8217;s stock a &#8220;buy.&#8221; &#8220;They&#8217;re similar to the asbestos or
the tobacco industry, and they&#8217;re going to be repeatedly sued in
the next few years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose about 1.8 percent in 2010, while the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Bank Index climbed 18.7 percent and Citigroup
gained 43 percent. Both banks are based in New York. Bank of
America, based in Charlotte, North Carolina, fell 11.4 percent,
while San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. rose 14.8 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama named William Daley, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. executive and former commerce
secretary, as his new chief of staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Few Americans can boast the breadth of experience that Bill
brings to this job,&#8217;&#8217; Obama said at the White House with Daley

&lt;p&gt;Daley, 62, a Washington veteran with strong ties to
business and part of the most powerful political dynasty in
Illinois, joins the administration as Obama prepares an agenda
for the second half of his term. His appointment comes amid a
retooling of the administration, including the naming tomorrow
of Treasury Department official Gene Sperling to replace
Lawrence Summers as head of the National Economic Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daley will replace Pete Rouse, whom Obama named on Oct. 1
to fill the role on an interim basis after Rahm Emanuel resigned
to return to Chicago. Rouse had indicated that he was reluctant
to remain in that job for the rest of Obama&#8217;s presidency. Rouse
will remain as an adviser, Obama said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ARM Holdings Plc climbed to its
highest price in ten years in London trading after Microsoft
Corp. said the next version of its Windows operating system will
run on ARM&#8217;s chip designs for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM, which designs semiconductors that power Apple Inc.&#8217;s
iPhone, rose 2.3 percent to 482 pence, the highest level since
Feb. 2001. Microsoft said yesterday it will work with ARM-based
chips, as it aims to produce an operating system running on
smaller, thinner devices with longer battery life and catch up
with Apple in the tablet computer market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has always been tied to Intel and the fact that
it&#8217;s now embracing ARM is an acceptance that ARM is the dominant
force in mobile and now perhaps beyond mobile,&#8221; said Paul Morland, an analyst at Peel Hunt in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM, based in Cambridge, England, signed a licensing
agreement with Microsoft in July, to let the company access
designs to build its own devices. ARM may start receiving
royalties on chip shipments from 2012, Morland said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares have climbed 14 percent since the start of 2011,
giving the company a market value of 6.4 billion pounds ($9.9
billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Windows software will be tailored for battery-powered
devices, such as tablets, netbooks and other handhelds,
Washington-based Microsoft said yesterday at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other versions of Microsoft programs aimed at phones
and mobile devices already work on ARM chips, this is the first
time the software maker will produce a full version of Windows
available on that technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operating system also marks a shift in Microsoft&#8217;s
alliance with semiconductor maker Intel Corp., which has
struggled in tablets and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economists are raising forecasts for
the number of jobs added by U.S. employers in December after a
report yesterday showed the biggest jump in company payrolls
since records began in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-two of 78 economists including those at Deutsche
Bank AG, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG increased projections for
tomorrow&#8217;s payrolls figures from the Labor Department. The
median forecast in the Bloomberg News survey calls for a 150,000
gain, up from 135,000 before yesterday&#8217;s data from ADP Employer
Services. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase  Co.
maintained their December payrolls estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The consensus has been too cautious in its assessment for
this year&#8221; on economic growth, Paul Donovan, deputy head of
global economics at UBS, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;If you
have a job, you are going to be more confident about maintaining
your job and for an economist, that&#8217;s the most important thing -
- how people in work feel about job security.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADP said that companies increased employment by 297,000
last month, triple the median forecast and exceeding the highest
projection in a Bloomberg survey. That added to evidence of a
broadening recovery as the Institute of Supply Management&#8217;s non-
factory index showed service industries expanded in December at
the fastest pace since 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economists at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan elected not to
alter their December payrolls estimates, while noting the ADP
figures suggested a risk the Labor Department&#8217;s numbers will be
higher than forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barclays View &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York-based Barclays Capital economist Theresa Chen said
in a note to clients today that the ADP number was &#8220;clearly a
strong report and suggests some upside risk&#8221; to her forecast of
a 150,000 gain. &#8220;However, the ADP data often do not predict
well the changes in nonfarm payrolls within the same period, so
we are not revising our payroll forecast in response to this
report,&#8221; she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan economists wrote in e-mails to
clients that ADP data may have been distorted by a seasonal
factor associated with year-end employment. Workers, regardless
of when they are dismissed or quit, sometimes remain on company
records until December, when businesses update their figures
with ADP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ADP estimates this so-called purge effect in adjusting
their data for seasonal changes and the company&#8217;s projection
this year may have been too large because there were fewer
firings this year than in the previous two, economists said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, Citigroup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donovan of UBS now predicts an increase of 160,000 for
December payrolls, set for release tomorrow at 8:30 a.m. from
the Labor Department in Washington. He previously forecast a
gain of 120,000. Other firms that revised up their estimate
include Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, Citigroup
Inc., HSBC Holdings Plc and Jefferies  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The median adjustment of the 22 revised forecasts received
by Bloomberg was up by 50,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Many including ourselves will now scramble to revise
higher estimates for non-farm payrolls,&#8221; Mitul Kotecha, head of
global foreign exchange strategy at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong
Kong wrote in a note to clients today. &#8220;We now look for a 240k
increase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#8217;s the highest forecast in the current Bloomberg survey
for tomorrow&#8217;s number. The lowest prediction at present is
98,000 by Peter Morici at the University of Maryland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are gaining confidence. Miami-based Carnival
Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest cruise-line operator, forecast fiscal
2011 earnings will increase as ticket prices and demand
strengthen. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx Corp. last month
raised its profit forecast for fiscal 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Federal Reserve policy makers last month reiterated that
progress toward cutting unemployment and preventing inflation
from slowing too much remained &#8220;disappointingly slow,&#8221;
according to minutes of their Dec. 14 meeting. The officials
affirmed their plan to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities
through June, aimed at bolstering the economy and reducing
joblessness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS&#8217;s Donovan said that there is still spare capacity in
the economy. The jobless rate was 9.8 percent in November, close
to a 26-year high of 10.1 percent reached in October 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As we go through 2011, there&#8217;s going to be a definite
need for the Federal Reserve to provide accommodation,&#8221; Donovan
said. &#8220;There&#8217;s no question of running a restrictive monetary
policy when you&#8217;ve got this degree of spare capacity and the
growth evidence we have at the moment is not going to change
that balance.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. clients
considering whether to buy shares in closely held Facebook Inc.
should take heed: Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable securities firm
could unload its own holdings without letting them know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the last sentence of a one-page investment profile sent
to private wealth clients, the firm explains: &#8220;GS Group may at
any time further reduce its exposure to its investment in
Facebook (through hedging arrangements, sales or otherwise),
without notice to the fund or investors in the fund.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering document, obtained by Bloomberg News, shows
that $75 million of the $450 million investment in Facebook by
Goldman Sachs is coming from Goldman Sachs Investment Partners,
a hedge fund that handles client money. The firm&#8217;s own $375
million investment will probably be cut to $300 million because
Goldman Sachs expects to sell $75 million to third parties or to
the fund it created so clients could buy a stake in Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There may be conflicts of interest relating to the
underlying investments of the fund and Goldman Sachs,&#8221;
according to the Facebook offering document&#8217;s disclosures
section. Material in the documents &#8220;is not guaranteed as to
accuracy or completeness.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs paid $550 million in July to settle fraud
charges filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating
to the 2007 sale of a mortgage-linked investment called Abacus.
The company said it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; by failing to inform
clients in the 2007 deal that it allowed a hedge fund betting
against the investment to help put together the deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Stephen Cohen, a Goldman Sachs spokesman in New York,
declined to comment yesterday. Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for
Facebook, also declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rules for Clients &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a stake in Facebook, Goldman Sachs clients are
required to make a minimum investment of $2 million by Jan. 7 in
what&#8217;s described as limited partnerships based in the Cayman
Islands and Delaware. Goldman Sachs is charging 0.5 percent of
any capital committed to the partnership as an &#8220;expense
reserve&#8221; as well as a 4 percent placement fee and 5 percent of
any gains, according to the document. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Richard A. Friedman, head of an internal investment group
in the firm called Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, turned down
an opportunity to invest in Facebook because he decided it
wasn&#8217;t right for his funds, according to a person familiar with
the decision. The New York Times reported Friedman&#8217;s decision
earlier today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friedman thought the investment wasn&#8217;t appropriate because
of its high valuation and because it didn&#8217;t match his investing
criteria, the newspaper said. The Goldman Sachs deal values
Facebook at $50 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active Users &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facebook has more than 600 million monthly active users, of
whom more than 230 million access the site on mobile devices,
the document shows. Statistics available on Facebook&#8217;s website
indicate it has more than 500 million monthly active users and
more than 200 million access from mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A letter addressed to &#8220;potential investor&#8221; that
introduces the Facebook investment profile ends with a two-
sentence paragraph. The first asks potential investors to
contact a Goldman Sachs representative for further information.
The second says: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Do not contact Facebook.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genco Shipping  Trading Ltd. may
rise as much as 20 percent in the current quarter in New York
trading, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said, citing expectations for a
recovery in freight rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genco may lead gains among haulers of dry-bulk cargoes
because the stock is at the low end of a trading range, analysts
Jonathan Chappell and Darren Hicks said in a note to clients
today. The Baltic Dry Index, a measure of commodity freight
costs, has been under &#8220;immense pressure&#8221; because of reduced
coal shipments from Australia and fleet expansion, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would look for Genco to recover to closer to its
resistance levels, providing appreciation of 15 to 20 percent,&#8221;
Chappell and Hicks said, adding that their technical analysis
suggests the stock may be &#8220;bottoming.&#8221; The Baltic Dry Index
may rebound once production resumes at Australian coal mines
shut by floods, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genco closed at $14.71 yesterday, giving the New York-based
company a market value of $522.6 million. The stock has traded
as high as $18.08 and as low as $13.88 since the end of June,
and a rebound in freight rates may push the shares toward the
upper end of that range, the analysts said. JPMorgan has an
&#8220;overweight&#8221; rating on the stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genco&#8217;s ships haul dry-bulk commodities including grains
and coal, the company&#8217;s website shows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two-year Treasury notes rose,
snapping three days of losses, as investors and economists said
the recovery in the U.S. job market hasn&#8217;t gone far enough for
the Federal Reserve to consider raising interest rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasury 10-year note yields fell from a three-week high
reached yesterday after data showed private employers added
297,000 jobs, ADP Employer Services reported, versus a forecast
of 100,000 in a Bloomberg survey. The rise in yields is
&#8220;extreme&#8221; and investors should use it as an opportunity to buy
five-year notes, Citigroup Inc., one of the 18 primary dealers
that trade directly with the central bank, recommended today in
a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re getting a correction,&#8221; said John Spinello, chief
technical strategist in New York at primary dealer Jefferies
Group Inc. &#8220;We got blasted yesterday. You have to try and sort
out the truth of the ADP number. The Fed will continue with
their purchases.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-year note yields declined three basis points to 0.69
percent at 7:59 a.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The price of the 0.625 percent security maturing in
December 2012 rose 1/16, or 63 cents per $1,000 face amount, to
99 28/32. Ten-year yields fell three basis points to 3.43
percent. They rose by 14 basis points yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-year yields are 45 basis points more than the upper end
of the Fed&#8217;s target range of zero to 0.25 percent. The
difference has widened from 2010&#8217;s low of eight basis points in
November. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Tactical Entry&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields will drop to 3.17 percent and two-year
rates will slide to 0.65 percent by March 31, a Bloomberg survey
of banks and securities companies shows, with the most recent
forecasts given the heaviest weightings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries tumbled yesterday after the ADP report showed
private employers added jobs in December, almost three times the
amount that economists expected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise in yields after the report provides &#8220;an
attractive tactical entry point,&#8221; Brett Rose, strategist at
Citigroup, wrote in a research note today. A &#8220;fairly strong&#8221;
increase in payrolls in a report expected tomorrow could lead to
a reversal of yield gains, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labor Department data tomorrow will show the nation added
jobs for a third month in December, a Bloomberg News survey of
economists shows. The jobless rate will be more than 9 percent
for a 20th month, according to the survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Purchases &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between yields on 10-year notes and Treasury
Inflation Protected Securities, a gauge of trader expectations
for consumer prices, widened to 2.42 percentage points
yesterday, the most since April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way ADP compiles its data tends to skew the figures for
December, Andrew Tilton, an economist at Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. in New York, wrote in his report yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We view the dramatic improvement shown in the report with
skepticism,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Markets may be overly optimistic about
the extent to which this will show up in Friday&#8217;s report.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fed is scheduled to buy $6 billion to $8 billion of
notes due from January 2015 to June 2016 today as part of its
effort to spur the economy. The Treasury plans to announce the
sizes of three-, 10- and 30-year auctions set for next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Signs of growth outside the job market will push Treasury
yields higher, Satoshi Okumoto, a general manager at Fukoku
Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Tokyo, which has the equivalent of
$67.1 billion in assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service industries, which cover about 90 percent of the
U.S. economy, expanded in December at the fastest pace since May
2006, a private report showed yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that will push yields higher,&#8221;
Okumoto said. &#8220;The economic figures are very good. The supply
outlook may weigh on the market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year yields will advance to 3.75 percent by the end of
March, he said. President Barack Obama has increased the U.S.
publicly traded debt to a record $8.75 trillion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okumoto said he&#8217;s trying to buy dollar-denominated
corporate bonds being sold this week, betting they will
outperform government debt as the economy improves. The limited
amount of the securities makes them tough to get, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toyota Motor Corp., the world&#8217;s largest automaker, and Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. are among the companies
that have issued debt this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Treasuries returned 5.9 percent in 2010, versus 10 percent
for company bonds, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed policy makers said improvements in the economy didn&#8217;t
meet the threshold for scaling back their plans to purchase $600
billion in bonds, in minutes of their Dec. 14 policy meeting
released Jan. 4 in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty-day federal funds futures contracts for delivery in
February 2012 yielded 0.565 percent, indicating investors expect
the central bank to increase borrowing costs by that month from
current levels. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global investment banking revenue
growth for this year and next will be lower than estimated,
according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It cut investment banking revenue growth for 2011 and 2012
to 3 percent from 4 percent due to declines in fixed income,
currencies and commodities income, which account for 55 percent
of revenue, according to JPMorgan analysts including Kian Abouhossein in a note to clients today. Fixed income revenue
will fall 4 percent in 2011 and a further 4 percent in 2012,
although it will be cushioned by gains in equities advisory and
underwriting, the note said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from fixed income, currencies and commodities
trading fell at most investment banks in the third quarter
according to company filings. Credit Suisse Group AG said in
October that fixed-income sales and trading revenue in the third
quarter dropped to 1.46 billion Swiss francs ($1.5 billion) from
2.48 billion francs in the year-earlier period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, global investment banks including Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. and UBS AG are still attractive because they are
cheap, according to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;On a long-term basis, we continue to believe that
investment banks are attractive as they remain cheap on
valuation both on tangible book value and price-to-earnings
basis,&#8221; the JPMorgan analysts said. The firm&#8217;s preferences are
Goldman Sachs, followed by UBS, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, Barclays Plc and Deutsche Bank AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another key focus for securities firms will be
compensation, JPMorgan said. Investors will be &#8220;disappointed&#8221;
by an average full year 2010 ratio of 42 percent excluding the
U.K. bonus tax, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governments, forced to rescue their nations&#8217; financial
services firms, are pressuring the industry to curb banker
compensation. The International Monetary Fund has called on the
Group of 20 leaders to tax banks to help pay for future
bailouts. In December 2009, the U.K. put a one-time 50 percent
levy on bankers&#8217; discretionary bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is selling
its stake in Accordia Golf Co., ending an almost decade-long
investment in the sport in Japan as player numbers fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Goldman Sachs investment unit will sell 470,587 shares in
Accordia, the Tokyo-based golf operator said in a statement
today. The stake is worth about 37 billion yen ($445 million)
based on today&#8217;s closing price. Accordia&#8217;s stock has lost 60
percent since Goldman Sachs took the company public in 2006. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spent more than 3 trillion yen since 1997 on
assets in Japan, including golf facilities and office buildings.
The nation&#8217;s golf-course industry has been in decline since an
asset bubble burst 20 years ago, and is unlikely to return to
its former glory as the population shrinks and the economy
stagnates, said Daisuke Seki of IB Research and Consulting Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman must have judged it&#8217;s time to sell as it can&#8217;t
expect any upside from the shares, and the move suggests the
bank will exit from other real estate investments in Japan,&#8221;
said Seki, chief executive officer at the Tokyo-based firm.
&#8220;Golf is a luxury. Playing numbers are falling because of the
declining population and weakening economy, as well as companies
choosing not to entertain clients on the course.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordia shares, sold in the IPO for 195,000 yen, fell 1
percent to 78,900 yen in Tokyo today before the announcement.
Goldman Sachs owns a 45 percent stake in the company. Goldman
raised about 100 billion yen from the IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bankrupt Clubs &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Daiwa Securities Group Inc.&#8217;s investment banking unit and
Goldman Sachs will underwrite the share sale, according to the
statement. They will sell the shares to investors in Japan, Asia
and Europe, and decide the price as early as Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hiroko Matsumoto, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the sale. She also declined to
comment on returns from its investment in the golf business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordia last month cut its profit forecast to 11.4 billion
yen for the year ending March 31, from 12.1 billion yen. It
posted a 10.4 billion yen profit a year earlier. The stock
slipped 19 percent in the past year while the Topix Index was
little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which made its first investment in Japan&#8217;s
golf industry in 2002, owned 131 courses as of Dec. 31 according
to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golf membership prices soared in Japan during the 1980s
bubble economy, then slumped as the country fell into four
recessions in the past two decades. At least 800 golf clubs have
gone bankrupt since 1991, according to Meiji Golf, which trades
club memberships in Tokyo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Membership values at Accordia-owned courses have fallen
faster than the nationwide average, Kazunari Tsutsumi,
executive director of Meiji Golf, said in July last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs at times faced challenges to acquire and
operate the golf courses. It lost management control of bankrupt
Nanso Country Club outside Tokyo last year after a court
accepted a petition by members to remove executives appointed by
the U.S. firm. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shutdown of Canadian Natural
Resources Ltd.&#8217;s 110,000-barrel-a-day Horizon oil sands project
after a fire may bring benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude
back from a &#8220;supercontango&#8221; and narrow its discount to Brent
oil, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The loss of this upgrader will further decrease flows to
the region, and should lead to a tightening of WTI spreads,&#8221;
analysts led by Lawrence Eagles said in a note to clients. &#8220;It
is also important to recognize that there was already a supply
bottleneck in Canada before the outage, therefore it is not
simply a case of subtracting the capacity of the upgrader from
Cushing flows,&#8221; the analysts wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap between WTI and Brent, the European benchmark,
narrowed 88 cents to $5.26 a barrel as of 11:49 a.m. New York
time today, after the discount increased yesterday to the
biggest since February 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Canadian company&#8217;s shares fell as much as 7.7 percent,
the biggest intraday drop since Aug. 6, and were down 4.9
percent to C$40.85 as of 9:30 a.m. local time. Canadian Natural
Resources is valued at C$44.5 billion ($44.8 billion). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fire started at about 3:30 p.m. local time in the
upgrader, where tar-like bitumen is converted to synthetic crude
oil, the Calgary-based company said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. All production at the plant was shut down and the
company doesn&#8217;t know when it will resume operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is important because it could have a direct impact
on flows to Cushing,&#8221; Oklahoma, the delivery point for the New
York Mercantile Exchange crude contract, the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI Discount &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WTI has seen its discount to Brent and Gulf Coast crudes
increase sharply, and in a dramatic reversal has seen the re-
emergence of a &#8220;supercontango,&#8221; the analysts said. The
discount of the contract nearest to expiration versus the third-
month futures averaged $1.16 a barrel in December, but widened
sharply to $2.52 a barrel in the first week of 2011 as Cushing
supplies increased 18 percent in eight straight weeks of gains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Canadian Natural December production averaged about 83,700
barrels a day of synthetic crude oil, the company said in a
separate statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey&#8217;s benchmark ISE National 100
Index fell 540.91, or 0.8 percent, to 68,770.29 at the 5:30 p.m.
close in Istanbul, curbing this week&#8217;s gains to 4.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Icecek AS (CCOLA TI), the bottler and distributor
of Coke drinks, dropped 85 kurus, or 4.2 percent, to 19.30
liras, the biggest loss in five weeks. Ozgorkey Holding AS,
which has a five percent stake, applied to the exchange to sell
2.54 million shares, or a 1 percent stake, according to a filing
from the bourse late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Denizbank AS (DENIZ TI), the bank part-owned by Belgium&#8217;s Dexia SA, rose 20 kurus, or 1.7 percent, to 12.15 liras.  Dexia
has 12 investors interested in the life insurance unit of
Denizbank, which is worth between 200 million euros and 300
million euros, French daily Les Echos reported, citing two
unidentified people. It&#8217;s also seeking a distribution partner
for non-life products for Denizbank&#8217;s insurer, the paper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Turkiye Is Bankasi AS (ISCTR TI), the country&#8217;s biggest
listed bank by assets, declined 14 kurus, or 2.4 percent, to
5.68 liras, snapping four days of gains.  The tax office
demanded it pay 632 million liras ($407 million) in backtaxes
and charges, and Isbank won an initial court case to overturn
it, the bank said in a filing with the exchange after markets
closed yesterday. The case is now at Turkey&#8217;s top administrative
court, it said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R. Allen Stanford&#8217;s criminal trial on
charges he led a $7 billion investment fraud was postponed
indefinitely by a U.S. judge while the Texas financier receives
care for a prescription-drug addiction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nothing can be done until the medical aspect is cleared
up,&#8221; U.S. District Judge David Hittner in Houston told defense
lawyers and federal prosecutors yesterday after an almost eight-
hour hearing on Stanford&#8217;s mental competency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three psychiatrists, one working for the government and two
working for the defense, testified yesterday that Stanford&#8217;s
dependency on prescription anti-anxiety medication and the
after-effects of a head injury he sustained in a jailhouse
beating left him unfit for the trial scheduled to start Jan. 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanford, 60, is accused of leading a scheme centered on
the sale of certificates of deposit by Antigua-based Stanford
International Bank Ltd. Stanford, indicted on 21 criminal counts
in June 2009, has denied wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the doctors who testified agreed that Stanford needs
hospitalization, lawyers disagree on where that treatment should
be provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense lawyers told Hittner they want him placed in a
private Houston-area facility where he would wear an electronic
monitor around his ankle and be watched by guards paid for by
his family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors said that treatment can be provided at a
federal prison, preferably one in Houston. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s the government that caused this,&#8221; defense attorney
Ali Fazel responded, noting Stanford&#8217;s head injury was sustained
in prison, as was the overmedicating. &#8220;Why entrust them to now
take care of him?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hittner set a Jan. 12 deadline for submission of each
side&#8217;s detailed proposal. A new trial date won&#8217;t be set until
Stanford is fit, the judge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of a court-imposed gag order, Stanford&#8217;s lawyers
and prosecutors didn&#8217;t comment after the hearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criminal case is U.S. v. Stanford, 09-cr-00342, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas (Houston). The SEC
case is Securities and Exchange Commission v. Stanford
International Bank Ltd., 09-cv-00298, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Texas (Dallas). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madoff Investors Object to Picower Accord With Trustee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims of Bernard L. Madoff&#8217;s Ponzi scheme objected to a
settlement in which the estate of billionaire Jeffry Picower,
who also invested, agreed to forfeit $7.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investors filed their objection yesterday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York. They said the Picower settlement
may interfere with their own efforts to get money from the
estate. Irving Picard, the trustee liquidating Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC, doesn&#8217;t represent them because they
didn&#8217;t lose principal in the fraud and they also have tax
claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;By the trustee&#8217;s settlement, the Picower entities are
paying Picard more than twice what he could recover if he won
completely on his pending complaint,&#8221; Helen Davis Chaitman, a
lawyer for the investors, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard sued Picower in May 2009, claiming he withdrew $7.2
billion more than he invested. Picower died in October 2009 at
age 67. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Picard and U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who is probing the
Madoff fraud, on Dec. 17 announced the settlement with Picower&#8217;s
widow, Barbara. The settlement brought the amount collected by
authorities over the Madoff fraud to $9.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Remus, a spokeswoman for Picard&#8217;s law firm, Baker 
Hostetler LLP in New York, didn&#8217;t have an immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. Picower, 09-1197, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BofA Urges New Jersey Court Not to Halt Foreclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and other U.S.
banks told a New Jersey court that defects in their processes
for seizing homes in the state can be remedied without halting
foreclosures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks have taken steps to improve their procedures,
making a suspension unnecessary, they said in documents filed
Jan. 5 in state court in Trenton, New Jersey, and made public
yesterday. The filings came in response to a proposal to freeze
foreclosures in the state by six U.S. banks while their
procedures are reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks&#8217; practices came under scrutiny after bank
employees signed court documents in foreclosure cases without
reviewing their accuracy, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bank of America fully appreciates the court&#8217;s concerns
and looks forward to working with the court to address them,&#8221;
the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company said. &#8220;The court
should not take the steps outlined in the order because they are
unnecessary and will cause a wholesale delay in administering
foreclosure cases that is not in the public interest.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Mary Jacobson scheduled a Jan. 19 hearing to consider
suspending uncontested foreclosure cases and foreclosure sales
by the banks: Ally Financial Inc., Bank of America, JP Morgan,
Wells Fargo  Co., Citigroup Inc. and OneWest Bank, according to
a Dec. 20 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobson said in the order that the move &#8220;is necessary to
protect the integrity of the judicial foreclosure process in New
Jersey and to assure the public that the process going forward
will be reliable.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In the Matter of Residential Mortgage
Foreclosure Pleading and Document Irregularities Superior Court
of New Jersey, Chancery Division-General Equity Part, No.
F-59553-10, Mercer County (Trenton). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA Agrees to Drop Subprime CDO Lawsuit Against RBC &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; MBIA Inc. agreed to drop a lawsuit against Royal Bank of
Canada that claimed the bank fraudulently induced the insurer to
sell it credit-default swaps protecting against losses on
securities linked to subprime mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for MBIA Insurance Corp. and MBIA&#8217;s LaCrosse
Financial Products LLC signed an agreement of voluntary
discontinuance in the case along with attorneys for the Toronto-
based bank and two of its units, according to a copy of the
stipulation stamped as filed Jan. 4 in New York state Supreme
Court in Westchester County and posted on MBIA&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement was filed four days after RBC withdrew from a
suit that is challenging the insurer&#8217;s restructuring in 2009.
MBIA has been shut out of the bond insurance business since
losing its top rankings in 2008 over losses on subprime mortgage
debt it guaranteed. Other banks including UBS AG, Bank of
America Corp., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC
Holdings Plc are still challenging MBIA&#8217;s restructuring,
according to court filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin Brown, a spokesman for Armonk, New York-based MBIA,
declined to comment on MBIA&#8217;s reason for dropping the case.
Scott Balber, an attorney for Royal Bank of Canada in the case,
also declined to comment, and Kevin Foster, a spokesman for
RBC&#8217;s New York-based brokerage arm, didn&#8217;t immediately return a
phone call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MBIA had sued RBC in January 2010 over $4.4 billion of
credit-default swaps the insurer sold the bank to protect
against losses on three collateralized debt obligations created
and marketed by RBC, according to a copy of the complaint on
MBIA&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is MBIA Insurance Corp. v. Royal Bank of Canada,
12238/2009, New York state Supreme Court (Westchester). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs developed and sold the collateralized debt
obligation known as Abacus for hedge-fund client Paulson  Co.
in 2007, according to the complaint filed yesterday by ACA in
New York state court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abacus was &#8220;worthless&#8221; when Goldman Sachs marketed it to
ACA, a bond insurance company, the suit alleges. ACA, which says
it now guarantees more than $7 billion in municipal bonds, is
seeking at least $30 million in compensatory damages and at
least $90 million in punitive damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed to the SEC settlement in July over
claims the bank misled investors in CDOs linked to subprime
mortgages. The New York-based bank didn&#8217;t admit or deny
wrongdoing as part of the settlement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC lawsuit, filed in April, claimed Goldman failed to
disclose that Paulson helped pick the underlying securities and
bet against the investment vehicles. As part of the settlement,
Goldman acknowledged it was a &#8220;mistake&#8221; for its marketing
materials to state that the portfolio was &#8220;selected by&#8221; ACA
Management LLC without disclosing the role of Paulson in the
selection process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Duvally, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, didn&#8217;t return a
call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is ACA Financial v. Goldman Sachs  Co.,
650027/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch Sues Italian Region Over Swap Deal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp.&#8217;s Merrill Lynch International Bank
Ltd. unit sued Italy&#8217;s Lazio region for refusing to honor
obligations under a 2001 swap deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed Jan. 5 in New York state Supreme Court,
seeks a Feb. 1 payment, enforcement of the agreement, and
damages. Lazio entered the transaction to hedge interest rate
and foreign-exchange rate risk related to two bonds it had
issued, Dublin-based Merrill Lynch said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lazio is among local Italian authorities that have sued
Merrill and other banks in Rome to recover allegedly hidden fees
on swaps. Lazio says it was misled by Merrill into agreeing to
the transaction and may seek damages while refusing to live up
to the deal, according to the bank, which also has sued the
region in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An official for Lazio didn&#8217;t immediately return a call for
comment. The central Italian region is made up of five provinces
that include Rome. &lt;/p&gt;

of Lazio, 650024/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheros Sued by Shareholder Over Qualcomm Acquisition &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Atheros Communications Inc. was sued by a shareholder
claiming its acquisition by chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. for about
$3.2 billion comes at an unfair price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $45-a-share deal is &#8220;inadequate&#8221; given Atheros&#8217;s
recent results and promising new networking products, the
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority said in a
lawsuit filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atheros brings expertise in home networking and products
that help computers and other electronics link up without wires.
San Diego-based Qualcomm is the world&#8217;s largest maker of mobile-
phone chips. The acquisition, its biggest since it went public
in 1991, helps broaden its lineup of Wi-Fi technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offer, announced Jan. 5, represents a 21.6 percent
premium over Santa Clara, California-based Atheros&#8217;s closing
price on Jan. 3, less than the average premium of 48 percent for
similar deals in the industry during the past year, SEPTA
officials said the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The two companies have a long-standing integration
relationship,&#8221; SEPTA said. &#8220;This long-standing relationship
likely put Qualcomm at an advantage in securing a lower price
for the company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly Mulloy, a spokeswoman for Atheros, didn&#8217;t return a
phone call seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;

Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreclosures May Be Undone by Ruling on Mortgage Transfer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts&#8217;s highest court is poised to rule on whether
foreclosures in the state should be undone because
securitization-industry practices violate real-estate law
governing how mortgages may be transferred, Bloomberg News&#8217; Thom
Weidlich reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight between homeowners and banks before the Supreme
Judicial Court in Boston turns on whether a mortgage can be
transferred without naming the recipient, a common
securitization practice. Also at issue is whether the right to a
mortgage follows the promissory note it secures when the note is
sold, as the industry argues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A victory for the homeowners may invalidate some
foreclosures and force loan originators to buy back mortgages
wrongly transferred into loan pools. Such a ruling may also be
cited in other state courts handling litigation related to the
foreclosure crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the first time the securitization paradigm is
squarely before a high court,&#8221; said Marie McDonnell, a
mortgage-fraud analyst in Orleans, Massachusetts, who wrote a
friend-of-the-court brief in favor of borrowers. The state
court, under its practices, is likely to rule by next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of wrongdoing by banks and loan servicers triggered
a 50-state investigation last year into whether hundreds of
thousands of foreclosures were properly documented as the
housing market collapsed. The probe came after JPMorgan Chase 
Co. and Ally Financial Inc. said they would stop repossessions
in 23 states where courts supervise home seizures and Bank of
America Corp. froze U.S. foreclosures. Massachusetts is one of
27 states where court supervision of foreclosures generally
isn&#8217;t required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts homeowners argued that the banks that
took their homes didn&#8217;t follow their own rules for transferring
mortgages into mortgage-backed trusts that issued bonds. The
banks and the mortgage-bundling industry counter that the
securitization documents themselves assign the mortgages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Bank v. Ibanez, 10694, Supreme Judicial
Court of Massachusetts (Boston). The lower-court cases are U.S.
Bank National Association v. Ibanez, 08-Misc-384283, and Wells
Fargo Bank NA v. LaRace, 08-Misc-386755, Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, Trial Court, Land Court Department (Boston). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ex-Arcandor CEO Says He Never Misled Investors on Refinancing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Arcandor AG Chief Executive Officer Thomas
Middelhoff rejected claims he misinformed investors in 2008
about the company&#8217;s efforts to refinance debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middelhoff testified at a court in Essen, Germany,
yesterday that he wasn&#8217;t wrong when he told a reporter on Sept.
16, 2008, that Arcandor had ruled out a capital increase for a
refinancing due at the end of that month. He also didn&#8217;t
instruct his spokesman to deny that Arcandor was considering
selling its stake in Thomas Cook Group Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At the time of the interview I was totally convinced that
we would be able to finalize the refinancing without a capital
increase and also without selling the Thomas Cook stake,&#8221;
Middelhoff said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arcandor, the former parent of German department-store
chain Karstadt, filed for insolvency in June 2009. Middelhoff&#8217;s
home and office were searched in October as part of a probe into
the company&#8217;s demise and whether there was any related
misconduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plaintiff in yesterday&#8217;s case, Jan-Eric Peters, the
editor in chief of Die Welt, claims he lost more than 50,000
euros ($65,000) because he bought Arcandor shares relying on the
information. On Sept. 24, 2009, Arcandor said it had to
&#8220;clarify&#8221; an earlier statement by a spokesman that it wouldn&#8217;t
give away part of its majority stake in Thomas Cook to guarantee
loans. The shares fell 30 percent the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several refinancing efforts faltered, Arcandor
announced a few days later that it would sell 23 million new
shares to Bank Sal Oppenheim Jr.  Cie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday&#8217;s case is LG Essen, 4 O 244/09. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SGC Director Fined, Banned by Regulator for Insurance Fraud &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former director at Surety Guarantee Consultants Ltd. was
banned from working in the financial industry by a U.K.
regulator for his part in a scheme that defrauded London
insurers of more than 2 million pounds ($3 million). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barry Williams, 61, was also fined 25,000 pounds for
participating in the scheme to defraud Markel International
Insurance Co., QBE Insurance  Europe) Ltd. and Amalfi
Underwriting Ltd., the U.K. Financial Services Authority said in
a statement yesterday. While Williams didn&#8217;t profit from the
scheme, he &#8220;turned a blind eye&#8221; and lied to insurers about it,
the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He recklessly abused the trust and confidence placed in
him by leading London market insurers and by doing so enabled
secret profits to be made from the fraud by his colleagues,&#8221;
FSA enforcement chief Margaret Cole said in the statement.
&#8220;This sort of breach of fiduciary duty and lack of integrity
amounts to very serious misconduct.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SGC, an insurance company that sold surety bonds, exposed
the other insurers to greater liabilities than they had agreed
to take on by exceeding their authorized limits and withholding
money that was owed to the clients, the FSA said. The company
also provided false documents to its auditors, according to the
agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FSA&#8217;s registry didn&#8217;t provide contact information for
Williams. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dollar will fall this year as the
Federal Reserve keeps interest rates close to zero and the
fiscal deficit stays near a record amid an extension of Bush-era
tax cuts, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. currency will be used to fund so-called carry
trades, where it is used to buy higher-yielding currencies, said
John Normand, the London-based head of currency strategy at
JPMorgan. The dollar will slide about 12 percent to $1.48 per
euro and 7 percent to 78 yen by the end of 2011, he said. The
Canadian dollar may be the best performer among major currencies
this year if oil averages above $100 per barrel, the bank
predicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;U.S. growth alone cannot support the dollar as it&#8217;s
highly unlikely that the Fed will be lifting interest rates in
the next 12 months,&#8221; said Normand in an interview. &#8220;Few people
will be buying the dollar as an investment vehicle. Many people
will continue to use the dollar as a funding currency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar gained 7 percent against the euro last year as
investors sought refuge from a debt crisis that forced Greece
and Ireland to turn to the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund for bailouts. The greenback fell 13 percent versus
the yen, its biggest decline against a major currency, as
record-low interest rates in the U.S. reduced the attractiveness
of American assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar strengthened 0.1 percent to $1.2989 per euro and
0.2 percent to 83.50 yen as of 10:17 a.m. in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax Cuts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates
this year because inflation pressures remain subdued, Normand
said. JPMorgan forecasts the U.S. economy will expand 3.3
percent this year, up from a 2.9 percent growth in 2010.
Consumer prices will climb 1.2 percent, compared with an average
of 2.5 percent in the past decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar will underperform the 17-nation European
currency as policy makers in the euro region work to reduce
their fiscal shortfalls and the U.S. deficit widens following
the extension of tax cuts implemented by President George W. Bush, said Normand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The greenback will also suffer from a widening current
account deficit, he said. The U.S. current-account gap, the
broadest measure of trade, will rise to 3.4 percent of the
nation&#8217;s output this year, while in the euro area it will drop
to zero, according to economists in Bloomberg surveys. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal Deficit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Given the EU leaders&#8217; commitment to provide all necessary
support to stabilize the region, pressures on the euro should
fade as the periphery passed a refinancing hump in spring,&#8221;
Normand said. &#8220;The market&#8217;s focus should then turn to the U.S.
challenge of funding a 10 percent fiscal deficit and widening
current account imbalance with zero cash rates, a backdrop which
is dollar-negative.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. deficit was $150.4 billion in November, exceeding
the median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
compared with $120.3 billion in November 2009, according to a
Treasury Department budget statement released last month. The
extension of tax cuts by President Barack Obama will expand the
federal budget deficit to $1.34 trillion for fiscal 2011, Credit
Suisse Group AG strategists estimated on Dec. 7. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ARM Holdings Plc said it may start to
earn royalties from its designs for Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Windows in
about two years as Microsoft brings out tablet computers based
on the operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We earn royalties when those chips start getting into real
products, so probably a couple of years out at the very
minimum,&#8221; ARM Chief Executive Officer Warren East said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;On the Move&#8221; show with
Francine Lacqua. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced Jan. 5 at the Consumer Electronics Show
in Las Vegas that the next version of Windows will run on ARM&#8217;s
chip designs for the first time. The agreement &#8220;accelerates the
potential&#8221; for ARM technology to be found in &#8220;a complete range
of computing products,&#8221; East said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM earns revenue from licensing deals and through royalty
payments on chip shipments. Third-quarter royalties increased 31
percent to $81.7 million, accounting for about half of total
sales, the Cambridge, England-based company said in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chipmaker signed a licensing agreement in July to let
Microsoft access designs to build devices. The Windows software
will be tailored for battery-powered products, such as tablets,
netbooks and other handhelds, Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While other versions of Microsoft programs aimed at phones
and mobile devices already work on ARM chips, this is the first
time the software maker will produce a full version of Windows
available on that technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operating system also marks a shift in Microsoft&#8217;s
alliance with semiconductor maker Intel Corp., which has
struggled in tablets and mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARM&#8217;s East today said that shareholders and customers will
benefit as long as ARM maintains its &#8220;neutral and independent
position&#8221; in the market. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Liquefied natural gas production from Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s Arun plant in Indonesia&#8217;s Aceh province may
drop 24 percent in 2011 from a year earlier as deposit of the
cleaner-burning-fuel dwindle, a company official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Output from Arun, the country&#8217;s oldest LNG plant, may fall
to 29 cargoes this year from 38 cargoes produced in 2010, said
Maman Budiman, a spokesman at Exxon&#8217;s Indonesian unit. Twenty-
six cargoes will be sold to overseas buyers and the rest to
local fertilizer producer PT Pupuk Iskandar Muda, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lower output is &#8220;because of a natural decline in gas
production,&#8221; Budiman said in a telephone interview from Jakarta
today. &#8220;When a field has produced continuously for so many
years, over time the reserves will be depleted.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, the world&#8217;s third-largest LNG supplier, exports
the frozen fuel from three plants to Japan, South Korea, Taiwan
and China under term contracts. Arun and Bontang in East
Kalimantan produced more than 95 percent of the country&#8217;s LNG in
2009, according to Bloomberg calculations based on official data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arun, which shipped its first cargo to Japan in 1978, will
cease exports by 2014, according to Indonesia&#8217;s Gas Balance
2010-2025 document. LNG is natural gas chilled to liquid form
for transportation by ships to places not connected by pipelines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LNG demand in Asia is poised to rise for a second year in
2011. Imports may increase 5 percent this year, after jumping
almost 12 percent in 2010 and falling 2.9 percent the previous
year, according to Sook Ching Wong and Alexis Aik of FACTS
Global Energy, a Singapore-based energy consultant. Japan, the
world&#8217;s biggest LNG buyer, paid $9.40 per million British
thermal units for deliveries in November, compared with about
$14 a year earlier, according to Japanese customs data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Foreign investment banks seeking a
greater share of stock underwriting in China must focus more on
smaller initial public offerings, said the head of JPMorgan
Chase  Co.&#8217;s Chinese operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley, both based in New York, got
regulatory approval to set up investment banking joint ventures
in China this week, joining Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and UBS AG
in gaining access to a market where companies raised $74 billion
through IPOs last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign-backed joint ventures were laggards in that market
in 2010, with UBS Securities Co. claiming the highest
underwriter ranking at No. 18 overall, Bloomberg data show. As
smaller deals dominated, local firms with more employees in the
country such as Ping An Securities Co. benefited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Certain adjustments in (foreign firms&#8217;) business model
will need to be made, but the shift will be relatively
gradual,&#8221; Shao Zili, hired by JPMorgan in November 2009 as
chief executive officer for China, said in an interview. Small
and mid-sized IPOs &#8220;is traditionally not an area the foreign
firms focused on. However, it is a market that presents a great
deal of potential and no one can ignore the SME market now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Todd Marin, JPMorgan&#8217;s head of investment banking in Asia,
defined such IPOs as those that raise up to $150 million.
JPMorgan expects those offerings to account for a greater share
of IPOs in Shanghai and Shenzhen as some of the largest state-
owned companies, such as Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., have
already gone public, Marin, 48, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Headcount Expansion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan plans to expand its investment-banking workforce
in the Asia-Pacific region outside Japan by 5 percent to 10
percent this year, in part to grow in China, Marin said. He
declined to say how many employees the unit has now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank, the world&#8217;s third-biggest manager of equity
sales in 2010, received regulatory approval to set up an
investment banking joint venture in China with First Capital
Securities Co., according to a table posted on the China
Securities Regulatory Commission&#8217;s website yesterday. Morgan
Stanley said today in a statement it got the CSRC&#8217;s approval for
a venture with Huaxin Securities Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s local venture will likely be &#8220;up and running&#8221;
in the second quarter, Shao, 52, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tying up with a local firm is a prerequisite for arranging
share sales in China, which is poised to overtake Japan as the
world&#8217;s second-largest economy. Deutsche Bank AG and Credit
Suisse AG are among other global banks that have started
ventures with local partners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriter Sponsors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One bottleneck for foreign investment banks in China is
staffing. Under Chinese rules, each underwriting firm must have
two so-called sponsors -- bankers who have passed an
underwriting test administered by the securities regulator and
have relevant experience in equity offerings -- sign off on each
deal. A single sponsor can&#8217;t work on more than two IPOs
simultaneously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UBS Securities has 20 qualified sponsors, putting it at No.
25 among the 71 firms that can underwrite local IPOs by that
measure, the China Securities Regulatory Commission said Sept.
3. Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities Co. ranked No. 40 with 11
sponsors at the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guosen Securities Co. employed the most such professionals
at the time with 113, the regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
prepares to unveil business standards aimed at improving its
reputation after settling fraud charges last year, the Facebook
Inc. stock sale to clients shines new light on the firm&#8217;s
potential conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pitching as much as $1.5 billion in stock in the closely
held social-networking company to wealthy investors, Goldman
Sachs disclosed that it might sell or hedge its own $375 million
investment without warning clients. The company&#8217;s disclosures
didn&#8217;t reveal that one of its star fund managers, Richard A. Friedman, rejected the deal as inappropriate for his clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, created a
business standards committee last May after the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission sued Goldman Sachs for fraud. The SEC
alleged that the firm misled investors in a 2007 mortgage-linked
investment by failing to inform them of a hedge fund&#8217;s plan to
bet against the investment. The committee&#8217;s report, which could
be released as soon as next week, will address how the company
can &#8220;reinforce the firm&#8217;s client focus and improve upon the
transparency of our activities,&#8221; according to a May statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The committee was undertaken in the hope and the
commitment to do some things that were going to help restore and
improve trust,&#8221; said James Post, a professor at Boston
University&#8217;s School of Management who focuses on corporate
governance and ethics. Instead, &#8220;people are going to look at it
and say do those standards seem credible in light of the
Facebook deal?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s last large

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. released 100 pounds
of hydrogen sulfide from its Beaumont refinery in Texas,
according to a filing to the U.S. National Response Center. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leak was caused by a crack in the coke drum, the report
showed. It occurred at 12:50 a.m. local time yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. refineries must notify the center if they release
hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News couldn&#8217;t immediately verify that the
information in the NRC filing was accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery can process almost 360,000 barrels of crude a

&lt;p&gt; Junk bonds in the CCC tier of credit
quality may return as much as 10 percent this year and those one
group higher may gain 9.5 percent, offering &#8220;the best overall
balance&#8221; of risk and return, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonds rated CCC and lower returned 18.4 percent in 2010,
the best-performing rating tier of the year, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. Investors pocketed 14 percent
from B rated bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We recommend overweighting both CCC and B rated corporate
debt,&#8221; New York-based strategist Alberto Gallo, who co-wrote a
Jan. 7 report with fellow analysts Charles Himmelberg, Lotfi Karoui and Annie Chu, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;We
recommend single-Bs as a sweet spot, after adjusting our
expected returns by their risk.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyclical industries including retail sales may benefit from
more consumer spending, while energy company debt will be
&#8220;attractive&#8221; because of increasing oil prices, the strategists
wrote. The bank is forecasting junk bonds will outperform
higher-rated debt at the same time it&#8217;s predicting the U.S.
economy will grow 3.4 percent in 2011. Gross domestic product
will expand 2.6 percent in 2011, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defaults on bonds ranked below Baa3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors
Service and less than BBB- by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, a category
known as junk or high-yield, will fall to 2.4 percent this year,
Goldman Sachs said. The trailing 12-month global default rate
for the category fell to a two-year low of 3.1 percent in the
fourth quarter of 2010, down from 13.1 percent a year earlier,
Moody&#8217;s said Jan. 7. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fed Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rate declined as the Fed has kept its target rate for
overnight loans between zero and 0.25 percent for more than two
years. The U.S. central bank is also buying $600 billion of
Treasuries to tamp down yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Junk bond yields fell to 7.69 percent on Jan. 7, the lowest
since Nov. 15, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate bonds with B ratings have lagged behind other
junk classes during the past 10 years, Bank of America Corp.
researchers led by Phil Galdi wrote Jan. 7 a report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B rated bonds returned a monthly average of 0.65 percent,
compared with 0.69 percent for higher-rated debt and 1.04
percent for the lowest tier, the research showed. The debt has
underperformed even taking into account the amount of risk being
assumed, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. said President Bob Muglia, head of the software maker&#8217;s server and tools division,
will leave this summer because Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer decided the unit needed new leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muglia, a 23-year veteran, will run the group while
3Microsoft conducts a search for his replacement, Ballmer said
in an e-mail posted on the Redmond, Washington-based company&#8217;s
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The business, which generated sales of $14.9 billion in the
most recent fiscal year, includes database software, the Azure
cloud-computing programs and a version of Windows software for
corporate networks. Ballmer said the unit needs to accelerate
growth and that requires a new executive team. Muglia is the
company&#8217;s fourth senior manager to announce his departure since
May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;All businesses go through cycles and need new and
different talent to manage through those cycles,&#8221; Ballmer said
in the message. He said he is making the switch now because
&#8220;the best time to think about change is when you are in a
position of strength.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muglia took over the division in October 2005. The
business&#8217;s revenue rose more than 50 percent under his
leadership. It accounted for 24 percent of Microsoft&#8217;s total
sales in the year ended in June, making it the third-largest
division. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcame Demotion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muglia survived a demotion earlier in the decade after the
Hailstorm Internet services effort he was overseeing failed amid
questions from potential partners and privacy advocates. He
fought his way back to head the server and tools division three
years later and in 2009 was named one of Microsoft&#8217;s presidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"He has done amazing," said Rob Horwitz, research chair and
co-founder of market research firm Directions on Microsoft.
"He&#8217;s built that business up against formidable competition from
the likes of Oracle and IBM." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many executives would have quit after the demotion, said
Horwitz, who had the office next to Muglia&#8217;s at Microsoft in
1988. Bob is "a company man," and it&#8217;s entirely possible that he
was willing to admit to Ballmer that he wasn&#8217;t the right man for
the CEO&#8217;s future plans, Horwitz said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The departure, coming after those of Chief Software
Architect Ray Ozzie, Office division chief Stephen Elop and Xbox
unit president Robbie Bach, adds to concern that Ballmer is
losing senior executives too quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It is a bummer to lose that much institutional talent,"
Horwitz said. "There&#8217;s a natural cleaning process of replacing
executives but it&#8217;s never good to have it that compressed. There
were probably different reasons for each departure. Whether it&#8217;s
a symptom of something larger, I don&#8217;t know." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawn Beauparlant, a spokeswoman for Microsoft, said Muglia
wasn&#8217;t available for an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker,
fell 38 cents to $28.22 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock
Market trading. The stock declined 8.4 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) completed a third
deepwater well in the Santos Basin, home to Brazil&#8217;s largest oil
discoveries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world&#8217;s largest oil company, finished the Sabia-1 well after finding signs of crude in December, Brazil&#8217;s oil
regulator, known as the ANP, said today on its website. Exxon
has found oil in two of the three wells it drilled at the BM-S-22 exploration block, which it operates with partners Hess Corp. (HES)
and state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA. (PETR4) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are now analyzing the well, and we will work with the
ANP and our partners Hess and Petrobras to define the next
steps,&#8221; Exxon said today in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santos contains the government&#8217;s Libra oil field with
estimated deposits of up to 15 billion barrels, and the 6.5-billion-barrel Lula field, the largest oil finds in the Americas
since Mexico discovered Cantarell in 1976. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon operates the block with a 40 percent stake, while New
York-based Hess has 40 percent and Petrobras holds 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Brazil is one of the few growth prospects around that all
of the integrated majors have their eyes on,&#8221; Gianna Bern,
president of Brookshire Advisory and Research Inc., a Chicago-based adviser to oil producers and investors, said in a
telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon fell or 0.8 percent, or 60 cents, to $74.99 at 3:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s ABC is looking to
tap characters from its Marvel comic-book franchise for network
television shows, building from an initial list that includes
the Hulk and AKA Jessica Jones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a little glint in our eye that we would love to
make a Marvel franchise work on our network,&#8221; Paul Lee,
president of ABC Entertainment, said today at a meeting of
television critics in Pasadena, California. &#8220;This won&#8217;t
probably be the only thing we do with Marvel.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney completed its $4 billion purchase of Marvel a year
ago, bringing names such as Spider-Man, X-Men and Iron Man into
a fold that already included Mickey Mouse and Winnie-the-Pooh.
Exploiting Marvel properties on multiple platforms such as film
and TV fits Disney&#8217;s overall strategy, Lee said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is one of the things our company does better than
any company,&#8221; Lee said. &#8220;You can get behind a property and
make it live within the entire company.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company and biggest
theme-park operator, fell 12 cents to $39.33 at 2:01 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares gained 16

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Genworth
Financial Inc. put spreads before the insurer&#8217;s February
earnings release because the company may post further losses on
mortgage guarantees, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Amyn Bharwani and Marko Kolanovic recommended buying February $14 puts and selling
February $11 puts. The move, known as a spread strategy, caps
potential gains while cutting the cost of the trade. Genworth is
scheduled to report results Feb. 1 and hold an investor meeting
the next day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We expect the division to continue to generate losses
through 2011,&#8221; the strategists wrote in a note today, referring
to the company&#8217;s protection business. Citing the firm&#8217;s analyst,
Jimmy Bhullar, they wrote, &#8220;In our view, management is unlikely
to announce any dramatic strategic or capital management actions
in its 2011 outlook, so we do not view the company&#8217;s February 2,
2011, investor meeting as a positive catalyst.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genworth shares have risen 22 percent since the end of
2009, compared with a 14 percent rise for the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index. Of the 16 analysts that cover Genworth tracked by
Bloomberg, five rate the shares a &#8220;buy,&#8221; 10 a &#8220;hold&#8217;&#8221; and
one a &#8220;sell.&#8221; After the company&#8217;s last three earnings reports,
the shares dropped between 9 percent and 13 percent, according
to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buying the spread becomes profitable when the shares go
below about $13.30, the strategists said. The trade makes the
most if the shares fall below $11. Genworth fell 1.9 percent to
$13.95 as of 11:05 a.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trans-Alaska Pipeline System
that carries 15 percent of U.S. crude output will restart in

JPMorgan Chase  Co. said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ``very, very minor leak'' should be repaired within
two-to-three days, the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;``At present, exports have not been halted, but it is hard
to make up this supply loss. West Coast refiners are likely to
be looking for alternatives, which will tend to benefit Oman and

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. economy, led by rising
exports and domestic investment, will avoid a Japan-style &#8220;lost
decade&#8221; to emerge strengthened this year, Jim O&#8217;Neill, chairman
of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s asset-management business, wrote
in the Financial Times today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvements in the U.S. savings rate following the credit
crisis of late 2008 and 2009, favorable demographics and high
productivity mean the U.S. may &#8220;at some stage&#8221; return to a
growth trend of &#8220;close to 3 percent,&#8221; he wrote in the opinion
piece. The &#8220;decisiveness&#8221; of U.S. central bankers, policy
makers and politicians in providing monetary and fiscal stimulus
together with commitments to long-term fiscal improvements has
&#8220;given business that further lift that was necessary,&#8221; he
wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the BRIC nations, which comprise Brazil, Russia, India and China, and the next largest 11 countries such as
Indonesia, Turkey and South Korea, the U.S. will help drive and
share in the benefits of world growth, wrote O&#8217;Neill, who coined
the acronym &#8220;BRIC.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. equities will outperform so-called emerging markets
for part of the year as the dollar strengthens against most
currencies, with the Chinese yuan being one exception, he said.
U.S. Treasures will weaken, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two Goldman Sachs Group Inc. traders
are preparing to start their own hedge fund after new financial
regulations restricted banks from risking capital on speculative
bets, said a person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ariel Roskis and Daniele Benatoff, who work for New York-
based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s principal strategies desk in London, plan
to start the fund in the second quarter, said the person, who
declined to be identified before the plans are announced. The
pair have secured a $300 million investment from Brummer 
Partners, the largest Scandinavian hedge fund, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is losing traders as it moves to comply with
a provision of the U.S.&#8217;s Dodd-Frank financial rules that
prohibits banks from betting capital for their own accounts.
Nine employees left in October to start a unit at private equity
firm KKR  Co. that will invest in stocks. Pierre-Henri Flamand,
the former head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Principal Strategies group,
retired last year to start his own hedge fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roskis and Benatoff didn&#8217;t immediately return phone calls
seeking comment. A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London
declined to comment. Jacob Lannero, a spokesman for Brummer 
Partners, declined to discuss Roskis and Benatoff&#8217;s plans. The
departures were reported earlier by the Financial Times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Sze, who succeeded Flamand as Goldman Sachs&#8217;s global
head of the principal strategies unit, is starting a hedge fund
that will mostly invest in Asia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Threadneedle Hire &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Threadneedle Asset Management, a unit of Ameriprise Financial Inc., today hired Irina Miklavchich, an
executive director in Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Principal Strategies
group. Based in London, she will manage funds investing in
equities in emerging markets, the firm said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs initially planned for most members of the
Principal Strategies unit to leave together and form a hedge
fund. The company then decided to disband the group, which had
about 70 employees, people familiar with the matter said in
September. Wall Street&#8217;s most profitable investment bank made
about 10 percent of its revenue from proprietary trading, Chief
Financial David Viniar said a year ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank Act, signed by U.S. President Barack Obama
in July, allows banks at least four years to bring their
proprietary trading into compliance with the law, according to
law firm Davis Polk  Wardwell LLP. Congress approved the
legislation in an attempt to limit risky trading and investing
by depositary institutions in response to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;

generic version of the kidney drug Sensipar until at least 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva can&#8217;t enter the market until the last of three patents
expires, U.S. District Judge Harvey Bartle in Wilmington, Delaware, ruled Jan. 7. The judge rejected Teva&#8217;s arguments that
the patents are invalid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensipar, whose chemical name is cinacalcet hydrochloride,
generated $320 million in U.S. sales in the first nine months of
last year for Amgen, the Thousand Oaks, California-based company
said Oct. 25. Amgen, along with patent partners NPS
Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Brigham  Women&#8217;s Hospital Inc. of Boston, sued in 2008 to prevent Teva from selling a copy of the
medicine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One patent expires in 2015, and two expire in 2016,
according to information on the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration&#8217;s website. NPS spokeswoman Susan Mesco said one
of the patents has been extended until March 2018, to compensate
the company for the time it took to receive regulatory approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For NPS, the ruling may mean about $300 million in
additional royalties through the life of the patents, said
Francois Nader, chief executive officer of the Bedminster, New
Jersey-based company. The Sensipar royalties have helped fund
the company&#8217;s research into two other medicines that are
undergoing testing, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a nice cushion to have the royalty stream of this
magnitude,&#8221; Nader said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teva, based in Petah Tikva, Israel, filed a lawsuit in
2009, claiming Amgen&#8217;s drug is &#8220;made in part by use of a
process that infringes&#8221; a Teva patent. That case is pending in
federal court in Philadelphia. Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for
Teva, said the company had no comment on the Jan. 6 decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Polk, a spokesman for Amgen, didn&#8217;t have an immediate
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensipar, first approved by regulators in 2004, is used to
treat complications from kidney disease. The drug lowers high
parathyroid-hormone levels -- a condition linked to heart and
bone problems -- in patients receiving kidney dialysis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Delaware case is Brigham  Women&#8217;s Hospital Inc. v.
Teva Pharmaceuticals USA Inc., 08cv464, U.S. District Court,
District of Delaware (Wilmington). The Pennsylvania case is Teva
Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. v. Amgen Inc., 09cv2256, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Sues Novartis&#8217; Sandoz Unit Over Vfend Antifungal Drug &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest drugmaker, sued the Sandoz
unit of Switzerland&#8217;s Novartis AG in federal court in Delaware,
alleging infringement of two U.S. patents for the antifungal
medicine Vfend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug is used to treat people with fungal infections
related to AIDS and other diseases that affect immune systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sandoz is accused of infringing patents 5,364,938, issued
in November 1994; and 6,632,803, issued in October 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit aimed to keep generic copies of the drug off the
market until the patents expire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is represented by Jack B. Blumenfeld and Maryellen
Noreika of Wilmington&#8217;s Morris, Nichols, Arsht  Tunnell LLP and
Bruce R. Genderson, Christopher N. Manning and Jamie Lynne
Simpson of Washington&#8217;s Williams  Connolly LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Pfizer Inc. V. Sandoz Inc., 1:11-cv-00023-UNA,
U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrari Seeks Patents on Driver-Monitoring Technology &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferrari SpA filed applications to patent an automotive
technology that will adjust a car&#8217;s stability and traction
control systems to conform with a driver&#8217;s physical and mental
state, the U.K.&#8217;s Autocar.co.uk website reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The applications cover a network of biometric sensors to
monitor the driver&#8217;s blood pressure, heart rate, respiration,
eye blink rate, electrical activity in the brain, surface
temperature and degree of perspiration, according to Autocar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diagrams accompanying the applications indicate that
sensors would be mounted through the automobile&#8217;s cabin,
including its ceiling, dashboard, the steering wheel and the
driver&#8217;s seat area, Autocar reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its applications, Modena, Italia-based Ferrari says the
car&#8217;s dynamic performance may be modified to enhance driving
safety, or, in the case of &#8220;an alert, responsive driver,&#8221; to
enhance driving pleasure and/or performance, according to
Autocar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Potter&#8217; Copyright Suit Against Scholastic Dismissed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Scholastic Corp., U.S. publisher of the bestselling &#8220;Harry
Potter&#8221; novels, won a copyright-infringement lawsuit brought by
the estate of an author claiming one of the books copied his
work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Shira Scheindlin in Manhattan dismissed
the suit brought by the trustee for the estate of Adrian Jacobs
against New York-based Scholastic because the books were too
different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The contrast between the total concept and feel of the
works is so stark that any serious comparison of the two strains
credulity,&#8221; Scheindlin wrote in an opinion filed Jan. 6,
granting Scholastic&#8217;s motion to dismiss the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trustee claimed J.K. Rowling&#8217;s &#8220;Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire,&#8221; the fourth of the seven novels in the series,
copied Jacobs&#8217;s &#8220;The Adventures of Willy the Wizard -- No. 1
Livid Land.&#8221; &#8220;Goblet&#8221; was published in the U.S. and the U.K.
in 2000. &#8220;Willy&#8221; came out in the U.K. in 1987 and hasn&#8217;t been
published in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scheindlin noted that &#8220;Willy,&#8221; a 32-page work with 16
pages of illustrations, is about an adult who takes part in a
wizards&#8217; contest. &#8220;Goblet,&#8221; a 734-page novel with few
illustrations, features a teenager who participates in a
tournament between rival schools of magic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estate of Jacobs &#8220;regrets&#8221; that its lawsuit has been
dismissed, Max Markson, a spokesman, said in an e-mailed
statement. &#8220;The estate&#8217;s U.S. attorneys are presently analyzing
the judgment with a view to lodging an appeal,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowling&#8217;s  Harry Potter&#8221; novels have sold 400 million
copies worldwide, and there are 141 million in print in the
U.S., said Kyle Good, a spokeswoman for Scholastic. There are 19
million copies of &#8220;Goblet&#8221; in print in the U.S., she said.
Scholastic doesn&#8217;t release U.S. sales figures for the novels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacobs died in 1997. In the complaint, the trustee said
that Jacobs and Rowling were represented at one time by the same
literary agent, Christopher Little. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. ruling has &#8220;no legal bearing&#8221; on a copyright
case brought by the estate in the U.K. against Rowling and her
British publisher, Bloomsbury Publishing Plc, Markson said. He
said that case is scheduled for trial in February 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Allen v. Scholastic, 10-5335, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). The U.K. case
is GLC 72/10 Allen v. Bloomsbury Publishing Plc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dispatch Demands Takedown of &#8216;Golden Voice&#8217; Video from YouTube &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Columbus Dispatch, whose video of a homeless man with a
&#8220;golden voice&#8221; was seen by millions on Google Inc.&#8217;s YouTube
video-sharing site, demanded the removal of the video and
claimed its copyright was infringed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The video of Ted Williams triggered a media frenzy that
included multiple television appearances including a televised
reunion with his elderly mother. Williams was also reportedly
offered announcing jobs by several media outlets and the
Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement posted on the newspaper website Jan. 7, the
Dispatch said the video was posted on YouTube by an unauthorized
person Jan. 4, and that this posting violated the newspaper&#8217;s
copyright. Following the Dispatch&#8217;s demand under the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, YouTube removed the video, according
to the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At no time was &#8216;The Columbus Dispatch&#8217; trying to prevent
anyone from seeing our video,&#8221; the newspaper said in its
statement. The Dispatch has since reposted the video on YouTube
&#8220;under our copyright,&#8221; the company said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. IP Seminar to Address Issues Related to Royal Wedding &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anticipation of the royal wedding in April, a U.K.
provider of continuing legal education is presenting a seminar
on IP issues related to the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The April 29 wedding of Prince William and Katherine
Middleton will raise many questions related to IP rights,
according to the brochure promoting the seminar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central Law Training of Birmingham in the U.K. is offering
&#8220;The Royal Wedding and British Business: Intellectual Property
Perspectives on Major Events,&#8221; a one-day seminar set for Feb. 8
in London. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the topics that will be covered are the IP business
generated by weddings and other royal events; royal trademarks;
getting clearance for royal memorabilia; and what to do with
unsold stock after the event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other issues to be covered are ambush marketing, the use of
clips and short audio-visual extracts from the televised
coverage of the wedding, and fashion IP issues raised in
connection with the wedding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nicola Solomon of London-based Finers Stephens Innocent LLP
is making the presentation on the fashion issues. According to
the brochure, she will discuss copyright, design rights and
other issues arising from Katherine Middleton&#8217;s wedding dress
and wedding ring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwest Specialty Claims &#8216;Spontaneous Combustion&#8217; Infringed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwest Specialty Foods Inc., a Phoenix-based maker of
hot sauces, sued an Ohio competitor for trademark infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the complaint filed Jan. 6 in federal court in
Phoenix, Crazy Uncle Jester&#8217;s Inferno World LLC of Dayton, Ohio,
is accused of infringing Southwest Specialty&#8217;s &#8220;Spontaneous
Combustion&#8221; trademark. The Arizona company claims it has used
the mark since January 1996, and that it&#8217;s harmed by Uncle
Jester&#8217;s registration of the same mark in January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its court papers, Southwest says it registered the
phrase as a trademark in 1997, and the mark was canceled in
April 2008. Southwest said it &#8220;had no intent to abandon the
mark and has never abandoned the mark.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a January 2009 BusinessWeek story, the hot
sauce industry does an annual $2 billion in business. In
addition to &#8220;Spontaneous Combustion,&#8221; Southwest also offers
&#8220;Hot Sauce from Hell,&#8221; &#8220;Ass Blaster Hot Sauce&#8221; and &#8220;Whoop
Ass Chipotle Fire&#8221; hot sauce. Crazy Uncle Jester offers
&#8220;Louisiana Firestorm&#8221; and &#8220;Ultimate Pepperhead,&#8221; in addition
to its &#8220;Spontaneous Combustion&#8221; sauce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Arizona company claims it has suffered injury and
damages from the Ohio company&#8217;s use of the mark and accuses
Crazy Uncle Jester of conduct that &#8220;evidences an evil hand
guided by an evil mind.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwest Specialty asked the court for an order barring
Crazy Uncle Jester&#8217;s use of &#8220;Spontaneous Combustion&#8221; and for
awards of money damages, extra damages to punish the Ohio
company for its actions, and for awards of attorney fees and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crazy Uncle Jester didn&#8217;t respond immediately to an
e-mailed request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwest Specialty is represented by Ray K. Harris of
Fennemore Craig PC of Phoenix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Southwest Specialty Foods Inc. v. Crazy Uncle
Jester&#8217;s Inferno World LLC, 2:11-cv-00048-0SRB, U.S. District
Court, District of Arizona (Phoenix). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. will
select Exxon Mobil Corp., Occidental Petroleum Corp. or Royal
Dutch Shell Plc this quarter to help develop the $10 billion
Shah natural-gas project, a company official said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi National, known as Adnoc, is deciding which of
the three will join Shah after the original foreign partner, ConocoPhillips, withdrew from the project in April. The project
is still on track for completion in 2014, according to the
official, who declined to be identified because a formal
statement won&#8217;t be issued until a partner is chosen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adnoc unit Abu Dhabi Gas Development Co. is pressing ahead
with plans to develop reserves of sour, or high-sulfur, gas to
meet soaring power consumption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Techint Group, Dodsal Group and Al-Jaber Group won
contracts worth $1.1 billion this month to transport and process
the sulfur. The project will process 1 billion cubic feet of
sour gas into 540 million cubic feet a day of fuel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United Arab Emirates holds the fourth-largest gas
reserves in the Middle East. Public relations officials for
Occidental in Abu Dhabi and Shell in Dubai declined to comment.
Exxon Mobil officials in Abu Dhabi did not immediately respond
to e-mails and calls requesting comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reliance Industries Ltd., India&#8217;s
biggest company by market value, probably boosted earnings for
the December quarter by 5 percent from the previous three months
because of oil processing gains, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;strong&#8221; diesel spread and the gap between lighter and
heavier crude oil grades will increase gross refining margins
for the Mumbai-based company to $8.75 a barrel from $7.90 in the
period ended Sept. 30, Pradeep Mirchandani and Neil Gupte,
Mumbai-based analysts at the U.S. bank, said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Polyester spreads have been robust on the back of
elevated cotton prices with the potential of a lower-than-
anticipated output from India,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional gross refining margins rose to $4.55 a barrel from
$4.23 in the second quarter as diesel margins remained
&#8220;robust,&#8221;and light-heavy differentials rose, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reliance shares fell as much as 1.4 percent to 1,050.60
rupees in Mumbai trading today. The stock has declined 4.1
percent in the past year compared with the 11 percent gain in
the benchmark Sensitive Index of the Bombay Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Microsoft Corp. led the
winners of U.S. patents in 2010 during a 31 percent record jump
in grants of a main safeguard of intellectual property. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, became
the first company to get more than 5,000 patents in a single
year, according to data from researcher IFI Claims Patent
Services. Samsung trailed IBM&#8217;s 5,896 patents with 4,551, while
Microsoft received 3,094, IFI said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office improved turnaround
times by processing applications more efficiently, contributing
to &#8220;the most significant annual increase on record,&#8221; IFI said.
The gain also shows the effects of the worst recession since the
Great Depression failed to deter companies from continuing to
innovate, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT, a
Hayward, California-based information technology researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Significant temporary blips in the economy can&#8217;t be
something that derails dedication to technical excellence and
the next new thing,&#8221; King said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 10 companies on IFI&#8217;s list -- all technology
related -- each saw an increase from the year earlier. In all,
the U.S. issued a record 219,614 utility patents in the calendar
year, according to the Wilmington, Delaware-based researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earthquake, Traffic Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the largest owner of U.S. patents, received protection
last year for an earthquake detection system, a way to predict
traffic and a computer chip that combines electrical and optical
devices on a single silicon wafer. IBM&#8217;s number of new patents
rose 20 percent in 2010, putting the Armonk, New York-based
company at the top of IFI&#8217;s list for the 18th straight year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not all of our inventions get commercialized, but
virtually all start with the research and intent to
commercialize them,&#8221; Manny Schecter, IBM&#8217;s chief patent
counsel, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company spends $6 billion a year on research and
collects about $1 billion from its intellectual property, with
patent licensing the most common part, Schecter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camera company Canon Inc. and plasma-TV maker Panasonic
Corp., both of Japan, rounded out the top five companies on the
IFI list. Apple Inc., maker of the iPad and iPhone, broke into
the top 50 for the first time, at No. 46, by almost doubling its
number of new patents to 563, according to IFI. Samsung&#8217;s number
increased 26 percent, while Microsoft&#8217;s rose 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Micron Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one of the top 50 companies saw a decrease, computer-
memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc., IFI said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFI, a unit of Wolters Kluwer NV, conducts the survey each
year to rank 2,000 companies as part of its database system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tremendous increase in patent issues in 2010 suggests
that so far the economy doesn&#8217;t appear to have slowed patent
flow significantly in the U.S.,&#8221; Darlene Slaughter, general
manager of IFI, said in the statement. &#8220;The bottom line: There
is still a backlog of patents pending, but the number of grants
continues to grow even after a period of economic downturn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*

&lt;p&gt;A new division called institutional client services will
report revenue and pretax earnings from bond, currency,
commodity and stock trading as well as prime brokerage, New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in a report today. A unit called
investing and lending will show results from investments with
the firm&#8217;s own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new system, which takes effect immediately, is a result
of the report issued today that also spells out efforts to
enhance the firm&#8217;s focus on clients. Providing separate figures
for how much Goldman Sachs makes from trading and investing with
its own money, considered a risky and unpredictable business,
may lead investors to assign more value to the rest of the
firm&#8217;s trading business, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at
Portales Partners in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re going to get a better sense of what is really more
of a constant in terms of revenues versus what is volatility,&#8221;
Peabody said. &#8220;People will gain greater confidence on the
reproducibility of that trading revenue.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. may begin
restoring its dividend, cut during the height of the financial
crisis, in the second quarter, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re waiting for guidance from regulators about on what
basis are they going to let firms pay dividends, buy back stock
or do other things,&#8221; Dimon said in an interview today on CNBC
television from the company&#8217;s annual health-care conference in San Francisco. &#8220;Now it looks more like the second quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board hasn&#8217;t decided on a specific increase, with the
New York-based bank hoping eventually to pay 30 percent to 35
percent of normalized earnings, Dimon said earlier at the
conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to do it in one jump. So we may do
something like 75 cents or a dollar,&#8221; he told attendees. &#8220;I
think we&#8217;re going to be allowed to pay a dividend, but I could
be sitting here a year from now and be embarrassed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 54, said in October that he was &#8220;reasonably
hopeful&#8221; the firm, which cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents
in 2009, will be able to raise that payment in 2011&#8217;s first
quarter and that regulators were open to the idea. JPMorgan has
been buying back its own stock in the meantime, repurchasing
$2.6 billion of shares through the third quarter. The bank is
scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest threat to the U.S. economy is the &#8220;huge&#8221;
fiscal deficit, which could &#8220;crimp our style&#8221; if not
addressed, Dimon said. While some municipalities may default on
their debts, it won&#8217;t be a &#8220;disaster,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
$1.83 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis and the
highest U.S. jobless rate in 26 years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of new overdue loans eased over
the second and third quarters as the U.S. economy recovered. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. restored oil
production at an offshore platform in its Eugene Island field
after a one-hour shutdown yesterday, according to Scott Walker,
a company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chevron shut in a shallow-water platform in the Gulf of
Mexico&#8217;s Eugene Island field yesterday which resulted in a
release of 0.00717 gallons of oil,&#8221; Walker said in an e-mailed
statement today. &#8220;The production has been restored and the
shut-in lasted less than an hour.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one was injured and the integrity of the platform wasn&#8217;t
affected, according to the Houston-based spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Coast Guard didn&#8217;t plan to send any investigators
to the platform site, Petty Officer Steve Lehmann said in a
telephone interview from New Orleans. There was no report of any
structural problem with the platform, Lehmann said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will
disclose more financial information and change the way it sells
some products, according to a report prepared by a committee of
employees created after a U.S. regulator sued the firm for fraud
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report makes 39 recommendations about how New York-
based Goldman Sachs should change its business practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We act in many capacities, including as an advisor,
fiduciary, market maker and underwriter,&#8221; the report said. &#8220;We
must be clear to ourselves and our clients about the capacity in
which we are acting and the responsibilities we have assumed.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recommendations emerged eight months after the firm
established a committee of employees led by E. Gerald Corrigan
and J. Michael Evans to review business standards in the wake of
the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s fraud lawsuit. The
company settled the matter in July by agreeing to pay $550
million, and said it made a &#8220;mistake&#8221; in omitting disclosure
to investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will begin &#8220;providing plain language
explanations to our clients about the firm&#8217;s conflicts-
resolution and business-selection processes, including
describing activities we may continue to conduct while we are
advising or financing a particular client,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Business Standards Committee was established by Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein to examine the firm&#8217;s
responsibilities to clients, review how Goldman Sachs identifies
and manages conflicts of interest, and consider whether
financial reporting and public disclosure could improve. The
committee also looked at whether the firm was properly selling
complex products, adequately training employees and whether
firmwide operating committees could become more effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs will start breaking out four revenue areas
instead of three and will begin providing a simplified balance
sheet that shows assets by business unit and activity, the
report said. The firm will also begin providing more detail on
credit risk, operational risk and capital adequacy, the report
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Poland&#8217;s central bank may raise interest rates as early as this month, making the zloty an
attractive investment, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said, while
warning that the currency&#8217;s appreciation will be gradual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Evidence is growing that the central bank will soon
embark on a tightening cycle,&#8221; Magdalena Polan and Themos Fiotakis, London-based economists at Goldman Sachs, wrote in an
e-mailed note. &#8220;Against a backdrop of loose fiscal policy and
tighter monetary policy, the currency is set to benefit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank is more likely to raise rates this month
after Governor Marek Belka argued for higher rates to damp
inflationary expectations, reversing the position he took last
year. Polish inflation probably accelerated to 3.1 percent in
December, the Finance Ministry said on Jan. 3. The central bank
targets inflation of 2.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The market is pricing in a quarter-point rate increase in
January, with a high probability of similar move in March,
according to Goldman Sachs. This may be followed by further
increases that would push the rate to 4.75 percent by year-end,
the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is close to our own views on the Polish tightening
cycle,&#8221; Polan and Fiotakis wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zloty is fairly valued at around 3.55 per euro, about 9
percent stronger than current levels, according to Goldman
Sachs&#8217;s valuation models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is quite likely that we touch those levels as the
cycle matures,&#8221; Polan and Fiotakis wrote. The zloty
strengthened to 3.8879 per euro as of 2:17 p.m. in Warsaw, from
3.9060 late yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pace of appreciation will only be gradual,&#8221; because
&#8220;rapid currency appreciation could offset the need for higher
rates,&#8221; Goldman Sachs said. The bank advised investors to wait
for a drop in the zloty because levels from 3.95 to 4 per euro
present a &#8220;much more interesting risk-reward.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp., Samsung Electronics Co. and Microsoft Corp. led the
winners of U.S. patents in 2010, when grants of a main safeguard
of intellectual property jumped 31 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s biggest computer-services provider, became
the first company to get more than 5,000 patents in a year,
according to data from researcher IFI Claims Patent Services.
Samsung trailed IBM&#8217;s 5,896 patents with 4,551, while Microsoft
received 3,094, IFI said in a statement yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office improved turnaround
times by processing applications more efficiently, contributing
to &#8220;the most significant annual increase on record,&#8221; IFI said.
The gain also shows that the worst recession since the Great
Depression failed to deter companies from continuing to
innovate, said Charles King, principal analyst at Pund-IT, a
Hayward, California-based information technology researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Significant temporary blips in the economy can&#8217;t be
something that derails dedication to technical excellence and
the next new thing,&#8221; King said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The top 10 companies on IFI&#8217;s list -- all technology
related -- each saw an increase from the year before. In all,
the U.S. issued a record 219,614 utility patents in calendar
2010, according to the Wilmington, Delaware-based researcher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the largest owner of U.S. patents, received protection
last year for an earthquake-detection system, a way to predict
traffic and a computer chip that combines electrical and optical
devices on a single silicon wafer. IBM&#8217;s number of new patents
rose 20 percent in 2010, putting the Armonk, New York-based
company at the top of IFI&#8217;s list for the 18th straight year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Not all of our inventions get commercialized, but
virtually all start with the research and intent to
commercialize them,&#8221; Manny Schecter, IBM&#8217;s chief patent
counsel, said in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company spends $6 billion a year on research and
collects about $1 billion from its intellectual property, with
patent licensing the most common part, Schecter said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camera company Canon Inc. and plasma-TV maker Panasonic
Corp., both of Japan, rounded out the top five on the IFI list. Apple Inc., maker of the iPad and iPhone, broke into the top 50
for the first time, at No. 46, by almost doubling its number of
new patents to 563, according to IFI. Samsung&#8217;s number increased
26 percent, while Microsoft&#8217;s rose 6.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just one of the top 50 companies saw a decrease, computer-
memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc., IFI said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IFI, a unit of Wolters Kluwer NV, conducts the survey each
year to rank 2,000 companies as part of its database system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The tremendous increase in patent issues in 2010 suggests
that so far the economy doesn&#8217;t appear to have slowed patent
flow significantly in the U.S.,&#8221; Darlene Slaughter, general
manager of IFI, said in the statement. &#8220;There is still a
backlog of patents pending, but the number of grants continues
to grow even after a period of economic downturn.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fujifilm Wins Reversal of $3 Million St. Clair Patent Verdict &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Fujifilm Holdings Corp. won reversal of a 2004 verdict in
which it was told to pay a Michigan company $3 million for
infringing patents on an invention that stores digital images in
computer memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A judge erred in his interpretation of the patents owned by
closely held St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants Inc.,
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington
said yesterday. Both sides had agreed that if the court sided
with Fujifilm on the definition of key terms in the patents,
then there was no infringement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2-1 decision, the appeals court said that under the
correct interpretation of patent terms, there was no
infringement, and reversed the jury verdict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants
Inc. v Canon Inc., 2009-1052, 2010-1137, and 2010-1140, U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (Washington). The lower
court case is St. Clair Intellectual Property Consultants Inc.
v. Canon Inc., 03CV241, U.S. District Court, District of
Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel to Pay Nvidia $1.5 Billion; Both Cross-License Patents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. agreed to a long-term cross-
license agreement, ending a legal dispute over the use of each
other&#8217;s technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intel will pay Nvidia $1.5 billion over the next five
years, and the companies will receive a license to each other&#8217;s
patents, subject to certain terms, Santa Clara, California-based
Intel said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute centered around Intel&#8217;s assertion in February
2009 that a license held by Nvidia didn&#8217;t cover future products.
Nvidia, a maker of graphics chips, then accused its larger rival
of breaching a contract that let the companies use each other&#8217;s
capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nvidia supplied so-called chipsets that support older model
Intel microprocessors, providing a link to the rest of the
computer and graphics. Intel now includes that functionality in
its processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agreement comes after Intel settled an antitrust case
with rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. and the U.S. government.
Intel is also fighting fines imposed by the European Union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent case is Intel Corp. v. Nvidia Corp., CA4373,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Buffalo Wild Wings Inc., the Minneapolis-based restaurant
chain, is on the verge of being sued for trademark infringement
by a Canadian sports-bar chain, the Toronto Star reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wild Wing, of Aurora, Ontario, which has 75 outlets in
Ontario, registered &#8220;wild wing&#8221; as a Canadian trademark in
2003 and has successfully opposed Buffalo Wild Wings&#8217; attempts
to register the mark in Canada, according to the Star. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. chain told the Star it wouldn&#8217;t
comment until after a suit is filed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buffalo Wild Wings said in August that it would open 50
company-owned and franchised restaurants in Canada, the Star
reported. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ribadu campaign claims it has used the slogan for the

&lt;p&gt;Wang Dan, a leader of China&#8217;s 1989
student movement suppressed by troops in Tiananmen Square, said
he is awaiting Hong Kong&#8217;s response to his request for a visa to
attend commemoration services for local activist Szeto Wah. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No one from the government has had contact with me as of
this time,&#8221; Wang said in an e-mail today. Authorities in Hong
Kong, a special administrative region of China, in 2009 denied
the visa applications of five Chinese activists, including Wang,
as they sought entry to attend an academic seminar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wang Guangya, director of China&#8217;s Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs office, said it&#8217;s up to the city&#8217;s government to decide
on the activist&#8217;s visa application, Radio Television Hong Kong
reported today. The mainland won&#8217;t interfere in Hong Kong
affairs, the broadcaster cited the official as saying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am not able to work out what Wang Guangya&#8217;s statement
would mean,&#8221; Wang Dan said. &#8220;All I can say is I will be
waiting until the last day,&#8221; said the exiled activist, who
studied at Harvard University and taught at Taiwan&#8217;s National
Chengchi University after serving a jail term in China for his
role in the 1989 student movement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Szeto Memorials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There will be memorial services on Jan. 28 and 29 in Hong
Kong for Szeto, the chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in
Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China who died this
month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We do not comment on individual cases,&#8221; according to an
e-mailed statement by the Hong Kong government today. Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said today he has no
information on Wang Dan&#8217;s visa status at a regular press
briefing in Beijing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong, a British colony until 1997, is a semi-
autonomous region of China with its own legal system and a
constitution that includes guarantees of free speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Student demonstrators calling for government reform and an
end to corruption occupied Tiananmen Square in the heart of
Beijing for five weeks in the spring of 1989. Between the
evening of June 3 and the early hours of June 4, soldiers backed
by tanks opened fire on civilians in and around the square. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beijing&#8217;s mayor said in a 1989 report to the government
that about 200 civilians died. The U.S. Embassy in the city
estimated that the death toll exceeded 1,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. renewed its
November recommendation to buy gasoil futures as cold weather
spurs demand in Europe and China, even as blizzards undercut
consumption in the U.S. Northeast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy March 2011 contracts in London as
Europe consumes more heating fuel, Goldman analysts led by New
York-based David Greely said in a weekly report dated yesterday.
Continued power disruptions in China and floods in Australia&#8217;s
Queensland state, which may affect supply of thermal coal, will
boost diesel-fired power generation in the Asian country,
according to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Extreme weather is undercutting U.S. demand while
supporting demand in Europe and China,&#8221; Goldman said in the
report. &#8220;We continue to expect improving fundamentals to
provide additional support to prices.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude futures in New York rose for a fourth month in
December as arctic temperatures in Europe boosted demand for
heating fuels. Conversely, New York&#8217;s heaviest December
snowfalls in six decades cut transportation-fuel use in the
U.S., the world&#8217;s largest oil consumer, according to the Goldman
report. A new storm that forced the cancellation of thousands of
flights across the U.S. South yesterday may bring as much as 14
inches (36 centimeters) of snow to the East Coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman on Nov. 10 said investors should buy January gasoil
on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The contracts,
which expire Jan. 31, have made a profit of $35.25 a metric ton,
the bank said. Its latest recommendation is to buy March
futures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heating Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Europe still relies quite heavily on oil for heating
purposes,&#8221; the analysts said. The U.S. storms &#8220;dumped between
12 and 32 inches of snow, crippling both private and public
transportation, grounding aircraft and trapping motorists at
home,&#8221; Goldman said in the report. &#8220;As a consequence, U.S.
demand for transportation fuels dropped.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;West Texas Intermediate, the crude traded in New York, may
remain discounted to London-traded Brent oil because stockpiles
are rising in the U.S. Midwest contrary to a wider drop in
supply, according to Goldman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude inventories shrank for a fifth week in the seven
days ended Dec. 31 to 335.3 million barrels, the Energy
Department said last week. That&#8217;s the longest stretch of
declines since July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supplies from Canada and increased production has led to a
surplus in the U.S. Midwest that needs to be shifted to the Gulf
Coast through a &#8220;realignment&#8221; of pipeline infrastructure,
Goldman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discount of West Texas to Brent yesterday widened to
$6.45 a barrel, the most since February 2009, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. It was at $6.24 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-largest U.S. bank by
assets, on Dec. 16 said investors should sell West Texas
contracts and buy Brent to profit from the widening spread. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Slovenia is aiming to attract U.S.
investors, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to the Adriatic
country&#8217;s banking industry, Finance Minister Franc Krizanic
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have met Alexander Dibelius three times as we seek to
attract U.S. investors to Slovenia and we didn&#8217;t speak only
about investing in Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., but also other
banks,&#8221; Krizanic said today in an interview with the Ljubljana-
based public broadcaster TV Slovenija. Dibelius is New York-
based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head of operations in Germany and Austria,
as well as Russia and central and eastern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment on the Slovenia finance minister&#8217;s comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nova Ljubljanska Banka, in which the government holds just
below 50 percent and Belgium&#8217;s KBC Groep NV has a third, has
been seeking a partner as Slovenia&#8217;s biggest bank prepares for a
250 million-euro ($328 million) capital increase. Other banks in
the Adriatic country suffer from bad loans and increased
bankruptcies and also need capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the world&#8217;s most profitable investment bank,
may buy KBC&#8217;s stake in NLB in a partnership with Apax Partners
LLP, the Ljubljana newspaper Finance reported in October 2008,
citing people it didn&#8217;t name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which is also the adviser to Apax, would
make an offer if the Slovenian government invited it to do so,
the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBC, which bought a third of the Slovenian bank in 2002 for
435 million euros, has reiterated that it plans to sell its
holding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, is seeking to sell stakes held by subsidiary XTO in
certain North Sea blocks off the U.K. coast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is offering its 15 percent stake in blocks that
include the Platypus natural-gas discovery, operated by Dana
Petroleum, as well as a 33 percent stake in a Witch Ground
Graben block, according to a posting on a Schlumberger Ltd.-
operated website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The North Sea auction is part of Exxon Mobil Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson&#8217;s plan to shed assets acquired
during its purchase of XTO last year that won&#8217;t generate high
enough returns to meet Exxon&#8217;s internal profit targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We will test the interest of other companies in
particular assets that we think could have relatively higher
value in their portfolios than in ours,&#8221; Patrick McGinn, a
spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, said in an e-mail
today. McGinn declined to comment on a potential price for the
assets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Platypus well found about 130 billion cubic feet of
gas, according to a filing from the operator, Dana Petroleum,
which was acquired last year by Korea National Oil Corp. The
well was drilled in a water depth of about 142 feet (43 meters)
to a total depth of 11,048 feet, Exxon said in today&#8217;s posting.
Dana holds a 45 percent interest in the Platypus discovery,
according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it was willing to consider a transaction that
includes an asset exchange, cash or some combination. Offers on
the blocks are due by March 31, McGinn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online and physical data rooms will open Jan. 24, according
to Exxon&#8217;s posting. A data room is where potential suitors can
get more information about the geological features and other
characteristics of oil fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose 89 cents to $76.58 as of 4:09 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the most
profitable Wall Street firm, and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.
continue to do business together even as the insurer sues the
bank for securities fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re really smart and good people,&#8221; Edmund &#8220;Ted&#8221; Kelly, chief executive officer of Boston-based Liberty Mutual,
said yesterday in an interview. &#8220;We just have some
differences.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs misled investors in 2007 when it sold Fannie
Mae preferred shares and bet against the U.S. mortgage market,
according to a July 8 complaint by Liberty Mutual. The lawsuit
is without merit and Goldman Sachs &#8220;will contest it
vigorously,&#8221; spokesman Michael DuVally said at the time. He
declined to comment today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual&#8217;s lawsuit came after New York-based Goldman
Sachs was criticized in Congress and sued by the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission for transactions tied to the mortgage
market. The Fannie Mae shares that Goldman Sachs helped sell in
2007 were &#8220;virtually worthless&#8221; the next year when the
mortgage-financing firm fell into government conservatorship,
Liberty Mutual said in the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kelly didn&#8217;t elaborate on the business Liberty Mutual does
with the bank. He declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was
filed in U.S. District Court in Boston and transferred in
December to New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed in July to pay $550 million and change
its business practices to settle the SEC&#8217;s claim that the bank
sold a collateralized debt obligation without disclosing that a
hedge fund helped pick underlying securities and bet against the
vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Liberty Mutual v. Goldman Sachs, 10-cv-09184,
U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European refiners are likely to
reduce processing rates amid decreasing profits, according to
analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery run cuts look &#8220;almost inevitable,&#8221; given
weakness in European gasoil and diesel markets, the JPMorgan
analysts, headed by Lawrence Eagles, said in a research note
today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Factors that may delay or offset this drop in runs from
their current seasonal peak include further spikes in weather
related-demand and the goal to build inventories ahead of
planned maintenance in the coming weeks,&#8221; JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining margins in Northwest Europe averaged $2.84 a
barrel in the first quarter to date, according to data posted on
BP Plc&#8217;s website Jan. 6. That&#8217;s down from the first quarter
2010, when margins averaged $4.29 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is changing
the way it discloses financial information, breaking up the unit
known as trading and principal investments that has dominated
revenue in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new division called institutional client services will
report revenue and pretax earnings from bond, currency,
commodity and stock trading as well as prime brokerage, New
York-based Goldman Sachs said in a report yesterday. A unit
called investing and lending will show results from investments
with the firm&#8217;s own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the previous reporting system, Goldman Sachs said
third-quarter 2010 pretax earnings from trading and principal
investments were $2.37 billion, or 84 percent of the total.
Under the new reporting system, institutional client services
accounted for $1.5 billion of pretax earnings and investing and
lending accounted for $846 million, New York-based Goldman Sachs
said in a regulatory filing yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currencies and commodities, known as FICC,
the company&#8217;s largest revenue source, shrinks under the new
reporting system, and equities-trading revenue increased under
the new disclosures. Investment-banking revenue that totaled
$1.12 billion under the old reporting system changes to $1.16
billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes were part of a series of recommendations
prepared by a committee of employees created after the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm for fraud last
year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report makes 39 recommendations about how Goldman Sachs
should change its business practices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance Policy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money Funds Push $24 Billion Backstop as Rules Clash Looms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual-fund industry fleshed out a plan for a private
backstop to money-market funds, rejecting alternatives
considered by U.S. regulators that include abolishing the funds&#8217;
stable $1 net asset value. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The industry&#8217;s plan, proposed in a letter by the
Washington-based Investment Company Institute, calls for fund
companies to finance a private bank with $350 million in assets
that would grow to $24 billion after 10 years. Other options are
impractical, unworkable or fail to address the most important
risk to money funds, the ICI said in its letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rejection puts the fund industry on a collision course
with officials from the Treasury Department and the Securities
and Exchange Commission, who said several ideas laid out in
October by a White House advisory body remain on the table.
Regulators last year enacted one round of rule changes for the
funds to prevent a repeat of the run on money funds that
followed the collapse of the Reserve Primary fund in the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICI&#8217;s submission included a new outline for a private
liquidity facility, first pitched in March. The plan would
create an emergency pool of cash, chartered as a bank or trust,
that would buy commercial paper at full value from prime funds
in the event of another crisis. All prime funds would be
required to participate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank financial overhaul signed into law in July
has made it more difficult for the Fed to make similar emergency
bailouts, and the Troubled Asset Relief Program, under which the
Treasury insured money funds, has expired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the public comment period that ended Jan. 10, the
issue goes to the Financial Stability Oversight Council. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Government Contractors Face New Minority Hiring Mandate &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. financial regulators are required to open 20 offices
this month endowed with new powers to force government
contractors and subcontractors to diversify their staffs or risk
losing federal business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dodd-Frank law orders U.S. financial regulators to set
up Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion to monitor whether
they and their contractors are hiring enough women and
minorities -- a mandate that could have far-reaching effects on
public and private-sector hiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offices are being established at agencies ranging from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to each of the 12 Federal
Reserve banks. Among other duties, staff will scrutinize hiring
at firms that do business with the regulators and take steps to
terminate contracts if the companies haven&#8217;t made an adequate
effort to employ women and minorities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congressional Democrats pushed to include the new offices
in the law because some were unhappy that few of the major
contracts awarded by government agencies in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis went to minority-owned firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law requires each new office to develop and apply a
policy that will ensure &#8220;to the maximum extent possible the
fair inclusion&#8221; of women and minorities in the contracting
process. The federal government defines a minority-owned
business as one that is at least 51 percent-owned and operated
by U.S. citizens who are Asian, black, Hispanic or American
Indian. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street Lobbyists Fight Ownership Caps on Swaps Exchanges &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capping banks&#8217; ownership stakes in clearinghouses,
exchanges or so-called swap execution facility would have
&#8220;potentially profound implications for future market
structure,&#8221; financial-industry lobbyists said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They made the statement in a letter to regulators drafting
rules to govern derivatives markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter was written in response to Justice Department
support for &#8220;more stringent&#8221; regulation and urges the
Commodity Future Trading Commission and Securities and Exchange
Commission &#8220;in the strongest possible terms to forego the
adoption of any aggregate ownership limits.&#8221; It was signed by
groups including the Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association, International Swaps and Derivatives Association and
Financial Services Roundtable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine A. Varney, assistant attorney general in the
Justice Department&#8217;s antitrust division, expressed support for
aggregate ownership caps in a Dec. 28 letter to regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFTC is scheduled to meet on Jan. 13 to complete a
proposal for ownership and governance limits as part of new
regulations required under the Dodd-Frank Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Basel to Set Rules on Debt Securities for Bank Rescues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global banking regulators may decide as soon as this week
on criteria that debt securities must meet to count as capital,
ensuring they contribute to rescuing international lenders on
the brink of failure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is seeking to
ensure the instruments can absorb losses or be converted to
common equity to aid a bank in distress when they are counted as
part of a lenders&#8217; capital. The proposals are scheduled to be
published &#8220;in the next few days,&#8221; the Basel group said in an
e-mail yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators are aiming to avoid a repeat of the financial
turmoil that followed the 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. The European Commission on Jan. 6 proposed that
authorities may be allowed to write down senior debt before
relying on the taxpayer to save a failing lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s &#8220;a likely outcome&#8221; that this month&#8217;s proposal will
include the main ideas of a draft version that was put out for
consultation last August, according to Jonas Niemeyer, who
represents the Swedish central bank at the Basel committee. He
made the remarks in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compliance Action &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SEC Inspector General Probes Khuzami&#8217;s Role in Citi Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s internal
watchdog is reviewing an allegation that Robert Khuzami, the
agency&#8217;s top enforcement official, gave preferential treatment
to Citigroup Inc. executives in the agency&#8217;s $75 million
settlement with the firm in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspector General H. David Kotz opened the probe after a
request from U.S. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican,
who forwarded an unsigned letter making the allegation. Khuzami
told his staff to soften claims against two executives after
conferring with a lawyer representing the bank, according to the
letter. Jon Diat, a Citigroup spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup agreed in July to pay $75 million to resolve SEC
claims that the bank understated investments linked to subprime
mortgages as the housing crisis unfolded. The two men settled
without admitting or denying the SEC&#8217;s allegations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The settlement appropriately held the company and
individuals accountable,&#8221; John Nester, an SEC spokesman, said
Jan. 10 in a statement issued after Khuzami was asked to
comment. &#8220;We stand ready to assist and cooperate with the IG&#8217;s
review.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agency&#8217;s settlement was questioned in August by U.S.
District Judge Ellen Huvelle, who eventually approved it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Relaxes Credit Rules After Stock Market Slide &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission eased some
credit and investment rules to increase liquidity after the
Dhaka Stock Exchange&#8217;s benchmark General Index fell the most in
five years, Chairman Ziual Haque Khondker said in a telephone
interview Jan. 10. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Shanghai Removes Exchange Hurdle for Foreign Private Equity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shanghai&#8217;s government said it will allow foreign private-
equity firms to convert money raised overseas into yuan for
local investments, removing a key hurdle for firms including Blackstone Group LP and Carlyle Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pilot program will initially be open to qualified
foreign investors with at least $1 billion of assets under
management or $500 million of &#8220;owned&#8221; assets, according to a
statement on the website of the Shanghai Financial Services
Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreign private-equity investors have been faced with
restrictions on buying in China, which limits access to
industries it designates as strategic and imposes capital
controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Korea Tightens Derivatives Rules After Nov. 11 Tumble &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Korea&#8217;s financial regulators will limit the number of
derivative equity contracts an investor can hold as authorities
continue investigating the cause of a plunge in the Kospi Index
on Nov. 11. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutional investors will be allowed a maximum of 10,000
futures and options contracts in any &#8220;speculative,&#8221; or open
and unhedged transaction, the Financial Services Commission, the
government&#8217;s policy-making body, said in an e-mailed statement,
without saying when the new rule will become effective. While
institutions are now limited to 7,500 futures contracts and
individuals can hold 5,000 futures contracts, there are no
limits on options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laos Regulator Expects Companies to Raise $8 Billion &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laos, Southeast Asia&#8217;s smallest economy, expects private
companies and state-run enterprises to raise at least $8 billion
in equity and bond sales in the next five years to fund
investments, the market regulator said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communist country opened a stock exchange yesterday,
aiming to integrate with the global economy and join the World
Trade Organization. The exchange will facilitate trading of
government and corporate debt under its five-year plan, allowing
bonds and equities to replace bank loans as the biggest source
of capital for local companies, said Vathana Dalaloy, the acting
secretary general of Laos&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss Banks See Tax as Bigger Threat Than Basel, Survey Finds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swiss banks see measures to curb secrecy and tax evasion as
a bigger threat in 2011 than higher capital-adequacy
requirements, according to a survey by Ernst  Young AG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four percent of the lenders consider Switzerland&#8217;s
double-tax and fiscal information-sharing agreements to be their
biggest concern, the consultants&#8217; firm said in a study released
yesterday in Zurich. That compares with 5 percent who cited new
capital and liquidity rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland has signed information-exchange treaties with
countries wanting to know about their nationals&#8217; holdings in
Swiss banks, and agreed to start talks on taxing the Swiss
assets of people living in the U.K. and Germany. Moves to end
Switzerland&#8217;s bank secrecy will force shareholders to accept
lower returns, said Iqbal Khan, an Ernst  Young partner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A panel appointed by the Swiss government last year
proposed that UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG should have
capital equivalent to at least 19 percent of their assets,
compared with the 10.5 percent needed under the Basel III rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks Said to Face EU Tests on Capital, Liquidity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union regulators are scheduled to discuss plans to
conduct separate stress tests on bank capital and liquidity
provisions at a meeting today, a person familiar with the
negotiations said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supervisors at the European Banking Authority in London
will decide what sort of information lenders should provide for
this year&#8217;s EU-wide stress tests on capital, as well as possible
exams on liquidity, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the meetings are private. Regulators will
also choose an interim chairman to manage the EBA until a
permanent chief is installed later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2010 European stress tests were criticized for not
being stringent enough because lenders were shown by regulators
to need only 3.5 billion euros ($4.5 billion) of new capital,
about a 10th of the lowest analyst estimate. The European
Commission is pushing to include tests on bank liquidity in this
year&#8217;s stress tests in the wake of Ireland&#8217;s financial turmoil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lenders may escape examination of their sovereign debt
holdings in this year&#8217;s round of European stress tests,
according to a document from the Committee of European Banking
Supervisors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Schwab Agrees to Pay $119 Million to Settle SEC Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Charles Schwab Corp. will pay $119 million to settle U.S.
regulatory claims that the San Francisco-based brokerage misled
investors in its YieldPlus Fund and changed investment strategy
without shareholder approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The YieldPlus Fund fell to $1.8 billion in assets in 2008
from a peak of $13.5 billion in 2007 after deviating from its
stated policy by investing more than 25 percent of fund assets
in private-issuer, mortgage-backed securities, the Securities
and Exchange Commission said yesterday in a complaint filed at
federal court in San Francisco. Schwab executives Kimon Daifotis
and Randall Merk committed fraud in offering, selling and
managing the fund, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schwab, the largest independent brokerage by client assets,
settled the regulator&#8217;s claims without admitting or denying
wrongdoing. The case against Daifotis and Merk is continuing,
said the SEC, which is seeking unspecified fines and
disgorgement of any ill-gotten profits from the two men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daifotis&#8217;s attorney David Bayless said his client plans to
contest the SEC&#8217;s allegations in court. Merk also plans to fight
the SEC&#8217;s claims, his attorney Susan Brune said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Schwab would never seek to profit at the expense of its
own clients,&#8221; and will continue to work to bring the matter to
a conclusion, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC settlement also resolves related claims by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Illinois regulators. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cohan, Levitt Comment on Goldman Revenue Disclosure Plan &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Cohan, author of &#8220;House of Cards&#8221; and a Bloomberg
Television contributing editor, talked about Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.&#8217;s reported decision to disclose more about how it makes
money as part of an effort to repair a reputation blemished when
a U.S. regulator sued the firm for fraud last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohan, who spoke with Deirdre Bolton on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;InsideTrack,&#8221; said &#8220;real change takes time&#8221;
and the current development is &#8220;mostly PR.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Arthur Levitt, former U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission chairman and a policy adviser to Goldman Sachs, said
it&#8217;s doubtful its disclosure plan would be adopted by other Wall
Street financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Levitt talked with Bloomberg&#8217;s Ken Prewitt and Tom Keene on

&lt;p&gt;European Union securities regulators voted to install
Portugal&#8217;s Carlos Tavares as acting chief of the European
Securities and Markets Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulators from the 27 EU member states met in Paris
yesterday to decide on a temporary chairman for the agency,
which was established Jan. 1 to replace the Committee of
European Securities Regulators. Tavares was previously chairman
of CESR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Parliament voted last year to establish
authorities in London, Paris and Frankfurt to regulate the
banking, securities and insurance industries respectively, which
would have the power to mediate between national supervisors and

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. said
it plans to flare gases from an ethylene unit at its Port Arthur
facility in Texas, according to a filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flaring, or release of gases into the air, will start
today and last until Feb. 1, and is related to &#8220;planned
maintenance activity&#8221; on a so-called acetylene converter,
according to the filing with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical is a joint venture between Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips. Flaring is a safety measure
that prevents excessive pressure from building up in processing
units that are being shut down or started up. Ethylene is used
in plastics. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European investment banks led by
Credit Suisse Group AG and UBS AG may benefit from the so-called
Volcker rule that will create opportunities in market-making,
JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limits on U.S. investment banks&#8217; proprietary trading in
making markets for clients imposed by the Volcker rule are a
&#8220;material positive earnings potential for European investment
banks,&#8221; the analysts, led by Kian Abouhossein, wrote in a note
to investors today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule, named after former U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Paul Volcker, bans banks from risking capital by
wagering for their own accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volcker rule provisions are unlikely to be implemented in
Europe, benefiting banks such as Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Plc, BNP Paribas SA and Societe Generale SA, said the analysts, who
wrote two notes on the subject today. UBS and Credit Suisse are
JPMorgan&#8217;s top picks because they are well capitalized, they
said. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. may have the most to lose from
new regulation, according to the note. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk-reward is now in favor of European investment
banks,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan lowered Goldman&#8217;s stock rating to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable investment bank, predicts the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will rally 18 percent to 1,500 by the end of
December and Treasuries will have a &#8220;decent&#8221; year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have a very out-of-consensus view for how much the
economy can grow before this growth generates higher inflation
and interest rates,&#8221; Jan Hatzius, the company&#8217;s New York-based
chief U.S. economist, wrote in a report he distributed by e-mail
today. &#8220;If we&#8217;re right, the likely implication is a decent
environment for the Treasury bond market and a very good
environment for the equity market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has climbed 12 percent over the past year,
rising to the highest level since Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc.&#8217;s bankruptcy in September 2008 as Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke pumps $600 billion into the economy and President Barack Obama extends tax cuts. An advance to 1,500 would result
in a 19 percent gain for the year. The index has only risen that
much twice in the past decade, gaining 23 percent in 2009 and 26
percent in 2003. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. three-month bill rates will average 0.2 percent in
2011 and 0.3 percent in 2012, the report said, compared with
0.14 percent today. Ten-year Treasury yields will rise to 3.75
percent by Dec. 31 from 3.35 percent now, according to Goldman,
which is one of the 18 primary dealers that are authorized to
trade directly with the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quicker Growth &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s biggest economy will expand 3.4 percent this
year, the report said, quickening from 2.6 percent in the third
quarter of 2010, which are the most recent figures available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. consumer price index will increase 1.7 percent,
Goldman predicts, versus 1.1 percent that the government
reported for November from a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low inflation helps preserve the value of a bond&#8217;s fixed
payments. Ten-year real rates, what investors get after
accounting for costs in the economy, have doubled over the past
year to 2.24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s report reiterated forecasts for the SP 500 and 10-
year yields that Goldman Sachs issued at the end of 2010 and
earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said he expects more U.S.
municipalities to declare bankruptcy and urged caution when
investing in the $2.9 trillion public-debt market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There have been six or seven municipal bankruptcies
already,&#8221; Dimon, 54, said yesterday at his company&#8217;s annual
health-care conference in San Francisco. &#8220;I think unfortunately
you will see more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities including Detroit and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, have
raised the prospect of bankruptcy. Still, the number of filings
has declined. Five municipal entities sought protection in 2010
compared with 10 in 2009, according to data compiled by James Spiotto, head of the bankruptcy practice at Chapman  Cutler, a
Chicago law firm. The biggest last year was a South Carolina
toll road with more than $300 million in debt, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. states will contend with about $140 billion in
deficits in the next fiscal year, the Center on Budget and
Policy Priorities, a Washington research group, said in a report
issued Dec. 16. Edmund &#8220;Ted&#8221; Kelly, CEO of Liberty Mutual
Holding Co., said yesterday that his firm had reduced holdings
of municipal debt in Connecticut, California and Illinois. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market is being held up to some extent by the belief
that the federal government will bail out&#8221; state and local
issuers, Kelly said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vallejo, California, filed for bankruptcy in 2008 after
failing to win union pay cuts. Detroit Public Schools, which
considered bankruptcy protection last year, said this month the
district may try a restructuring to deal with a $327 million
deficit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yield Soars &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tax-exempt municipal-bond yields soared amid a U.S.
Treasury selloff and expiration of the federally subsidized
Build America Bond program in last year&#8217;s fourth quarter. The
securities lost 4.5 percent in that period, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Municipal Master Index, the worst
performance in more than 16 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If you are an investor in municipals you should be very,
very careful,&#8221; Dimon said at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies including Allstate Corp., the largest publicly
traded U.S. home and auto insurer, have been reducing holdings
of municipal debt. Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
trimmed its investment in municipal debt, predicted last year a
&#8220;terrible problem&#8221; for the bonds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liberty Mutual had about $13.7 billion in municipal
securities as of Sept. 30, or about 20 percent of invested
assets, compared with $15.5 billion and 23 percent at the end of
2009, according to company statements. The Sept. 30 total
includes $372 million from the state of Florida and $278 million
from the state of California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States&#8217; Ratings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, based in Boston, still has holdings from the
three states, Kelly said. California and Illinois are rated A1
by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, the lowest among the states and
the company&#8217;s sixth-highest ranking. Connecticut is rated Aa2,
Moody&#8217;s fourth-highest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gregory Whiteley, U.S. government portfolio manager at Los
Angeles-based investment firm DoubleLine Capital LP, suggested
in a report yesterday that investors consider municipal bonds
because the risk of bankruptcy is low. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The financial stress of state and local governments has
given rise to an unusual investment opportunity,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii edged out Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Xbox 360 as the best-selling video-game
console in the U.S. after Microsoft was unable to meet demand
for its Kinect motion-sensing peripheral, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nintendo sold more than 2.3 million Wii consoles in
December, the Kyoto, Japan-based company said in a statement,
citing figures from researcher NPD Group Inc. The company said
it sold more than 2.5 million Nintendo DS handheld systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total industry sales for the month fell 9 percent to $5.06
billion from $5.55 billion a year earlier, when Nintendo and Sony Corp. cut prices of their video-game consoles, Port Washington, New York-based NPD said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sold 1.9 million consoles in December, the
biggest one-month total for the Xbox 360, David Dennis, group
product manager with Xbox, said today, citing NPD. The figures
track sales in the five-week period beginning Nov. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We would have sold more had we not run out of supply in
late December,&#8221; Dennis said in an interview. &#8220;We
air-freighted stuff in December, but you can only sell as many
as you can make.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retailers will continue to see &#8220;pockets of
supply constraints&#8221; through early February, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry sales of software fell 8 percent to $2.37 billion,
while sales of accessories including Kinect and Sony&#8217;s Move
motion-controller jumped 10 percent to $853.2 million, NPD said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Online Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including games sold or rented digitally and online, video-
game sales for the year were unchanged to down 1 percent at
$15.4 billion to $15.6 billion, NPD estimated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The increasing number of ways to acquire the content has
allowed the industry to maintain total consumer spend on content
as compared to 2009,&#8221; Anita Frazier, an NPD analyst, said in
the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Xbox 360, released in November 2005, is benefiting from a
June console redesign, followed by the Nov. 4 introduction of
the Kinect add-on. Consumers spent $6.2 billion on Xbox hardware
and software last year, more than any other console, the company
said, citing NPD figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft,  based in Redmond, Washington, has shipped more
than 8 million Kinect sensors for its Xbox device, topping the
company&#8217;s forecasts, and now has 30 million users for the
related Xbox Live online service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NPD stopped reporting unit sales of consoles in September.
The industry tracker now releases monthly revenue for video-game
hardware, software and peripherals. Console makers are free to
report their own unit sales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy the iShares
MSCI Germany Index fund because it trailed U.S. stocks for six
weeks and should benefit from a global recovery, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exchange-traded fund, which owns shares in 54 German
companies and tracks the MSCI Germany Index, may rise to $25.75,
Goldman said. The strategists said investors should sell to
minimize losses in the event the fund slips to $23.15. The ETF
rose 3.2 percent yesterday to $24.16. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The German equity retreat, coupled with sound
fundamentals, offers a good opportunity with the room to move
higher,&#8221; strategists Noah Weisberger and Kamakshya Trivedi said
in an e-mail to clients. &#8220;We continue to have a decidedly pro-
cyclical and pro-risk bias&#8221; and German equities have lagged
behind the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The German benchmark DAX Index has risen 5.7 percent since
the end of November, compared with an 8.9 percent gain for the
U.S.&#8217;s SP 500, as concern about a European sovereign debt
crisis lingered. Portugal may join Greece and Ireland in
receiving European Union aid as part of a package of new
measures being discussed by governments to quell the crisis,
four people with direct knowledge of the talks said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;German gross domestic product jumped 3.6 percent, the most
since data for a reunified Germany began in 1992, its Federal

&lt;p&gt;Talks between the Slovenian
government and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on the possible purchase
of a stake in Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. are at an &#8220;early&#8221;
stage, Finance Minister Franc Krizanic said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;ve had talks with Goldman Sachs and other financial
institutions that could act as advisers or they may themselves
purchase the stake in Nova Ljubljanska, but this is at an early
stage,&#8221; Krizanic told reporters in Ljubljana today. &#8220;Goldman
is interested in our biggest bank because of its Balkan
presence.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nova Ljubljanska Banka, in which the government holds just
below 50 percent and Belgium&#8217;s KBC Groep NV has a third, has
been seeking a partner as Slovenia&#8217;s biggest lender prepares for
a 250 million-euro ($330 million) capital increase. Other banks
in the Adriatic country suffer from bad loans and increased
bankruptcies and also need capital. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krizanic already spoke about the interest of Goldman Sachs
in Nova Ljubljanska in an interview with public broadcaster TV
Slovenija last night, when he said that Slovenia aims to attract
U.S. investors, including Goldman Sachs, to the Adriatic
country&#8217;s banking industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have met Alexander Dibelius three times as we seek to
attract U.S. investors to Slovenia and we didn&#8217;t speak only
about investing in Nova Ljubljanska, but also other banks,&#8221;
Krizanic said. Dibelius is New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s head
of operations in Germany and Austria, as well as Russia and
central and eastern Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs in New York,
declined to comment yesterday on the finance minister&#8217;s TV
comments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KBC, which bought its stake in the Slovenian bank in 2002
for 435 million euros, has reiterated that it plans to sell its
holding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bayer AG said it&#8217;s &#8220;determined to
enforce intellectual property&#8221; after losing a bid to demand
royalties from Abbott Laboratories over U.S. sales of the
arthritis drug Humira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Europe&#8217;s largest drug and chemical maker, which sued Abbott
in 2008 for violating its intellectual-property rights, conceded
in a court filing Jan. 11 that Humira doesn&#8217;t infringe its
patent under an interpretation by a judge in the case. Bayer&#8217;s
lawsuit can be revived if an appeals court overturns the judge&#8217;s
definition of the phrase &#8220;human monoclonal antibodies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bayer claimed the arthritis drug violates a patent for
antibodies against tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, an immune cell
protein that is linked to inflammation. The Leverkusen, Germany-
based company demanded royalties on sales of Humira, which
generated $4.67 billion in revenue for Abbott Park, Illinois-
based Abbott in the first nine months of 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is a procedural step in order to allow a quick
appeal of the earlier decision,&#8221; a Bayer spokesman, Oliver
Renner, said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. &#8220;We are
determined to enforce our intellectual property against any
infringement once the earlier decision is overturned on
appeal.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Dennis Saylor in Worcester, Massachusetts, ruled in October that Bayer&#8217;s patent covered only
antibodies that have low affinity, referring to the strength of
the antibody&#8217;s attachment to TNF, and that don&#8217;t neutralize the
protein. Both sides agreed that wouldn&#8217;t cover Humira. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are confident that the appellate court will uphold the
lower court&#8217;s interpretation of Bayer&#8217;s patent, under which
Humira does not infringe,&#8221; said Adelle Infante, an Abbott
spokeswoman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbott is appealing a separate Humira patent-infringement
case it lost to Johnson  Johnson that resulted in a $1.67
billion verdict. The company in 2009 settled a royalty dispute
with the University of Iowa for undisclosed terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Abbott Laboratories v. Bayer Healthcare LLC,
09cv40002, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts
(Worcester). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan Sues Novartis Unit Over Patents for Sanctura Medicine &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan Inc., the maker of wrinkle-smoothing Botox, sued a
unit of Basel, Switzerland&#8217;s Novartis AG in federal court in Delaware alleging infringement of four U.S. patents for Sanctura
XR, a prescription medicine used to treat overactive bladder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In dispute are patents 7,759,359, 7,763,635, 7,781,448, and
7,781,449. According to the Jan. 11 complaint, the infringement
arises from an application a Novartis unit submitted to the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration for approval of a generic form of
the drug covered by the patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allergan, based in Irvine, California, asked the court to
bar the production of the generic drug until after the patents
expire, and for awards of money damages, attorney fees, and
litigation costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is represented by William J. Marsden Jr., Anna
Martina Linnea Tyreus and Gregory Robert Booker of Boston&#8217;s Fish
 Richardson PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Allergan Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 1:11-cv-00042-
UNA, U.S. District Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CommScope, Bore-Flex Settle Dispute Over Conduit Patent &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; CommScope Inc., a maker of electronic and fiber-optic
cables, settled a patent-infringement suit against a Missouri-
based competitor, the company said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hickory, North Carolina-based CommScope sued Bore-Flex
Industries Inc. for patent infringement in federal court in
Macon, Georgia, on Sept. 21. It accused the Mountain Grove,
Missouri, company of infringing patent 7,279,643. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patent covers a conduit for electronic and fiber-optic
cables that can be detected deep underground, thus avoiding
accidental severing by construction crews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CommScope statement, Bore-Flex has taken a
royalty-bearing license to the patent. No terms of the license
were disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case was dismissed Jan. 5, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is CommScope of North Carolina v. Bore-Flex
Industries Inc., 5:10-cv-00344-CAR, U.S. District Court, Middle
District of Georgia (Macon). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trademark &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Argues &#8216;App Store&#8217; Too Generic a Trademark for Apple &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest software company, is
arguing that the term &#8220;app store&#8221; is too generic for Apple
Inc. to register it as a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cupertino, California-based Apple applied to register the
term in July 2009, according to the database of the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Jan. 20 filing to the patent office&#8217;s trademark appeal
board, Microsoft notes that even Apple&#8217;s founder and Chief
Executive Officer Steve Jobs has used &#8220;app store&#8221; as a generic
term for online stores that sell applications to be used on
mobile electronic devices. He used the term in an Oct. 18 phone
call with financial analysts widely reported in the technical
press and on National Public Radio, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company also argued that a
recent news database search turned up more than 1,000 stories
featuring the term as a generic name. Further, Microsoft said
that in previous trademark disputes, the appeal board has held
that terms that combine the generic name of a product with the
generic designator &#8220;store&#8221; are &#8220;generic and unregistrable for
retail store services featuring the product.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software company also presented evidence that the word
&#8220;app&#8221; has become so well known that it was named &#8220;word of the
year&#8221; by the American Dialect Society, according to Microsoft&#8217;s
filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2009 MetroPCS Communication Inc.&#8217;s MetroPCS
Wireless unit filed an application to register &#8220;@Metro app
store&#8221; as a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s argument is presented by William O. Ferron Jr.
and Nathan E. Durance of the Seed IP Law Group PLLC of Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Microsoft Corp. v. Apple Inc., Opposition No.
91195582, In the United Stated Patent and Trademark Office
Before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prince&#8217;s Fiancee&#8217;s Name Now a Brand, Royal Aide Tells Newspaper &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full name of Prince William&#8217;s bride-to-be is now a
brand &#8220;controlled&#8221; by the British Royal Family, the U.K.&#8217;s
Telegraph newspaper reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unidentified aide to the Royal Household told the
Telegraph that while a company could get away with calling a
dress akin to one the royal fiancee wore a &#8220;Kate Dress,&#8221;
promoting the frock as a &#8220;Catherine/Kate Middleton Dress&#8217; could
go over the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aide said Middleton -- who will marry Prince William
April 19 -- &#8220;has a reputation to uphold and because of that she
is, to all intents and purposes, akin to a brand or mark,&#8221;
according to the Telegraph. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Copyright &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hershey Must Face Infringement Claims in iMilk App Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Hershey Co., which asked a federal court to declare it
isn&#8217;t infringing the copyright for an application for Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPhone, must now face infringement claims from the
developer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, told Hershey
that Las Vegas-based Hottrix LLC, developer of the iMilk
application, made sufficient claims of copyright infringement in
its response to the chocolate company&#8217;s complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hottrix &#8220;has sufficiently pleaded that the two
applications are substantially similar,&#8221; Judge John E. Jones II
wrote in his Jan. 6 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hershey filed suit in June 2006, seeking a declaration that
its application for Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone didn&#8217;t infringe
Hottrix&#8217;s copyright for its iMilk app, which portrays the
pouring and drinking of a glass of milk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chocolate company argued that its application was
different from iMilk in many ways, including the giving the user
the option of adding Hershey&#8217;s syrup, and allowing the milk to
be &#8220;drunk&#8221; through a virtual straw that is added by tapping
the screen. Another difference is that with the Hershey app, the
user can blow bubbles through the added straw. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge noted the economics of the app industry, and
wrote that according to AppleInsider, an online newsletter, apps
generated $2.4 billion in revenue for the maker of the iPhone
and iPad. &#8220;This is big business by anyone&#8217;s measuring stick,
which explains why the combatants here would bring a dispute
involving computer-generated images of milk, chocolate and syrup
to federal court,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a Sept. 13 court filing, Hottrix said it was damaged
economically by Hershey&#8217;s offering its app for free. The Hottrix
iMilk app was sold for $2.99 in Apple&#8217;s App Store. It asked the
court for money damages &#8220;in an amount in excess of
$12,360,000.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hershey is represented by Harvey Freedenberg of Alan R.
Boynton Jr. and Shawn K. Leppo of  Harrisburg&#8217;s McNees, Wallace
 Nurick LLC, and Paul C. Llewellyn and Thomas A. Smart of New
York&#8217;s Kaye Scholer LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hottrix is represented by Jason H. Fisher of the Fisher Law
Group of Los Angeles, and Robert J. Tribeck and Todd J. Schill
of Harrisburg&#8217;s Rhoads  Sinon LLP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an earlier case, Hottrix sued Molson Coors Brewing Co.
in federal court in Los Angeles in October 2008 claiming the
brewer&#8217;s iPint app infringed its iBeer app. That case settled
for undisclosed terms in March 2009, according to Bloomberg
data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case was Hottrix LLC v. Molson Coors Brewing Co.,
2:08-cv-06695-PSG-SS, U.S. District Court, Central District of
California (Los Angeles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chocolate milk app case is Hershey Co., v. Hottrix LLC,
1:10-cv-01178-JEJ, U.S. District Court, Middle District of
Pennsylvania (Harrisburg). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Catcher&#8217; Sequel Banned in U.S. on Sale in Asia, Europe &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unauthorized sequel to the late J.D. Salinger&#8217;s
&#8220;Catcher in the Rye&#8221; is now on sale in Brazil, Korea, Hungary,
Turkey and Greece, in addition to the U.K. and Sweden, The
Local, Sweden&#8217;s English-language newspaper, reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and Canadian publication of Fredrik Colting&#8217;s &#8220;Sixty
Years Later: Coming Through the Rye&#8221; is barred until Salinger&#8217;s
original book enters the public domain, following the settlement
of a U.S. copyright-infringement suit, according to The Local. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colting told The Local that he expects Nicotext, the Boras,
Sweden-based publishing company he owns, will make him more
money than he will ever realize from his book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newspaper reported that New York&#8217;s Frankfurt Kurnit
Klein  Selz PC represented Colting in the copyright dispute for
a $900,000 fee. &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dawn Kopecki" date="Jan 13, 2011 12:00 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-13/jpmorgan-reserve-bleeds-distort-record-earnings-for-last-year.html"><headline>JPMorgan's Reserve `Bleeds' Distort Record $16.7 Billion Earnings Estimate</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, will probably report record
earnings of about $16.7 billion for last year boosted by a
reduction in reserves for future losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter results, which the New York-based company
plans to announce tomorrow, are likely to show a profit of $4.2
billion, or $1 per share, based on the average estimate of
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. About 40 percent of earnings for
the first nine months came from money taken from loss reserves
as U.S. banks dip into their funds, at least temporarily, and
mask a revenue squeeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t pay attention to the bottom line EPS numbers,&#8221;
said Chris Kotowski, managing director of research at
Oppenheimer  Co. in New York. &#8220;Reserve accounting distorts
what&#8217;s reported as earnings. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s just JPMorgan.
It&#8217;s the entire industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserves are typically released back into earnings if the
losses they were meant to cover don&#8217;t materialize or if the
company&#8217;s outlook improves. Such reserve &#8220;bleeds&#8221; will also
boost 2011 results, especially if the economy continues to
rebound, Betsy Graseck, a bank analyst at Morgan Stanley, said
in a Dec. 1 research report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Inc. may benefit the most from releasing reserves
in 2012, according to Graseck, who estimated a 19 percent boost
to per-share profits for the New York-based bank based on
historical reserve practices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the largest U.S. lenders, JPMorgan, Bank of America
Corp. and Wells Fargo  Co. stand to derive 4 percent, 10
percent and 5 percent of their 2012 earnings from reserve
releases alone, Graseck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the economy accelerates, the reserve bleed could punch
EPS even higher in 2011 and 2012,&#8221; Graseck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks &#8220;got dinged when they were building reserves, so
when you release reserves it goes directly to the capital
account,&#8221; said bank analyst Jason Goldberg of Barclays Capital
in New York. &#8220;It is real capital even if it&#8217;s not considered
real earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reserves hurt bank earnings while they&#8217;re being built up.
JPMorgan said it added about $5.2 billion to its litigation
reserves during the first three quarters last year. Reserve
accounting will probably continue to distort earnings over the
next year or two, analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foreclosures, Litigation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banking industry is still struggling with escalating
foreclosures, increasing litigation costs and anemic loan
growth, which are all eating into revenue. JPMorgan&#8217;s revenue,
which slumped 11 percent in the third quarter, remained weak in
the fourth quarter, Goldberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit margins at JPMorgan, the first of the largest U.S.
banks to report earnings, narrowed in the third quarter as
revenue from investment banking and card services tumbled from a
year earlier and non-interest expenses rose 7 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While they benefit from reserve releases, you&#8217;re still
facing the detriment of elevated loan-loss provisioning, some
more subdued loan growth, the impact of prolonged low interest
rates and elevated mortgage repurchase costs,&#8221; Goldberg said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors should expect some &#8220;bumpiness or lumpiness&#8221; in
trading results in the fourth quarter, although it should be
better than the previous three months, Kotowski said. Fixed-
income revenue was $3.1 billion in the third quarter, compared
with $5 billion a year earlier and $3.6 billion in the second
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Price Targets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotowski is among analysts who have raised their price
targets and earnings estimates on JPMorgan and other banks in
the past month amid signs that the improving economy may benefit
bank stocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s more important to focus on the fundamentals rather
than the noise,&#8221; Kotowski said. &#8220;JPMorgan&#8217;s core earnings
power is quite stable and robust.&#8221; He said that pre-provision
earnings, which back out all reserving, were running at an
annual rate of $47 billion during the first nine months last
year, compared with $48 billion for all of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit card charge-offs dropped from 8.35 percent in the
third quarter to 7.51 percent in October and November, which is
a &#8220;broadly positive indication,&#8221; Kotowski said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loan growth is shrinking at a slower pace. Loan volumes
dropped 0.5 percent from September to December, which is an
improvement from a 1.1 percent decrease the quarter before and a
4.4 percent quarterly drop at its worst pace in late 2009,
Kotowski said, citing Federal Reserve data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shrinking Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit quality is steadily getting better,&#8221; Kotowski
said. &#8220;Loans are still shrinking but a lot less than they were
and they show every sign of turning around in the next two
quarters.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Mayo, an analyst at Credit Agricole, increased his
earnings estimate for JPMorgan from 97 cents to 99 cents a share
on Jan. 7 due to the better economic outlook. Matt O&#8217;Connor, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in New York, upped his estimates on
the expectation that banks will use excess reserves to raise
dividends or buy back stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan investors may see their quarterly dividend, which
was cut to 5 cents in 2009, rise in the second quarter, Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a Jan. 11 interview on
CNBC television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re waiting for guidance from regulators about on what
basis are they going to let firms pay dividends, buy back stock
or do other things,&#8221; Dimon, 54, said from the company&#8217;s annual
health-care conference in San Francisco. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board hasn&#8217;t decided on a specific increase, with the
bank hoping eventually to pay 30 percent to 35 percent of
normalized earnings, Dimon said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dividend, Buybacks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said in October that he was &#8220;reasonably hopeful&#8221;
the firm will be able to raise the payment in 2011&#8217;s first
quarter and that regulators were open to the idea. JPMorgan has
been buying back its own stock in the meantime, repurchasing
$2.6 billion of shares through the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index of 24 stocks has dropped 56 percent
since its February 2007 peak after the U.S. housing bubble burst
and left banks grappling with the worst economy since the Great
Depression. Investors in JPMorgan, the only major Wall Street
firm to post profits in every quarter throughout the recession,
lost 14 percent during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank behind JPMorgan and
Bank of America, may report fourth-quarter earnings of $2.2
billion when it releases results on Jan. 18, the survey of
analysts shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America
may report a profit of $2.5 billion on Jan. 21. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, posted a record $4.83 billion
profit, buoyed by $2 billion in reserves added back to earnings
as credit quality and the U.S. economy improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income, which rose 47 percent, was $1.12
a share, compared with $3.28 billion, or 74 cents, in the same
period of 2009, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. The results compared with an average per-share
estimate for adjusted earnings of $1 projected by 25 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. The shares rose as much as 2.9 percent to
a nine-month high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, was
the only major U.S. bank to remain profitable throughout the
financial crisis. The company&#8217;s record $17.4 billion in earnings
last year were boosted by about $7 billion in pretax reserve
releases on the better economic forecast, an improvement that
Dimon, 54, said he doesn&#8217;t count as actual earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We only take down reserves pretty much when we have to&#8221;
because of accounting requirements, Dimon told reporters on a
conference call today. &#8220;We don&#8217;t really want to. It isn&#8217;t like
we&#8217;re doing it to report earnings. I don&#8217;t look at it as
earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan rose 46 cents, or 1 percent, to $44.91 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The cost to protect the
company&#8217;s debt declined as credit-default swaps fell 1.4 basis
points to 79.1 basis points, according to broker Phoenix
Partners Group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDS Prices Rise &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Five of the six businesses are showing improvements,&#8221;
said Richard Bove, a bank analyst at Rochdale Securities in
Lutz, Florida. &#8220;The revenue momentum is positive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon reiterated his desire to restore the company&#8217;s
quarterly dividend, which was cut to 5 cents a share in 2009, as
soon as regulators allow. For Bove, &#8220;these are the factors that
will push the stock up or down ultimately, not the accounting
mumbo-jumbo with reserves.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The credit-card division, which lost money for all of 2009,
generated 27 percent of JPMorgan&#8217;s net income for the quarter.
The investment bank accounted for 31 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Dimon called the U.S. housing market still
&#8220;terrible,&#8221; he said it&#8217;s better than it was a year ago. The
bank put $1.5 billion in litigation reserves to cover costs
related to buying back faulty mortgages. It also set aside $2.1
billion more against soured loans from Washington Mutual, the
lender JPMorgan bought in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Private Label &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon said most of the new litigation reserves are intended
for so-called private-label mortgages, which are not insured by
the federal government or federally controlled mortgage
companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He said it will take years
to resolve those disputes and to determine the ultimate cost to
JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a long ugly mess, but it won&#8217;t be life-
threatening to JPMorgan,&#8221; he told analysts on a separate call.
&#8220;We will be talking about this for every quarter over the next
three years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is the first of the largest U.S. banks to report
earnings. Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. lender behind
JPMorgan and Bank of America Corp., may report fourth-quarter
profit of $2.19 billion when it releases results on Jan. 18, the
survey of analysts shows. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank
of America may report a profit of $2.61 billion on Jan. 21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter revenue at JPMorgan rose 13 percent to $26.1
billion. Fixed-income and equity markets revenue was $4 billion,
compared with $3.7 billion a year earlier and $4.3 billion in
the third quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Cards &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While home-lending and credit-card losses continued to
weigh on earnings, the company set aside fewer provisions for
future losses in both divisions and released $2 billion in
reserves against credit-card loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fewer consumers fell behind on their credit-card payments
in the fourth quarter. Thirty-day delinquency rates dropped to
4.1 percent from 6.3 percent in the same quarter in 2009 and 4.6
percent in the third quarter. The rate of credit cards charged
off as bad debt also fell to 7.8 percent from 9.3 percent the
prior year and 8.9 percent in the previous quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Consumer credit continues to improve across the board,&#8221;
said Paul Miller, a former examiner for the Philadelphia Federal
Reserve Bank and analyst at FBR Capital Markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retail banking earned $708 million, compared with $907
million during the third quarter and a $399 million loss a year
earlier. The division benefited from a $1.8 billion reduction in
provisions to $2.5 billion, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Card Services &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-card services earned $1.3 billion, compared with
$735 million in the prior three months and a $306 million loss a
year earlier. JPMorgan reduced provisions against future losses
by $3.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income in investment banking declined 21 percent, to
$1.5 billion in the fourth quarter from $1.9 billion the year
before, even after benefiting from the release of $271 million
in reserves back into earnings, compared with a $181 million
gain the prior year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The numbers don&#8217;t look nearly as strong as the headlines
would suggest,&#8221; a group of strategists led by Michael Reiner at
Societe Generale SA wrote in a note today after the earnings
report. &#8220;A large portion of the earnings beat came from a large
drop in loss provisions at JPM&#8217;s credit-card segment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Margin Squeeze &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other large banks, which have benefited from
record low costs of funding mortgages and other assets, face a
squeeze on net interest margins -- the difference between what
they pay to borrow money and what they get for loans and on
securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net yield on interest-earning assets -- what the bank
collects on interest on loans and securities minus what it pays
out on deposits and other borrowings -- dropped to 2.88 percent
in the fourth quarter, from 3.01 percent in the third quarter
and 3.02 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies have recorded losses and writedowns of
at least $1.82 trillion stemming from the U.S. housing crisis
and the highest U.S. jobless rate in 26 years, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of new problem loans eased over
the last two quarters as the U.S. economy recovered, even after
the federal government withdrew support from financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options dropped to the lowest in three weeks and fell to a
three-year low in intraday trading as the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500
Index jumped to a two-year high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The VIX, as the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, fell 5.7 percent to 15.46 after dropping as low
as 15.37 earlier. The index measures the cost of using options
as insurance against declines in the SP 500, which rose 0.7
percent to 1,293.24. VIX futures also retreated. February
contracts lost 4.7 percent to 18.40 while May&#8217;s fell 2.6 percent
to 22.95. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People are saying that things are going to be quiet for
the foreseeable future,&#8221; said Dominic Salvino, a specialist at
Group One Trading, the primary market maker for VIX options.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t see any catalyst or major market moves in the next
three to six months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. advanced after cutting provisions for
future credit-card and real-estate losses, helping the bank post
a $4.83 billion fourth-quarter profit. The bank had the 10th-
biggest gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which rose to
the highest level since June 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve gone to another day where there was concern about
earnings, and the earnings were fairly good,&#8221; Christopher Rich,
head options strategist at Jones Trading in Chicago. &#8220;People
are perceiving less and less risk in the marketplace.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500&#8217;s one-month historic volatility, a gauge of
past price swings, has fallen to 6.38 from 17.59 on Dec. 2. It
declined to 4.64 on Dec. 31, the lowest level since at least
2001, according to Bloomberg data. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index is
heading for a decline, according to strategists at Royal Bank of
Canada and JPMorgan Chase  Co., who disagreed on the timing for
the dip in reports today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-than-forecast U.S. jobless claims this week and
China&#8217;s measures to cool its economy may spur a &#8220;correction&#8221;
in the benchmark gauge for U.S. equities in the first quarter,
according to Myles Zyblock, chief institutional strategist at RBC Capital Markets. Thomas Lee, his counterpart at JPMorgan,
said the SP 500 Index will continue to gain before peaking at
about 1,333 in March or April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re going to run out of steam at that level,&#8221; Lee, the
chief U.S. equity strategist at the New York-based bank, said in
a telephone interview today. The drop will start when &#8220;the
hazardously bullish people lose conviction.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 Index is poised to advance for the seventh
straight week, the longest streak since 2007, as stronger-than-
expected corporate earnings have tempered concerns that a
slowdown in the global economic recovery will hurt stocks. U.S.
first-time jobless claims rose to the highest level since
October in the first week of the year, missing economists&#8217;
estimates. China&#8217;s central bank said on its website today it
raised lenders&#8217; reserve requirements to rein in liquidity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market set-up is already there for a correction,&#8221;
Zyblock wrote in his note. The decline will create a &#8220;buying
opportunity&#8221; in &#8220;economically sensitive and globally centric&#8221;
shares, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors Intelligence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proportion of investment newsletters that anticipate a
correction, or 10 percent decline in the market, rose to a two-
month high of 25 percent in the week ended Jan. 4, according to
Investors Intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose 0.7 percent to 1,293.24 at 4 p.m. in New
York today. The benchmark measure has advanced 1.7 percent this
week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. fourth-quarter earnings season started this week. Lee
wrote in today&#8217;s note earnings results have been better than
forecast for 61 percent of the SP 500 companies to report so
far. He estimated earnings growth will fall to 9 percent from a
year earlier in the first quarter before accelerating to a
&#8220;double-digit&#8221; rate, boosted by an expansion in gross domestic
product. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; PNC Financial Services Group Inc.
and Capital One Financial Corp. led U.S. financial stocks higher
after JPMorgan Chase  Co. posted record fourth-quarter profit
on improvement in credit quality and the U.S. economy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index climbed 2.4 percent to 54.73, an eight-
month high, at 2:30 p.m. in New York as 23 firms rose and one
fell. Pittsburgh-based PNC, the sixth-largest U.S. bank by
deposits, jumped 4.6 percent to $63.93. Capital One, based in
McLean, Virginia, climbed 3.4 percent to $48.29. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Credit trends in our credit card and wholesale businesses
continued to improve,&#8221; JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54, said in a statement. While the U.S. housing market is
still &#8220;terrible,&#8221; it&#8217;s better than it was a year ago, he told
reporters on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the first of the biggest U.S. banks to report
fourth-quarter and full-year earnings, had a $17.4 billion
profit in 2010, boosted by about $7 billion in pretax reserve
releases because of the better economic forecast. Net income in
the fourth quarter rose 47 percent to $4.83 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions Financial Corp., Alabama&#8217;s biggest bank, gained 3.4

&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect debt issued by
JPMorgan Chase  Co. climbed, pulling credit-default swaps on
its peers higher, after the bank reported a fourth-quarter
profit based heavily on changes to loss reserves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets rose 3.5 basis points to 84 basis points at 9:35 a.m. in New York, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. The bank&#8217;s
net income increased to $4.83 billion, or $1.12 a share, from
$3.28 billion, or 74 cents, a year earlier as it released $2
billion in reserves while adding to a cushion against future
losses tied to its 2008 purchase of Washington Mutual Inc., the
New York-based company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The numbers don&#8217;t look nearly as strong as the headlines
would suggest,&#8221; a group of strategists led by Michael Reiner at
Soceite Generale SA wrote in a note today after the earnings
report. &#8220;A large portion of the earnings beat came from a large
drop in loss provisions at JPM&#8217;s credit card segment.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Wells Fargo  Co., based in San
Francisco, increased 5.4 basis points to 112 and contracts on Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America Corp. climbed
6.5 basis points to 175, Phoenix data show. Both companies are
due to report next week. Contracts on Morgan Stanley added 4.8
basis points to 164, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports that JPMorgan plans to sell three-year debt in a
two-part benchmark offering as soon as today is also helping to
push the swaps higher, according to Rizwan Hussain, a New York-
based analyst at Morgan Stanley. Increasing loan loss provisions
in some portfolios also sparked concern, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digging Into Details &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors will be trying to decipher a lot of details
that aren&#8217;t necessarily captured in the bottom line,
particularly regarding which way loss provisions are going
across different types of risk that they hold,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan said it reduced reserves overall, it also
added $2.1&#160;billion for loan losses from its purchase of WaMu
during the credit crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impairment of the purchased credit-impaired portfolio
reflected an increase in estimated future credit losses and was
largely related to home equity and, to a lesser extent, option-
ARM loans,&#8221; the bank said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High-Yield Outperforms &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost to protect U.S. corporate bonds from default fell.
The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, dropped 1.4 basis points to a
mid-price of 83.5 basis points as of 1:16 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Markit CDX North America High Yield Index climbed 0.175
percentage point to 103.5 percent of face value, Markit data
show. That means the annual cost to protect against a default by
the 100 companies in the index dropped to 415.3 basis points,
the lowest since October 2007, according to prices from Markit
and CMA. The high-yield index rises as investor confidence
improves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see good reason for the strong performance of high
yield considering improving fundamentals, the wide-open primary
markets, and our expectations for defaults of only 2 percent,&#8221;
credit strategists Bradley Rogoff and Jeffrey Meli at Barclays
Capital in New York wrote in a note to clients. &#8220;However, at
current levels, there appears to be little upside.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A building that&#8217;s part of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s London headquarters was purchased by Chinese
Estates Holdings Ltd. for about 280 million pounds ($444
million), the broker that advised on the sale said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank has about 10 years left on its
lease at River Court, a building on Fleet Street in the U.K.
capital&#8217;s main financial district, Gresham Down Capital Partners
said in a statement today. Warren  Partners bought the office
for 246.5 million pounds in 2001 on behalf of a group of Irish
investors, Gresham Down said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These large, high-profile assets continue to attract
strong interest from overseas investors who view London as their
preferred investment location and a safe haven during this
period of global economic uncertainty,&#8221; Stephen Down, managing
partner of Gresham Down, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London&#8217;s commercial property market probably received the
most investment for the second straight year in 2010 as
prospects of rising rental income attracted cash from as far
afield as Hong Kong, Qatar and Canada, according to Real Capital
Analytics Inc. Low interest rates and concern that the global
economy may deteriorate have made other investments more risky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese Estates -- a Hong Kong-based property developer and
investor controlled by its billionaire chairman, Joseph Lau --
will pay about 38 million pounds in cash and assume a 240.5
million-pound bank loan and 1.7 million pounds of other
liabilities, Chinese Estates said in a separate statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;River Court has annual rental income of 15.6 million
pounds, according to Chinese Estates. Gresham estimated its net
yield at about 5.25 percent. The building has 430,000 square
feet (40,000 square meters) of space. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Embraer SA, the world&#8217;s fourth-
largest airplane maker, climbed the most in more than five
months after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. added the stock to its
&#8220;Americas conviction buy&#8221; list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embraer surged 4.3 percent to 12.80 reais at 10:38 a.m. New
York time after climbing 5.3 percent earlier, the most on an
intraday basis since July 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs gave Embraer a price target of $39 for its
American depositary receipt with the chance to rise as much as
30 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter results for Embraer and other players in the
jet industry will be &#8220;near-term positive catalysts&#8221; for the
company, according to Goldman Sachs. The investment bank also
expects Embraer to receive new regional jet orders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Delta Air Lines Inc., the world&#8217;s second-largest carrier,
plans to order 100 to 200 narrow-body jets and seeks options for
200 more as it replaces older planes, the company told employees
today on an internal website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embraer shares gained 24 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s investment
bank hired employees faster than it expanded the compensation
pool last year, leading to a drop in average pay per worker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds set aside to reward traders, deal makers and the
unit&#8217;s other personnel increased 4 percent to $9.73 billion, or
an average of $369,651 for each of the 26,314 workers, the
company said today in an earnings supplement. That&#8217;s 2.4 percent
less than the average of $378,600 a year earlier, when 24,654
people worked there. Compensation amounted to 37 percent of
revenue last year, up from 33 percent in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 54,
added workers last year even as it generated less revenue from
fixed-income trading and investment banking. Pressure to limit
compensation mounted at the unit as revenue slipped 7 percent to
$26.2 billion and non-compensation expenses jumped 24 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The economy hasn&#8217;t fully recovered,&#8221; said David Schmidt,
a senior consultant at New York-based executive pay firm James
F. Reda  Associates. &#8220;You still have to pay your stars, but
they probably feel like they don&#8217;t have to go crazy to keep
people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank added 1,660 employees in 2010,
boosting headcount by 6.7 percent, according to today&#8217;s report.
Headcount at the entire New York-based company rose 8 percent to
239,831 at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising Expenses &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter, the investment bank&#8217;s net income
declined 21 percent from the year-earlier period to $1.5
billion, according to the bank&#8217;s statement. An 84 percent surge
in non-interest costs, including litigation expenses, overcame a
26 percent increase in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companywide, fourth-quarter profit rose 47 percent to $4.83
billion as the lender cut provisions for future credit-card and
real-estate losses. The investment bank contributed 31 percent
of the firm&#8217;s total net income. That compares with 29 percent in
the third quarter and 58 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks set aside revenue throughout the year to
pay employees and typically decide bonuses at the end of the
year. The average compensation figures are derived by dividing
the number of employees with the overall compensation pool and
don&#8217;t represent individual workers&#8217; actual pay. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. said it resumed flows
through its Dibi-Abiteye pipeline in the southern Niger River
delta about a month after it was breached by militants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The impacted line is fixed and operations normal,&#8221; Scott Walker, a company spokesman in Houston, said yesterday in an e-
mailed statement without giving further details. Oil from the
link is exported through the Escravos terminal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Niger Delta Liberation Force claimed responsibility for
attacks on three oil flow stations in Nigeria&#8217;s Delta State
belonging to Chevron and Eni SpA&#8217;s local unit, a spokesman for
the group said Dec. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attacks by armed groups in the delta cut Nigeria&#8217;s oil
production by more than 28 percent from 2006 to 2009, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon
Mobil Corp., Chevron, Total SA and Eni run joint ventures with
the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. that pump more
than 90 percent of the West African nation&#8217;s oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is Africa&#8217;s largest oil producer and fifth-biggest
source of U.S. oil imports. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp., the second-biggest
U.S. oil company, said it&#8217;s in talks with the Indonesian
government on extending its drilling rights at a block in
southern Sumatra. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explorer, based in San Ramon, California, is seeking to
extend drilling rights at the Siak oil block expiring in 2013,
Gareth Johnstone, a Chevron spokesman based in Singapore, said
by e-mail today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesian petroleum regulator BPMigas received a letter
from Chevron in September in which the company expressed an
intention to extend drilling rights at Siak, Elan Biantoro, a
spokesman at BPMigas, said yesterday. Chevron has until November
to submit a formal proposal, according to Biantoro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Siak Block is a crucial part of Chevron&#8217;s Sumatra
integrated operations, including supporting production from the
Rokan Block,&#8221; Johnstone said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron holds a 100 percent stake in the Rokan and Siak
blocks in southern Sumatra, according to its website. The
company, which also has interests in Borneo, Java and Papua
islands, produced an average of 485,000 barrels of oil a day in
2009. That&#8217;s about half of Indonesia&#8217;s output. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
released for the first time details of about $5 billion of
investment losses it suffered during the financial crisis, the
Financial Times reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures, issued as part of internal reforms undertaken
to placate the bank&#8217;s critics, show that Goldman suffered losses
of $13.5 billion from investing and lending with its own funds
in 2008, the newspaper said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s regulatory filings and comments by its
executives to investors at the time indicated that $8.5 billion
of losses were incurred on the bank&#8217;s investments in bonds and
equity, the FT said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discrepancy, which doesn&#8217;t change Goldman&#8217;s 2008
results overall, arose from the fact that the bank hasn&#8217;t
provided until now a full breakdown of profits and losses from
activities carried out with its own resources, according to the
newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world refined copper market is
expected to have a 500,000-metric-ton to 600,000-ton deficit in
2011, even with a significantly weaker demand scenario,
according to JPMorgan Securities Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disruptions last year seemed to have wiped out most of mine
supply growth, metals strategist Michael Jansen told a
conference in Shanghai. &#8220;As demand further recovers into 2011,
supply-side issues will become more influential,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper for delivery in three months in London advanced to a
record of $9,754 a metric ton on Jan. 4 after rising 30 percent
last year as the improving global economy and rising investment
demand for commodities prompted buying. The International Copper
Study Group is expecting a 435,000-ton global deficit in the
refined metal this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While current prices are sufficient to encourage brownfield
and greenfield developments, longstanding issues, including
capital availability, relative merit of projects, resource
nationalism, and geotechnical issues, remain key impediments for
supply increase, said Jansen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Copper is also increasingly being seen as scarce and is
in many ways adopting some store of value attributes normally
associated with precious metals,&#8221; he said in his presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jansen said his current forecast for the average London
cash price is $9,713 a ton this year. In slides shown earlier at
the conference he had predicted $9,000 a ton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper closed 0.4 percent higher at $9,650 a ton yesterday
on the London Metal Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese stock futures and
Australian shares rose after JPMorgan Chase  Co. reported
record profit and the yen weakened to its lowest level in a
month against the euro, boosting the outlook for export earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts of Canon Inc., a Japanese
camera maker that gets about 80 percent of its revenue abroad,
increased 2 percent from the closing share in Tokyo on Jan. 14.
Those of Honda Motor Co., Japan&#8217;s No. 2 carmaker by market value,
gained 1 percent. Macquarie Group Ltd., Australia&#8217;s biggest
investment bank, increased 0.9 percent in Sydney today. On Jan.
13, Intel Corp. forecast sales that may exceed analyst estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Along with positive earnings from Intel and JPMorgan,
expectations about the U.S. economic recovery are rising, and market sentiment is looking up,&#8221; said Koichiro Nishio, a market
analyst in Tokyo at Nikko Cordial Securities Inc. &#8220;This is also
leading to improved expectations about Japanese company
earnings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,575 in Chicago on Jan. 14, compared with
10,515 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,570
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia&#8217;s
SP/ASX 200 Index was little changed, while most stocks advanced.
New Zealand&#8217;s NZX 50 Index was little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index were little
changed today. The index increased 0.7 percent on Jan. 14 after
JPMorgan&#8217;s profit overshadowed lower-than-forecast consumer
confidence and retail sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Currency &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported
a quarterly profit of $4.83 billion on Jan. 14. The bank is
&#8220;hopeful&#8221; it can raise its dividend and buy back shares, Chief
Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yen depreciated to as low as 111.12 against the euro,
its weakest level in a month, boosting the value of European
income at Japanese companies when converted into their home
currency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum climbed 0.3
percent on Jan. 14, its sixth weekly gain in seven weeks. Crude
oil for February delivery settled at $91.54 a barrel in New York
on Jan. 14, an increase of 14 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 14.3 percent last year,
compared with gains of 12.8 percent by the SP 500 and 8.6
percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark were valued at 14.2 times estimated earnings on
average at the last close, compared with 13.6 times for the SP
500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. halted an
offering of Facebook Inc. shares to U.S. investors on concern
that &#8220;intense media attention&#8221; on the deal may violate rules
limiting marketing of private securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, the sale, first reported Jan. 2, will be
restricted to non-U.S. investors, the New York-based bank said
in an e-mailed statement today. Goldman Sachs and funds it
manages had agreed to buy $450 million of closely held Facebook
before the bank began seeking investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman Sachs concluded that the level of media attention
might not be consistent with the proper completion of a U.S.
private placement under U.S. law,&#8221; it said in the statement.
The move &#8220;was based on the sole judgment of Goldman Sachs and
was not required or requested by any other party.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the biggest U.S. securities firm before
converting to a bank in 2008, had been trying to sell as much as
$1.5 billion in Facebook shares to investors inside and outside
the U.S. before making the change announced today. The company
didn&#8217;t say whether it still expects to raise that amount. The
target is still achievable, according to a person with knowledge
of the bank&#8217;s plan who declined to be identified because it
isn&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Client Disappointment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Goldman&#8217;s U.S. clients will be disappointed,&#8221; said Randy Hawks, a managing director of Oakland, California-based venture
capital firm Claremont Creek Ventures, which has $300 million
under management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Facebook spokesman, Jonathan Thaw, said Goldman Sachs is
&#8220;in the best position to answer any questions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It certainly is not going to be happy for the people who
put the time into analyzing the investment and didn&#8217;t get any,&#8221;
said Peter Hahn, a lecturer on corporate finance at Cass
Business School in London. &#8220;But this transaction seems like a
unique enough one that it&#8217;s hard to think there will be any
long-lasting damage&#8221; for Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limited sale may raise questions about whether it makes
sense for the U.S. to restrict marketing of securities offerings
that are only for sophisticated investors, Hahn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Does this suggest that U.S. laws are prohibiting a
certain group of investors from funding U.S. companies?&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You might see some significant U.S. investors suggest
that this is a negative for the U.S. economy.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Goldman Sachs had proceeded with the sale to U.S.
investors, there was a risk that regulators could later conclude
that media coverage had violated rules for a private placement,
said the person with knowledge of the bank&#8217;s decision. If that
had happened after the deal, Facebook might have been told to
repurchase shares or register as a public company, the person
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its statement, Goldman Sachs said &#8220;we regret the
consequences of this decision, but Goldman Sachs believes this
is the most prudent path to take.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equities will outperform commodities
in the &#8220;near term&#8221; after surges last year in metal, energy and
agricultural product prices, said Jeffrey R. Currie, head of
commodities research at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global stocks are still about $9.6 trillion short of the
record $62.6 trillion of market capitalization reached in
October 2007, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The MSCI World
Index of shares has climbed 2.1 percent this year, almost double
the gain of the Standard  Poor&#8217;s GSCI Total Return Index of 24
commodities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Both commodities and equities have substantial upside,
which is why we prefer both when looking at the medium- to long-
term,&#8221; Currie said in an interview in London today. &#8220;Near-
term, we favor equities over commodities but on a 6- to 12-month
horizon, we shift back to favoring the commodities along with
equities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman on Dec. 13 forecast an 18 percent advance in raw
materials in 12 months, led by a 28 percent gain in precious
metals. Commodities that perform the best will be those in which China isn&#8217;t self-sufficient, the company said. Commodity assets
under management will attract a total of $60 billion in new
money this year, the second most after 2009, Barclays estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gold futures last year gained 30 percent, crude oil rose 15
percent and corn jumped 52 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currie on Oct. 22 correctly forecast higher prices for
crude oil, copper, corn and platinum in a Bloomberg Television
interview. Since then, crude has gained 11 percent, copper and
corn are both up 16 percent and platinum rose 7.6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Agricultural Bank of Greece SA (ATE GA) advanced 6.9
percent to 78 cents, erasing a 1.4 percent drop on Jan. 14.
Reignwood Group, based in China, has expressed interest in

&lt;p&gt;Bank of Cyprus Pcl. (BOC GA) increased 2.7 percent to 2.7

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Wall
Street&#8217;s most profitable investment bank, promoted Jan Hatzius
and Dominic Wilson to oversee its global economics research
division, succeeding Jim O&#8217;Neill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius, 42, was named chief economist and Wilson chief
markets economist, according to an internal memo dated Jan. 12
and obtained by Bloomberg News. Both will run economics,
commodities and strategies research in the Americas, with Jeff Currie and Peter Oppenheimer responsible for Europe, according
to the memo from Steven H. Strongin, global head of investment
research. Sophie Bullock, a London-based spokeswoman for the
bank, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promotions split up the responsibilities of O&#8217;Neill,
who served as head of global economics, commodities and strategy
research until becoming chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset
Management at the end of last year. O&#8217;Neill, 53, is best known
for devising the term &#8220;BRIC&#8221; to describe the growing economic
power of Brazil, Russia, India and China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs economists are becoming more optimistic about
the outlook for the U.S. economy and said in a report this month
that 2011 will be &#8220;the year of recovery&#8221; globally. They
predict the world&#8217;s largest economy will expand 3.4 percent this
year after growing 2.8 percent in 2010, and that the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index will rally to 1,500 from 1,293 at the end of
last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People continue to underestimate just how powerful the
world economy is,&#8221; O&#8217;Neill told a conference in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kathy Matsui and Tim Moe will become co-heads of economics,
commodities and strategy research in Asia. Oppenheimer will
become chief global equity strategist, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hatzius became chief U.S. economist in 2005 after joining
the bank in 1997 in Frankfurt. He moved to New York two years
later. Wilson joined Goldman Sachs in 2000 in Hong Kong and then
transferred to New York as a global economist. Both studied at
Oxford University and became managing directors in 2004. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Growth of copper consumption in China, the world&#8217;s biggest user, may almost halve this year as
the government curbs monetary expansion, cooling demand, said
Michael Jansen, metals strategist at JPMorgan Securities Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Weaker Chinese demand growth is starting to materialize,
courtesy of the tighter restrictions on credit and energy
availability,&#8221; Jansen said at a conference in Shanghai Jan. 15.
Real consumption is likely to gain about 7 percent to 7.88
million metric tons, down from 13 percent in 2010, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper surged to a record $9,754 a ton in London Jan. 4 on
expectations that supply will lag behind demand and as investors
sought commodities as a hedge against currency debasement. China
last week told banks to set aside more deposits as reserves for
the fourth time in just over two months, stepping up efforts to
rein in liquidity and cool inflation after foreign-exchange
holdings rose by a record and lending exceeded targets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see a slowdown in output growth for major consuming
sectors such as home appliances, power, construction and
transport vehicles,&#8221; said Ren Gang, head of research at Maike
Futures Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper demand may grow by at least 6 percent to 7.74
million tons this year, slowing from 10 percent in 2010,
according to Bonnie Liu, a metals analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd.
Researcher Beijing Antaike Information Development Co. predicted
growth to slow to 8 percent from 11.5 percent. Copper dropped
0.4 percent to $9,615 a ton today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s Economy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China&#8217;s economy will grow 8.7 percent in 2011, down from 10
percent last year, &#8220;due in part to the unwinding of fiscal
stimulus, restrictions placed on overheating sectors,&#8221; such as
housing, and tighter monetary policy to help reduce price
increases, the World Bank said Jan. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank last week said it will lift the reserve
requirement ratio by 50 basis points starting Jan. 20 as it
moves to curb lending and liquidity as inflation runs at the
fastest pace in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk is that this runs deeper into 2011 than we are
expecting,&#8221; JPMorgan&#8217;s Jansen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese exports of home appliances, a major user of copper,
may grow at a slower rate this year as an appreciating yuan will
make products less competitive, said Hu Xiaohong, head of the
information and consultation department at the China Household
Electrical Appliances Association. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yuan touched its strongest level since 1993 on Jan. 14
as the U.S. made renewed calls for China to allow appreciation
before President Hu Jintao&#8217;s visit to Washington this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Negative Factor &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are still uncertainties in the global economic
recovery this year; this will also be a negative factor,&#8221; said
Hu from the appliances association at the Jan. 15 meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper surged 30 percent in 2010 as the global economy
recovered from the worst recession since World War II. Usage of
copper in air-conditioners represents 60 percent of the demand
in the home appliance sector, said Hu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent rally in copper prices is &#8220;not fully
supported&#8221; in the near term as demand from the power industry
in China may fall short of expectations, Na Liu, China strategy
adviser to Scotia Capital, said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China State Grid Corp., the nation&#8217;s largest operator of
electricity networks, is planning an 11 percent increase in
fixed-asset investment this year, the Beijing-based company said
in a Jan. 10 statement. That is less than the 45 percent
increase the market had been expecting, Liu said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stockpiles at the Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses
advanced to the highest level in seven months, adding 481 tons
to 132,647 tons last week, according to the bourse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;World Shortage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China produced 4.37 million tons of refined copper in
January-November, or 13 percent more than a year earlier,
according to the National Bureau of Statistics. November output
jumped to a record of 443,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world refined copper market is expected to have a
deficit of 500,000 tons to 600,000 tons in 2011, even with a
significantly weaker demand scenario, said JPMorgan&#8217;s Jansen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macquarie said in a research report on Dec. 27 that the
shortfall would be 550,000 tons. The International Copper Study
Group has predicted a shortage of 435,000 tons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China is expected to import more of the metal in the first
quarter, which should underpin the record level price, said Yang Changhua, a senior analyst at Antaike on Dec. 22. Yang has been
researching copper in China for 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, denied allegations that it may have evaded value
added tax in Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Der Spiegel reported that prosecutors in Mannheim have been
probing Pfizer on tax evasion allegations since 2006, citing a
document from the investigation. The company may have failed to
properly register units in Germany for valued added tax
purposes, aiming to evade tax payments, the magazine said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Pfizer rejects the accusation that it set up a system to
avoid paying VAT,&#8221; the company&#8217;s German unit said in a
statement on its website. &#8220;The handling of deliveries as
practiced by the company didn&#8217;t cause Germany to generate less
tax.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company paid the VAT bills issued by the state
financial authorities, Pfizer said. After paying them, it
contested the bills and it expects tax courts to resolve the
disputes, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christina Arnold, the Mannheim prosecutor handling the
probe, wasn&#8217;t immediately available for comment, an assistant at
the prosecutors&#8217; office said when contacted by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp., JPMorgan
Chase  Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG were
picked to manage the sale of the U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s 92
percent stake in insurer American International Group Inc., said
a person with direct knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks will split the biggest share of fees from
handling the first disposal of part of Treasury&#8217;s 1.66 billion
AIG shares, said the person, who declined to be identified
because an announcement hasn&#8217;t been made. The offering will
likely happen in the first half of this year, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What better way to kick off the year than to have a role
underwriting a big, prestigious event to help sell the
government stake in AIG?&#8221; said William Cohan, a former JPMorgan
banker and current Bloomberg Television contributing editor.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a big offering, so they&#8217;re bringing out their big guns.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks beat out firms including Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley that sought a leading role in what may be one of
the largest U.S. stock sales. Citigroup and Bank of America are
advising AIG on its restructuring, the person said. The U.S. is
unwinding its investment, acquired in the 2008 rescue that
swelled to $182.3 billion, in the New York-based insurer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission named Eileen Rominger, a former executive with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., to become director of its Division of Investment Management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rominger, 56, will take the helm next month at the unit
responsible for protecting investors and promoting capital
formation through oversight and regulation of the investment
management industry, the SEC said today in a statement. She
worked for the past 11 years at Goldman Sachs Asset Management,
most recently as global chief investment officer, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She will replace Andrew J. &#8220;Buddy&#8221; Donohue, who stepped
down in November, the SEC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Eileen brings the agency a lifetime of experience in the
asset management industry and a record of strong leadership,&#8221;
SEC Chairman Mary L. Schapiro said in the statement. &#8220;She
understands the importance of the nation&#8217;s investment management
industry to the well-being of investors everywhere.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, Andrea Rafael, said the
company doesn&#8217;t comment on its regulators. Rominger retired from
Goldman last month, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She comes to the SEC job with &#8220;unique credentials,&#8221; said
Paul Schott Stevens, president and chief executive officer of
the Washington-based Investment Company Institute, in a

interests of America&#8217;s mutual fund investors and the mission of
the SEC more broadly.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, posted
fourth-quarter profit and sales that topped analysts&#8217; estimates
as companies spent more on computer systems and software. The
shares climbed in late trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per-share profit rose to $4.18, the Armonk, New York-based
company said today in a statement, topping the $4.08 average
estimate of analysts&#8217; surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 6.6
percent to $29 billion as hardware revenue got a boost from
IBM&#8217;s newest mainframe and companies bought more analytics
software. Analysts estimated sales of $28.3 billion on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services signings rose 18 percent to $22.1 billion, the
first increase in a year. Full-year profit this year, excluding
some costs, will be at least $13 a share, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM&#8217;s well positioned as the economies around the world
are starting to pick up and IT spending starts to pick up,&#8221;
said Collins Stewart Plc analyst Lou Miscioscia, who rates the
shares &#8220;buy&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t own them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is the second technology bellwether whose
earnings suggest an uptick in information-technology spending.
Last week, Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, forecast
first-quarter sales that may top estimates, as companies buy
more computers and servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM climbed as much as 2.9 percent to $155.05 in late
trading, after rising 65 cents to $150.65 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 2.7
percent this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-Quarter Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter hardware revenue climbed 21 percent to $6.3
billion, as the mainframe introduced in July helped boost sales
in that product category by almost 70 percent. Sales from the
software division gained 7 percent to $7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the quarter increased 9.2 percent to $5.26
billion from $4.81 billion, or $3.59 a share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the 2011 full-year forecast, IBM is moving to
an operating reporting format, which excludes acquisition and
retirement costs. Per-share earnings on that basis will be at
least $20 in 2015, the company said today, up from its May
prediction of $20 per share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue will increase by about $20 billion in that
timeframe, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing in
analytics software that predicts trends, which will be a $16
billion business for IBM by 2015, and cloud computing, expected
to generate $3 billion annually by then. Smarter Planet,
Palmisano&#8217;s initiative to digitally monitor anything from roads,
buildings and hospitals to make them more efficient, should grow
to a $10 billion business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano also plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions through 2015. He announced 15 deals last year,
including storage-computer maker Netezza Corp. for $1.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMC Mortgage,
facing homeowner lawsuits over foreclosures, was sued by the
trustee of a mortgage portfolio for refusing to turn over
documents detailing the quality of loans bought by the trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., the trustee, is seeking access to files
for more than 2,000 underlying mortgages in the Bear Stearns
Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, according to the complaint
filed today in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee has repeatedly requested that EMC provide
access to the subject documents,&#8221; Wells Fargo said in the
complaint. &#8220;EMC has played proverbial &#8216;rope a dope&#8217; and
otherwise continued to drag its feet, and has produced nothing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of wrongdoing by banks and loan servicers triggered
a 50-state investigation last year into whether hundreds of
thousands of foreclosures were properly documented as the
housing market collapsed. Lending practices have also pitted
mortgage-bond investors against banks over misrepresentations
such as overstatements of borrowers&#8217; income and inflated
appraisals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine Holevas, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo said it needs access to the documents to answer
&#8220;serious&#8221; questions raised by investors in the trust about
whether EMC breached representations and warranties regarding
the quality of option-adjustable rate mortgage loans the trust
bought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investor Questions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor in the trust, who owns 42 percent of the
outstanding face amount of the portfolio&#8217;s certificates,
questioned the condition of underlying loans, Wells Fargo said
in the complaint, citing an August letter it received from David Grais, the investor&#8217;s attorney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grais, a partner at New York-based Grais  Ellsworth LLP,
represents the federal Home Loan Banks of Seattle and San
Francisco and Charles Schwab Corp. in litigation seeking to
force banks including Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan to
repurchase mortgage-backed securities because they allegedly
misrepresented the quality of the loans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a September interview, Grais said he was also working
with two hedge funds that hadn&#8217;t filed suits and had contacted
trustees with similar complaints. He wouldn&#8217;t name the funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Aug. 31, 2010, letter to San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo, Grais said he had investigated 1,317 of the loans held by
the trust and determined that EMC appeared to have violated its
representations with respect to 938 loans, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grais didn&#8217;t immediately return a phone call today seeking
comment on the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;400 Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo began requesting the documents in January last
year and reached an agreement with EMC in December on access to
files for 400 loans. EMC had until Jan. 12 to produce documents
on the first 100 loans, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC failed to produce the documents &#8220;culminating more than
a year of good-faith negotiations and misplaced patience by the
trustee in a futile attempt to avoid litigation,&#8221; Wells Fargo
said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank N.A. as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage Corp., CA6132,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said it is mailing $2 million in
refunds to military families who were overcharged on mortgages
or wrongfully lost their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We made mistakes here and we are fixing them,&#8221; Kristin Lemkau, a spokeswoman for the New York-based bank, said today in
a telephone interview. JPMorgan&#8217;s mortgage unit is refunding
excessive interest and fees charged to 4,000 active-duty
personnel and reimbursing or reversing foreclosures for 14 other
families who lost homes while on active duty, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marine Captain Jonathon Rowles, a pilot flying missions in South Korea, filed a lawsuit against JPMorgan July 6 in U.S.
District Court in South Carolina. He claims military personnel
were overcharged and subjected to aggressive collection
practices. He accused the bank of violating the Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act, which protects active-duty personnel from
foreclosure and prohibits banks from charging more than 6
percent for a mortgage. NBC News reported the lawsuit and
JPMorgan&#8217;s refunds on Jan. 17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowles said in the complaint that Chase Manhattan Mortgage
Corp., a subsidiary that serviced his loan, didn&#8217;t adjust the
interest rate on a $255,000 loan for his Colorado home even
after Rowles repeatedly provided proof of military service. The
bank &#8220;began to pursue aggressive collection methods,&#8221; calling
his mother&#8217;s home, his workplace and his home up to three times
a day, after midnight and sometimes at 4 a.m., he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal Review &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan conducted an internal review and has since put
into place a team of mortgage specialists dedicated to servicing
military loans, Lemkau said. &#8220;They deserve nothing less,&#8221;
Lemkau said. &#8220;While any customer mistake is regrettable, we
feel particularly bad about the mistakes we made here.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rowles is still pursuing his case, seeking damages,
attorney&#8217;s fees and other costs, said Richard Harpootlian,
Rowles&#8217; lawyer in Columbia, South Carolina. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Chase not only charged them too much, but harassed
them,&#8221; Harpootlian said. &#8220;We&#8217;re looking for our day in
court.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who sits on the
Senate Banking Committee, asked Attorney General Eric Holder in
a letter yesterday to investigate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan Chase was violating the law, and I am concerned
other banks may also be wrongly overcharging our troops or
taking unfair advantage of their situation,&#8221; Reed said in a
statement. &#8220;I urge all the banks to review, acknowledge, and
rectify any and all violations.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rowles lawsuit has been stayed pending a decision by
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, in a case on
whether private individuals can bring actions under this law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Rowles v. Chase Home Finance LLC, 9:10-cv-
01756, U.S. District Court, District of South Carolina
(Beaufort). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. is releasing a
version of its Office OneNote note-taking program for Apple
Inc.&#8217;s iPhone as the software maker seeks to increase usage of
Office on mobile phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app will be available starting today as a free trial.
The company hasn&#8217;t decided when and how much it will charge,
said Jason Bunge, senior director for Office Product Management,
in an interview. It&#8217;s the first Office program for the iPhone
and the third iPhone application from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft&#8217;s mobile-phone division aims to lure
customers to smartphones based on its Windows software and away
from the iPhone, units like Office and the Bing Internet search
engine are working to boost their user base with versions
designed for rival devices. The OneNote iPhone app was developed
in response to customer requests and Microsoft is expecting
&#8220;pretty strong demand for it,&#8221; Bunge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software will let users take and edit notes on their
iPhones and then synchronize them with their personal computers.
Mobile users can also insert photographs into the notes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. sold bonds
denominated in British pounds for the first time in more than
two years after saying last week that profit climbed to a record
in the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, issued
500 million pounds ($799 million) of 4.25 percent, six-year
notes that yield 150 basis points more than gilts, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01 percentage
point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering follows a $3.25 billion sale of fixed- and
floating-rate notes in the U.S. on Jan. 14, Bloomberg data show.
New York-based JPMorgan announced the same day that net income
in the fourth quarter rose 47 percent to $4.83 billion from a
year earlier, helped by $2 billion in reserves added back to
earnings as credit quality and the U.S. economy improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last sold bonds in the British currency in
December 2008, when it issued 600 million pounds of three-year
notes backed by the U.S. government under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.&#8217;s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program,
Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s Investors Service ranks JPMorgan Aa3, while
Standard  Poor&#8217;s grades it A+, one step lower. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp., based in Charlotte, North Carolina,
is the biggest U.S. bank by assets, according to data compiled
by the Federal Reserve. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy options of DirecTV and EMC Corp. as potential for a merger or acquisition
of these companies is not adequately factored into their prices, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives strategists Maria Grant and Katherine Fogertey
also recommended buying short-dated calls, selling long-term
options or both on companies including Textron Inc., Mylan Inc., Joy Global Inc. and Allergan Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors have become more comfortable that a supportive
economic backdrop coupled with high cash balances, low rates,
compelling internal rates of return and significant private
equity dry powder should drive MA,&#8221; the strategists wrote in a
note yesterday. &#8220;Short-dated options prices on single stocks
are near their lowest levels in years ahead of earnings on
average, presenting strong options-buying opportunities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stocks of takeover companies have tended to move an average
of 30 percent on the day of the announcement, Goldman said.
Announced deals worldwide rose 28 percent to $2.44 trillion last
year from 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Already
this year, there have been 1,030 deals for $94.1 billion
globally, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists selected the trades after screening for
buy- or  neutral-rated stocks that have a 15 percent or greater
chance of MA in the next year and where they see &#8220;upside&#8221; to
the analysts&#8217; price estimates. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s Kevin Connors, co-head of global foreign-exchange sales for Group of
10 currencies, is leaving the firm, a person with knowledge of
the situation said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His departure follows a breach of internal compliance
procedures, which didn&#8217;t involve anyone else, said the person,
who declined to be identified because the details are private. A
spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in London declined to comment
today. Connors&#8217;s mobile phone was turned off. He was named a
partner in 2008 and initially joined the bank in 1990. Connors
is still listed as &#8220;active&#8221; on the U.K. Financial Services
Authority&#8217;s register. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is trying to improve its reputation after the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the firm and
employee Fabrice Tourre in April over claims the company misled
investors in a collateralized debt obligation linked to subprime
mortgages. Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million in July to
settle the lawsuit. The FSA also fined the New York-based bank
in September for failing to report to U.K. regulators the U.S.
investigation that led to the suit. The fine was the second
largest levied by the FSA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connors&#8217;s job involved getting clients to trade with
Goldman Sachs. His co-head of global foreign-exchange sales for
Group of 10 currencies is Lora Robertson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs dismissed Alexandre Harfouche, co-head of the
European syndicate, for not following compliance rules a person
with knowledge of the matter said in November. The violations
involved a failure to make certain disclosures and didn&#8217;t break
securities laws or harm clients, said the person, who declined
to be identified. Harfouche couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment
through Goldman Sachs at the time and wasn&#8217;t listed in the London directory. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Angolan Oil Minister Jose Maria
Botelho de Vasconcelos said talks are continuing to allow India&#8217;s Oil  Natural Gas Corp. to buy Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s 25
percent stake in the country&#8217;s Block 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Oil companies &#8220;may decide to leave and others decide to
join in,&#8221; Vasconcelos told reporters today in the capital,
Luanda.  &#8220;It&#8217;s a dynamic process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State-run ONGC said last month it submitted a binding bid
for Exxon&#8217;s stake in Block 31, which is due to start production
next year and reach peak output of as much as 150,000 barrels a
day, according to India&#8217;s Junior Oil Minister Jitin Prasada.
Exxon declined to say whether the stake was for sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angola, which vies with Nigeria as Africa&#8217;s top oil
producer, pumped 590 million barrels from January to November.
Angola, a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, adhered to the cartel&#8217;s quotas, Vasconcelos said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As benchmark crude nears $100 a barrel, Vasconcelos says he
doesn&#8217;t believe there will be a repetition of the price collapse
of 2008, when New York oil touched a record $147.27 a barrel
before retreating to almost one-fifth of that value. The world
has learned its lesson, and there is more dialogue between oil
producers and consumers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Construction of Angola&#8217;s second refinery, the 200,000
barrel-a-day Sonaref plant, is at an &#8220;advanced stage,&#8221;
Vasconcelos said. The country&#8217;s first natural gas project, set
to start exports in the first quarter of 2012, is 62 percent
done, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co. narrowed the annual
loss at Hong Kong Disneyland and said it expects the business to
turn profitable &#8220;fairly soon&#8221; as visitor numbers rise and the
park expands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The net loss shrank to HK$720 million ($93 million) in the
12 months ended Oct. 2 from a HK$1.3 billion loss a year earlier,
according to a statement distributed in Hong Kong today. Park
attendance increased 13 percent to 5.2 million visitors,
boosting sales 19 percent to HK$3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The theme park benefited from a 27 percent surge in
arrivals from mainland China in Hong Kong last year as wealth
generated in the world&#8217;s fastest-growing major economy spurred
outbound tourism. New areas of the park scheduled to be
completed in 2014 may lure more visitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We hope they can accelerate the expansion and add more
rides,&#8221; said Joseph Tung, executive director of Hong Kong&#8217;s
Travel Industry Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park, a venture between Hong Kong&#8217;s government and the
Burbank, California-based company, plans to add rides including
&#8220;Toy Story Land,&#8221; &#8220;Grizzly Trail&#8221; and &#8220;Mystic Point&#8221; after
the city approved the conversion of part of its loan to the park
into equity in 2009 and Disney agreed to pay HK$3.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The expansion is very crucial to our profits in the
future,&#8221; Hong Kong Disneyland managing director Andrew Kam told
reporters today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Visitors &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s government owns about 53 percent of the theme
park. Disney, the world&#8217;s largest media company, owns the rest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The expansion plan is on time and on budget as the park
signed most of the outsourcing contacts in 2009 that allow it to
avoid a rise in raw-material costs, Kam said. &#8220;Toy Story Land&#8221;
will be completed this year, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The share of Hong Kong Disneyland visitors coming from
mainland China rose to 42 percent from 36 percent, while Hong
Kong&#8217;s contribution declined to 33 percent from 41 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The park had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
and amortization of HK$221 million. Hotel occupancy increased 12
percentage points to 82 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ticketing generates the most profit, Kam said, followed by
merchandising, food and beverage and hotel businesses. He said
98 percent of the theme park's 5.2 million visitors last year
paid for their tickets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total visitor arrivals to the former British colony surged
22 percent to 36 million in 2010, according to the government-
backed Hong Kong Tourism Board. China&#8217;s National Tourism
Administration said outbound tourism increased 17.5 percent last
year to 56 million people, Xinhua News Agency reported Jan. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong Disneyland expects attendance to grow 10 percent
in 2011, in line with a forecast from the city&#8217;s Tourism Board,
Kam said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese stock futures and
Australian shares fell after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. failed to
exceed profit estimates and U.S. housing starts declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American depositary receipts of Toyota Motor Corp., the
world&#8217;s biggest carmaker, dropped 1.1 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of Canon Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
camera maker, sank 1 percent. BHP Billiton Ltd., the No. 1
mining company worldwide, slumped 1.7 percent in Sydney today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may be hard to find a good reason to buy,&#8221; said
Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $450 million in assets in
Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
March closed at 10,455 in Chicago yesterday, compared with
10,580 in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 10,460
in Osaka, Japan, at 8:05 a.m. local time today. Australia&#8217;s
SP/ASX 200 Index dropped 0.5 percent and New Zealand&#8217;s NZX 50
Index declined 0.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The index declined 1 percent yesterday in New York, its
biggest drop since November, after Goldman Sachs reported
fourth-quarter net income decreased to $3.79 a share. Estimates
of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg averaged $3.79 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in the U.S., housing starts fell 4.3 percent in
December to a 529,000 annual rate, Commerce Department figures
showed yesterday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a 550,000 rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency, Commodities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dollar depreciated to as low as 81.85 yen today, the
least in two weeks. A weaker dollar cuts the value of U.S.
income at Japanese companies when repatriated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for February delivery fell 0.6 percent to settle at
$90.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday,
the lowest level since Jan. 10. The London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial metals including copper and
aluminum lost 1.3 percent, its biggest decline since Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may see a decline in exporters as the yen strengthens,
and commodity related shares may fall on lower oil prices,&#8221;
Akino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 2.1 percent this year to
yesterday, compared with gains of 1.9 percent by the SP 500 and
2.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark were valued at 14.4 times estimated earnings on
average at the last close, compared with 13.4 times for the SP
500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; William Daley, President Barack Obama&#8217;s new chief of staff, filed a notice with the Securities
and Exchange Commission today to sell 186,190 shares of JPMorgan
Chase  Co. that he valued at almost $8.3 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approximate date of sale was listed in the filing as
today and comes as Daley, a former JPMorgan executive, divests
his holdings to work at the White House. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daley&#8217;s last day as a vice chairman at JPMorgan was Jan. 7.
He resigned from the boards of Boeing Co. and Abbott
Laboratories the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To join the White House, Daley can&#8217;t hold a specific
equity, such as the JPMorgan shares, unless he seeks a waiver.
Like all top federal executives, judges and members of Congress,
Daley also must disclose assets, liabilities and memberships on
boards to comply with conflict-of-interest rules under a 1974
ethics law. Those documents, due within 30 days of assuming the
job, will give a fuller picture of Daley&#8217;s wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He replaced Pete Rouse, whom Obama named on Oct. 1 to fill
the role on an interim basis after Rahm Emanuel resigned to run
for mayor of Chicago. Daley is the brother of the city&#8217;s current
mayor, Richard M. Daley, who is retiring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan fell $1.04 today to $43.71 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daley&#8217;s background in business and finance -- he joined New
York-based JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, in
2004 -- was among the reasons Obama picked him for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daley was President Bill Clinton&#8217;s commerce secretary from
January 1997 to June 2000. He served as president of SBC
Communications Inc., now ATT Inc., for more than two years
before moving to JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. sold A$175
million ($175 million) of bonds in the first domestic currency
debt sale by Australia&#8217;s biggest soft-drink maker in almost five
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil marketed the notes to investors in Asia
and Europe, and priced them to yield 60 basis points more than
the mid-swap rate, a person familiar with the transaction said,
asking not to be named as the details are private. The 6.125
percent notes are due in May 2014, and the sale was managed by
Credit Suisse Group AG and BNP Paribas SA, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sydney-based company has bonds in U.S. dollars, yen and
its home currency outstanding, the data show. It last sold
Australian-dollar bonds in March 2006, when it priced A$100
million of floating-rate notes due 2013 with a coupon of 34
basis points, or 0.34 percentage point, more than the bank bill
swap rate, according to the data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit-default swaps on Coca-Cola Amatil cost 53.7 basis
points, the least of any of the Markit iTraxx Australia index&#8217;s
25 members, CMA prices show. The company, which is 30 percent
owned by Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co., the world&#8217;s biggest soft-
drink maker, is rated A3 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service, the
seventh-highest grade, and the equivalent A- by Standard 
Poor&#8217;s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Australia Bank Ltd. priced A$1.25 billion of
January 2014 bonds to yield 75 basis points more than swap rates
yesterday, the lender said in a statement. The bank has a long-
term rating of Aa1 from Moody&#8217;s, the second-highest ranking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks fell, driving the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index to its biggest drop since November,
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. failed to beat profit estimates
and housing starts slid more than forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs slumped 4.7 percent, the most since April,
after earnings tumbled 52 percent because of lower revenue from
trading and investment banking. A gauge of homebuilders in SP
indexes retreated 2.9 percent. American Express Co. declined 2.4
percent following a lower-than-estimated profit forecast. International Business Machines Corp. rallied 3.4 percent after
reporting earnings that topped analysts&#8217; projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 slumped 1 percent to 1,281.92 at 4 p.m. in New
York after a two-day rally of 0.9 percent. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average declined 12.64 points, or 0.1 percent, to
11,825.29 as IBM&#8217;s advance limited losses. The VIX, as the
Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index is known, rose
9.1 percent, the most since November, to 17.31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;d better buckle up,&#8221; said Stanley Nabi, New York-
based vice chairman of Silvercrest Asset Management Group, which
oversees $9.5 billion. &#8220;Comparisons at both economic and
earnings reports are not going to be that easy this year. That
doesn&#8217;t mean things are getting worse. However, investors will
need to get ready for more conservative readings.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Scorecard &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 has rallied seven straight weeks as optimism
increased that the economy is rebounding and companies beat
profit estimates. Seventeen of the 24 companies in the index
that reported quarterly earnings since Jan. 10 have topped
analysts&#8217; predictions, according to Bloomberg data. Income grew
22 percent in the fourth quarter and will increase 14 percent in
2011, according to the average analyst projections. Sales topped
estimates at 18 of the 24. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing in the earnings reports that is giving
cause for either new concern or extra optimism in terms of our
view that markets will go higher in 2011,&#8221; said Oliver Pursche,
co-manager of the GMG Defensive Beta Fund and president of
Suffern, New York-based Gary Goldberg Financial Services, which
manages about $500 million. &#8220;Companies have done a phenomenal
job at increasing profit margins through cost cutting. So, for
companies to continue to beat earnings estimates, it will have
to come from growth in sales. That&#8217;s absolutely critical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Alcoa Inc., the first Dow company to announce quarterly
results, last week reported earnings excluding tax benefits and
gains on restructuring and derivatives of 21 cents a share,
beating the average analyst estimate by 12 percent. Sales at the
largest U.S. aluminum producer gained 4 percent to $5.65
billion, missing projections. Earnings at Citigroup Inc., the
third-largest U.S. bank, missed estimates by 48 percent as
revenue from stock and bond trading fell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial Stocks Slump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gauge of financial companies in the SP 500 decreased 2.2
percent today. The KBW Bank Index retreated 2.4 percent as 23 of
its 24 stocks retreated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs slumped 4.7 percent to $166.49. Fourth-
quarter net income decreased to $2.39 billion, or $3.79 a share,
from $4.95 billion, or $8.20, a year earlier. Estimates of 22
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg averaged $3.79 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trading of bearish options on U.S. banks and brokers jumped
to the highest since June. More than 545,000 puts to sell the
Financial Select Sector SPDR exchange-traded fund changed hands,
six times the four-week average. The ETF tracking 81 companies
declined 2.2 percent to $16.25, while the most-active contracts
were March $15 puts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An index of homebuilders in SP indexes slid 2.9 percent.
D.R. Horton Inc., the second-largest U.S. homebuilder by
revenue, dropped 3.7 percent to $12.84. Lennar Corp., the third-
biggest, slid 3.4 percent to $19.79. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing Starts &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builders began work on fewer homes than projected in
December, a sign the industry that triggered the recession
continued to struggle more than a year into the U.S. economic
recovery. Housing starts fell 4.3 percent to a 529,000 annual
rate, the lowest level since October 2009, Commerce Department
figures showed. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a 550,000 rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American Express fell 2.4 percent to $45.24. The biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases said fourth-quarter net income
will be less than some analysts estimated as it disclosed costs
tied to job cuts in its servicing network. Net income rose 48
percent to $1.1 billion, or 88 cents a share. The average
estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 96 cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Steel Corp. decreased 5.9 percent to $52.33. The
producer of the metal was downgraded to &#8220;hold&#8221; from &#8220;buy&#8221; at
Deutsche Bank AG. The 12-month share-price estimate is $57. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 3.4 percent to $155.69 to help buoy the Dow. Per-
share profit rose to $4.18, the company said yesterday, beating
the $4.08 average estimate of analysts&#8217; surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales climbed to $29 billion as hardware revenue got a boost
from IBM&#8217;s newest mainframe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has the biggest weighting among 30 stocks in the Dow,
accounting for about 10 percent of the measure. Today&#8217;s advance
in IBM added 38.10 points to the Dow, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legg Mason Inc.&#8217;s Bill Miller said he likes dividend-paying
stocks such as IBM, ConocoPhillips and Microsoft Corp. &#8220;We&#8217;re
staying high in the quality spectrum,&#8221; Miller, head of the Legg
Mason Capital Management unit, said today at a firm&#8217;s investment
conference in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Apple Inc. fell 0.5 percent to $338.84, after earlier
rising as much as 2.3 percent to $348.60. Net income in the
fiscal first quarter rose to $6 billion, or $6.43 a share, from
$3.38 billion, or $3.67, a year earlier, Apple said yesterday.
Apple also projected second-quarter profit and sales that may
exceed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP Boosts Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SP&#8217;s Investment Policy Committee raised its 12-month
forecast for the SP 500 Index, the benchmark measure of U.S.
shares, to 1,370 from 1,315. The increase reflects the global
economy and &#8220;our rising confidence that corporate management
will reach the SP 500&#8217;s $95 earnings per share estimate for all
of 2011,&#8221; Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at SP
Equity Research, said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pessimism about U.S. stocks among investment newsletter
writers rose the most since Oct. 26. The proportion of bearish
publications among about 130 tracked by Investors Intelligence,
which has examined forecasts in newsletters since 1963, climbed
to 20.9 percent on Jan. 18, from 19.1 percent a week earlier.
The bullish reading fell to 56 percent from 57.3 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Technical analysts, who try to predict stock moves based on
price and trading patterns, track investor sentiment as a
contrarian indicator. They consider lower pessimism a sign
stocks will stop rising, under the theory that there are fewer
bearish investors left to change their minds and buy shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Negative sentiment increasing could be a longer-term
positive for the stock market,&#8221; said Eric Mintz, who helps
oversee about $4 billion at Eagle Asset Management in St.
Petersburg, Florida. &#8220;The one negative factor that all agreed
on going into 2011 was that people were overly bullish, and in
that environment returns tend to lag.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, and Apple
Inc., maker of the iPhone and iPad, reported earnings that beat
analysts&#8217; estimates, adding to evidence of a rebound in
corporate spending on technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM reported fourth-quarter profit and revenue yesterday
that topped analysts&#8217; predictions, buoyed by demand for computer
systems and software. Apple said more than 80 of the world&#8217;s top
100 companies are using the iPad tablet computer, contributing
to the company&#8217;s record quarterly sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Businesses are spending more on products ranging from IBM
mainframes to smartphones and tablet computers. That bodes well
for results due in coming weeks from Hewlett-Packard Co., Microsoft Corp., Dell Inc. and other companies that supply
corporations with computers, services and software. Last week, Intel Corp., the biggest chipmaker, forecast sales that may top
estimates as companies upgrade computer and server fleets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As companies have gotten through a couple of years of
underinvestment, they really need to refresh their
infrastructure,&#8221; said Abhey Lamba, an analyst at ISI Group in
New York. &#8220;The December quarter was really great for servers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After slashing spending in the wake of the worst U.S.
economic recession since the 1930s, corporations are now
updating their aging hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports last week on retail sales and industrial production
supported prospects for quickening growth that may boost demand
for products as varied as cars from Ford Motor Co. cars and
computer products made by Apple and IBM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Employee Demand&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per-share profit rose to $4.18, Armonk, New York-based IBM
said yesterday, topping the $4.08 average estimate of analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 6.6 percent to $29 billion
as hardware revenue got a boost from IBM&#8217;s newest mainframe and
as companies bought more analytics software. Analysts estimated
sales of $28.3 billion on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said sales increased 71 percent to $26.7 billion,
exceeding the $24.4 billion predicted by analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. The company sold 7.33 million iPad tablet computers in
the first holiday season for the device, Apple said yesterday.
That topped the 6 million projected by Mike Abramsky at RBC
Capital Markets LLC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Employee demand for iPad in the corporate environment
continues to be significant,&#8221; Apple Chief Financial Officer
Peter Oppenheimer said yesterday. &#8220;Enterprise CIOs are adding
iPads to their approved device list at an amazing rate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testing IPads &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and Wells Fargo
 Co. are among companies now testing or using the device, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone thought they could sell 7 million
iPads,&#8221; said Jane Snorek, who helps oversee about $75 billion
at Nuveen Asset Management and said Apple is Nuveen&#8217;s biggest
holding. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone thought they could even make 7
million iPads.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies are using the iPad for product demonstrations,
approving shipping orders and calling up finance options to help
sell products ranging from cars to loans, customers such as
Wells Fargo, SAP AG and Tellabs Inc. said after its introduction
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple, based in Cupertino, California, fell $1.81 to
$338.84 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.
The company is the world&#8217;s second-most valuable company behind
Exxon Mobil Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM added $5.04, or 3.4 percent, to $155.69 on the New York
Stock Exchange, setting a record for a third straight day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, scheduled to announce quarterly earnings on Jan.
27, may report sales rose 1 percent as corporate demand for
Office and server software makes up for weaker-than-expected
personal-computer sales to consumers. Sales will be $19.1
billion, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That trade-off was evident in Intel&#8217;s earnings. The Santa
Clara, California-based company said demand for chips used in
so-called cloud-computing centers, which provide network
services over the Internet, bolstered fourth-quarter sales and
profit even as consumer demand for notebooks remained sluggish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM said fourth-quarter hardware revenue climbed 21 percent
to $6.3 billion, as a mainframe computer introduced in July
helped boost sales in that product category by almost 70
percent. Sales from the software division gained 7 percent to $7
billion. Signings for services rose 18 percent to $22.1 billion,
the first increase in a year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. shares climbed to their third record in as many days as
analysts raised their price estimates for the stock on
increasing spending by corporations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose 3.4 percent today after IBM posted sales
and profit that topped estimates after-market yesterday. More
than half of IBM analysts tracked by Bloomberg increased their
price targets, including six who predict the stock will reach at
least $175. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM reported sales growth in every division, as well as a
bump in services contracts -- the first in a year -- and said it
is on track to hit a goal of almost doubling operating earnings
to $20 or more by 2015. The company has boosted per-share profit
for more than 30 straight quarters, and investors are starting
to take notice, said Rob Cihra, an analyst at Caris  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;IBM steadily was able to even grow during the downturn,
and IBM is slowly starting to get credit for that,&#8221; said New
York-based Cihra, who rates IBM &#8220;above average&#8221; and has a 12-
month price target of $175. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, which has
its 100th anniversary this year, is also benefiting as
corporations resume spending after the recession, said Chris Whitmore, a Deutsche Bank AG analyst, who predicts companies&#8217;
information-technology budgets will grow 6 percent this year. He
boosted his price target for IBM by $20 to $175 today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter sales climbed 6.6 percent to $29 billion,
with hardware revenue rising more than 20 percent as a mainframe
computer introduced in July helped boost sales in that product
category. Sales from the software division, accounting more than
40 percent of total profit, climbed 7 percent $7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analytics, Cloud Computing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, forecast that operating
earnings, which exclude acquisition and some retirement costs,
will increase 11 percent to $13 a share this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shares rose $5.04 to $155.69 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading for the biggest jump since May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer in March
2002, he&#8217;s divested hardware units, including the personal-
computer business sold to China&#8217;s Lenovo Group Ltd., and
invested in more-profitable software and services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an investor briefing in May, he laid out how IBM plans
to reach its 2015 earnings target, as well as boost its annual
revenue of almost $100 billion by another $20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That helped the company break an 11-year-old closing price
record in October, hitting $138.72. Since then the shares have
climbed 12 percent, outpacing the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is investing in analytics software and so-
called cloud computing, which the company forecasts will become
$16 billion and $3 billion businesses respectively by 2015.
Smarter Planet, Palmisano&#8217;s initiative to digitally monitor
anything from roads to hospitals to make them more efficient,
should grow to a $10 billion business, the company projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano also plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions through 2015. He announced 15 deals last year,
including the purchase of storage-computer maker Netezza Corp.
for $1.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore" date="Jan 19, 2011  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-19/goldman-earnings-drop-52-matching-estimates-as-trading-revenue-declines.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Shares Drop After Earnings Fall for Third-Straight Quarter</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. shares fell
the most in almost nine months after the firm reported its third
straight quarterly earnings decline, led by a slowdown in
trading and investment banking revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading, the
firm&#8217;s largest source of revenue, tumbled 48 percent from a year
earlier to $1.64 billion, the New York-based company said today
in a statement. Equities-trading revenue dropped 5 percent to $2
billion and investment banking fell 10 percent to $1.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s clients bought and sold fewer stocks, bonds
and other securities during the quarter because of the European
debt crisis, regulatory changes and concern the economic rebound
would stall, Chief Financial Officer David A. Viniar said on a
conference call. While business picked up in January, Viniar
said it&#8217;s too early to make predictions for the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It was just a very weak environment for fixed-income
trading and to a certain extent equity trading as well,&#8221; said
Keith Davis, an analyst at Farr, Miller  Washington LLC in Washington, which manages about $700 million, including Goldman
Sachs shares. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think one poor quarter from a trading
perspective makes a trend.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined $8.19, or 4.7 percent, to $166.49 at
4:15 p.m. in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
the biggest drop since a 9.4 percent tumble on April 30. The
shares had gained 3.9 percent this year through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment Banking &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Trone, an analyst at JMP Securities LLC in New York
who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Goldman Sachs stock, said in
an interview that the results raise questions about whether
firms like Goldman Sachs will have to depend more on investment
banking and equity trading as revenue from fixed-income,
currencies and commodities, known as FICC, erodes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The idea that clients had no conviction -- they&#8217;ve been
saying that for three quarters now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Within the
context of client activity there seems to be something
structural going on that would suggest that the FICC cycle is
kind of over.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results prompted some analysts to reduce estimates for
2011 fixed-income trading revenue and earnings per share.
Richard X. Bove at Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida, said in
a note to investors that he cut his 2011 profit estimate to
$14.70 per share from $20.32 previously. He reduced his price
target on the stock to $188 from $214. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Structural Changes&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It has been my thinking to this point that the businesses
would regain their peak performance, driven by increases in money supply and economic activity,&#8221; Bove wrote. &#8220;This is
still possible, but I now believe that there have been
structural changes in the market which will delay regaining the
peak for a number of years.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income fell to $2.39 billion, or $3.79 a
share, from $4.95 billion, or $8.20, a year earlier. Estimates
of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg averaged $3.79 a share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the conference call with analysts, Viniar said the firm
was still adding employees, especially in high-growth markets,
because it expects a rebound in demand from clients after an
unusually slow fourth quarter. While he said some credit-market
products that were popular before the financial crisis are
unlikely to return quickly, he doesn&#8217;t expect those businesses
to disappear permanently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Out of Favor&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t tend to think most things are permanent,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Some products that were in favor are now out of favor
and are likely to stay out of favor for at least some period of
time, but other products are likely to be developed to replace
them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, worked to
maintain Goldman Sachs&#8217;s profitability and reputation last year
as trading revenue declined from a record in 2009 and the bank
settled a civil fraud lawsuit filed by a U.S. regulator. Last
week Goldman Sachs released a set of new business practices and
changed financial reports to separate client-trading revenue
from gains and losses generated by bets with its own money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are seeing signs of growth and more economic activity
and we are well-positioned to help our clients expand their
businesses, manage their risks and invest in the future,&#8221;
Blankfein said in the statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue Estimates &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s full-year revenue fell 13 percent to $39.2
billion in 2010 from $45.2 billion in 2009, the firm said. In
the fourth quarter, revenue dropped 10 percent to $8.64 billion.
The average estimate of 14 analysts in a Bloomberg survey was
$8.86 billion in revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation and benefits, the bank&#8217;s biggest expense,
decreased 5 percent to $15.4 billion from $16.2 billion as the
number of employees rose 10 percent from a year earlier to
35,700. Goldman Sachs, which took a $600 million charge in the
second quarter related to a one-time tax on bonuses in the U.K.,
recouped $135 million of that in the fourth quarter after
determining it had overestimated the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JMP Securities&#8217; Trone said that the firm made up for a
weaker-than-expected revenue figure by reducing compensation
costs more than investors and analysts were anticipating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixed-income traders had a tougher time making money in
2010 as volume fell and prices improved at a slower pace from
the previous year. The extra yield investors demanded to own
investment-grade debt instead of Treasuries tumbled 414 basis
points in 2009 to end the year at 190 basis points, the biggest
annual drop in Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
beginning in 1996. In 2010 spreads narrowed 24 basis points, the
data show. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Citigroup &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter earnings reports from JPMorgan Chase  Co.
and Citigroup Inc., the second- and third-biggest U.S. banks by
assets, showed that fixed-income trading revenue fell compared
with the prior quarter and for 2010 as a whole. Average weekly
trading volume in corporate debt dropped 11 percent in 2010 from
2009, according to Federal Reserve data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s FICC revenue fell 37 percent for the full
year to $13.7 billion. Full-year equities-trading revenue
dropped 25 percent to $8.09 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut the size of its trading bets during the
year. Average value-at-risk, an estimate of how much the firm
could lose trading in a single day, fell to $134 million in 2010
from $218 million in 2009. In the fourth quarter, the measure
dropped to $120 million from $121 million in the prior quarter
and from $181 million a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the decline in risk-taking was in bets on interest
rates, where value at risk dropped to an average $93 million in
2010 from $176 million in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investing and Lending &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar said on the conference call that some parts of the
firm&#8217;s investing and lending unit may be prohibited under new
rules being drafted by U.S. regulators. The firm, which has
traditionally invested more than 3 percent of its own money into
private equity and hedge funds it manages, will have to reduce
those holdings under the new rules, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s investment bank and money-management
divisions have been in the spotlight this month after the firm
and some of its funds invested $450 million in closely held
Internet social networking site Facebook Inc. and tried to sell
$1.5 billion of the company in a private placement to wealthy
clients. On Jan. 17, the firm said it would restrict the sale to
clients outside the U.S. on concern media coverage of the deal
would run afoul of rules governing private offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viniar declined to answer questions about the Facebook deal
posed by analysts on today&#8217;s conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm said its investment-banking transaction backlog
decreased compared with the end of the third quarter, which
JMP&#8217;s Trone said he thought was surprising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You would have thought the pipeline would have been up,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European stocks slid the most since
November after a report said the U.S. building industry started
work on fewer homes than projected and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
posted earnings that failed to exceed analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Qiagen NV sank 2.2 percent as Exane BNP Paribas cut its
recommendation on the shares. Swatch Group AG declined even
after reporting increased sales and ASML Holding NV dropped even
as its quarterly profit beat estimates. Kesa Electricals Plc
plunged 9.8 percent after the owner of Comet and Darty
electrical goods stores said its profit will be toward the lower
end of analysts&#8217; projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index slid 1.4 percent to 282.72 at
the 4:30 p.m. close in London, the gauge&#8217;s largest retreat in
seven weeks. The measure advanced 1 percent last week as
investors speculated that European leaders will increase their
efforts to contain the region&#8217;s debt crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The underlying mood is positive, though some caution is
prevailing after the strengthening of the European Financial
Stability Facility has been postponed, while volatility is still
affecting financial shares,&#8221; said Nicola Trivelli, who helps
manage about 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion) as chief investment
officer of Sella Gestioni Sgr in Milan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Euro-area finance ministers meeting late on Jan. 17 ruled
out increasing the size of the 750 billion-euro EFSF for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European stocks extended their losses as an economic
adviser to the German government was cited as saying Europe&#8217;s
largest economy should set aside funds to prepare for a Greek
default in an interview with Handelsblatt newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that Greece will manage to deal with its
debts without a cut,&#8221; said Lars Feld, one of five economists on
a panel that advises the German government and a professor at
the University of Freiburg. &#8220;And then German guarantees will
come due.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greek bonds fell, pushing the extra yield that investors
demand to hold the securities over German bunds higher, after
Die Zeit reported Germany is considering a plan to help Greece
restructure its debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Germany would allow Greece to buy back government bonds
with funds from the European Financial Stability Facility made
available &#8220;with favorable interest conditions,&#8221; the German
newspaper reported, without saying where it obtained the
information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A downward correction was always likely after yesterday&#8217;s
strong gains, and long-term investors will be hoping this is
simply a case of opportunist profit taking before the general
uptrend continues, rather than a more serious malaise,&#8221; Ben
Critchley, sales trader at IG Index, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., housing starts fell 4.3 percent to a 529,000
annual rate last month, the lowest level since October 2009,
Commerce Department figures showed today in Washington. The
median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey called for 550,000
starts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Results &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s earnings dropped 52 percent, matching
analysts&#8217; estimates, as revenue from trading and investment
banking declined. Even so, 2010 was the fourth-best year for
profits in the firm&#8217;s history. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income fell to $2.39 billion, or $3.79 a
share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $4.95 billion, or
$8.20, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in
a statement. The estimates of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
averaged $3.79 per share, and ranged from $3 to $4.31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National benchmark indexes fell in 14 of the 18 western
European markets. France&#8217;s CAC 40 Index and Germany&#8217;s DAX Index
each dropped 0.9 percent. The U.K.&#8217;s FTSE 100 Index lost 1.3
percent. Greece&#8217;s ASE Index posted the best performance, rising
4.5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Qiagen lost 2.2 percent to 14.01 euros. Exane downgraded
the biotechnology company to &#8220;neutral&#8221; from &#8220;outperform.&#8221;
The brokerage said in a note that Qiagen suffers from a &#8220;lack
of positive short-term catalysts.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swatch Slides &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swatch dropped 4.9 percent to 373.80 Swiss francs even as
the world&#8217;s largest watchmaker said sales rose 19 percent in
2010, led by demand for luxury brands in Asia, central Europe
and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The numbers were good this morning,&#8221; said Benno Galliker, a trader at Luzerner Kantonalbank AG in Lucerne,
adding that the shares suffered from &#8220;some profit taking&#8221; as
&#8220;some think the numbers were as good as it gets and it will be
hard to sustain the growth rate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kesa slumped 9.8 percent to 136 pence, its largest drop in
two years, after Europe&#8217;s third-largest electronics retailer
said profit before tax would be at the lower end of market
estimates after sales retreated at Christmas. Revenue at stores
open at least a year fell 4 percent in the 11 weeks to Jan. 18,
the London-based retailer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASML, Edenred Slip &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ASML sank 6.8 percent to 27.90 euros as investors
speculated that the company&#8217;s growth will slow in 2011. Europe&#8217;s
biggest semiconductor equipment maker posted fourth-quarter
profit that beat analysts&#8217; estimates, with 2010 sales rising to
a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe important momentum indicators like bookings,
book-to-bill ratio and backlog are set to trend down in coming
quarters,&#8221; Kepler Capital Markets wrote in a note. &#8220;With the
stock having almost tripled in two years, we believe it is time
to take profits.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edenred SA lost 2.1 percent to 18.25 euros as Cheuvreux SA
said in a note that the world&#8217;s largest seller of meal and
service vouchers posted &#8220;a decent performance, not more.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edenred said fourth-quarter sales rose 13 percent as it
issued more tickets in Latin America. Cheuvreux reiterated its
&#8220;underperform&#8221; rating, saying that &#8220;there is no reason to be
much more optimistic as long as we have no tangible improvement
in the labor market in Europe.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;William Hill, Eiffage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; William Hill Plc surged 7 percent to 189 pence, its biggest
gain in 15 months, after the company reported that fourth-
quarter sales at its betting parlors rose 8 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. bookmaker, which has about 2,350 shops, posted
full-year earnings before interest, taxes and amortization in
the 52 weeks ended Dec. 28 of some 275 million pounds ($439.7
million), excluding one-off items. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Eiffage SA soared 4.5 percent to 36.62 euros. France&#8217;s
third-largest construction company was named as preferred bidder
for a 3.4 billion-euro contract to finance, build and maintain a
high-speed railway between Le Mans and Rennes in western France. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Cheuvreux lifted its recommendation on the
shares to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8216;underperform.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pearson, Eurotunnel &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Pearson Plc surged 4.5 percent to 1,051 pence, its highest
price in eight months, as the owner of the Financial Times and
Penguin books raised its 2010 profit forecast for the third
time, citing growth in emerging markets and digital services.
The company predicted adjusted earnings per share of about 76
pence, a 16 percent increase on a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Groupe Eurotunnel SA advanced 5 percent to 7.12 euros as
Exane upgraded the operator of the undersea rail link between England and France to &#8220;outperform&#8221; from &#8220;neutral.&#8221; The
brokerage cited in a note a &#8220;much improved pricing outlook and
an attractive entry point.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ingenico rose 2.7 percent to 28.10 euros as the world&#8217;s
largest payment-terminal manufacturer said 2010 revenue probably
exceeded 900 million euros, beating its previous forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy&#8217;s Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl gained 5.2 percent to
3.05 euros as Deutsche Bank AG lifted its recommendation to
&#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;hold.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage said the stock is &#8220;currently undervalued,&#8221;
and the lender&#8217;s &#8220;solvency ratios seem solid enough to avoid a
capital increase.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria $500 million debut
international bond, to be sold this week, will probably yield
more than Ghana&#8217;s dollar debt because of political risks and
fiscal deterioration, JPMorgan Chase  Co. analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Africa&#8217;s most populous nation and biggest oil producer will
probably pay a yield ranging from 6.90 percent and 7.70 percent
on its 10-year bonds, compared with 6.2 percent on Ghana&#8217;s $750
million of debt due 2017, analysts including Johannesburg-based
Giulia Pellegrini wrote in an e-mailed note dated Jan. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Recent experience in sub-Saharan and North Africa has
increased political risks in the minds of investors who will
likely demand some additional compensation for political
uncertainty in the run-up to elections,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Ivory Coast missed an interest payment Dec. 31 on its $2.3
billion of Eurobonds amid a political standoff over disputed
results of the Nov. 28 election between incumbent Laurent Gbagbo, who refuses to step down, and internationally backed
winner Alassane Ouattara. Tunisia had its bond ratings
downgraded to the lowest investment-grade rating by Moody&#8217;s
Investors Service after the violent ouster of the North African
country&#8217;s ruler, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigeria is rated B+ by Standard and Poor&#8217;s, four levels
below investment grade, while Ghana is rated one level lower at
B. The country should pay more than Ghana because its debt will
carry a longer maturity and as its fiscal balance deteriorated
before the presidential election scheduled for April 9, the
analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Budget Deficit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Goodluck Jonathan in December proposed a 2011
budget of 4.23 trillion naira ($28 billion), 19 percent less
than what was approved for 2010. The budget will produce a
deficit equal to 3.62 percent of gross domestic product, in
keeping with the administration&#8217;s promise to narrow it from 6
percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We see a high probability that Jonathan will continue as
president after the elections and so do not place as large a
political risk premium as we might if there was more uncertainty
around this,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nigerian officials have been meeting investors in London
and the U.S. to market the bond. It plans to sell the debt on
Jan. 21, Miji Amidu, deputy director of the country&#8217;s Debt
Management Office, said in an interview in London today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country, which has sub-Saharan Africa&#8217;s second-largest
economy after South Africa, plans to use the Eurobond as a
benchmark for local companies to price debt and fund development
projects, Finance Minister Olusegun Aganga said in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country appointed Citigroup Inc. and Deutsche Bank AG
to manage the bond sale, helped by Barclays Capital and FBN
Capital Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. climbed the most in six months in New York trading,
extending yesterday&#8217;s record, after reporting fourth-quarter
profit and sales that topped analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Per-share profit rose to $4.18, the Armonk, New York-based
company said yesterday in a statement, beating the $4.08 average
estimate of analysts&#8217; surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales climbed to
$29 billion as hardware revenue got a boost from IBM&#8217;s newest
mainframe and companies bought more analytics software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Services signings jumped 18 percent to $22.1 billion, the
first increase in a year. Full-year profit this year, excluding
some costs, will be at least $13 a share, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM climbed $3.99, or 2.7 percent, to $154.64 at 9:47 a.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest
intraday gain since July 7. The stock rose 12 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investors are encouraged by strengths in the signings
this quarter,&#8221; said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore, who
rates the shares &#8220;buy&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t own them. &#8220;They exited the
year well. There&#8217;s not a lot to pick on this quarter.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is the second technology bellwether whose
earnings suggest an uptick in information-technology spending.
Last week, Intel Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest chipmaker, forecast
first-quarter sales that may top estimates, as companies buy
more computers and servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-Quarter Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter hardware revenue climbed 21 percent to $6.3
billion, as the mainframe introduced in July helped boost sales
in that product category by almost 70 percent. Sales from the
software division gained 7 percent to $7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income for the quarter increased 9.2 percent to $5.26
billion from $4.81 billion, or $3.59 a share, a year earlier.
Analysts estimated sales of $28.3 billion on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revenue from growth markets, such as Brazil, India and China, climbed 15 percent. Sales from the regions will make up
at least a quarter of revenue by 2015, the company said in May,
up from 21 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the 2011 full-year forecast, IBM is moving to
an operating reporting format, which excludes acquisition and
some retirement costs. Per-share earnings on that basis will be
at least $20 in 2015, the company said, reiterating its forecast
from May. Revenue will increase by about $20 billion in that
period, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reporting operating earnings provides more transparency and
a better comparison to other technology companies, Chief
Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on a conference call
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software and Deals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer Sam Palmisano is investing in
analytics software and cloud computing, which the company
forecasts will become $16 billion and $3 billion businesses
respectively by 2015. Smarter Planet, Palmisano&#8217;s initiative to
digitally monitor anything from roads to hospitals to make them
more efficient, should grow to a $10 billion business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano also plans to spend about $20 billion on
acquisitions through 2015. He announced 15 deals last year,
including storage-computer maker Netezza Corp. for $1.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

Moore and Christine Harper" date="Jan 19, 2011  9:30 AM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-19/goldman-sachs-cuts-its-compensation-pool-by-14-to-430-700-per-employee.html"><headline>Goldman Sachs Reduces Average Compensation Per Employee by 14% to $430,700</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s
compensation and benefits expense fell 5 percent to $15.4
billion in 2010 as the firm&#8217;s revenue decreased 13 percent and
the number of employees climbed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount, equal to 39 percent of revenue, is enough to
pay each of the firm&#8217;s 35,700 employees $430,700, according to a
statement today from the New York-based bank. That&#8217;s down 14
percent from an average of $498,246 for the firm&#8217;s 32,500
workers a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After setting an all-time high for Wall Street pay in 2007,
Goldman Sachs cut compensation costs to 36 percent of revenue in
2009, the lowest ratio ever, as it reported record earnings and
U.S. banks faced pressure from regulators and lawmakers to rein
in bonuses. JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s investment bank cut average
pay for employees 2.4 percent to $369,651 last year, the New
York-based lender said last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a lot of eyes on what they&#8217;re going to do from a
compensation perspective,&#8221; said Jason Tyler, senior vice
president of portfolio management at Chicago-based Ariel
Investments LLC, on Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;In The Loop&#8221; with
Betty Liu. &#8220;So the numbers are lighter than what they could have
been.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Charitable Giving &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks set aside a portion of revenue throughout
the year to pay employees and typically decide bonuses at the
end of the year based on full-year results. Average compensation
figures, derived by dividing the compensation pool by the number
of employees, don&#8217;t represent any individual&#8217;s worker&#8217;s actual
pay. Bonuses vary widely depending on an employee&#8217;s seniority,
job title, and performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, led by Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 56, is the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, and
JPMorgan is the second largest. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s compensation
figures don&#8217;t include costs tied to the U.K. bonus tax, for
which the firm recorded a $465 million expense in 2010. In
October, it said the cost would be $600 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation was reduced to fund a $320 million charitable
contribution to Goldman Sachs Gives, the bank said. The firm had
a negative compensation expense of $519 million in the fourth
quarter of 2009 as it cut pay to fund a $500 million
contribution to the charity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table compares compensation at Goldman Sachs
and JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is moving
French investment banking chief Jean Raby to Moscow to help
oversee its Russian office as the country starts a new round of
asset sales, said two people with direct knowledge of the
transfer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raby will work alongside Christopher Barter, who became
sole head of Goldman Sachs&#8217;s Russian office last year after co-
country chief David Schwimmer returned to New York, said the
people, who declined to be identified because the information
hasn&#8217;t been made public. Raby will run investment banking and
Barter will continue to oversee securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Vladimir Putin&#8217;s government in October
selected Goldman Sachs and nine other banks to help it raise at
least 1 trillion rubles ($34 billion) selling assets over the
next three years. The privatization list includes OAO Sberbank
and VTB Group, Russia&#8217;s two largest lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable Wall Street firm, is
rebuilding its Russian business after abandoning Moscow in 1998,
when the country defaulted on $40 billion of domestic debt. The
bank was the fifth-largest underwriter of Russian debt and
equity sales last year, with a market share of 11 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. It hired Clemens Grafe from UBS AG
in October as chief economist in Moscow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian share sales may jump to $28 billion this year, the
most since 2007, according to estimates by VTB Capital, last
year&#8217;s largest underwriter. Initial public offerings, mainly in
the mining, chemicals and retail industries, will probably total
$20 billion, while the state privatization program may raise
another $7 billion to $8 billion, Elena Khisamova, head of
equity markets at VTB Capital, said in an interview Nov. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raby joined Goldman Sachs in 1996 and was a made a partner
in 2004. He was promoted to run investment banking in France and Belgium alongside Shahriar Tadjbakhsh in 2006. Neither Raby nor
Barter responded to phone messages seeking comment and Elena
Zakrevskaya, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. said it would pay as
much as $632 million to Theraclone Sciences Inc. for research on
infectious disease and cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer will buy up to four human antibodies in as many as
two infectious diseases and two cancers, the companies said in a
statement today. New York-based Pfizer will be responsible for
clinical development of the antibodies, and Theraclone, which is
closely held and based in Seattle, will receive royalties on any
developed products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next five years, Pfizer faces generic competition
to products with $20 billion in annual sales, or almost a third
of the company&#8217;s revenue. The company moved to make up for
expected losses by acquiring Wyeth for $68 billion in 2009.
Earlier this month, Pfizer paid $14 million to use technology
from Santaris Pharma A/S to develop new drugs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Antibodies represent a very exciting class of
biotherapeutics for Pfizer to combat infectious disease and are
a proven approach to cancer treatment,&#8221; said Jose-Carlos
Gutierrez-Ramos, Pfizer&#8217;s senior vice president of
biotherapeutics research  development. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp., ordered to
return $500 million in deposits to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
and pay $90 million in interest, said it didn&#8217;t act with
&#8220;maliciousness&#8221; and shouldn&#8217;t have to pay damages greater than
$1.3 million of Lehman&#8217;s costs for litigating the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank wants to argue the point in a written brief to
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck, who has said he might fine
Bank of America for breaking bankruptcy rules in taking the
deposits, according to the bank&#8217;s Jan. 14 filing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman isn&#8217;t entitled to punitive damages because it can&#8217;t
prove the bank acted maliciously, Bank of America said in the
filing, a report by the two banks on the status of the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of the $590 million, Lehman said it wants at least
$10 million more, including attorney fees and other funds taken
by the bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peck said in his November ruling that Charlotte, North
Carolina-based Bank of America took deposits unrelated to the
loans to Lehman that it sought to protect. The seizure after New
York-based Lehman went bankrupt violated the law, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bank of America NA v. Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., 08-01753, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apple May Not Need to Reveal Details of Jobs Medical Leave &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Apple Inc. may already have told investors all it needs to
about Steve Jobs&#8217;s health problems in its Jan. 17 statement that
he was granted a leave of absence, according to three securities
law experts, Bloomberg News&#8217; Chris Dolmetsch and Peter Burrows
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They don&#8217;t have to say any more than the fact that he&#8217;s
taking a leave, it&#8217;s indefinite, if that&#8217;s what it is,&#8221; James
Cox, a Duke University law professor, said yesterday. &#8220;Then
they can express lots of generalized optimism which is not going
to get them into trouble because that&#8217;s the kind of expected
puffery for which there&#8217;s no actionable claims to speak of.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jobs took a leave of absence as his health deteriorates
from battling a rare form of cancer and the effects of a liver
transplant he had almost two years ago, according to a person
with knowledge of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securities laws require Apple to disclose developments that
a reasonable investor would consider to be important, Peter
Henning, a law professor at Wayne State University, said in a
phone interview. The SEC hasn&#8217;t provided guidance on whether
that would include Jobs&#8217;s medical condition, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment
beyond the statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parmalat Claim Against Grant Thornton Revived by Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two suits by Parmalat SpA and the company&#8217;s Parmalat
Capital Finance Ltd. unit claiming damages from the accounting
firm Grant Thornton LLP were revived by a federal appeals court
in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court ruled yesterday that U.S. District Judge
Lewis Kaplan, who was assigned to oversee federal Parmalat-
related lawsuits from throughout the country, applied the wrong
standard in deciding to exercise jurisdiction over the Grant
Thornton suits, which were originally filed in Illinois state
court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appeals court sent the cases back to Kaplan to
determine whether he should have permitted the cases to stay in
Illinois. Kaplan, after taking jurisdiction over the cases,
dismissed them in 2009. An affirmative ruling by Kaplan, or by
the appeals court reviewing Kaplan&#8217;s answer to the question,
would undo the dismissals and permit the Illinois court to
consider the claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Parmalat Securities Litigation, 04-
cv-01653, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Banks in MBIA Suit Oppose Insurance Department Appeal &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; UBS AG, Bank of America Corp. and other financial
institutions opposed the New York state Insurance Department&#8217;s
appeal of a court order to review e-mails by officials who
approved the 2009 split of MBIA Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, which sued over MBIA&#8217;s restructuring, filed
papers yesterday with the state&#8217;s Appellate Division, First
Department, in opposition to the department&#8217;s Jan. 3 motion for
permission to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case, filed in New York state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, the banks, which hold MBIA Insurance Corp. policies,
are challenging the department&#8217;s decision to allow MBIA to split
its municipal bond policies from its guarantees of subprime
mortgages and other debt that led to the loss of its top ratings
in 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state appeals court dismissed another case this month
by the banks challenging the split of the Armonk, New York-based
company, leading MBIA to climb to the highest since September
2008. That decision will be appealed to New York&#8217;s highest
court, in Albany, according to Robert Giuffra Jr., lead counsel
for the banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks claim the bond insurer&#8217;s restructuring left MBIA
Insurance Corp. with insufficient assets to honor its long-term
obligations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The New York Insurance Department is fighting tooth and
nail to stop the public from knowing anything about the basis
for its improper decision to allow MBIA to strip $5 billion in
assets from MBIA Insurance and illegally engineer its
unprecedented split into a &#8216;good insurer&#8217; and a &#8216;bad insurer,&#8217;&#8221;
Giuffra said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks claim the restructuring transferred $5 billion in
cash and securities out of MBIA&#8217;s primary operating unit, MBIA
Insurance, to another entity now known as National Public
Finance Guarantee Corp., according to the complaint. The move
benefited MBIA shareholders and executives while leaving MBIA
Insurance with insufficient assets to honor long-term guarantees
of about $230 billion in debt, the plaintiffs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is ABN Amro Bank NV v. MBIA Inc., 601846-2009, New
York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally&#8217;s GMAC Dismisses 250 Maryland Foreclosures &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial Inc.&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage unit agreed to drop
about 250 foreclosure cases in Maryland that were tied to
defective affidavits, the company said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMAC made the decision in November to dismiss and re-file
active foreclosure cases that may have been affected by flawed
foreclosure affidavits, Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally, said
yesterday in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re dismissing the cases but they will be re-filed,&#8221;
Proia said. &#8220;The intention is to re-file the cases to go
through the new foreclosure procedures in Maryland.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GMAC&#8217;s decision comes after a Maryland nonprofit, Civil
Justice Inc., agreed to drop a class-action lawsuit on behalf of
homeowners whose foreclosure documents were signed by GMAC
employee Jeffrey Stephan, Anthony DePastina, an attorney for
Civil Justice, said in a phone interview. Stephan said in sworn
depositions last year and in 2009 that he signed as many as
10,000 affidavits a month without checking their accuracy in a
practice that has come to be known as &#8220;robo-signing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Hopefully GMAC&#8217;s actions will set a precedent with other
lenders where robo-signing has occurred,&#8221; DePastina said. &#8220;I
think there will be a ripple effect throughout the country.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DePastina said as many as 1,000 foreclosures may be tied to
defective affidavits. Proia said that number is &#8220;factually
inaccurate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The company has been filing cases for dismissal and many
have already been granted,&#8221; Proia said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally&#8217;s GMAC Mortgage unit halted evictions in 23 states in
September amid concerns over its handling of foreclosure
documents. All 50 U.S. states are investigating mortgage firms
after revelations that banks may have acted illegally in using
so-called robo-signers to validate documents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Suits &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-Hedge Fund Manager Swindled Investors, U.S. Claims &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former hedge fund manager defrauded almost 50 investors
in a seven-year scheme that cost his clients more than $3.5
million, Chicago U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Brandolino, 42, of Joliet, Illinois, was charged
yesterday with a single count of mail fraud, a crime punishable
by as many as 20 years in prison, Fitzgerald said in a
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Since 2003, Brandolino allegedly told investors that
their funds, minus a commission, would be used to trade futures
contracts and always told them that the trading was profitable,
even though often it was not,&#8221; Fitzgerald said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former principal of the Brandolino Investment Group,
Falcon Capital Partners LLC and Lloyd Lewis Capital Inc.,
Brandolino took in about $4.7 million from &#8220;high net worth
investors,&#8221; according to the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He provided about $1.1 million in redemptions, lost about
half of the balance and spent most of the remainder on a 2004
BMW, a Rolex wristwatch and a down payment on an unbuilt
condominium in Greece, Fitzgerald said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandolino surrendered to federal agents yesterday and, at
an initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael
Mason, asked to remain in federal custody, according to
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jim turned himself in before any investigation began in
an attempt to do the right thing,&#8221; his lawyer, Robert J.
Callahan of Chicago, said in a telephone interview. Citing the
federal case, Callahan declined to comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandolino, who didn&#8217;t enter a plea yesterday, waived his
right to a hearing where the government must prove it has
probable cause to believe he committed a crime, said Randall
Samborn, a spokesman for Fitzgerald. The U.S. has 30 days to
obtain a grand jury indictment, Samborn said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Brandolino, U.S. District Court,
Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s EMC Mortgage Sued Over Home Loan Documents &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMC Mortgage, facing homeowner
lawsuits over foreclosures, was sued by the trustee of a
mortgage portfolio for refusing to turn over documents detailing
the quality of loans bought by the trust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., the trustee, is seeking access to files
for more than 2,000 underlying mortgages in the Bear Stearns
Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2, according to the complaint
filed yesterday in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The trustee has repeatedly requested that EMC provide
access to the subject documents,&#8221; Wells Fargo said in the
complaint. &#8220;EMC has played proverbial &#8216;rope a dope&#8217; and
otherwise continued to drag its feet, and has produced
nothing.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claims of wrongdoing by banks and loan servicers triggered
a 50-state investigation last year into whether hundreds of
thousands of foreclosures were properly documented as the
housing market collapsed. Lending practices have also pitted
mortgage-bond investors against banks over misrepresentations
such as overstatements of borrowers&#8217; income and inflated
appraisals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine Holevas, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage Corp., CA6132,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trials/Appeals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boeing Gets Support at Top Court on $3 Billion Award &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court questioned a ruling that could force Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp. to pay $3 billion in a
clash with the Navy over a canceled contract for a stealth
fighter aircraft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing arguments in a 20-year-old legal dispute, the
justices yesterday reviewed a federal appeals court decision
letting the Navy cancel the contract on the grounds that the
companies failed to meet their obligations. The ruling put the
government on track to recover $1.35 billion in payments, plus
the interest that has accrued over two decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several justices suggested the government&#8217;s invocation of
the so-called state secrets privilege, which let it avoid
disclosing sensitive information, prevented Boeing and General
Dynamics from presenting their case. Chief Justice John Roberts
and Justice Antonin Scalia said the fairest outcome might be to
throw out the whole case -- barring both the U.S. claim and the
companies&#8217; bid for $1.2 billion plus interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer,
voiced support for the government. Breyer said the companies&#8217;
position would mean that &#8220;we&#8217;re not just throwing a monkey
wrench into the gears of government contracting, we&#8217;re throwing
the whole monkey.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multibillion-dollar fight stems from one of the largest
defense procurement fiascos in U.S. history. The A-12 Avenger,
as the plane was known, never made it into production in spite
of years of development. It was designed to penetrate heavily
defended locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1988, General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas signed a
contract to build eight of the planes for the Navy at a total
target price of $4.4 billion. Three years later, the Navy and
then-Defense Secretary Dick Cheney declared the company in
default and canceled the contract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cases are General Dynamics v. United States, 09-1298,
and Boeing v. United States, 09-1302, U.S. Supreme Court. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mattel Accuses MGA of Stealing Bratz Doll Idea at Second Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Mattel Inc., the maker of Barbie, accused rival toymaker
MGA Entertainment Inc. of stealing its idea for the pouty,
multiethnic Bratz doll in 2000 when it made a deal with the
Mattel designer who created it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opening statements started yesterday in Santa Ana, California, federal court for a trial that U.S. District Judge
David Carter has said may take as long as four months. Mattel is
seeking damages for copyright infringement and trade-secret
theft from closely held MGA, which in turn will ask the jury to
hold Mattel liable for unfair competition and stealing its trade
secrets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case returns to court after a $100 million verdict in
favor of Mattel was overturned on appeal. MGA, based in Van
Nuys, California, said in court filings that Mattel may seek as
much as $1.1 billion in damages for its trade-secret claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2008, a federal jury in Riverside, California, agreed
with Mattel that doll designer Carter Bryant made most of the
initial sketches for the Bratz dolls while he worked for El
Segundo, California-based Mattel. The jury awarded the toymaker
$100 million in damages and Stephen Larson, the judge presiding
over the trial, awarded Mattel rights to most of MGA&#8217;s Bratz
products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco found that
Larson had wrongly ruled that Mattel automatically owned
Bryant&#8217;s design under the terms of an invention agreement and
that the judge incorrectly gave Mattel ownership of later Bratz
dolls that MGA developed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bryant v. Mattel, 04-09049, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verdicts/Settlement &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defective-Product Awards Rise as Trial Jurors Slap Companies &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Cybex International Inc., a fitness equipment maker, lost a
$66 million jury verdict in New York last month to an assistant
physical therapist who was paralyzed when an exercise machine
fell on her at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The state court jury&#8217;s Dec. 7 decision in Buffalo
illustrates the most prominent trend in U.S. court verdicts in
2010: a surge in awards against companies accused of putting
defective products on the market, Bloomberg News&#8217; Margaret
Cronin Fisk reports &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stalled economy and a surfeit of negative corporate
news, such as the BP Plc oil spill, sudden-acceleration suits
against Toyota Corp. and bank foreclosure practices, has fueled
public anger, affecting lawsuits against companies in unrelated
cases across the country, legal experts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Jurors are more willing to believe that there was
corporate wrongdoing that was intentional,&#8221; said Ophelia
Camina, a lawyer at Susman Godfrey LLP in Dallas who won a $246
million verdict last year in a breach-of-warranty and fraud case
against JDA Software Group Inc. &#8220;It&#8217;s easier to get people
angry when they&#8217;re already brooding.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cybex verdict, which was more than twice the company&#8217;s
market value, sent its shares down 37 percent. The accident was
unprecedented and not the result of a faulty product, the
Medford, Massachusetts-based company said. Cybex said it plans
to appeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten of the 50 largest jury verdicts last year came in
product-defect cases, compared with five in 2009 and one in
2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There were 15
such verdicts of $25 million or more in 2010, compared with
seven in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UBS Client Loses Swiss Appeal Against Data Handover to U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An American client of UBS AG lost an appeal against the
handover of her account data to the U.S. Internal Revenue
Service in a Swiss ruling that may be relevant to about a dozen
similar cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The client, who wasn&#8217;t identified, was the beneficiary of a
foundation based in neighboring Liechtenstein that earned at
least 300,460 Swiss francs ($314,000) on its UBS account and
didn&#8217;t declare the funds to the IRS, Switzerland&#8217;s Federal
Administrative Court said in a ruling published yesterday. The
court said the client was suspected of tax fraud as defined
under a Swiss-U.S. agreement that came into force last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switzerland agreed in 2009 to hand over information on as
many as 4,450 UBS accounts to the IRS, lifting a U.S. legal
threat to the country&#8217;s biggest bank. The UBS customer had
argued she didn&#8217;t benefit from an &#8220;offshore company account&#8221;
as described in the 2009 accord. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Foundations can be regarded as companies if they are able
to own property or have a lasting relationship with a bank, the
Bern, Switzerland-based court said in its ruling. There are
about a dozen similar appeals hinging on that definition, court
spokesman Andrea Arcidiacono said by telephone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Official Faces Life in Jail as Singapore Deters Graft &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singapore may send a former government executive to prison
for life to protect its graft-free image, after jailing the
first of his alleged accomplices in a decade-long scam for 10
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ho Yen Teck, 31, was sentenced on Jan. 14 for his part in
cheating three government agencies of more than S$12.5 million
($9.7 million), the city&#8217;s biggest public-sector graft case
since 1995. Prosecutors say Koh Seah Wee, a former deputy
director at the Singapore Land Authority, masterminded the
fraud, which has &#8220;severely shaken the public confidence&#8221; in
government controls. Koh, whose trial hasn&#8217;t been set, faces 372
charges, each of which carries a maximum term of as long as 10
years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh, 40, is accused of defrauding the Singapore Supreme
Court of an undisclosed amount, the Intellectual Property Office
of Singapore of S$286,000 and the land authority of S$12.2
million. He and Christopher Lim Chai Meng, 37, his former
subordinate, submitted false invoices through various shell
companies set up by five people including Ho for fictitious
information technology services and goods at the land agency,
according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ho&#8217;s lawyer Jackson Eng of Drew  Napier LLC said he is
seeking his client&#8217;s instructions on whether to appeal the
sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Koh&#8217;s lawyer Ravinderpal Singh declined to comment as the
case is before the courts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J. Crew Agrees to Settle Lawsuit Tied to TPG Buyout &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Crew Group Inc. agreed to settle a lawsuit over its
proposed $3 billion takeover by private-equity firms TPG Capital
and Leonard Green  Partners LP, and will spend another month
seeking competing offers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Crew will extend the period to solicit competing offers
until Feb. 15, according to a statement yesterday from the New
York-based clothier. J. Crew originally had until Jan. 15 to
find other offers. The agreement also will include a $10 million
payment to plaintiffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholders had filed complaints questioning whether Chief
Executive Officer Millard Drexler, who began negotiating with
the buyout firms months before the deal became public, obtained
a fair price from TPG and Los Angeles-based Leonard Green. J.
Crew now plans to hold a shareholder vote on the deal March 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parties agreed that TPG and Leonard Green would accept
a smaller $20 million payment if J. Crew accepts a competing
offer. The original $27 million fee, equal to about 1 percent of
the purchase price, was already lower than the typical breakup
fee. TPG and Leonard Green offered $43.50 a share for J. Crew on
Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is In Re J. Crew Shareholders Litigation, 6043,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japanese stocks rose, sending the Nikkei 225 Stock Average higher for the third day this week,
after Apple Inc. and International Business Machines Corp.
reported earnings that exceeded analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitachi Ltd., which makes consumer electronics, gained 3.8
percent. Elpida Memory Inc., the world&#8217;s No. 3 maker of
computer-memory chips, increased 5.7 percent. Panasonic Corp.,
the world&#8217;s largest maker of plasma televisions, climbed 0.6
percent. Toray Industries Inc. rose 4.7 percent, leading textile
companies higher and extending gains yesterday, after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. raised its share-price estimate on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;America&#8217;s economic recovery is getting stronger and
market sentiment is improving,&#8221; said Naoki Fujiwara, who helps
oversee $6 billion in Tokyo at Shinkin Asset Management Co.
&#8220;Earnings in the U.S. are getting better. We can probably
expect firm results for Japanese companies too.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 0.4 percent to
10,557.10 at the close of trading in Tokyo. The broader Topix
index climbed 0.6 percent to 936.87, with more than double the
number of stocks rising as falling. The Topix is on course for
its third consecutive weekly gain this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Topix has risen 4.2 percent this year, driving the
average price of shares in the index to 16.1 times estimated
earnings on average, near the highest level since August. The
gauge sank 1 percent in 2010 as the yen at its strongest annual
average level against the dollar since 1971 dimmed the outlook
for export earnings, and as Europe&#8217;s debt crisis, China&#8217;s steps
to curb inflation and concern about U.S. growth damped
confidence in a global recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Earnings &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index climbed 0.1
percent today. The index rose 0.1 percent yesterday in New York,
extending a seven-week rally, as gains in commodity producers
and a pledge by European finance chiefs to support the region
overshadowed lower-than-estimated profit at Citigroup Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hitachi rose 3.8 percent to 465 yen, and was the biggest
contributor to the Topix&#8217;s climb today. Elpida increased 5.7
percent to 1,162 yen, extending gains after the Nikkei
newspapers said yesterday the company plans to raise prices.
Panasonic, which received about 13 percent of its revenue from
the Americas, climbed 0.6 percent to 1,167 yen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, posted
fourth-quarter profit and sales that topped analysts&#8217; estimates
as companies spent more on computer systems and software. The
shares climbed in late trading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiber Makers Jump &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the close of regular New York trading, Apple, whose
chief executive officer is taking medical leave, reported
quarterly net income of $6.43 a share, compared with $5.41 a
share estimated on average by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Following macro improvements in the U.S. economy, micro
factors such as an earnings recovery are beginning to show,&#8221;
said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo at Nikko
Cordial Securities Inc. &#8220;The opaque outlook for the economy is
starting to clear.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A measure of textile and apparel makers had the second-
biggest gain on the Topix index, led by Toray and Teijin Ltd.
The companies extended yesterday&#8217;s advances after Goldman Sachs
boosted estimates on their share prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toray, a maker of synthetic fibers, jumped 4.7 percent to
556 yen. Teijin, which makes polyester and other fibers,
advanced 6.6 percent to 421 yen, its highest level since April
2008. Goldman Sachs boosted its share price target for Toray to
480 yen from 440 yen previously, and raised its estimates for
Teijin to 380 yen from 350 yen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects description of Boston-based group in third
paragraph) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shareholder groups are pressing Chevron Corp., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Southwestern Energy Co. to
disclose the risk the companies face from hydraulic fracturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The groups say they want shareholders to know that the
companies could face litigation or fines related to their use of
rock-fracturing techniques to find natural gas and oil. They
plan to introduce resolutions during the annual meetings of nine
companies, calling on them to disclose the chemicals used in
hydraulic fracturing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Investor Environmental Health Network in Falls Church,
Va., helped organize groups of investors to file the
resolutions, including the New York State Comptroller&#8217;s Office,
the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia and Ceres, a Boston-
based coalition that directs the $9 trillion Investor Network on
Climate Risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same groups, working together as the Investor
Environmental Health Network, filed similar petitions last year
against 12 oil and gas producers. None passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 20 percent of shareholders voted for the
resolutions at some companies, said Richard Liroff, executive
director of the Investors Environmental Health Network.
&#8220;Clearly we&#8217;re getting our point across,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some landowners have accused gas companies of polluting
local water supplies with their fracturing activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cabot Oil  Gas Corp. agreed to provide drinking water and
put $4.1 million into escrow for families in Pennsylvania who
said their drinking water was polluted by the company&#8217;s oil
wells, settling a claim by the Pennsylvania Department of
Environmental Protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York has imposed a moratorium on fracturing horizontal
wells until an environmental review is completed. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is also conducting a study of
fracturing&#8217;s impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few Problems &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Crinklaw, a Chevron spokesman, said the company is
reviewing the shareholder proposal. &#8220;We believe that hydraulic
fracturing is critical to accessing the nation&#8217;s natural-gas
resources, leading to greater energy security,&#8221; Crinklaw wrote
in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 1 million wells have been hydraulically fractured
over the last 60 years with only a few problems, America&#8217;s
Natural Gas Alliance, an industry trade group, says on its
website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon said it supports the disclosure of hydraulic
fracturing chemicals, without commenting on the shareholder
proposals. &#8220;We believe the concerns of community members can be
alleviated by the disclosure of all ingredients used in these
fluids,&#8221; Karen Matusic, an Exxon spokeswoman, wrote in an e-
mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Southwestern didn&#8217;t return calls seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Southwestern have looked for ways to reduce the
need for chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. &lt;/p&gt;

Mider" date="Jan 20, 2011  6:30 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-20/jpmorgan-said-to-hire-cravath-lawyer-woolery-to-co-head-mergers.html"><headline>JPMorgan Hires Cravath Lawyer Woolery as Co-Head of North American Mergers</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. hired James Woolery, a partner at the law firm Cravath, Swaine  Moore LLP,
as co-head of North American mergers and acquisitions, part of
management changes in the investment banking group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Ventresca, who has co-managed the North American MA
division since 2008, will remain a co-head with Woolery, who is
41, JPMorgan said in a statement today. Jimmy Elliott, who had
been global MA head for five years at JPMorgan, will focus on
working with clients and hold the title of global chairman of
MA. He won&#8217;t be replaced as global head of the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Stute, who had co-run the North American MA group
while advising on deals in the health-care industry, will move
over to be North American head of JPMorgan&#8217;s broader health-care
coverage group. He has advised on deals such as Universal Health
Services Inc.&#8217;s acquisition of Psychiatric Solutions Inc. and
Merck  Co.&#8217;s takeover of Schering-Plough Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Robbie Huffines, who previously held that health-care post
at JPMorgan, will become a vice chairman of investment banking.
Huffines worked on the sale of Guidant Corp. to Boston
Scientific Corp. and is currently advising Sanofi-Aventis SA on
its proposed acquisition of Genzyme Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MA Lawyers &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolery is one of a handful of top MA lawyers to attempt a
switch to investment banking. In 2000, Cravath partner Robert Kindler left to become a banker at Chase Manhattan Corp., now
part of JPMorgan, and another partner, George Bilicic, went to
Merrill Lynch  Co. In 2005, Dennis Hersch left Davis Polk 
Wardwell LLP to join JPMorgan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kindler now runs MA at Morgan Stanley, Bilicic is at
Lazard Ltd., and Hersch has left banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among bankruptcy lawyers, Harvey Miller of Weil Gotshal 
Manges LLP and James Sprayregen of Kirkland  Ellis LLP both
entered banking in the last decade and later returned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Cravath, Woolery has had a hand in several of the
biggest mergers in recent years, counseling Affiliated Computer
Services Inc. on its $5.8 billion sale to Xerox Corp. He is
currently representing a board panel at Massey Energy Co. as the
coal miner weighs selling itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Woolery, who starts Feb. 7, was born in Louisville,
Kentucky. He graduated from Wake Forest University and earned
his law degree from the University of Kentucky, according to the
Cravath website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cravath had the fifth-biggest market share among U.S. law
firms for merger advice over the past three years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg, advising Burlington Northern Santa
Fe on its sale to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and Pepsi Bottling
Group Inc. on its sale to PepsiCo Inc. The firm also represented
a special committee of J. Crew Group Inc. on its proposed $3
billion leveraged buyout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan finished third in global MA in 2010 with $381.4
billion in deals, behind Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. stocks erased most of their
losses as Morgan Stanley, Home Depot Inc. and builders rallied.
Treasuries extended their drop after a record auction of
inflation-indexed securities attracted lower-than-average
demand. Commodities and emerging-market equities plunged. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent at 4 p.m. New York time, trimming a 0.8 percent slump, as Morgan Stanley
and Home Depot gained more than 2.4 percent. Yields on 10-year
Treasuries rose 13 basis points to 3.47 percent, the highest
since Jan. 5. Silver, copper and oil fell more than 2.4 percent.
The MSCI Emerging Markets Index lost 1.6 percent and the
Shanghai Composite Index sank 2.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial companies rallied after U.S. Representative Barney Frank said he&#8217;s ready to work with the Republican
majority to force changes in a Federal Reserve proposal to cap
debit-card &#8220;swipe&#8221; fees. The SP 500 had slumped earlier,
joining losses in commodities and emerging markets, as China&#8217;s
accelerating economy fanned concern interest rates will rise.
Home Depot advanced and Treasuries fell after sales of
previously owned American homes topped projections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;One of the main contributions to the intraday rally is
the potential push by Washington to ease the Dodd-Frank bill,
which would benefit financials,&#8221; said Chad Morganlander, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based money manager at Stifel Nicolaus
 Co., which oversees $90 billion in client assets. &#8220;That
created a bid under financials in the middle of the day. There&#8217;s
greater indications that this will lead to less regulation than
originally thought.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings Season &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 rose as much as 91 percent since March 2009
amid government measures to stimulate the economy and as
companies reported better-than-estimated earnings. It lost 1
percent yesterday, the most since November, after Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. reported profit that failed to beat the average
analyst estimate because of less trading an investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 70 percent of SP 500 companies beat the average
analyst profit estimate during the past six quarters, the
longest streak since 1993, when Bloomberg started compiling the
data. For the fourth quarter, 30 of the 42 companies in the
index that reported quarterly earnings since Jan. 10 have topped
analysts&#8217; predictions, according to Bloomberg data. Income grew
22 percent in the fourth quarter and will increase 14 percent in
2011, according to the average analyst projections. Sales topped
estimates at 32 of the 42 companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Home Depot, Freeport &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley gained 4.6 percent, the most since July,
after revenue beat analysts&#8217; estimates. Home Depot added 2.4
percent and homebuilders in SP indexes rose 0.3 percent as 
home sales exceeded economists' predictions. Freeport-McMoRan
Copper  Gold Inc. slumped 3.7 percent after cutting its 2011
forecasts for sales of the metals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Visa Inc. added 2.3 percent to $70.69, while MasterCard
Inc. fell 0.1 percent to $235.10. U.S. Representative Barney Frank, one of the authors of the financial regulatory overhaul,
said he is ready to work with the Republican majority to force
changes in a Federal Reserve proposal to cap debit-card
&#8220;swipe&#8221; fees. Frank is a member of the Democratic party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; U.S. debt extended losses after a record $13 billion
auction of 10-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities
attracted lower-than-average demand. The sale drew a yield of
1.17 percent, compared with an average forecast of 1.108 percent
in a Bloomberg survey of nine primary dealers. The bid-to-cover
ratio, which gauges demand by comparing the amount offered with
the amount sold, was 2.37, the lowest since April 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emerging Markets &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Commodities and emerging-market shares slumped after growth
in China, Asia&#8217;s biggest economy, quickened to 9.8 percent in
the final three months of 2010. Concern that the figures will
lead to more monetary tightening in China overshadowed the U.S.
reports showing a drop in jobless claims and home-sales growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currencies of commodity-exporting countries tumbled versus
the U.S. dollar as speculation increased that China will take
more measures to cool economic growth, curbing appetite for raw
materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. currency extended gains versus most of its 16
major counterparts after jobless claims fell more than forecast
for the latest week and existing home sales increased more than
projected in December. South Africa&#8217;s rand and the New Zealand,
Australian and Canadian dollars dropped as prices for crude oil,
gold and copper slumped. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. chief Sam Palmisano is giving non-executive workers $1,000
in long-term stock incentives after the company posted fourth-
quarter earnings that sent shares to a record high. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are continuing to outperform the market and our
competitors and to make encouraging progress against our
strategic growth initiatives,&#8221; Palmisano wrote in a memo to
employees. &#8220;Our long-term success is the product of the work,
innovation and superior execution of more than 400,000 IBMers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that all non-executive employees who performed
consistently during the execution of the company&#8217;s 2010
strategic plan, covering the years from 2007 to 2010, would
receive the IBM stock. The shares will vest in 2015. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of workers will receive the awards,
said a person familiar with the situation, who couldn&#8217;t be
identified because the number of awards isn&#8217;t public. The
Armonk, New York-based company had about 400,000 employees at
the end of December. Doug Shelton, a spokesman for the company,
wouldn&#8217;t give the specific number of workers getting the awards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM posted earnings and sales this week that topped
analysts&#8217; estimates, with revenue rising in every division as
companies spend more on hardware and software. The company is on
track to meet its long-term goal of almost doubling operating
earnings per share to $20 or more by 2015, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM rose 11 cents to $155.80, the company&#8217;s highest closing
price ever, at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares climbed 12 percent last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; William Daley, President Barack Obama&#8217;s new chief of staff, can defer the payment of capital
gains taxes on his sale of almost $8.3 million of JPMorgan Chase
 Co. shares, based on government ethics rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daley filed a notice with the Securities and Exchange
Commission yesterday on the sale of 186,190 shares of JPMorgan,
where he was vice chairman. As Daley divests his holdings to
work at the White House, he is eligible to take advantage of a
law that allows people forced to sell assets when they accept
government jobs to reinvest the proceeds and delay capital gains
liability until the new investments are sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daley likely will still face a steep income tax bill this
year, said Robert Willens, founder and president of Robert
Willens LLC, a consulting firm that advises investors on tax and
accounting rules. On Jan. 6, Daley acquired almost 202,000
restricted shares and stock appreciation rights for an average
of about $17.23 apiece, according to an SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daley probably would owe income tax on the difference
between the cost of acquiring those shares and the market price
that day, when JPMorgan closed at $44.48, Willens said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The capital gains deferral could let Daley put off payment
of upwards of $625,000, assuming the average acquisition price
of his total JPMorgan holdings is roughly half the current share
price, Willens said. JPMorgan rose $1.04 to $44.75 in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asian stocks fell, with the regional
benchmark index sliding the most in almost two months, as
Chinese economic reports prompted speculation the country will
do more to fight inflation and U.S. earnings disappointed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; BHP Billiton Ltd., the world&#8217;s No. 1 mining company that
counts China as its biggest market, dropped 1.9 percent as
commodity prices slumped. China Merchants Holdings International
Ltd., which has interests in ports moving about a third of the
country&#8217;s container traffic, dropped 4.1 percent in Hong Kong. James Hardie Industries SE, the biggest seller of home siding in
the U.S., declined 2 percent in Sydney, set for its longest
losing streak since July 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 1.3 percent to 138.66 as
of 7:34 p.m. in Tokyo, with about seven stocks declining for
every that rose. China reported economic growth accelerated to
9.8 percent in the fourth quarter as the inflation rate slowed
to 4.6 percent in December from 5.1 percent in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s fair to say that this data will add to pressure on
China to tighten,&#8221; said Shane Oliver, Sydney-based head of
investment strategy at AMP Capital Ltd., which manages about $93
billion. &#8220;The figures aren&#8217;t overly worrying, but with growth
continuing along at a fairly solid pace and inflationary
pressures still evident, it&#8217;s all consistent with further
tightening.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional Indexes Slide &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Asia Pacific gauge yesterday closed at its highest
level in 2 1/2 years after Apple Inc. and International Business
Machines Corp. reported earnings that exceeded analysts&#8217;
estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong&#8217;s Hang Seng Index dropped 1.7 percent, its
biggest intraday decline in a month, and the Shanghai Composite
Index fell 2.9 percent. Japan&#8217;s Nikkei 225 Stock Average
retreated 1.1 percent. South Korea&#8217;s Kospi Index slipped 0.4
percent, while Australia&#8217;s SP/ASX 200 Index dropped 1.1
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Futures on the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index gained 0.1
percent. The index declined 1 percent yesterday in New York, its
biggest drop since November, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
reported fourth-quarter net income decreased to $3.79 a share.
Estimates of 22 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg averaged $3.79 a
share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co., the largest U.S. home lender, yesterday
posted a fourth-quarter profit that missed some analysts&#8217;
estimates as income from mortgage banking weakened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in the U.S., housing starts fell 4.3 percent in
December to a 529,000 annual rate, Commerce Department figures
showed yesterday. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey
called for a 550,000 rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Going Backwards&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The market has had an increasingly positive view on the
U.S. recovery,&#8221; said Matt Riordan, who helps manage about $6
billion in Sydney at Paradice Investment Management Pty. &#8220;Then
you get a situation like this, when things seem to be going
backwards. For a sustainable recovery, you really need housing
and employment coming back.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; China&#8217;s expansion exceeded the 9.4 percent median estimate
in a Bloomberg News survey of 22 economists and compared with a
9.6 percent annual gain in the previous three months, a
statistics bureau report showed. Citigroup Inc. and Credit
Suisse Group AG say inflation may peak at as much as 6 percent
in the first half. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Alarming Inflation&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If the economy keeps growing at the current pace,
inflation will remain alarming,&#8221; said Liu Li-Gang, a Hong Kong-
based economist at Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; BHP Billiton, Australia&#8217;s No. 1 oil producer, dropped 1.9
percent to A$45.19 and Rio Tinto Group, the world&#8217;s third-
largest mining company, slid 2.3 percent to A$85.57. Jiangxi
Copper Co., China&#8217;s No. 1 producer of copper, fell 2.5 percent
to HK$25.50 in Hong Kong, while Cnooc Ltd., China&#8217;s biggest
offshore oil producer, declined 2 percent to HK$19.02. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil for February delivery fell 0.6 percent to settle at
$90.86 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday,
the lowest level since Jan. 10. The London Metal Exchange Index
of prices for six industrial metals including copper and
aluminum lost 1.3 percent, its biggest decline since Nov. 23. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We may see a decline in exporters as the yen strengthens,
and commodity related shares may fall on lower oil prices,&#8221;
Akino said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; OZ Minerals Ltd. sank 3.4 percent to A$1.72 in Sydney after
reporting that fourth-quarter copper output fell 31 percent
because of declining grades. Copper output in the three months
to December 31 was 25,185 metric tons, the Melbourne-based
company said, compared with 36,497 tons a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China Merchants Falls &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also in Sydney, James Hardie declined 2 percent to A$6.29.
China Merchants lost 4.1 percent to HK$33 in Hong Kong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It may be hard to find a good reason to buy,&#8221; said
Mitsushige Akino, who oversees about $450 million in assets in
Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 2.1 percent this year to
yesterday, compared with gains of 1.9 percent by the SP 500 and
2.5 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark were valued at 14.4 times estimated earnings on
average at the last close, compared with 13.4 times for the SP
500 and 11.2 times for the Stoxx 600. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee Sachs, a former aide to U.S.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, and banker John Delaney
have formed a company that aims to help smaller banks lend to a
wider range of borrowers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The management company, AlliancePartners, is assembling a
cooperative network of banks and will look nationally for loans,
Sachs said in an interview yesterday. Lenders that join the
BancAlliance network will be able to elect the partnership&#8217;s
board of directors, which for now includes Sachs, Delaney,
former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, former
CapitalSource Inc. president Jason Fish and an investor whose
name hasn&#8217;t been released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Responsibly diversifying their loan portfolios is the
best way for these banks to improve their long-term financial
outlook,&#8221; Sachs said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has struggled to encourage more
lending from smaller banks to small businesses, in its effort to
make it easier for companies to expand and hire more workers.
Plans set up under the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief
Program drew few participants, and another initiative outside
the rescue effort is just getting under way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The network will service the loans and retain an interest
in every loan it refers to member banks, Sachs said. The goal is
to help small and mid-sized banks find and evaluate loans in new
asset classes so they can manage portfolios that may be
currently concentrated in commercial real estate, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sachs and Delaney say their network will offer technology,
education and other support for participating banks so they can
compete against bigger firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Through BancAlliance, neighborhood bankers from across
the country will be able to participate in a broad range of
opportunities traditionally only available to the largest
banks,&#8221; Delaney, chairman of CapitalSource in Chevy Chase, Maryland, said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Helen Siswein, a retired
teacher, heard about an investment that might earn 8 percent a
year and never lose money, she was sold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I thought, &#8216;Boy, if the market surges I could make a
lot,&#8217;&#8221; said Siswein, 82. She put about $1 million into four
different annuities linked to stock-market indexes in July 2003
on the advice of an insurance agent who came to her former home
in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, after her husband died. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siswein said the agent didn&#8217;t tell her she was locking up
most of her money until her 87th birthday or that there were
caps on how much she could earn. It cost Siswein fees of as much
as 15 percent of her account balances to get out of the
investments five years later, the contracts show. She says one
annuity earned an average of about 3 percent a year after the
penalty was subtracted, while the index it tracked, the Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, returned 6.3 percent including dividends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors such as Siswein are buying more equity-indexed
annuities, contracts that earn money based on the performance of
stock indexes and don&#8217;t decline in value if held to maturity.
While that protection may be attractive to investors who saw the
SP 500 plunge 38 percent in 2008, the contracts&#8217; complex terms
and embedded fees make them unlikely to perform as well as
expected, said Kent Smetters, a professor of insurance at the
University of Pennsylvania&#8217;s Wharton School. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These contracts have really high hidden fees,&#8221; said
Smetters, a former U.S. Treasury Department economic policy
official. &#8220;That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re terrible ideas for older people
even though they&#8217;re peddled to them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Record Sales &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers led by Allianz SE and Aviva Plc sold a record $8.7
billion of indexed annuities in the third quarter, up 16 percent
from a year earlier, according to AnnuitySpecs.com, a market
research company. The contracts generally earn nothing when
stocks fall and include caps on returns that insurers can change
at will. Salespeople are paid commissions as high as 12 percent,
and some are rewarded with free trips to Disney World. Unlike
the fees on mutual funds, those costs aren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexed annuities are part of a boom in structured
products, opaque investments pitched as a way for conservative
investors to earn higher yields. As insurance agents sell more
complex annuities, stockbrokers across the country are pushing
structured certificates of deposit and notes, which are similar
derivatives-based investments created by Wall Street banks.
Sales of structured notes rose to a record $49.5 billion in
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The pure psychology of downside protection with upside
potential sells really well,&#8221; said Smetters. &#8220;These products
are all very complicated. The problem is, they&#8217;re not
transparent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of Derivatives &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salespeople typically downplay the complexity of indexed
annuities and their long lock-up periods, said Barbara Roper,
director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of
America, a Washington-based lobbying group. The contracts are
&#8220;one of the most abusively sold products on the market today,&#8221;
said Roper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers create the annuities using derivatives, financial
contracts whose value is derived from stocks, bonds and
commodities. While the policies guarantee principal if held to
term, they have withdrawal penalties that may last for more than
10 years. The dividends paid by stocks in the index generally
aren&#8217;t counted toward the annuities&#8217; returns. Buyers can convert
the contracts into a lifetime stream of income at maturity. Most
don&#8217;t, said Smetters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Downside Protection &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You will never get all of the upside&#8221; of the stock
market because returns are capped, said Eric Thomes, senior vice
president of sales at Allianz Life Insurance Company of North
America in Minneapolis, the largest seller in the U.S. &#8220;You
also don&#8217;t need to worry about the downside, and with what
happened in 2008, this type of benefit will no doubt interest a
lot of people.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low yields on federally insured bank CDs are helping sales
of indexed annuities, said Wendy Waugaman, chief executive
officer of American Equity Investment Life Holding Co., based in
West Des Moines, Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s really easy to see why they&#8217;re so popular in today&#8217;s
environment,&#8221; said Waugaman. Investors also are buying because
they&#8217;re &#8220;afraid of market risk,&#8221; said Waugaman. American
Equity is the third-largest seller of indexed annuities,
according to AnnuitySpecs, based in Des Moines, Iowa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney World &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company is offering agents that sell at least $2.5
million of its products in the 12 months ending June 30, 2011, a
trip to the Walt Disney World resort in Orlando, Florida. Agents
must sell an additional $600,000 of annuities to bring a child.
The trip is to the firm&#8217;s annual convention, a standard industry
practice, said Waugaman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insurers who sell indexed annuities buy derivatives from
banks to cover the contracts&#8217; guarantees, making the business
less risky than selling other investments with a guaranteed
minimum return. In 2008, insurers lost money on variable
annuities with similar guarantees when the stock market
plummeted. Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. wrote down the
value of a variable-annuity business by $274 million and Prudential Financial Inc. also recorded a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexed annuities tend to underperform a lower-risk
strategy of rolling over CDs, &#8220;because of the high cost
embedded in these things,&#8221; said William Reichenstein, professor
of investments at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDs Are Better &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, an insurer may take $100 from a customer and
invest $94.33 of that in bonds and keep $2, said Reichenstein,
who has analyzed several indexed-annuity contracts. With that
remaining $3.67, the company buys a portfolio of derivatives
linked to the SP 500 that will give investors some, though not
all, of the index&#8217;s returns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with interest rates near record lows, CDs may still do
better than the annuities because insurers will have to reduce
caps on returns to maintain profitability, Reichenstein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re not playing Santa Claus,&#8221; said Reichenstein.
Insurers must earn enough over time to recoup what they pay
upfront to agents or brokers who sell the annuities, cutting
into returns to investors, he said. Commissions range from 1.5
percent to 12 percent, according to AnnuitySpecs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opacity of the products&#8217; fees and complexity of the
return calculations makes it impossible for investors to figure
out if they&#8217;re getting a good deal, said Glenn Daily, a fee-only
insurance consultant based in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;re paying the insurance company to set up and manage
a portfolio of fixed-income securities and derivatives,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have transparency.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surrenders, Withdrawals &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts prevent canceling, or surrendering, for a refund
of the account balance without a penalty for a set period that
ranges from 3 years to 16 years, AnnuitySpecs data show.
However, most contracts do permit 10 percent penalty-free
withdrawals annually, according to AnnuitySpecs. Owners may
incur a 10 percent charge from the Internal Revenue Service if
distributions are made before age 59 1/2 because the earnings
are tax-deferred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siswein, the retired teacher, bought her indexed annuities
from Robert Calamunci of Monmouth, New Jersey. Calamunci, now an
accountant, said he no longer sells the products and declined to
comment further. Siswein said she needed financial advice after
her husband&#8217;s death left her with more assets to manage and
Calamunci convinced her to put about $250,000 each into four
indexed annuities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her Contract &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the indexed annuities Siswein bought, called FlexDex
Bonus, was issued by Allianz Life accompanied by a 23-page
packet explaining the terms. The contract required Siswein, who
was 75 at the time, to tie up most of her money until she turned
87 or pay withdrawal penalties of as much as 15 percent. She
canceled her policy because of lower returns than she expected
and the limited access to her funds, which she says she didn&#8217;t
understand when she bought it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnings were based on a portion of the average monthly
performance of the SP 500 without dividends as calculated from
her contract&#8217;s anniversary on July 14 to the same date the
following year. The SP 500, with dividends reinvested, returned
35 percent from July 14, 2003, to July 13, 2008, compared with
about 15 percent Siswein made over the same time period
including the surrender charge, according to Carolyn Walder,
president of Lifetime Wealth Planning and Management in National
Harbor, Maryland, and Alexandria, Virginia, who now advises
Siswein. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total Return &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Up until 2008 the market had gone up dramatically,&#8221; said
Walder. &#8220;She should have made a lot more money during that
time.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without the surrender charge, an investor like Siswein may
have had a total return of nearly 30 percent for five years, or
almost 6 percent a year, said Laurie Bauer, a spokeswoman for
Allianz Life, in an e-mail. Bauer said she couldn&#8217;t comment on
Siswein&#8217;s contract because Siswein wouldn&#8217;t sign a release.
Holders of indexed annuity contracts were protected against
market declines like 2008 and lost no principal or previously
credited interest, Bauer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Siswein said she joined a class action suit against Allianz
originally filed in 2005 alleging misleading sales of indexed
annuities. Allianz Life denies the allegations of the case, said
Bauer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexed annuities have caps on returns and other terms that
insurers may change annually at their discretion. Siswein&#8217;s
contract with Allianz Life, for example, had a cap of 8 percent
on how much she could receive from the SP&#8217;s performance in 2003
when she bought it that was lowered to 6 percent for the policy
year beginning July 2008, according to her statements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altering the caps allows insurers to change how much they
spend on the derivatives that fund the payouts, said FBL
Financial Group Inc., based in West Des Moines, Iowa, in a Sept.
30 regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Additional Spreads&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Quite frankly, each and every quarter, we&#8217;ve started
taking additional spreads,&#8221; which helped increase the company&#8217;s
profits, said Chief Financial Officer James Brannen, during an
Aug. 6 conference call with analysts. Brannen referred questions
to Kathleen Till Stange, vice president of investor relations,
who declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Chiodo, a 68-year-old retired firefighter, said he
invested $113,000 in an indexed annuity issued by an FBL unit
called EquiTrust Life Insurance Co. after meeting an agent at a
free dinner seminar at Bonefish Grill near his home in Palmetto,
Florida. Dissatisfied with his returns, he said it cost him
about 20 percent in fees in July to get out of the contract
after four years. FBL declined to comment on Chiodo&#8217;s policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Parades&#8217; for Annuities &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rick Stgeorge, the Sarasota, Florida-based agent who sold
Chiodo the annuity, said he explained the withdrawal fees and
that Chiodo made a mistake by terminating the contract when he
did. Most of his clients are happy with their returns and tax
benefits, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indexed annuities allow investors to defer taxes, though
earnings when withdrawn are taxed as ordinary income.  Capital
gains from stock sales are generally taxed at a lower rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There should be parades for indexed annuities,&#8221; said
Stgeorge, who spells his last name as one word. Annuities earn
between 3 percent and 8 percent with &#8220;no risk,&#8221; Stgeorge said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Smythe, former chief executive officer of Meineke Car
Care Centers Inc. based in Charlotte, North Carolina, said he
started moving money into indexed annuities about a year ago. He
bought a contract issued by Allianz Life from Stgeorge because
of the principal protection and potential for higher yields than
other annuities. Smythe, 76, who&#8217;s retired and living in
Longboat Key, Florida,  said he&#8217;s unconcerned about the
surrender charges for early withdrawal because he said he&#8217;s
holding them &#8220;for the long range.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not Strict Enough &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike the stocks they track, fixed-indexed annuities
generally aren&#8217;t subject to U.S. securities laws and are
regulated by state insurance departments. An amendment
introduced by Iowa Senator Tom Harkin to the Dodd-Frank
financial overhaul law passed by Congress in July blocked the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from overseeing the
market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State insurance regulations aren&#8217;t strict enough to prevent
salespeople from taking advantage of the elderly with indexed
annuities, said Roper of the Consumer Federation, who lobbied
for the products to be regulated by the SEC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Iowa, companies and individuals licensed to sell
annuities have to gather information from buyers such as their
finances and age to ensure the contract is suitable, said Jim
Mumford, first deputy commissioner and securities administrator
for the state&#8217;s insurance division. Agents who offer indexed-
annuities must also take at least an additional four hours of
training on the products, Mumford said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No FDIC Guarantee &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Annuities aren&#8217;t guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. Insurers agree to cover losses if a company
fails, up to a limit that varies by state. An investor in
Florida, for example, is covered up to $250,000 or $300,000 per
company, said William Falck, executive director of the state&#8217;s
Life  Health Insurance Guaranty Association. While the
principal on an indexed annuity contract may be reimbursed by
the state guaranty fund, the interest may not, Falck said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; MetLife Inc. and Prudential, the two largest U.S. insurers,
don&#8217;t offer indexed annuities. MetLife allows its agents to sell
indexed annuities from third parties, Patrick Connor, a
spokesman for the New York-based company, said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TIAA-CREF, the retirement company that manages more than
$400 billion, also doesn&#8217;t offer them. &#8220;Very few people
understand what the product is,&#8221; said Dan Keady, director of
financial planning for the New York-based company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Greek bondholders are unlikely to
get all their money back on schedule unless borrowing costs
fall, said Andrew Wilson, head of fixed-income at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Unless we have a dramatic change in the interest-rate
structure, particularly for a country like Greece, I think some
form of restructuring is a relatively high-probability event&#8221;
after 2011, Wilson said in Bloomberg Television&#8217;s &#8220;On the Move
with Francine Lacqua.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greece spawned the euro-region sovereign debt crisis a year
ago when investors became concerned spending cuts wouldn&#8217;t be
enough to bring down the country&#8217;s budget deficit, which was
more than three times the limit laid down by the European Union.
Greece&#8217;s 110 billion-euro ($149 billion) bailout in May failed
to stop its bond yields surging, infecting other so-called
peripheral nations including Spain and Italy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crisis in the euro region&#8217;s most indebted nations
&#8220;gives a lot of investors jitters,&#8221; said London-based Wilson,
who joined Goldman Sachs in 1995 and was made a partner four
years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing funding costs down &#8220;is either happening through
time and the fiscal austerity -- markets are not being very
patient around that -- or we get some direct intervention,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we&#8217;re waiting for: is the European Central
Bank going to come up with something?&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. equity strategists at JPMorgan
Chase  Co. say this week&#8217;s slump is a buying opportunity
because monetary policy is supportive and the economy has
positive momentum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group led by Thomas J. Lee identified 19 stocks, which
they forecast to gain at least 10 percent, including Citigroup
Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co. and Newmont Mining Corp. The Standard
 Poor&#8217;s 500 Index declined 1 percent on Jan. 19, the biggest
one-day drop since November, and slipped 0.8 percent to 1,283.35
this week. The measure closed at the highest level since August
2008 on Jan 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While we ultimately expect a correction in the
March/April timeframe, we are buyers of this current dip,&#8221; New
York-based Lee said in a report today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faster inflation in other countries means that the U.S.
&#8220;fully capitalizes on economic growth surprise,&#8221; because the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates before 2013,
the strategists said. In contrast to a year ago, indicators for
the U.S. such as the Economic Cycle Research Institute&#8217;s U.S.
Weekly Leading Index have been gaining strength, the report
said. Money supply also is growing at a faster rate than a year
ago, JPMorgan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists favor financial and consumer cyclical
companies, a view they said is widely held. Within the groups,
they recommended 19 companies with out-of-favor characteristics
including high market value, low price, low price-to-earnings
ratios, low price momentum and high quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $2.5
billion of 30-year debt in its first sale of the securities in
more than three years, as investors accept the lowest premiums
since April for bank bonds with similar credit grades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 6.25 percent notes from the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by
assets pay 170 basis points, or 1.7 percentage points, more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank sold the debt after reporting on Jan. 19 that
earnings dropped 52 percent as a slowdown in trading and investment banking reduced revenue more than analysts estimated.
Relative yields for banks ranked A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, such as
New York-based Goldman Sachs&#8217;s, have still tumbled from last
year&#8217;s high of 305 basis points in June to 214 basis points as
of yesterday, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As far as U.S. banks go, the sentiment really is that
they do have a lot of liquidity on their balance sheets, but
rates continue to be quite low,&#8221; said Rajeev Sharma, a money
manager at First Investors Management in New York who helps
oversee $1.5 billion of investment-grade credit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spreads on bank bonds graded A are at the lowest since
the level was 208 basis points on April 23, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. Spreads on overall A rated
corporate notes were at 159 basis points yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Looking for Spread&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;With A rated debt, the sentiment continues to be you&#8217;re
looking for spread, and a lot of the bank paper continually has
more spread than industrial paper,&#8221; Sharma said. &#8220;It makes it
very attractive if you compare it to a regular industrial out
there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs may use proceeds for general corporate
purposes with the debt rated A1 by Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and
A by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, according to a person familiar with the
offering who declined to be identified, citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly about the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank last issued 30-year U.S. dollar bonds in benchmark
size in September 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
In that offering, the bank sold $2.5 billion of 6.75 percent
debt due in October 2037 at a spread of 190 basis points more
than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. Benchmark
sales are typically at least $500 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transaction is also the first benchmark offering of 30-
year debt by a U.S. bank since October, when JPMorgan Chase 
Co. sold $1.25 billion of 30-year bonds in October, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank by assets, issued
5.5 percent debt maturing in October 2040 in that offering at a
spread of 165 basis points, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs sold $1.3 billion of 50-year debt on Oct. 26,
Bloomberg data show. The bonds were offered in $25 denominations
and can&#8217;t be called, or redeemed, for five years, the bank said
in a regulatory filing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bullish options
on the biggest U.S. energy companies because the stocks are
poised to rally as global growth boosts crude prices and
industry profits, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists John Marshall and Maria Grant recommended buying calls on Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron
Corp., Suncor Energy Inc. and six other oil companies, saying
they would return 150 percent on average if the stocks reach the
prices predicted by Goldman analysts by July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite the strong upside potential for big oil, call
options prices on these names are near lows,&#8221; the strategists
wrote today. &#8220;We see the potential for upward revisions to
global growth forecasts to drive upside to oil prices, earnings,
multiples and ultimately, our nine selected stocks.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strategists cited integrated oil analyst Arjun Murti,
who expects 2011 to be &#8220;a  big year for integrated and domestic
oils,&#8221; the note said. The basket of nine companies has rallied
600 percent in the past 10 years, while the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
Energy sector gained 200 percent, the strategists said, adding
that it is &#8220;well-positioned&#8221; to gain again this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following table lists the contracts that Goldman Sachs
said investors should buy, adding that &#8220;a call on the basket
could potentially return 190 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

COMPANY (TICKER)             BUY
Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO US)  July $42 Calls
Murphy Oil Corp. (MUR US)    July $75 Calls
Suncor Energy Inc. (SU US)   June $39 Calls
EOG Resources Inc. (EOG US)  July $105 Calls

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp.&#8217;s Torrance
refinery in California had a leak from a process unit resulting
in the flaring of gases, according to a filing with state
regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 100 pounds of hydrogen sulfide were released as a
result of the incident yesterday, according to the report to the
California Emergency Management Agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leak was identified, isolated and halted, Aarti Ramachandran, a spokeswoman for the refinery, said in a
telephone interview. No fenceline emissions were detected and
the incident didn&#8217;t affect production, she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon&#8217;s Torrance plant also reported unplanned flaring with
the South Coast Air Quality Management District. The emissions
weren&#8217;t associated with a breakdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery has a capacity of 155,800 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, extended its tender offer to acquire King
Pharmaceuticals Inc. for the third time while the companies
await U.S. regulatory approval for the $3.6 billion deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $14.25-a-share offer is now scheduled to expire at 5:00
p.m., New York City time on Jan. 28, New York-based Pfizer said
today in a statement. Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said the
companies are on track to complete the deal in the first
quarter, as planned when they announced the deal in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition would be Pfizer&#8217;s biggest since its $68
billion purchase of Wyeth in 2009. King gives Pfizer access to
the Flector pain patch and Embeda morphine pill. Pfizer has said
it&#8217;s looking to expand its pain products beyond the arthritis
treatment Celebrex and nerve pain remedy Lyrica. King had $1.78
billion in revenue in 2009 and is focused on making pain
medications that are difficult to abuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are some conditions that haven&#8217;t yet been
satisfied,&#8221; including certain regulatory approvals, Campion
said in a telephone interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of the end of Jan. 20, about 47 percent of Bristol,
Tennessee-based King&#8217;s shares were tendered, according to the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ghana&#8217;s plan to borrow $500 million
in its first loan from investment banker Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. to upgrade rail lines is hold until it gets approval from
the International Monetary Fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because of the impact it will have on the country&#8217;s debt
position, we needed to seek a waiver from the IMF before going
ahead,&#8221; said Newman Kusi, a finance ministry adviser, in an
interview in Accra, the capital, yesterday. The board of the
Washington-based lender will meet in the next two months, he
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghana, which borrowed $1 billion from the IMF in July 2009
to stabilize its economy after the currency slumped and the budget deficit climbed, needs approval from the Washington
lender to undertake any new non-concessionary loans, including
the Goldman plan, Kusi said. No one answered the phone yesterday
or today at the Accra office of Wayne Mitchell, the fund&#8217;s
resident representative for Ghana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country wants to use the money as part of a total $4
billion needed to upgrade railways that will link the port city
of Tema and Accra, 30 kilometers (18.6 miles) away, to the
southern towns of Koforidua and Nsawam and the second-biggest
city, Kumasi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Borrowing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government is planning to borrow a total of $1.4
billion from Goldman for the rails project, Kusi said. Africa
Rail Ghana Ltd. of Norway has signed a deal with the Ministry of
Transportation in Ghana to undertake the project, including
arranging the rest of the financing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghana&#8217;s currency, the cedi, weakened nearly 12 percent
against the U.S. dollar in the first six months of 2009, while
the budget deficit reached 14 percent of gross domestic product,
according to the African Development Bank. The cedi traded at
1.5132 to the dollar at 12:32 p.m. in Accra, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deficit was about 9.7 percent this year, higher than a
government target of 7.5 percent, Finance Minister Kwabena Duffuor said Nov. 18. The shortfall will narrow to 7.5 percent
of GDP next year and 4.7 percent in 2012, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&#8217;s bonus season for Wall Street,
and while Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&#8217;s employees are learning the
extent of their 2010 pay cuts, they&#8217;ll still take home more than
rivals at JPMorgan Chase  Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan started telling employees of year-end payouts this
week, while Morgan Stanley will do it today, people told of the
banks&#8217; plans said, requesting anonymity because the timing isn&#8217;t
public. Citigroup Inc., which awarded executive bonuses on Jan.
18, started telling traders and investment bankers about payouts
the next day, said Jon Diat, a spokesman. Yesterday, it said it
gave about $50 million in stock to 15 top executives. London-
based Barclays Plc&#8217;s bankers will get the news mid-February, two
people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. and European banks are under pressure to curb bonuses
after taxpayers were forced to bail out the industry during the
financial crisis. JPMorgan&#8217;s investment bank set aside enough
money to pay an average of $369,651 to each employee for 2010,
or 2.4 percent less than in 2009, according to the company&#8217;s
year-end financial statements. Goldman Sachs&#8217;s pool equates to
an average of $430,700, a reduction of 14 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As a rule of thumb, bonuses are going to be down 5
percent to 10 percent on last year as revenues have fallen,&#8221;
said Shaun Springer, chief executive officer of London-based
Square Mile Services Ltd., which advises firms on compensation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employee Rewards &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investment banks set aside a portion of revenue to reward
employees and typically decide bonuses at the end of the year
based on annual results. Average pay per worker doesn&#8217;t reflect
the amount of money each employee actually receives. Top
executives sometimes receive multimillion-dollar awards, while
clerical workers get less. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four New York-based banks will spend a combined $84.4
billion, or an average of $141,192 apiece, on their 598,073
workers, according to financial reports released since Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That figure is pulled down by the average at Citigroup --
$93,962 last year -- because the bank has 260,000 employees,
many of them tellers, commercial bankers and transaction
processors, who earn lower pay. Citigroup doesn&#8217;t break out pay
for its investment-banking and trading division, where workers
get multiples of what most retail banking employees receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly promoted Chief Operating Officer John Havens received
stock worth $4.75 million as of the share&#8217;s closing price on
Jan. 18, when the bonuses were awarded, according to yesterday&#8217;s
disclosures. Brian Leach, the chief risk officer, got stock
worth $5.16 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus Declined &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach got $2.33
million and Vice Chairman Lewis Kaden received $4.29 million.
Americas consumer banking chief Manuel Medina-Mora got $4
million. Mike Corbat, head of Citi Holdings, got $4.88 million,
as did the bank&#8217;s chief administrative officer, Don Callahan.
The bank disclosed last year that Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit declined a 2010 bonus. Shannon Bell, a Citigroup
spokeswoman, declined to elaborate on payouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley cut the investment bank&#8217;s compensation pool
by 2 percent to $7.08 billion. The firm doesn&#8217;t disclose the
number of employees in the unit. Companywide, Morgan Stanley
paid its 62,542 employees an average $256,596 last year, up from
$238,602 for each of the 60,494 employees at the end of 2009,
figures released yesterday show. The company&#8217;s 2010 pay accounts
for a full-year ownership of the Smith Barney brokerage,
compared with seven months in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The firm has told some employees to expect investment-
banking bonuses to decline 10 percent to 30 percent, two people
briefed on the matter said last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which reported earnings Jan. 14, set aside $9.73
billion for 26,314 workers at its investment bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees at Bank of America Corp., based in Charlotte, North Carolina, will be told their bonuses Jan. 26, a person
with knowledge of the plan said. The bank reports fourth-quarter
earnings today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. Financial Services Authority last month approved
new rules agreed by European Union regulators restricting
guaranteed bonuses and up-front cash payments for banks&#8217;
proprietary traders and broker dealers. The regulations allow
bankers to receive about 25 percent of their bonuses in
immediate cash payouts and require the rest to be deferred or
held in shares for a minimum of three years. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yoel Zaoui, the head of European investment banking at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., sees improving
confidence among business leaders in 2011, he told Les Echos in
an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroeconomic events, such as the European sovereign debt
crisis, weighed on merger and acquisition activity in 2010 by
reducing the confidence of executives, Zaoui told the French
business daily. Sentiment began to change at the end of last
year and improved further at the beginning of 2011, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sovereign debt woes showed that it&#8217;s necessary to
further integrate budgetary, fiscal and economic policy among
states in the euro region, Zaoui told the newspaper. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. reported an
emissions event caused by a leak on a furnace at its Baytown,
Texas, refinery, according to a filing with the Texas Commission
on Environmental Quality. The unit was shut for repairs, the
filing showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery is located along the Houston Ship Channel, 25

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. leaked oil into

&lt;p&gt;The refinery is using booms to contain the spill and

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s biggest
software maker, filed a U.S. trade complaint seeking to prevent TiVo Inc. from importing television set-top boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint submitted today to the U.S. International
Trade Commission in Washington accuses TiVo of infringing four
patents. Microsoft is asking that TiVo be barred from importing
the digital-video recorders, which are primarily made in Mexico
and sold in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC case opens a new front in a battle that began more
than a year ago when Microsoft challenged TiVo patents that were
being asserted against ATT Inc., a customer of the Redmond,
Washington-based software maker. A separate lawsuit was filed
claiming TiVo infringed seven Microsoft patents. The two sides
are in talks to settle the dispute, according to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We remain open to resolving this situation through an
intellectual property licensing agreement, and we look forward
to continued negotiations with TiVo,&#8221; Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft
spokesman, said in an e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krista Wierzbicki, a spokeswoman for TiVo, said the
Alviso, California-based company has no comment on the dispute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four patents in the ITC case relate to program
schedules and selection, controlling the interface, and a way to
restrict use of the DVR based on the program&#8217;s rating. Microsoft
said the technology is used in its Mediaroom software that runs
on competing set-top boxes including ATT&#8217;s U-Verse service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2009 Lawsuit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TiVo filed a patent-infringement suit against Dallas-based
ATT in August 2009, and Microsoft was allowed to join the case
to argue on behalf of its customer. That case is pending, as is
the suit accusing TiVo of infringing seven patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ITC is a quasi-judicial agency that has the power to
block imports of products found to infringe U.S. intellectual
property rights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it also filed a civil suit making the same
allegations in federal court in Seattle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new case is In the Matter of Set-Top Boxes, and
Hardware and Software Components Thereof, Complaint No. 2782,
U.S. International Trade Commission  Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling in
favor of a JPMorgan Chase  Co. unit, shielded banks from some
lawsuits by credit-card consumers whose interest rates were
increased after they went into default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices today unanimously said that a since-changed
Federal Reserve Board regulation let Chase Bank USA raise James
A. McCoy&#8217;s interest rates without notifying him. Chase&#8217;s
cardholder agreement said the company could impose higher rates
in the event of a default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In siding with Chase, the court said it was deferring to
the Fed&#8217;s interpretation of the rule, known as Regulation Z.
Although the Fed changed the regulation in 2009 to require
notification to defaulting customers, the Obama administration
argued that companies before then didn&#8217;t have to provide notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because the interpretation the board presents in its
brief is consistent with the regulatory text, we need look no
further in deciding this case,&#8221; Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote
for the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
had ruled against Chase in a decision that led to similar suits
being filed in California against other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation Z implements a consumer-protection provision in
the U.S. Truth in Lending Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chase Bank v. McCoy, 09-329. &lt;/p&gt;

Deprez" date="Jan 24, 2011  4:16 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-24/big-short-eisman-vies-with-goldman-sachs-in-value-faceoff-over-for-profits.html"><headline>Big Short Eisman Vies With Goldman Over For-Profits</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt;U.S. higher-education stocks fell 48
percent from April to October last year as the federal
government proposed tighter regulation and short sellers led by
hedge-fund manager Steve Eisman targeted for-profit colleges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisman, whose early bet against the housing market was
chronicled in Michael Lewis&#8217;s 2010 book &#8220;The Big Short,&#8221;
lobbied Department of Education officials and Senate staffers,
according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information
Act request. He publicly called for-profit schools &#8220;as socially
destructive as the subprime-mortgage industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, value investors are buying the stocks, saying the
worst is probably over. Maverick Capital Ltd. and Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. have seen their investments rebound as the Bloomberg
index of 13 for-profit colleges has rallied 17 percent since its
2010 low on Oct. 15, compared with the 9.1 percent gain by the
Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There is a lot of fear-mongering, which is actually great
because it causes the stocks to probably overshoot on the
downside, giving us the opportunity to look at them,&#8221; said
Jason Subotky, vice president at Yacktman Asset Management Co.
in Austin, Texas, which has $6.7 billion under management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are glad the short sellers came along to amplify the
uncertainty,&#8221; Subotky, whose firm owned 1.67 million shares of Apollo Group Inc. as of Sept. 30, said in an interview. The firm
has increased its stake since, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;University of Phoenix &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo is the operator of University of Phoenix, the
biggest for-profit college by enrollment. On Jan. 10, after the
close of regular U.S. trading, the Phoenix-based company
reported a higher-than-expected profit for the first quarter
ended Nov. 30. The stock rose 13 percent the next day, and has
gained an additional 3.95 percent since, while the SP 500 is
little changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $33 billion for-profit college industry tripled
enrollment to 1.8 million in the past decade while some of the
biggest companies -- among them Apollo Group, Education
Management Corp. and Washington Post Co.&#8217;s Kaplan Education unit
-- received 80 percent to 90 percent of their annual revenue
from federal student aid, according to company filings. The
industry stock index more than doubled from 2006 through its
2010 peak on April 21. The SP 500 fell 3.4 percent in the same
period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning last year, the Government Accountability Office
and Congressional Democrats, including Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, have raised questions about the industry&#8217;s recruiting
practices and record on educating students. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limiting Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in September that a
new rule, known as &#8220;gainful employment,&#8221; will be published
early this year that would limit the industry&#8217;s access to
federal student aid by linking for-profit colleges&#8217; eligibility
for government grants and loans to former students&#8217; incomes and
loan-repayment rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry trade groups and company executives have been
lobbying against the rule. They helped generate 90,000 letters
and e-mails in response to the proposal last year, leading
Duncan to delay implementation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Graham, chief executive officer of Washington Post,
criticized proposed regulations Jan. 14 in an op-ed article in
the Wall Street Journal, writing &#8220;their result will be less
access for our nation&#8217;s most needy students.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisman&#8217;s bets against bonds backed by subprime mortgages
helped double the size of his portfolio at FrontPoint Partners
LLC, the Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund where he is a
managing director, according to Lewis&#8217;s book. In May, at the Ira
Sohn Investment Research Conference in New York, he predicted
that higher-education stocks could fall as much as 50 percent if
the government tightened student-loan rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Morally Bankrupt&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Until recently, I thought that there would never again be
an opportunity to be involved with an industry as socially
destructive and morally bankrupt as the subprime-mortgage
industry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I was wrong. The for-profit education
industry has proven equal to the task.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vijai Mohan, a hedge-fund manager at Hyphen Fund Management
LLC in San Francisco, who had a stake in Washington Post,
decided to sell after Eisman spoke at the conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s such a high-profile investor, people listen to him
and he was quoted widely, and congressmen started scratching
their heads and decided they needed to do something,&#8221; Mohan,
who declined to disclose how many Washington Post shares his
fund held, said in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attractive Valuations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisman&#8217;s comments helped accelerate a selloff that has left
companies in the higher-education index trading at an average of
nine times last year&#8217;s profit. That&#8217;s 43 percent less than the
price-earnings ratio of 15.8 for the SP 500, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Santa Ana-based Corinthian Colleges Inc.
trades for 3 times earnings. No stock in the SP 500 is that
cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decline has attracted value investors, who buy stocks
they consider inexpensive based on financial measures like
earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many value investors &#8220;stayed away from the group for two
years as they were put off from the regulatory overhang,&#8221; said Trace Urdan, an analyst with investment bank Signal Hill Capital
Group LLC in San Francisco. They now &#8220;seem sufficiently
confident that the regulatory environment is going to resolve
itself, at least no worse than it&#8217;s been seen so far, and are
stepping in.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Significant Opportunity&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David Perkins, an analyst at Wallace R. Weitz  Co. in
Omaha, Nebraska, said, &#8220;Often times the most opportune time to
purchase a stock is when people believe the story the least.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investment firm oversees $3.7 billion, including shares
of Phoenix-based Grand Canyon Education Inc., Strayer Education
Inc. of Arlington, Virginia, and Washington Post, where the
Kaplan unit generates two-thirds of the Washington-based
company&#8217;s revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;As longer-term value investors, we&#8217;re not playing the
headlines or trying to find investments that will necessarily
reward us in the near term,&#8221; Perkins said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;We believe there&#8217;s still a significant opportunity
to educate working adults in this country and that the for-
profit model, when applied in the best interest of its students,
is an economically compelling means of providing a necessary
public good.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For-profit college investors include hedge funds Maverick
Capital, New York-based Tiger Global Management LLC, Lone Pine
Capital LLC of Greenwich, Connecticut, and San Francisco-based
Blum Capital Partners LP. Goldman Sachs, the New York-based
investment bank, has a 39 percent stake in Pittsburgh-based
Education Management. Warren Buffett&#8217;s Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
of Omaha owns 24 percent of Washington Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maverick&#8217;s Ainslie &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Ainslie, the New York-based founder of Maverick,
invested in Apollo in the third quarter of 2008 and has added to
his position. In the third quarter of 2010, he bought 190,692
shares, for a total of 7.7 million shares valued at about $330
million. Maverick owns 5.4 percent of Apollo, making it the
company&#8217;s second-largest shareholder after John Sperling, its
founder, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Apollo fell 35
percent last year, the third-worst performer on the SP 500. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the Value Investing Congress in New York in October,
Ainslie defended for-profit schools. &#8220;They serve minority
communities that are underserved,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For-profit
colleges deliver better results than community colleges.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ainslie declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On some companies, the bears have pulled back. Shares of 
Apollo sold short represented 6.9 percent of stock available for
trading, or float, as of Dec. 31, down from 9.6 percent in
September, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg. The
figure for Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based Career Education
Corp. declined to 9 percent from 17 percent in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shorts Haven&#8217;t Disappeared &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others are still under pressure. Short selling in
Corinthian Colleges amounted to 30 percent of float on Dec. 31.
That compared with the average of 3.9 percent for the Standard 
Poor&#8217;s 500 Index, the benchmark measure of U.S. shares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a short sale, traders sell borrowed stock, wagering they
will be able to repurchase it later at a lower price and pocket
the difference. If the stock goes down, it will benefit the
shorts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Jim Chanos, president of hedge fund Kynikos Associates
Ltd., has been betting against for-profit stocks for more than
two years. In a speech to investors in May 2009, he warned of
numerous instances of recruiting and lending violations at
higher-education companies. Chanos, who is based in New York,
declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisman&#8217;s Role &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of a religious argument at this point,&#8221; Jarrel Price, an analyst with investment-analysis firm Height Analytics
LLC in Washington, said in a telephone interview. &#8220;On the one
hand these companies print a lot of cash, and on the other hand
their enrollment strategies are vulnerable right now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisman, 48, has voiced his opinions regarding pending
regulation to government officials and Congressional Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 16, Eisman met with Education Department
officials, including acting deputy assistant education secretary
David Bergeron, according to Justin Hamilton, a department
spokesman. He sent multiple e-mails to a number of Education
Department officials, including Duncan, on May 28, two days
after airing his views at the Sohn conference in New York. He
warned against the watering down of gainful employment,
according to the documents obtained through a Freedom of
Information Act request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harkin Hearing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have been hearing that the Dept. of Ed. is considering
adjusting the gainful employment metrics in response to the
industry backlash against the proposal,&#8221; Eisman wrote in one of
the e-mails. &#8220;I cannot stress enough how critically important
choosing the right metrics are to enact the intended outcomes.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisman also had an April 15 telephone conference with
staffers from Harkin&#8217;s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee, and met with Harkin staff in May, according to
Justine Sessions, a spokeswoman for the senator. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee, chaired by Harkin, held a June 24 hearing
that was critical of for-profit colleges for misleading
applicants and graduating students with higher debt loads than
traditional colleges and poor job prospects. Eisman, a witness,
repeated his comments comparing for-profit schools to subprime
lenders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisman informed the Education Department and Harkin&#8217;s staff
that he had a short position, he said in a telephone
conversation. In an e-mailed statement, Eisman said there was
nothing wrong with his contact with the Education Department. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I have never had communications with the DOE of any kind
with respect to any existing or pending regulations,&#8221; Eisman
wrote, declining to disclose his current short position or
comment further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PowerPoint Presentation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He shared a PowerPoint that he intended to use for a
speech he was planning to give in May,&#8221; Bergeron, the acting
deputy assistant education secretary, said in a telephone
interview. &#8220;It would have been inappropriate for us not to meet
with someone that indicated that he had done serious research on
the industry.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 21, Eisman said in a separate statement that he was
considering starting his own hedge fund and leaving FrontPoint,
the firm Morgan Stanley plans to spin out by the end of March,
to give himself &#8220;greater operational flexibility and control
over my own business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eisman&#8217;s main FrontPoint Financial Services fund fell 8.3
percent in 2010, while his Financial Horizons Fund lost 7.7
percent, according to a person with knowledge of the results,
which were reported earlier today by the New York Post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apollo Group Donations &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For-profit colleges have spent millions of dollars on
campaign contributions and lobbying. In the 2010 U.S. midterm
elections, for-profit colleges made up half of the top 10
universities and educational institutions whose employees
donated the most money to federal candidates, parties and
committees, according to data compiled by the Center for
Responsive Politics, a Washington-based group that tracks money
in politics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employees at Apollo Group gave $300,292 to political
parties, the fourth-largest donation, after University of California, Harvard University and Stanford University.
According to the center, 9 of the 13 largest for-profit colleges
spent more than $4 million on lobbying in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What we&#8217;ve seen is a significant increase in for-profit
college spending on lobbying,&#8221; said Dave Levinthal, a spokesman
for the center. &#8220;For-profits are honing in on issues that have
a direct impact on their profitability.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for Mohan in San Francisco, he&#8217;s not looking to invest
in for-profit schools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This sector is in the crosshairs of regulation and we&#8217;re
broadly in a pro-regulatory environment,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That&#8217;s the
kind of situation I&#8217;d try to avoid.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Yonni Sebbag, the
California man who pleaded guilty in a scheme to leak Walt
Disney Co. earnings information, asked a court to sentence his
client to time served, or eight months in jail, in what he
called a &#8220;hare-brained scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney, Steven R. Kartagener, wrote to U.S. District
Judge Kimba Wood today asking for less than the 27 to 33 months
recommended by federal guidelines when she sentences Sebbag, 30,
on Jan. 28. Sebbag turned to crime after failing in the
restaurant business then losing money in day-trading and
gambling, the lawyer wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Defendant&#8217;s foolhardy undertaking was driven by
defendant&#8217;s desperation in the face of his failing business, and
by a gambling addiction which began to take control of his
life,&#8221; Kartagener said in a letter to Wood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, pleaded guilty to
attempting to sell confidential information about the
entertainment company&#8217;s quarterly earnings. Hoxie, a former
executive assistant to Disney corporate communications chief Zenia Mucha, is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 22. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag, a Moroccan citizen, faces deportation in addition
to prison time, Kartagener said in the letter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Hedge Funds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors claimed Sebbag sent letters in March to at
least 33 investment companies, including hedge funds, offering
to sell confidential information about Burbank, California-based
Disney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 11, an undercover agent with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation began reaching out to the pair, according to the
charging document filed in New York. On May 8, the two gave
undercover FBI agents internal Disney documents, according to
the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;None of the funds acted on the tips, a person familiar with
the matter said. Disney said it cooperated with prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This hare-brained scheme was obviously doomed to fail
from the start,&#8221; said Kartagenerin the letter. &#8220;Defendant is
extremely remorseful, and knows that what he did was stupid and
wrong.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Hoxie, 10-mag-01113, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York  Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; First Solar Inc. climbed as much as
5.4 percent to a three-month high in New York after Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. reiterated a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on the largest U.S.
solar panel maker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Tempe, Arizona-based company also began construction
today on a $300 million manufacturing plant in Vietnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First Solar rose as high as $155.38 in Nasdaq Stock Market
trading. It was trading at $153.14, up 3.9 percent, at 12 p.m.,
its highest since Oct. 26. Goldman Sachs has a target price of
$165 on the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;First Solar is our top pick based on one of our key
themes for solar stocks in 2011: owning long-term structural
winners that are low-cost, well-funded producers with visible
demand and credible capacity growth,&#8221; the New York-based bank
wrote in a research note today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company said its factory in Ho Chi Minh City is
expected to go into commercial production in the second half of
2012. It will have four manufacturing lines that will each be
able to produce as much as 59.6 megawatts of solar panels a
year. It also has the option to expand the plant to four times
that size, First Solar said in an e-mailed statement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Central Bank probably
won&#8217;t raise interest rates before the fourth quarter, even as
inflation accelerates, because of the region&#8217;s weak banking
industry, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief interest-
rate strategist Francesco Garzarelli. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;What seems to be holding the ECB&#8217;s hands at the present
juncture is the concern over insolvencies of some of these
banking institutions,&#8221; Garzarelli said in an interview on
&#8220;Bloomberg Surveillance&#8221; with Tom Keene. &#8220;Ultimately, those
issues will be addressed by the governments and that will
relinquish the ECB from having to handle the problem, so they
can return to looking at inflation as their primary mandate.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman predicts that the central bank will increase the
borrowing cost in the October-December period. The ECB kept its
benchmark rate at a record low of 1 percent earlier this month
while President Jean-Claude Trichet toughened his rhetoric on
inflation after it accelerated to 2.2 percent in December,
breaching the central bank&#8217;s 2 percent limit for the first time
in more than two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECB can avoid hurting the region&#8217;s most-indebted
nations, such as Ireland and Greece, by gradually raising interest rates while providing &#8220;generous&#8221; liquidity to banks,
he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Neutral&#8217; on Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In that way, they should be there for liquidity purposes
and also signal to the market they are serious about keeping
inflation close to the target,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Inflation should
gradually resurface, given the recovery is progressing fine in Germany and the core countries. That is what ultimately will
guide the ECB&#8217;s hands.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman is &#8220;neutral&#8221; on bonds in general as the global
economic recovery is gathering steam, Garzarelli said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There was a big repricing of bond yields over November
and December as people revised upward growth numbers,&#8221; said
Garzarelli. &#8220;The revision came mostly out of the U.S. which is
now seemingly recoupled with the rest of the world. We&#8217;ve seen a
bit of inflation concerns in the process, but those stem mostly
from commodities.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten-year Treasury yields climbed 1.1 percentage points
between reaching a two-week low on Nov. 4 and a six-month high
of 3.56 percent on Dec. 16. The yield was two basis points lower
at 3.39 percent as of 11:14 a.m. in New York. Similar-maturity
German bund yields were three basis points lower today at 3.15
percent, while U.K. 10-year gilts were also three basis points
lower, at 3.57 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Bond yields are going to stay here for a little while,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see how they progress during the course of the
year as the recovery consolidates. We are fairly neutral on
bonds at this juncture.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Solar-panel makers will avoid a
&#8220;hard landing&#8221; in 2011 and forecast that the industry will
expand by 13 percent, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank recommended investors buy shares of First Solar Inc., SMA Solar Technology AG and GCL-Poly Energy
Holdings Ltd. because the market is priced for a decline in
demand this year, according to a research note published today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The increase in demand for photovoltaic generators will be
driven by declines in the prices of panels, government targets
for clean power and companies installing panels, Goldman
analysts led by Mark Wienkes said in the report. Analysts
including Gordon Johnson at Axiom Capital Management in New York
have argued that demand will fall as governments in Germany and
the Czech Republic cut subsidies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;While the path for investors is unlikely to be smooth, the
opportunity to own long-term solar leaders&#8221; at current prices is
&#8220;appealing,&#8221; Wienkes said in the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar has gained 32 percent over
the past 12 months through Jan. 21 to trade at $147.41. Goldman
said the stock may exceed its six-month target price of $165 by
15 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission has sent subpoenas to the state treasurer requesting
information concerning dealings between Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
and ex-treasurer Timothy P. Cahill, the Boston Globe reported,
citing an official briefed on the request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The subpoenas seek e-mails, phone records, schedules,
files, and memorandums just over a month since Goldman removed
itself from two state bond deals in Massachusetts after it was
disclosed that Neil Morrison, a vice president at the firm,  was
active in Cahill&#8217;s 2010 gubernatorial campaign, the newspaper
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morrison&#8217;s involvement might contravene federal securities

&lt;p&gt;The utility signed a final agreement to buy 300,000 metric

&lt;p&gt;Kyushu also has an initial agreement to buy the fuel from

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co.&#8217;s money-losing
interactive media unit cut 29 percent of its workers in video-
game development for consoles, according to a person with
knowledge of the decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney fired about 200 of the 700 workers who design games
for consoles such as Nintendo Co.&#8217;s Wii, said the person, who
sought anonymity because the move isn&#8217;t public. Disney
Interactive Media has about 3,000 workers, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Pleasants and James Pitaro, installed as the unit&#8217;s
co-presidents last year by Disney Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger, are cutting console jobs as they add online and mobile
games. Iger, 59, told investors in November the company
shouldn&#8217;t be in the interactive business &#8220;if we&#8217;re not going to
be able to make money.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney&#8217;s interactive unit lost $234 million in the most
recent fiscal year. In a 2006 interview, Iger said it would take
as long as five years before the division would be profitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Disney said the restructuring began this
week at the interactive division, which includes games, online
worlds and websites aimed at parents and kids. The Burbank,
California-based company said it&#8217;s &#8220;setting a strategic
direction for future success in the digital-media space.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Friedland, a spokesman for Disney, declined to
comment on the number of jobs cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Austin, Vancouver &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dana Henry, a Disney spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today
that Propaganda Games in Vancouver were shuttered last week and
Junction Point Studios in Austin, Texas, had &#8220;a minor reduction
in workforce, as part of an overall restructuring of the Disney
Interactive Media Group.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney, the world&#8217;s biggest media company, fell 8 cents to
$39.86 today in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
shares climbed 16 percent in 2010, exceeding the 13 percent
increase in the Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Index. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The job cuts were reported previously by the Los Angeles
Times and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasants, who oversaw Playdom Inc. before its acquisition
by Disney, and Pitaro, who ran entertainment assets at Yahoo
Inc., replaced Steve Wadsworth, who left Disney last year. Both
executives report to Iger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Brazil&#8217;s annual inflation will
quicken to the fastest in seven years and the real will continue
to appreciate as the government fails to contain spending and
banks boost lending, said Paulo Leme, the chief Latin America
economist at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inflation will accelerate to 6.5 percent this year, the
fastest since 2004, Leme said today at an event in New York. His
estimate exceeds the median forecast of 5.53 percent among 100
economists polled for a Jan. 21 central bank survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Dilma Rousseff&#8217;s planned budget cuts are focused
on future spending, not current expenditures, and therefore
won&#8217;t be enough to cut inflation as public banks lend to promote
development, Leme said. Brazil&#8217;s central bank last week raised
its benchmark overnight rate by half a percentage point to 11.25
percent and signaled it will rely on administrative steps to
curb the growth of credit to fight inflation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Policy tightening will not be enough,&#8221; Leme said at a
panel held by the Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce.
&#8220;Something will have to give. What will give will be
inflation.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central bank targets annual inflation of 4.5 percent,
plus or minus two percentage points. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Near-zero interest rates in the U.S. and Europe will
continue to draw investors in search of higher yields to Brazil,
where the benchmark lending rate will rise to 13.25 percent by
the end of the year, Leme said. The inflows and Brazil&#8217;s
economic growth will put pressure on the real to appreciate,
which the government won&#8217;t be able to counter by intervening in
the market, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currency&#8217;s Gains &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real has gained 38 percent in the past two years, the
most among emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
Policy makers have sought to limit the gains, which can hurt
exporters by making their goods more expensive in dollar terms,
by taxing inflows, selling currency swaps and buying dollars in
the foreign-exchange market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real has gained 1.6 percent since the Finance Ministry
tripled a tax on foreign investors&#8217; fixed-income purchases in
October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;ll continue to intervene in many ways, ineffectively
because neither swaps nor buying reserves will really stop it,&#8221;
Leme said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s going to make much of a
difference.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without government reforms, Brazil won&#8217;t be able to boost
sustainable economic growth to more than 4.5 percent, Leme said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re not seeing the structural reforms, improvement on
the quality of fiscal taxes, labor reforms, social security that
would raise the potential GDP growth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What worries
me is we should be striving for 7 percent growth and we&#8217;ll
settle for 4.5 percent.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy bullish Embraer
SA options before earnings reports that may lift shares of
world&#8217;s fourth-largest plane maker amid a rebound in jet demand, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists Maria Grant and Katherine Fogertey recommended buying April $35 calls on the company&#8217;s
American depositary receipts &#8220;for exposure to our analyst&#8217;s
bullish view&#8221; on the shares. They also suggested buying April
$35 calls and April $30 puts, a strategy known as a strangle,
which they said profits if shares close above $37 or below $28
before the contracts expire April 15. Embraer lost 0.8 percent
to $32.09 as of 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embraer may get a boost from its earnings report and those
from rivals, they said, citing Goldman Sachs aerospace analyst
Noah Poponak, who rates the Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil-based
company at &#8220;buy.&#8221; More new aircraft orders combined with
greater credit availability as the global economic recovers
signal that the regional jet industry is &#8220;closer to the trough
than the peak,&#8221; the strategists said, citing Poponak. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He is seeing evidence of a much stronger recovery in
regional and business jets already under way,&#8221; the New York-
based strategists said today. That&#8217;s a &#8220;strong&#8221; indicator that
earnings may exceed analysts&#8217; estimates and it indicates the
shares&#8217; volatility may rise, they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potential catalysts for a rally in Embraer shares include
the company&#8217;s earnings report and investor day in March, as well
as earnings reports from General Dynamics Corp. and Textron
Inc., both scheduled for tomorrow, which may &#8220;shine light on
the positive trends in business jets,&#8221; the report said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy a security for a certain
amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the right
to sell. Investors use options to guard against fluctuations in
the price of securities they own, speculate on share-price moves
or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. will keep the
fluid catalytic cracker at its Chalmette, Louisiana, refinery
shut for about two weeks for unplanned repairs on an exchanger,
according to two people familiar with the plant&#8217;s operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gasoline-making unit, which can process more than
75,000 barrels a day, was shut because it can&#8217;t operate when the
exchanger is down, said the people, who declined to be
identified because they aren&#8217;t authorized to speak for the
plant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit had an outage &#8220;early Saturday morning&#8221; and
remains shut, Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, said in an e-
mail today. He said he doesn&#8217;t know how long the catalytic
cracker will be down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery is a joint venture with Petroleos de Venezuela
SA and has a capacity of 200,700 barrels a day, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chalmette is in St. Bernard Parish, adjacent to New
Orleans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yonni Sebbag, a California man who
pleaded guilty in a scheme to leak Walt Disney Co. earnings
information, should be sentenced to 27 months to 33 months in
prison, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag and his girlfriend, Bonnie Hoxie, pleaded guilty to
attempting to sell confidential information about the
entertainment company&#8217;s quarterly earnings. Hoxie, a former
executive assistant to Disney corporate communications chief Zenia Mucha, is scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 22. Sebbag, who
seeks an 8-month prison term, will be sentenced on Jan. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sebbag brazenly, and illegally, offered for sale highly
confidential and sensitive internal information regarding
Disney&#8217;s business and operations,&#8221; federal prosecutors in Manhattan said in a court filing made public today. &#8220;Sebbag
exploited his access to confidential information to hatch an
illegal insider trading scheme.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebbag sent letters to at least 33 investment companies,
including hedge funds, offering to sell confidential information
about Burbank, California-based Disney, prosecutors said. None
of the funds acted on the tips. Disney said it cooperated with
prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Hoxie, 10-cr-753, U.S. District Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp., the world&#8217;s largest computer-services provider, said it
won a contract to help China build Asia&#8217;s largest cloud-
computing center by 2016. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM will provide data-center design services for the
building that will measure 620,000 square meters, under a
contract from Range Technology Development Co., the Armonk, New
York-based company said in a statement today. Terms of the
contract weren&#8217;t disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data center will be part of the 9.8 billion yuan ($1.5
billion) Langfang Range International Information Hub in
northern China&#8217;s Hebei Province, Harriet Ip, an IBM spokeswoman,
said in an e-mail today. Langfang is a city of 3.85 million
people between Beijing and Tianjin that is being promoted as
&#8220;China&#8217;s Silicon Valley,&#8221; Ip said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data center will support independent software vendors
and enterprises with software product development, as well as
help Langfang city develop e-government services, administration
systems and food-and-drug safety services, IBM said in the
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Range Technology Development was established in 2009 as an
Internet, data-center service and telecommunications-network-
services provider, according to its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cloud-computing center is expected to employ between
60,000 and 80,000 people, according to Ip&#8217;s e-mail. Cloud
computing allows customers to save money by storing data on
remote servers that can be accessed via the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shishir Bajpai, vice president at
Mumbai-based IIFL Wealth Management Ltd. with assets valued at
$1.8 billion, comments on India&#8217;s monetary policy and stock
markets. He spoke by phone today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s central bank increased the benchmark interest rate
to a two-year high and signaled further gains in borrowing costs
after raising its inflation forecast. Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
lifted the repurchase rate to 6.5 percent from 6.25 percent,
according to a statement from the Reserve Bank of India in
Mumbai today. The decision was forecast by 21 of 22 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. One expected a half-point advance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombay Stock Exchange&#8217;s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 0.4 percent to 19,220.02 at 12:46 p.m. in Mumbai. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the RBI&#8217;s rate decision: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a temporary relief. I don&#8217;t think it changes much.
The concerns on inflation and the fiscal situation for which the
markets corrected are very much there and have not been
addressed by the rate increase. It&#8217;s not a game changer. The Reserve Bank of India has upped the inflation target. So, the
inflation concern has actually heightened.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On inflation: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Something needs to be done from the government&#8217;s side
because it&#8217;s not a demand-driven inflation this time but it&#8217;s
more of a supply side problem. There&#8217;s not much the Reserve Bank
of India can do by increasing rates.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On investment strategy: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t really change my investment policy. Now the
ball is in the government&#8217;s court to take some corrective
measures. We will be looking closely at the government policies
and the how the budget plays off.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s government will announce its annual spending plan
next month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG drugs
have helped patients with the same cancer as Apple Inc.&#8217;s Steve Jobs live longer in recent studies and Stanford University, near
Apple&#8217;s home base, is testing new drug combinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Apple chief executive officer took a leave of absence
in 2004 after saying he had a neuroendocrine tumor, a malignancy
that strikes about 3,000 Americans a year. He left in 2009 for a
liver transplant, sometimes done when the cancer spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Jobs&#8217;s third leave, announced to employees Jan. 17,
means the malignancy is back, his treatment options now include
a wave of new drugs that add months on average to survival
rates, even as they carry side effects that can include fatigue,
diarrhea, vomiting and low blood counts that can spur infection,
doctors say. Jobs has already beaten the odds, according to a
2007 study finding that patients with the tumor die an average
of three years after diagnosis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, &#8220;there have been advances that might be
applicable to his case,&#8221; said John Fung, chairman of the Cleveland Clinic&#8217;s Digestive Disease Institute, in a telephone
interview. &#8220;If he has a recurrence, it isn&#8217;t the end of the
world.&#8221; Fung said he hasn&#8217;t been involved in Jobs&#8217;s case. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley Managing Director
Kamal Ahmed is &#8220;cooperating&#8221; with the bank&#8217;s investigation of
allegations raised in a U.S. court filing that an employee
helped pass information in the Galleon Group LLC hedge fund
insider trading scandal, Ahmed&#8217;s lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Douglas Tween, a lawyer at Baker  McKenzie LLP in New York
who represents Ahmed, said yesterday in a phone interview that
he is &#8220;confident that when the investigation is completed, and
all the facts are gathered, it will be shown that he did nothing
illegal or unethical.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raj Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group, is charged
with five counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and
nine counts of securities fraud. He&#8217;s the central figure in an
insider-trading probe in which more than 20 people have been
criminally charged. Rajaratnam has pleaded not guilty and is
scheduled to go to trial Feb. 28. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors filed a superseding indictment dated Jan. 20
against Rajaratnam that added a new securities-fraud count and
provided additional details about stocks he is alleged to have
traded illegally. A Morgan Stanley banker, whose name was
redacted in the court filing, was accused of passing information
on Advanced Micro Devices Inc.&#8217;s purchase of ATI Technologies
Inc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In or about May 2006, [redacted], a banker with Morgan
Stanley, provided [redacted] with information regarding AMD&#8217;s
acquisition of ATI,&#8221; according to the letter, signed by
Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Streeter. &#8220;[Redacted] provided
this information to Rajaratnam.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 1:09-cr-1184, U.S. District

&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns Bid to Get Securities Suit Tossed Denied by Judge &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns Cos. once the world&#8217;s fifth-largest investment
bank, lost a bid to dismiss a federal securities lawsuit when a
judge ruled there is sufficient reason to take parts of the
consolidated case to trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor originally sued the New York-based firm in
November 2007 alleging mismanagement, in part for buying risky
subprime mortgage loans for collateralized debt obligations,
according to court papers. Other lawsuits followed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The incantation of fraud-by-hindsight will not defeat an
allegation of misrepresentations and omissions that were
misleading and false at the time they were made,&#8221; wrote U.S.
District Judge Robert W. Sweet in a 398-page opinion Jan.19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. bought Bear Stearns in March 2008,
with the firm on the brink of collapse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his opinion, Sweet refused to dismiss a case alleging
misstatements by Bear Stearns and auditor Deloitte  Touche, and
agreed to dismiss a so-called derivative suit seeking damages
for the company and a suit filed by former Bear Stearns
employees over a stock ownership plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It is important to recognize that in ruling on the
defendants&#8217; motions to dismiss, the court was required to assume
that the allegations in plaintiffs&#8217; complaint were true,&#8221; and
&#8220;Deloitte believes that the claims asserted against it are
meritless,&#8221; said company spokesman Jonathan Gandal in an
e-mailed message. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We believe that the Bear Stearns-related security law
claims that survived the motion to dismiss are entirely without
merit and we intend to seek their dismissal at an appropriate
juncture,&#8221; said JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli
in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combined case is In Re: Bear Stearns Cos. securities,
Derivative, and ERISA Litigation, 09-MDL-1963, U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HP Can Proceed With Hurd Departure Investigation, Judge Rules &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal judge allowed a probe of Mark Hurd&#8217;s departure
from Hewlett-Packard Co. to go forward, overriding Hurd&#8217;s
objection to the investigation based on claims he deserves to
see documents HP&#8217;s board refuses to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge James Ware, in San Jose, California,
canceled a hearing on the matter scheduled for yesterday,
finding &#8220;good cause&#8221; to let the company investigation go
forward while halting the lawsuit that prompted it for 45 days.
The suit alleges that directors at the largest maker of
computers wasted company money by awarding Hurd as much as
$53 million in severance when he resigned as chief executive
officer in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurd quit after the Palo Alto, California-based company
found that he violated business conduct standards in trying to
conceal a personal relationship with a contractor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ware scheduled a new hearing in March, requiring an
&#8220;update on the investigation&#8221; beforehand, according to his
Jan. 20 order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ware&#8217;s order doesn&#8217;t say whether Hurd was able to see the
documents he seeks. The new probe would be conducted by a
committee of directors who joined HP after Hurd&#8217;s departure and
by lawyers not involved in the shareholder litigation, according
to a case-management statement filed Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mylene Mangalindan, an HP spokeswoman, declined to comment
on the judge&#8217;s ruling yesterday. Glenn Bunting, a spokesman for
Hurd, didn&#8217;t immediately return calls and e-mails seeking
comment after business hours. &lt;/p&gt;

Court, Northern District of California (San Jose). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khodorkovsky May Face Third Trial, Prosecutors Say &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the jailed former head of Yukos Oil
Co., may face a third trial in Russia if an investigation
unearths further evidence against him, prosecutors said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russian law enforcement agencies are hunting for 18
&#8220;accomplices&#8221; of Khodorkovsky and his former business partner,
Platon Lebedev, prosecutors Valery Lakhtin and Gulchekhra
Ibragimova said in an interview published in the Komsomolskaya
Pravda newspaper yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khodorkovsky, once Russia&#8217;s richest man and a critic of
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, last month was sentenced to
another six years beyond his eight-year prison term for fraud.
He was found guilty of money laundering and of embezzling in a
ruling that will keep him in jail until 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOC Hong Kong Manager Warned Lehman Product Buyers, Court Told &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BOC Hong Kong (Holdings) Ltd. manager facing criminal
charges for selling structured products linked to Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. warned customers they could lose their
money, her lawyer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheung Kwai-kwai took her customers through sales leaflets
for the products, including the part showing that they weren&#8217;t
principal protected, her lawyer Peter Duncan said in his closing
submission yesterday in Hong Kong District Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheung, 48, pleaded not guilty to seven counts of
fraudulently or recklessly inducing customers, including
retirees and investors who hadn&#8217;t completed primary school, to
invest a total of about $770,164 in minibonds and Constellation
notes, between 2005 and 2008. Judge Garry Tallentire said
yesterday the verdict would be delivered on Feb. 18. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cheung made statements to customers that the structured
products were safe, principal-protected, and failed to disclose
that the risk level designated by the bank was &#8220;high,&#8221; Senior
public prosecutor Jonathan Man said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angel Yip, a spokeswoman for BOC Hong Kong didn&#8217;t respond
to an e-mailed request for comment yesterday. It was one of 16
banks that agreed to a settlement to buy back the products for
at least 60 cents on the dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Singapore Criticizes Fund Managers&#8217; &#8216;Window Dressing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Monetary Authority of Singapore said it won&#8217;t tolerate
&#8220;window dressing&#8221; by fund managers in its response to an
appeal against the civil stock-rigging lawsuit it won last year
against Pheim Asset Management Sdn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Any other decision would encourage and embolden
professional market players to flout the rules and undermine the
integrity of the market,&#8221; the central bank said in documents
filed at the Singapore High Court on Jan. 21, arguing that the
appeal by Pheim and its Chief Executive Officer Tan Chong Koay
should be dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pheim and Tan, 61, have denied rigging the stock and said
they&#8217;re &#8220;value&#8221; investors. They bought almost 90 percent of
the traded shares of United Envirotech Ltd. from Dec. 29 to
Dec. 31, 2004. The shares rose 17 percent over the three trading
days and helped raise the net asset value of the fund&#8217;s
accounts, triggering bonuses of S$50,790 ($39,560) and a
management fee of S$115. The trial is scheduled to start the
week of March 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Lai Siu Chiu in her Sept. 17 ruling said Pheim and
Tan had sought to boost their reputation instead of seeking
monetary gains in rigging the stock. The MAS, which had sought a
fine of S$1 million each, said in its January filing the
S$250,000 penalty imposed was &#8220;amply justified.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cavinder Bull from Drew  Napier LLC is acting for the
monetary authority and Vinodh Coomaraswamy is representing Tan
and Pheim. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEC Settles Foreign Bribe Case With Ex-Innospec Chief &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The former chief executive officer of Innospec Inc., Paul
W. Jennings, agreed to settle foreign bribery allegations
brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings agreed to pay about $229,000 in penalties to
resolve claims that he bribed Iraqi and Indonesian officials to
win contracts for the company&#8217;s specialty chemicals, the SEC
said in a statement. The agency filed a civil complaint
yesterday against Jennings in federal court in Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC claimed that Jennings &#8220;actively participated in
bribery schemes&#8221; in Iraq and Indonesia since 2004. The agency
said that from 2000 to 2008 Innospec Inc. paid more than
$6 million in bribes in exchange for about $177 million in
revenue, which generated $60 million in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennings&#8217;s attorney, Jay Holtmeier, didn&#8217;t immediately
return a telephone message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innospec spokesman Brian Watt declined to comment on
Jennings&#8217;s settlement, saying the company resolved its matter
with authorities last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Jennings, 11-cv-00144, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Wins at U.S. High Court in Credit-Card Case &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court, ruling in favor of a JPMorgan Chase
 Co. unit, shielded banks from some lawsuits by consumers whose
rates were increased after they went into default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday unanimously said that a since-
changed Federal Reserve Board regulation let Chase Bank USA
raise James A. McCoy&#8217;s interest rates without notifying him.
Chase&#8217;s cardholder agreement said the company could impose
higher rates in the event of a default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In siding with Chase, the court said it was deferring to
the Fed&#8217;s interpretation of the rule, known as Regulation Z.
Although the Fed changed the regulation in 2009 to require
notification to defaulting customers, the Obama administration
argued that companies before then didn&#8217;t have to provide notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because the interpretation the board presents in its
brief is consistent with the regulatory text, we need look no
further in deciding this case,&#8221; Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote
for the court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled against
Chase in a decision that led to similar suits being filed in
California against other banks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulation Z implements a consumer-protection provision in
the U.S. Truth in Lending Act. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Chase Bank v. McCoy, 09-329, U.S. Supreme Court
(Washington). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worker Retaliation Suits Backed by U.S. Supreme Court &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court bolstered the ability of employees
to sue for retaliation, ruling in favor of a man who was fired
after his fianc&#233;e complained about alleged sex discrimination at
the same company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The justices yesterday unanimously said that Title VII, the
federal law that covers gender and racial discrimination in the
workplace, protects third parties from retaliation in addition
to the person pressing the original complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anti-retaliation provision in Title VII is &#8220;worded
broadly,&#8221; Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court. &#8220;We
think it obvious that a reasonable worker might be dissuaded
from engaging in protected activity if she knew that her fianc&#233;
would be fired,&#8221; he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ruling lets Eric L. Thompson press ahead with a lawsuit
against his former employer, North American Stainless LP.
Thompson was fired in 2003, three weeks after the company
learned that his fianc&#233;e, Miriam Regalado, had filed a complaint
with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and claimed she
had suffered discrimination by her supervisor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court had barred the suit from going
forward. The Obama administration backed Thompson in the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Thompson v. North American Stainless, 09-291,
U.S. Supreme Court  New York). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. demanded that a
lender repurchase bad mortgages even as it resisted calls to buy
back the loans from bonds created by Bear Stearns Cos., an
insurer said in court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That would be pretty bad&#8221; if true, said Joshua Rosner, an
analyst at New York-based research firm Graham Fisher  Co. He
said such allegations show why &#8220;investors and consumers have a
right to be distrustful of the banks&#8217; statements.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac Assurance Corp., the debt guarantor partly seized
last year by Wisconsin&#8217;s insurance commissioner, made the claim
in a proposed amended complaint in its lawsuit against Bear
Stearns&#8217;s EMC Mortgage unit, now owned by JPMorgan. Ambac,
seeking to add a fraud claim to the case, referenced
depositions, e-mail and letters in the filing, which was
unsealed Jan. 14 in Manhattan federal court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond investors and other insurers, including
Allstate Corp., Pacific Investment Management Co. and MBIA Inc.,
have accused loan sellers or bond underwriters of sometimes
misrepresenting the quality of the underlying debt enough to
trigger contractual or legal provisions requiring repurchases.
So-called mortgage putbacks may cost banks and lenders as much
as $90 billion, JPMorgan bond analysts said in an October
report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment on the filing, which the company
had fought to keep secret. A federal judge must still rule on
whether to allow the amended complaint to go forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insured Bonds &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns sought on March 11, 2008 -- just weeks before
the collapsing company agreed to be bought by JPMorgan -- to
have a lender buy back mortgages in bonds insured by Syncora
Guarantee Inc., according to the filing. Bear Stearns said the
mortgages failed to meet promised standards of quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Bear Stearns was denying demands from
Syncora that it repurchase the loans, even though the insurer
cited the same flaws, according to the filing. Bear Stearns had
bought the loans and packaged them into bonds to sell to
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan later maintained &#8220;that it is EMC&#8217;s position that
these breaches materially and adversely affect the value&#8221; of
the loans, according to the complaint, which cited a June 26,
2008, letter from Alison Malkin, an executive director in
JPMorgan&#8217;s securities unit, to the lender, a now-closed unit of
Capital One Financial Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Diametrically Opposing&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Remarkably, Malkin took diametrically opposing positions
in repeatedly refusing to comply with all but 4 percent of
Syncora&#8217;s repurchase demands,&#8221; Ambac said in the proposed
amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit was filed in November 2008. New York-based Ambac Financial Group Inc., Ambac Assurance&#8217;s parent, filed for bankruptcy protection last year. Syncora, which was ordered to
stop paying claims by New York regulators in 2008, is also suing
EMC Mortgage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 16, U.S. Magistrate Judge Theodore Katz issued a
report and recommendations to U.S. District Court Judge Richard Berman in New York, who is presiding over the Ambac case. Katz,
who is handling pretrial matters, recommended that Ambac be
allowed to add a fraudulent-inducement claim against EMC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC&#8217;s lawyers on Jan. 14 argued against letting Ambac file
the proposed amended complaint. EMC has also asked Katz to
reconsider his ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan last quarter set aside $1.5 billion in litigation
reserves to cover costs related to buying back faulty mortgages.
Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said it will take years to
resolve the disputes and to determine the ultimate cost to his
bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Ugly Mess&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be a long ugly mess, but it won&#8217;t be life-
threatening to JPMorgan,&#8221; he told analysts on a Jan. 14
conference call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank also ignored the findings of mortgage-review firm
Clayton Holdings LLC in abandoning mortgage repurchases that
Bear Stearns had been considering in early 2008 stemming from a
pool of 596 of loans in bonds guaranteed by Ambac, according to
the insurer&#8217;s amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clayton found that 56 percent of the loans involved
&#8220;material&#8221; breaches of Bear Stearns&#8217;s contractual promises,
according to the filing, which cited a copy of a November 2007
document from the review firm to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Malkin overruled Bear Stearns decisions on which
mortgages to repurchase to limit JPMorgan reserve expenses, the
portion of those loans that were approved for repurchase fell to
2.2 percent by September 2008, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proof that the bank ignored a third-party review is
&#8220;major, that&#8217;s hugely newsworthy,&#8221; said Isaac Gradman, a San
Francisco-based consultant and formerly a lawyer at Howard Rice
Nemerovski Canady Falk  Rabkin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Sides &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Syncora loans, &#8220;if they&#8217;re making an argument out
of one side of their mouth and a different argument out of the
other, that is arguably a breach of an implied covenant of good
faith and would be very strong evidence to prove repurchase
demands,&#8221; he said in a telephone interview. Gradman represented
mortgage insurer PMI Group Inc. in a now-settled lawsuit over
similar issues against General Electric Co. and its defunct
mortgage unit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ambac also alleges in its proposed complaint that, as early
as 2005, Bear Stearns was making a strategy out of earning
&#8220;double&#8221; money on shoddy mortgages. First Bear Stearns sold
securities backed by the debt, then forced the mortgage lender
that sold it the loans to pay up when they turned delinquent in
the first few months or were otherwise proved to have breached
originators&#8217; representations, Ambac said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns generally wouldn&#8217;t refund investors with that
second pool of money, Ambac said in the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early Payment &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While such so-called early payment defaults may not require
repurchases of mortgages out of securities by the issuers of the
bonds, because of differences between securitization contracts
and those entered into by lenders, Bear Stearns&#8217;s policy raised
questions at the time, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;External auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP advised Bear
Stearns in August 2006 that it needed to review loans that were
defaulting or defective to see if their quality breached its
obligations and begin the &#8220;immediate processing of the buy-out
if there is a clear breach in order to match common industry
practices, the expectation of investors and to comply&#8221; with its
mortgage bonds&#8217; contracts, according to the amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its own lawyers by early 2007 were making similar
suggestions, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securitized Loans &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the end of 2005, Bear Stearns had moved to making sure
to securitize home loans before their early payment default
periods ended, without informing investors and insurers of the
switch, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, if the loans went delinquent or were otherwise found
defective, the company would seek settlements from lenders,
rather than repurchases, which would have required the cash paid
by originators to flow through to the securitization trusts so
the debt could be passed back, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;That is how we pay for the lights,&#8221; one employee told
another in an Aug. 11, 2005, e-mail cited in Ambac&#8217;s filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2007 and the first quarter of 2008, Bear Stearns
resolved repurchase claims to lenders on more than $1.3 billion
of mortgages through settlements or for other consideration,
according to the complaint, which cited the deposition of an
employee. The securities firm received more than $367 million of
&#8220;economic value,&#8221; according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo Suit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also this month, EMC Mortgage was sued by Wells Fargo 
Co., which is acting as the trustee for another set of mortgage
bonds, for refusing to turn over documents detailing the quality
of loans packaged into those securities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An investor believes the files show some of the loans
should be repurchased, according to the complaint filed Jan. 18
in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington. Wells Fargo &#8220;has
repeatedly requested that EMC provide access to the subject
documents,&#8221; the San Francisco-based bank said in the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;EMC has played proverbial &#8216;rope a dope&#8217; and otherwise
continued to drag its feet, and has produced nothing,&#8221;
according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual Inc., the Seattle-based bank whose assets
were mostly acquired by JPMorgan after it failed in 2008, has
been another source of litigation. Last September, Deutsche Bank
AG, acting as a trustee for bondholders, refiled a lawsuit over
allegedly misrepresented loans in $34 billion of WaMu mortgage
securities, with $165 billion in original balances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suit, filed in federal court in the District of
Columbia, included JPMorgan as a defendant after the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. said that JPMorgan was wrongly claiming
its insurance fund had agreed to cover the liabilities,
according to the amended complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is balking at turning over loan files to the
trustee, according to Deutsche Bank. Either JPMorgan or the FDIC
owes investors $6 billion to $10 billion, according to the
complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Ambac v. EMC Mortgage, 08-cv-9464, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc., pressed by
a congressionally appointed panel to describe its use of
derivatives during the financial crisis, said it relied on the
instruments for most mortgage trades and for revenue from
commodities, interest rates and currencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Derivatives accounted for about 70 percent to 75 percent of
revenue in the firm&#8217;s commodities business from 2006 to 2009,
and &#8220;half or more&#8221; of revenue from interest rates and
currencies, the firm estimated, according to a report by the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. From May 2007 to November
2008, about 86 percent of $155 billion in trades made by the
firm&#8217;s mortgage business involved derivatives, the FCIC said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission examined derivatives as part of an
investigation of the credit crisis, which sparked the worst
recession since the 1930s and the loss of more than 8 million
U.S. jobs. Derivatives -- contracts whose value is derived from
assets such as stocks, bonds, currencies or commodities -- may
have contributed to the turmoil by making it hard for
regulators, responding to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s 2008
bankruptcy, to gauge the interconnectedness of financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, estimated in August that 25 percent to 35 percent of
its revenue came from derivates. The New York-based firm&#8217;s
executives had previously said they didn&#8217;t know how much of
earnings were from the instruments. The company&#8217;s estimate
applies to the period from 2006 to 2009, according to the FCIC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Response &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCIC is set to officially release its report today in Washington. The panel&#8217;s findings are outlined in a 545-page
book, a copy of which was book obtained by Bloomberg News. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Stephen Cohen, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to
comment. The company yesterday posted on its website a copy of
its response to the panel&#8217;s questions on derivatives, listing
the share of revenue generated through derivatives in different
types of trading. The figures are based on a &#8220;rough analysis of
our major businesses&#8221; from 2006 to 2009, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;To be clear, these percentages do not accurately reflect
the percentage of aggregate firm-wide revenues from derivative
transactions, since each individual business is a mix of
derivative and non-derivative activity,&#8221; the firm wrote to the
FCIC. The estimates were &#8220;prepared solely for the purposes of
your request, and we would not (and do not) use this information
in the management of our businesses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is a table of the trading figures included in
the firm&#8217;s response to the FCIC. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. unit refused
to give mortgage trust investors more than 500,000 loan files
that would show them how many of the loans are bad and must be
repurchased, a trustee said in a court filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unit of Deutsche Bank AG said it has a right to the files
as trustee for the investors. The investors own 99 mortgage-
backed-securities trusts that were built on loans made by
Washington Mutual Bank before it was seized by regulators and
sold to JPMorgan in 2008 for $1.9 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These access rights are unqualified and have been
unequivocally breached by JPMC,&#8221; Deutsche Bank said in court
papers filed in federal court in Washington on Jan. 14. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mortgage-bond investors and bond insurers have accused loan
sellers like WaMu and JPMorgan or bond underwriters of often
misrepresenting the quality of the underlying debt. Those
misrepresentations can trigger contractual or legal provisions
requiring repurchases, investors claim. So-called mortgage
putbacks may cost banks and lenders as much as $90 billion,
JPMorgan bond analysts said in October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas A. Kelly, a JPMorgan spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost Value &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank National Trust Co.&#8217;s suit on behalf of
investors against New York-based JPMorgan and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. claims the trusts have lost $6 billion
to $10 billion in value. WaMu expected some of the loans it put
in the trusts to go bad, according to a U.S. Senate
investigation cited by Deutsche Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and the FDIC have asked a judge to throw out the
case. The Deutsche Bank filing is the trustee&#8217;s response to the
motion to dismiss the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outcome of the case could affect Washington Mutual Bank
noteholders, who have filed claims in the receivership case
being overseen by the FDIC, Kevin Starke, senior vice president
with CRT Capital Group LLC said in an interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should Deutsche Bank win the case on behalf of the trusts,
it would either have a claim against JPMorgan or the FDIC,
depending on how the judge rules, Starke said. That claim would
compete with other creditors of Washington Mutual Bank. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EMC Mortgage &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan&#8217;s EMC Mortgage said this week that it plans to
turn over documents detailing the quality of loans in a mortgage
trust managed by San Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. in an
attempt to resolve a lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo sued seeking access to files for more than
2,000 underlying mortgages in the Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding
Trust 2007-AR2. The complaint, filed in Delaware Chancery Court,
accused EMC of playing &#8220;rope a dope&#8221; and dragging its feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Deutsche Bank National Trust Co. v. Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., 09-01656, U.S. District Court, District
of Columbia (Washington). &lt;/p&gt;

</body></entry><entry author="By Dina Bass" date="Jan 26, 2011  2:57 PM ET" url="http://bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-26/microsoft-says-it-shipped-2-million-windows-phones-last-quarter.html"><headline>Microsoft Shipped 2 Million Windows Phone 7 Units</headline><body>
&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. said it shipped more
than 2 million copies of the Windows Phone 7 operating system
last quarter, as the company tried to reverse sliding smartphone
market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Customer satisfaction for the product is at 93 percent and
brand awareness has jumped 22 points to 66 percent since it was
released, Greg Sullivan, a senior product manager at Microsoft,
said in an interview, citing internal measures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world&#8217;s largest software maker, aims to stem
market-share declines to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and handsets based
on Google Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system. Apple sold 16.2
million iPhones in its most recent quarter, which ended Dec. 25.
For now, Microsoft is measuring success more in terms of
customer feedback than raw sales figures, said Sullivan, who
predicted sales will accelerate. He declined to give a forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Sales are an important measure, but for a new platform we
think customer satisfaction and active developer support are
more important indicators of how sales will be over the long
term,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are now 6,500 applications for Windows Phone and
24,000 developers have signed up to build them, Sullivan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shipment figure isn&#8217;t all that rosy, said Kevin Burden,
an analyst at ABI Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The number shows there&#8217;s a lot of competition in this
space and Windows Phone 7 is having a hard time being heard over
the crowd,&#8221; said Burden, who is based in Hopkinton, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market Share &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s share of the smartphone operating-system market
declined to 2.8 percent in the third quarter, from 7.9 percent a
year earlier, according to Gartner Inc. Android&#8217;s share
increased to 25.5 percent from 3.5 percent, while Apple&#8217;s iOS
share declined to 16.7 percent from 17.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phones with the new Microsoft software went on sale Oct. 21
in Europe and Nov. 8 in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to ship an update to the software in the
next few months that adds features such as cut and paste and the
ability to work with the CDMA technology used by Verizon
Wireless and Sprint Nextel Corp., Sullivan said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft rose 44 cents to $28.89 as of 2:26 p.m. New York
time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. The shares fell 8.4 percent
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company will throw a lot more resources at its mobile
efforts and can leverage exclusive features like connectivity to
its Xbox online gaming service, Burden said. Still, Microsoft
needs to show steady progress soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Can they build on this number? Yeah,&#8221; Burden said. &#8220;But
they need to show an uptick in the first quarter and an uptick
on top of that in the second quarter. They have the ability to
do some smart things with Windows Phone 7, but as always it
comes down to execution.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s EMC Mortgage
said it plans to turn over documents detailing the quality of
loans in a mortgage trust managed by Wells Fargo  Co. in an
attempt to resolve a lawsuit, according to court papers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo sued last week seeking access to files for more
than 2,000 underlying mortgages in the Bear Stearns Mortgage
Funding Trust 2007-AR2. The complaint, filed in Delaware
Chancery Court, accused EMC of playing &#8220;rope a dope&#8221; and
dragging its feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Despite Wells&#8217; unreasonable demands, EMC intends to make
the requisite materials pertaining to 400 loans available to
Wells today,&#8221; Daniel Rath, an attorney for EMC, wrote in a
letter yesterday to Daniel Ward, an attorney for Wells Fargo.
The letter was filed with the court and made public today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christine Holevas, a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo said in its complaint that it needs access to
the documents to answer questions raised by investors about
whether EMC breached representations and warranties regarding
the quality of option-adjustable rate mortgage loans the trust
bought. Claims of wrongdoing by banks and loan servicers
triggered a 50-state investigation last year into whether
hundreds of thousands of foreclosures were properly documented
as the housing market collapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors Against Banks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lending practices have also pitted mortgage-bond investors
against banks over misrepresentations such as overstatements of
borrowers&#8217; income and inflated appraisals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rath said in his letter that EMC had committed to making
the documents available to San Francisco-based Wells Fargo and
was in the process of reviewing a confidentiality letter when
the trustee filed suit. EMC, in its capacity as servicer for the
trust, is under no obligation to &#8220;acquire, maintain, or produce
any underwriting guidelines,&#8221; Rath said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Accordingly, while we remain willing to discuss a
cooperative way forward, we first need to understand Wells&#8217;
contractual basis for its request for underwriting guidelines,&#8221;
Rath said in the letter. He asked Wells to &#8220;reconsider&#8221; the
litigation given EMC&#8217;s commitment to work cooperatively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Bear Stearns Mortgage Funding Trust 2007-AR2 by
Wells Fargo Bank NA as Trustee v. EMC Mortgage Corp., CA6132,
Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; BP Plc, Morgan Stanley and Chevron
Corp. were among six biofuels suppliers to miss all three of the
U.K. government&#8217;s voluntary sustainability targets last year,
the Renewable Fuels Agency said today in an e-mailed report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three other companies to miss the goals on greenhouse-
gas cuts, sustainable sourcing of feedstock for the biofuels and
data reporting were Ineos Group Holdings Plc, Murco Petroleum
Ltd. and Total SA, according to the report. Prax Petroleum Ltd.
didn&#8217;t supply a verified annual report, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.K. is increasing the use of biofuels from crops to
replace petroleum and reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. At the
same time, European nations are trying to allay concerns about
deforestation and emissions associated with growing the crops by
introducing standards that may be implemented in the U.K. this
year, according to today&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Companies currently missing all three targets need to
make a step change in performance,&#8221; Renewable Fuels Agency
Chief Executive Officer Nick Goodall said in the statement.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen some progress from suppliers in meeting the
challenge of sourcing their biofuels responsibly but in many
cases it has been disappointingly slow.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 1.57 billion liters (414 million gallons) of biofuels
were supplied in the year through mid-April 2010, taking up 3.33
percent of road transport fuels and beating the 3.25-percent
government target, the agency said. That goal is rising up to 5
percent by 2013 as the U.K. seeks to source 15 percent of
energy, including heat and electricity, from renewables by 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenergy Fuels Ltd., Lissan Coal Co., Mabanaft U.K. Ltd.
and Topaz Energy Ltd. all met the three sustainability targets,
according to today&#8217;s report. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish stocks rose on the outlook
for banks after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. upgraded Turkiye Halk
Bankasi AS to &#8220;buy&#8221; from &#8220;neutral&#8221; and said lending in the
industry will continue rising even after the central bank took
steps to slow growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main ISE National 100 Index rose 0.9 percent to
65,709.52 at 12:19 p.m. in Istanbul. The banking index climbed
1.5 percent to 135,952. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Turkish banks will continue to be in a comfortable
position to expand credit supply in the medium term, despite
recent measures adopted by the central bank intended to moderate
loan growth,&#8221; Goldman analysts includingWilliam Mejia in Dubai
said in an e-mailed report today. Current valuations
&#8220;accurately reflect revised profitability and earnings growth
forecasts for most banks,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banking index has declined 3.7 percent since Dec. 17,
when the central bank started increasing banks reserve
requirements to avert a credit bubble. The ISE climbed 1.9
percent in the period. The central bank raised the reserve
ratios again two days ago. The measures mean loan growth is
expected to slow to between 20 percent and 25 percent this year,
central bank governor Durmus Yilmaz said yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halkbank, in which the government owns a 75 percent stake,
advanced 40 kurus, or 3.3 percent, to 12.5 liras, rising for the
second day. Goldman said it saw &#8220;significant value&#8221; in
Halkbank, increasing its price estimate to 18 liras from 16.44
liras. Yapi  Kredi Bankasi AS, part-owned by UniCredit SpA,
gained 6 kurus, or 1.3 percent, to 4.70 liras. Goldman increased
Yapi Kredi&#8217;s price estimate to 5.06 liras from 4.88 liras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The banks are recovering under Halkbank&#8217;s leadership,&#8221;
Ata Doganoglu, a trader at Ekspres Invest in Istanbul, said in
e-mailed comments today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yields on benchmark two-year bonds rose 7 basis points to
7.66 percent, reversing two days of declines. The lira fell 0.4
percent to 1.5751 per dollar. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eric Grubman&#8217;s style of football
won&#8217;t be on ESPN&#8217;s SportsCenter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a November day at the National Football League&#8217;s
Manhattan offices, Grubman -- a former Goldman Sachs Group
investment banker who is the NFL&#8217;s executive vice president of
business operations -- shuttles between meetings about foreign
television deals, overseas games and stadium improvements. Along
the way he&#8217;s often looking out for the customer. He wants
universal Wi-Fi access at the stadiums. He&#8217;s also in favor of
in-stadium broadcasts of the footage game officials use to
review challenged plays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grubman, however, may soon become the bane of football
fans, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its Jan. 31 issue. As
the league&#8217;s top money man, reporting directly to Commissioner
Roger Goodell, he&#8217;s at the center of a labor dispute that could
make the Super Bowl between the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh
Steelers the last NFL game for a long time. While the Feb.&#160;6
matchup is the biggest date on the football calendar, players
and team owners have their eyes fixed on March&#160;3. That&#8217;s when
their collective bargaining agreement expires. Until a new one
is in place, there likely won&#8217;t be any more games, raising the
prospect of a lost 2011-2012 season. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. options traders made
the most bullish bets in four years before the world&#8217;s largest
software maker released earnings today. The shares rose 0.3
percent following the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ratio of outstanding calls to buy the stock versus puts
to sell jumped 31 percent this week and reached 2.1 yesterday,
the highest since July 2006, after investors allowed bearish
positions to expire instead of renewing them using contracts
with longer maturities. The number of outstanding puts has
fallen 49 percent from last week to 902,650 contracts and calls
decreased 33 percent to 1.77 million for the biggest drops since
January 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty one-sided boat, and everyone&#8217;s in the bull
side,&#8221; said Jay Shartsis, director of options trading at R.F.
Lafferty  Co. in New York. &#8220;It&#8217;s the coming earnings, it&#8217;s the
general trend of the market, and Microsoft has been moving up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which has beaten profit estimates eight straight
quarters, beat estimates as corporate customers bought more
Office and server programs and consumers purchased Xbox Kinect
motion sensors. Net income rose to 77 cents a share, Peter
Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft,
said today. That compares with 68 cents, the average of
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. The shares rose to $28.87 at 4
p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has risen 21 percent while the Standard  Poor&#8217;s
500 Index has surged 24 percent since Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said in August that he was prepared to take
action to boost the economy. The company trades for 12.3 times
earnings from the past year, 22 percent less than the SP 500,
the benchmark measure of U.S. shares. During the past 10 years,
Microsoft has on average had a price-earnings multiple 15
percent higher than the Samp;P 500&#8217;s, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biggest Increase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest open interest increase among all options of
Microsoft since last week is a weekly option giving the right to
buy the shares at $29 before the contract expires Jan. 28,
according to data from Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based
provider of options-market analytics. The call&#8217;s open interest
has risen to 11,082 since it began trading on U.S. exchanges
Jan. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s total open interest has dropped 39 percent
after last week&#8217;s expiration to 2.67 million contracts
yesterday, about the same as the 38 percent decline for all
exchange-traded U.S. options, according to Jim Binder, a
spokesman for Chicago-based Options Clearing Corp., which
settles all trading of exchange-listed contracts. Microsoft&#8217;s
2010 options volume of 37 million contracts accounted for 1
percent of all U.S. trades and ranked sixth among all companies,
according to the OCC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implied Volatility &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Investors are paying less for options to protect against a
decline in the shares. Implied volatility, the key gauge of
option prices, for at-the-money options expiring in 30 days has
fallen to 25.12 from last year&#8217;s peak of 38.52 in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calls give the right to buy 100 shares of a security for a
certain amount, the strike price, by a set date. Puts convey the
right to sell. Investors use options to guard against
fluctuations in the price of securities they own, speculate on
share-price moves or bet that volatility, or stock swings, will
rise or fall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. trader accused by U.S. regulators of misleading
investors in a product linked to subprime mortgages, asked a
judge to halt pretrial interviews scheduled to begin on Feb. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre can&#8217;t &#8220;effectively participate&#8221; in the depositions
until he gets documents from Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, a &#8220;purported &#8216;victim&#8217; of the alleged
fraud,&#8221; his lawyer said today in a court filing. Tourre also is
awaiting other material and must review about 300,000 documents
he already received, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Mr. Tourre is compelled to proceed with depositions
beginning on Feb. 1, 2011, it will be without the benefit of
anything like adequate document discovery,&#8221; Pamela Chepiga,
Tourre&#8217;s lawyer, wrote in the filing in federal court in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs and Tourre on April 16, accusing them of failing to tell
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick underlying
securities for a collateralized debt obligation and planned to
bet against them. The SEC reached a $550 million settlement with
New York-based Goldman Sachs in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Harmon, a spokeswoman for the SEC, declined to
comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dismissal Request &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre is awaiting a judge&#8217;s ruling on his request to
dismiss the lawsuit on grounds that the transactions involving
the collateralized debt obligations called Abacus 2007-AC1
occurred outside the U.S. Tourre can&#8217;t be held liable under U.S.
securities law, his lawyers have argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC opposes the request, saying in court papers that
&#8220;unlawful securities transactions&#8221; occurred in the U.S. Tourre
worked at the Goldman Sachs &#8220;headquarters in New York during
the relevant period&#8221; and did business in New York, the agency
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court filing provides a window into the course of the
litigation. Tourre&#8217;s lawyers have hired 25 attorneys to review
1 million documents with about 10.5 million pages. Attorneys for
the SEC say they plan to depose about 25 witnesses, including
representatives of Goldman Sachs and IKB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. received
$2.9 billion for its own account as a taxpayer bailout enabled American International Group Inc. to make good on credit-default
swaps linked to mortgages, a congressionally appointed panel
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The money was included in about $3.4 billion in swap-
related payments, most of which AIG made following the
government&#8217;s bailout, the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission
wrote in a book outlining its findings. That was in addition to
about $14 billion that Goldman Sachs collected from AIG and
passed to other counterparties, according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $2.9 billion &#8220;was for proprietary trades (that is,
trades made solely for Goldman&#8217;s benefit rather than on behalf
of a client),&#8221; the panel wrote. The payout was &#8220;largely
relating&#8221; to collateralized debt obligations known as Abacus, a
series of mortgage-linked investments the firm helped create,
the FCIC said, without specifying the relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, the most profitable firm in Wall Street
history, acted as a &#8220;market intermediary&#8221; and bought
protection from AIG to hedge transactions with clients, Chief
Financial Officer David Viniar told reporters on a conference
call in 2009. The trades at issue in the FCIC&#8217;s report were
hedged, and most of the payments were used to cover offsetting
bets, a person with direct knowledge of them said, declining to
be identified because the transactions weren&#8217;t public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FCIC, which set out to determine the causes of the
financial crisis, released its report today in Washington,
simultaneously publishing a 545-page book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contracts Retired &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment on the panel&#8217;s findings. Chief
Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein told a Congressional
panel last year that the firm lost about $1.2 billion from
residential mortgage transactions in 2007 and 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $3.4 billion in AIG guarantees weren&#8217;t included in a
government bailout of the New York-based insurer that retired
$62.1 billion in contracts by fully reimbursing banks, including
Goldman Sachs and Societe Generale SA, through Federal Reserve
vehicles called Maiden Lane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AIG extinguished the additional swaps, which guaranteed
Abacus CDOs, in 2009, taking writedowns of $1.5 billion to $2
billion, a person with knowledge of the matter said last April.
AIG originally had about $6 billion in Goldman Sachs trades that
weren&#8217;t covered by the rescue, that person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Herr, an AIG spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs agreed last year to pay $550 million to
settle a Securities and Exchange Commission fraud lawsuit
alleging that it misled investors by underwriting and marketing
a mortgage-related security called Abacus 2007-AC1 without
disclosing to clients that a hedge-fund customer, Paulson  Co.,
was involved in creating it and planned to bet against it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Jamie Dimon, the chief executive officer of JPMorgan Chase 
Co., sparred over financial regulation today in Davos, after the
U.S. bank chief said he was concerned "bad policies" could
impede economic recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dimon, who oversees the second-biggest U.S. lender by
assets, said at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland that the
Group of 20 nations should focus on jobs and growth. Regulators
must avoid implementing policies "out of anger," he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Don&#8217;t be accusatory of us,&#8221; replied Sarkozy, the
chairman of the G-20 and G-8 nations this year. &#8220;We will be
reasonable, but we will be wise." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;France passed a law last year to increase the power of
supervisors over bank bonuses and rating companies. In a letter
last June, Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called
for permanent surveillance of pay, saying the Financial
Stability Board &#8216;&#8216;should establish directives to be put in place
by national supervisors and establish a permanent mechanism to
follow big financial institutions.&#8217;&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the U.S., the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission was
set to publish a report today that blamed &#8216;&#8216;weak&#8217;&#8217; federal
regulators and &#8216;&#8216;reckless&#8217;&#8217; Wall Street firms for contributing
to the economic collapse. The watchdogs found many banks were
deficient in curtailing risk-taking that fueled the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global energy demand will climb 35
percent by 2030 from 2005 levels amid rapid economic growth and
an improvement in living standards in developing nations, an Exxon Mobil Corp. forecast shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consumption of natural gas will surpass use of coal as the
second-largest global energy source after oil, according to the
company&#8217;s Outlook for Energy: A View to 2030, used to guide its
investment decisions. Worldwide electricity consumption will
rise more than 80 percent during the period, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimate by the world&#8217;s largest publicly traded oil
company is in line with a November forecast by the International
Energy Agency, the Paris-based adviser to 28 nations. The IEA
said energy demand will grow 36 percent from 2008 to 2035, with
93 percent of the gain coming from nations outside the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outlook &#8220;clearly points to a growing demand for energy
globally,&#8221; Exxon Mobil Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
said in a statement. &#8220;The forecasts also show a shift toward
natural gas as businesses and governments look for reliable,
affordable and cleaner ways to meet energy needs.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-OECD countries will see overall demand grow by 70
percent in the 25 years to 2030, while improvements in energy
efficiency will keep consumption flat in the industrialized
nations, according to the Exxon Mobil report, which is issued
annually. The IEA said that Chinese demand alone will rise 75
percent by 2035 compared with 2005 levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-OECD demand for power will more than double as more
people gain access to electricity, Exxon Mobil said. Demand for
natural gas for power generation will jump around the world and
increase sixfold in China, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy Efficiency &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global growth in energy consumption would be even higher
without the projections that efficiency will improve, according
to the Exxon Mobil report, which analyzes energy-use patterns in
100 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas-based company &#8220;will continue to invest
in technology and innovation to develop new economic energy
supplies to help meet this demand while looking for ways to
reduce environmental impacts,&#8221; Tillerson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; BP Plc forecast last week that global energy use will rise
by almost 40 percent by 2030, led by demand from China, India,
Russia, Brazil and other emerging economies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS-Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, said in September that global energy demand will
climb 30 percent to 40 percent from 2010 to 2030, spurred by
rising incomes in emerging markets and global economic growth.
Yergin is the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of &#8220;The Prize,&#8221; a
history of the oil industry. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s benchmark stock index fell
for a second day after central bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
increased interest rates for the seventh time since March and
boosted his inflation forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahindra  Mahindra Ltd. (MM), the nation&#8217;s largest maker of
sport-utility vehicles and tractors, sank the most since
November after its rating was lowered at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) fell to a four-month low. Food inflation
held above 15 percent for a fourth week, a report showed today.
That may have &#8220;spillover effects&#8221; and stoke broader price
increases, the central bank said Jan. 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s room for further hikes in the future and this is
likely to keep the market on tenterhook,&#8221; said Sanjay Sinha,
chief executive officer at LT Mutual Fund, the fund management
unit of the nation&#8217;s biggest engineering company with $702
million in assets. &#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to make a call if the
earnings projections for the next fiscal year will remain
intact.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bombay Stock Exchange&#8217;s Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
declined 285.02, or 1.5 percent, to 18,684.43 at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The index dropped below its 200-day moving
average of 18,720.6 for the first time since May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gauge, the world&#8217;s worst performer this year after
Egypt and Tunisia, is at its lowest level since September after
dropping 11 percent from a Nov. 5 record, exceeding the 10
percent slump that signifies a so-called correction to some
investors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Mahindra, DLF &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies on the measure are valued at an average 17.7
times estimated earnings, down from last year&#8217;s high of 21.5
times in March, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SP CNX Nifty (NIFTY) Index on the National Stock Exchange lost
1.5 percent to 5,604.30. The BSE 200 Index (BSE200) decreased 1.6 percent
to 2,316.06. Markets were shut yesterday for the Republic Day
holiday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahindra sank 4.9 percent to 733.55 rupees. DLF Ltd. (DLFU), the
nation&#8217;s biggest developer, slid 5.7 percent to 239.45 rupees,
extending this year&#8217;s decline to 18 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindustan Unilever, the biggest household products maker,
retreated 4 percent to 270.7 rupees, extending its 5.4 percent
drop on Jan. 25 after reporting a third-quarter profit decline
because of higher raw material prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reserve Bank of India on Jan. 25 raised its benchmark
wholesale-price inflation forecast to 7 percent by March 31,
more than its earlier prediction of 5.5 percent, after food
costs soared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Finance Minister &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central bank Governor Subbarao on Jan. 25 urged the
government to cut subsidies, building pressure on Finance
Minister Pranab Mukherjee to cut the deficit in next month&#8217;s
budget for the financial year starting April 1. The minister is
aiming to narrow the budget deficit to 5.5 percent of gross
domestic product in the current year ending March 31. That
compares with a shortfall of 2.6 percent of GDP in the year
ended March 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The government is groping for the right solution to
control inflation,&#8221; said Avinash Gupta, an analyst at Bonanza
Portfolio Ltd., a New Delhi-based brokerage. &#8220;The tenor of the
central bank shows that it can&#8217;t do much to control it. All eyes
are on the budget now.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JSW Steel Ltd., the third-biggest producer, sank 5.1
percent to 963.05 rupees after it reported a worse-than-expected
32 percent drop in third-quarter profit as demand for
automobile-grade sheets failed to counter increasing raw
material costs. The average estimate of 12 analysts in a
Bloomberg poll was for a 7 percent decline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Asia&#8217;s Worst &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd., the biggest copper
producer, sank 5.4 percent to 169.4 rupees after a panel ruled
on Jan. 25 that the government has no obligation to sell its 49
percent stake in Bharat Aluminium Co. to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT), the largest truckmaker, added 2.6 percent
to 1,195.85 rupees after Anil Kapur, head of sales for light
commercial vehicles, on Jan. 25 forecast 275,000 light
commercial-vehicles sales in the year ending March 31. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India&#8217;s (SENSEX) index, Asia&#8217;s worst performer this year, may drop a
further 15 percent within four months as rising costs trim
earnings and prompt higher interest rates, Birla Sun Life
Insurance Co.&#8217;s Vikram Kotak, who predicted 2010&#8217;s rally, said
in a Jan. 25 interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kotak, 40, who oversees $4.2 billion as Birla Sun&#8217;s chief
investment officer, has increased the portion in cash to almost
15 percent and is &#8220;in no mood to deploy it,&#8221; he said. In May,
he said cash accounted for about 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Either your market comes down to such a level that people
don&#8217;t worry about inflation and interest rates, or you solve
these problems,&#8221; Kotak said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have any reason why
markets should go up.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global funds bought a net 1.95 billion rupees ($42.8
million) of Indian equities on Jan. 24, according to data on the
website of the Securities and Exchange Board of India. Overseas
investors have sold $892 million more shares than they have
bought so far in January, heading for the first monthly outflow
since May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc., the world&#8217;s largest
drugmaker, was ordered to pay a total of $142.1 million in
damages for violating U.S. racketeering laws in the marketing of
its epilepsy drug Neurontin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Patti Saris in Boston yesterday upheld
a jury&#8217;s finding that Kaiser Foundation Health Plan Inc. and
Kaiser Foundation Hospitals deserved the award over the
companies&#8217; claims that Pfizer illegally promoted Neurontin for
unapproved uses. Saris tripled the jury&#8217;s award of $47.3 million
under a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act of 1970. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The damages awarded to the plaintiffs by the jury under
RICO are trebled,&#8221; the judge said in her one-page order. Saris
also denied Kaiser&#8217;s request for an estimated $76 million in
interest on the award. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaiser officials alleged they were duped into believing
that migraines and bipolar disorder could be treated effectively
with Neurontin, approved in 1993 by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for epilepsy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris Loder, a Pfizer spokesman, said the company was
pleased with Saris&#8217; decision to deny Kaiser&#8217;s bid for pre-
judgment interest on the award. &#8220;As we maintained all along,
Pfizer has strong defenses in this case and intends to appeal,&#8221;
he said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and JPMorgan Chase amp; Co. asked a judge to let them keep secret the
documents they subpoenaed from bankruptcy examiner Anton Valukas in their fight over billions of dollars in loans and
collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman is seeking $8.6 billion in collateral plus tens of
billions in damages from the second-biggest U.S. bank, its
former lender. JPMorgan sued Lehman back, claiming the firm
saddled it with &#8220;toxic securities.&#8221; The Valukas report said
Lehman might have grounds for suing JPMorgan, and that the bank
might have a defense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The litigants originally asked Valukas for so much material
he would have had to deliver more than six million documents,
said Robert Byman, a partner of Valukas. The examiner agreed to
supply a smaller number of documents, Byman said in a phone
interview today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to accommodate the parties in their desire
to move the litigation forward, and we&#8217;re trying to do it at
cheaply and efficiently as possible,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James M. Peck said in July that any
documents produced from the Valukas database must be &#8220;on a
publicly available platform,&#8221; according to a Jan. 21 court
filing. Byman said the ruling assumed Valukas would transfer the
database to a third party. That hasn&#8217;t happened yet, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bankruptcy case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York
(Manhattan). The adversary case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, 10-03266, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp. almost doubled its incentive payout to Chief Executive
Officer Samuel Palmisano last year, as the company exceeded its
four-year earnings goals and the shares rose to a record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano, 59, who&#8217;s led the company for eight years,
received $9 million in incentives last year, the company said in
a regulatory filing today. That compares with $4.75 million a
year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM had full-year profit of $11.52 a share last year,
beating its goal of at least $10 set four years ago, helped by
the company&#8217;s expansion in software and services. Palmisano&#8217;s
salary and target incentive this year will remain at $1.8
million and $5 million, respectively, unchanged since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mike Daniels, who heads the company&#8217;s services business,
received a raise of $160,000 to $825,000 this year, and Ginni Rometty, in charge of sales, got an increase of $170,000 to
$800,000. The raises give them the second- and third-highest
salaries at the company, surpassing finance chief Mark Loughridge and software head Steve Mills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shares of IBM fell $1.86 to $159.21 at 4 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares climbed 12 percent
last year, and rose to a record in October. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp., the second-largest
U.S. energy company, fell the most in two months after reporting
fourth-quarter sales and refining profits that failed to meet
analysts&#8217; estimates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company fell $1.38, or 1.5 percent, to $93.37 at 4 p.m.
in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Net income
rose to a record for the quarter of $5.3 billion, or $2.64 a
share, from $3.07 billion, or $1.53, a year earlier, San Ramon,
California-based Chevron said in a statement today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron had $54 billion in sales during the last three
months of 2010, $4.8 billion less than analysts&#8217; estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. The company&#8217;s U.S. refineries performed
&#8220;worse than expected,&#8221; contributing less to the overall bottom
line than anticipated, said Paul Cheng, a New York-based
Barclays Plc analyst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The revenue shortfall is disappointing,&#8221; said Robbert Van Batenburg, head of research at Louis Capital Markets LP in
New York. &#8220;In their U.S. downstream business they also came up
short.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron found enough new fields last year to replace less
than a fourth of the oil and gas it pumped, the lowest reserve-
replacement ratio in at least eight years for the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher crude prices triggered contract provisions in some
nations that reduced the amount of untapped oil Chevron is
allowed to claim for itself under production-sharing agreements,
Chief Executive Officer John S. Watson said today during a
conference call with analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Hurdle Rate&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There&#8217;s disappointment with the reserve-replacement
figure,&#8221; Lysle Brinker, director of research for integrated oil
companies at IHS Inc., said in a telephone interview from Cape
Elizabeth, Maine. &#8220;It falls short of the 100 percent hurdle
rate you like to see.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watson, 54, increased 2010 production to the equivalent of
2.76 million barrels a day, the highest in company history, and
last month announced plans to spend more than $71 million a day
in 2011 to discover and tap oil and natural-gas prospects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron expects full-year oil and gas output to rise 1
percent this year to the equivalent of 2.79 million barrels,
Watson said during the call. The production target is predicated
on an average oil price of $79 a barrel, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Profit in Chevron&#8217;s worldwide oil- and gas-production
business jumped 16 percent to $4.85 billion from a year earlier,
the company said. U.S. earnings from the unit fell 13 percent to
$930 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining Profit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding a $400 million gain from the sale of a stake in
Colonial Pipeline Co., Chevron&#8217;s U.S. refining unit earned $75
million. Barclay&#8217;s Cheng was expecting the division to generate
$277 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimated Chevron would earn $2.40 a share,
excluding one-time gains and losses, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil futures traded in New York averaged $85.24 a barrel in
the fourth quarter, a 12 percent increase from a year earlier.
Global crude demand is expected to swell this year by 1.4
million barrels a day, or 1.6 percent, the Paris-based International Energy Agency said in a Jan. 18 report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron rose 29 percent in the year ended yesterday,
outperforming bigger rivals Exxon Mobil Corp., PetroChina Co., Petroleo Brasileiro SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc. The stock has
18 buy and seven hold ratings from analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the fourth quarter, Watson revived purchases of
Chevron stock after a two-year hiatus and announced plans to
spend $11.5 billion to begin pumping crude from deep-water
fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The company also agreed to buy
U.S. gas producer Atlas Energy Inc. for $3.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil Demand &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global demand for crude may reach a record 89.4 million
barrels a day this year as prices increase 19 percent to an
average of $95 a barrel, a team of analysts at JPMorgan Chase amp;
Co. led by Lawrence Eagles wrote in a note yesterday to clients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron intends to give final investment approvals to 15
additional ventures by 2012 with price tags of at least $1
billion each, Watson said in a November presentation to
analysts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, the world&#8217;s largest oil company by market
value, is scheduled to announce fourth-quarter results on Jan.
31. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there&#8217;s one thing the chief
executive officers of beverage makers PepsiCo Inc. and Coca-Cola
Co. can agree on, it is the enduring appeal of former U.S.
President Bill Clinton. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is a common sentiment among business leaders in the
corridors of the World Economic Forum&#8217;s annual meeting in the
Swiss ski resort of Davos, which Clinton addressed yesterday
just as he first did in office 11 years ago and on several
occasions since departing office in 2001. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;When you sit down at the feet of Bill Clinton, he&#8217;s the
one stop on all the issues,&#8221; Indra Nooyi CEO of PepsiCo, the
world&#8217;s second-largest soft-drinks maker, told Bloomberg
Television in Davos today. Coca-Cola counterpart, Muhtar Kent,
last night praised the former president&#8217;s record on green energy
and aiding Africa as he introduced him to guests at a private
cocktail reception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2,500 participants at Davos may not be alone in being
inspired by Clinton, 64. More than 4,000 miles away in Washington, President Barack Obama has responded to the
Democrats&#8217; recent loss of the House of Representatives by hiring
or promoting former Clinton aides and making calls for
bipartisanship just as Clinton did after a similar defeat in
1994. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Strong Economic Management&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It appears the administration is learning of the value of
moving to the center,&#8221; said Charles Dallara, managing director
of the Washington-based Institute of International Finance and a
Davos attendee. &#8220;There is a respect and even affection for
President Clinton because he&#8217;s so global in his perspective and
is remembered for an era of strong economic management.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an hour-long discussion yesterday with WEF founder Klaus Schwab, Clinton sat in a blue suit and red tie offering up
opinions on the current affairs of every continent. He called
for faster rebuilding of Haiti after last year&#8217;s earthquake and
said protests in North Africa reflect a desire among youth to
become &#8220;part of a modern day that works.&#8221; He warned that
domestic politics in Israel is interfering with its ability to
make a peace deal with Palestinians and called Europe&#8217;s
sovereign-debt crisis &#8220;quite serious.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He drew laughter when he said his wife, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, wants to be a grandmother more than she ever
wanted the presidency. &#8220;I would like to have a happy wife, and
she won&#8217;t be unless she&#8217;s a grandmother,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
something she wants more than she wanted to be president.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;A Hero&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the session, Carol Realini, executive chairwoman of
Obopay Inc., a Redwood, California-based company that enables
money transfers through mobile handsets, said she &#8220;pushed&#8221;
through the crowd to introduce herself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;There are a ton of really important people here, but
Clinton is impressive,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He&#8217;s a hero.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinton has rehabilitated his image following his departure
from office, when his record was tarnished by impeachment and a
scandal over his pardoning financier Marc Rich. He established
the Clinton Global Initiative, a WEF-like effort aimed at
finding solutions to global issues, in 2005 and united with
President George H.W. Bush to raise funds for the victims of the
2004 Asian tsunami. He also joined President George W. Bush to
help those hurt by the Haiti earthquake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;You&#8217;ve given a new significance to the word retirement,&#8221;
Schwab told Clinton in introductory remarks yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Gallup opinion poll last July showed that 61 percent of
respondents had a favorable opinion of him, higher than Obama&#8217;s
rating. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex Issues &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;People admire the way he can take complex issues and
break them down for a global audience,&#8221; Barclays Plc CEO Robert Diamond said in an interview today, two days after hosting a
dinner for clients in Davos at which Clinton spoke. &#8220;People
want to hear what he has to say.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obama may be listening too. This month he appointed William Daley, Clinton&#8217;s commerce secretary, his chief of staff and
named Gene Sperling as the director of his National Economic
Council, a position Sperling held under Clinton. Also in Obama&#8217;s
economic team are Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and
budget director Jack Lew, both former Clinton administration
officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his State of the Union address three days ago, Obama
also echoed Clinton in seeking a &#8220;new era of cooperation.&#8221; And
just as Clinton won plaudits for his response to the 1995
bombing in Oklahoma City, Obama was praised for his Jan. 12
speech at a memorial service for victims of the Jan. 8 shooting
in Tucson, Arizona. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Nouriel Roubini, another former Clinton administration
official and a frequent WEF participant, also drew parallels
between Obama and the White House&#8217;s previous Democrat incumbent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;He&#8217;s Clinton in 1994,&#8221; said Roubini, a professor of
economics at New York University and chairman of New York-based
Roubini Global Economics LLC. &#8220;Obama has taken a lesson from
there.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa SA, the world&#8217;s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, is in talks to combine Spain&#8217;s La Sexta television network with another company to
boost its competitiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The idea is to create a more solid investment, forming
part of a bigger group that can compete efficiently,&#8221; Mexico
City-based Televisa said in a statement. &#8220;Nothing has been
decided. We&#8217;ll keep analyzing the different options we have.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A merger would give Televisa a way to extract itself from
La Sexta, in which it holds a 40.5 percent stake, Gregorio Tomassi, an analyst at Banco Santander SA in Mexico City, said
today in a research note. Televisa has invested $365 million
over five years in the network, which began broadcasting in
2006, Tomassi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Televisa dropped 1.27 pesos, or 2.2 percent, to 56.27 pesos
as of 12:40 p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading. The
shares had gained 13 percent in the 12 months through yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Santander, La Sexta had a net loss of 25
million euros ($34.3 million) last year on sales of 280 million
euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The eventual sale of Televisa&#8217;s minority stake in La
Sexta would be positive for Televisa,&#8221; Tomassi said. &#8220;Televisa
has little chance of capitalizing on its core strengths in this
investment, and the liquidity of the investment is limited.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;La Sexta isn&#8217;t holding conversations with anyone and has no
plans right now for a merger, an official with the broadcaster
said today. The company isn&#8217;t aware of any interest from
Televisa in selling the stake, said the official, who can&#8217;t be
named under company policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bid by Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. trader accused of misleading investors in a
product linked to subprime mortgages, to delay the start of
depositions in the lawsuit should be denied, regulators said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre yesterday asked a federal judge to postpone the Feb.
1 start of depositions in the lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission, partly because he is awaiting documents
from Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, a
&#8220;purported &#8216;victim&#8217; of the alleged fraud.&#8221; The SEC opposed
Tourre&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Tourre&#8217;s highly disruptive 11th-hour request for a stay
of depositions should be rejected,&#8221; the agency said yesterday
in a filing in federal court in Manhattan. &#8220;This action has
been pending for approximately nine months.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman Sachs and Tourre on April 16, accusing
them of failing to tell investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co.
helped pick underlying securities for a collateralized debt
obligation and planned to bet against them. The SEC reached a
$550 million settlement with New York-based Goldman Sachs in
July. Tourre denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp. shares failed to get
a lift from better-than-predicted second-quarter sales and
profit results yesterday after a shortfall in Windows revenue
raised concerns about future demand for the operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows revenue of $5.05 billion missed the $5.2 billion
average of analysts&#8217; estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That
differed from results showing Microsoft&#8217;s Office and Server
businesses exceeded projections, and the Xbox unit posted a 55
percent gain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contrast suggests that Microsoft may be losing sales as
customers opt for competing devices, such as Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPad
or Macintosh computers, rather than a new Windows-based machine,
said Tony Ursillo, an analyst at Loomis Sayles  Co. in Boston.
As rival operating systems gain ground, Microsoft&#8217;s other
products, such as Office, may also suffer, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The execution at this company has actually been pretty
good over the last year,&#8221; said Ursillo, whose firm manages $150
billion, including Microsoft shares. &#8220;The stock has gotten very
little credit for it because the market is worried about the
continued erosion of the Windows franchise and the potential
erosion of the Office franchise.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, fell 18 cents to
$28.69 at 9:35 a.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
The shares lost 8.4 percent in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did see a &#8220;small impact&#8221; from tablets and other
types of computing devices, though it was &#8220;not material,&#8221;
Chief Financial Officer Peter Klein said in an interview
yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tablet Strategy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple sold 7.33 million iPad tablet-style machines last
quarter, as well as 4.13 million Mac computers. Apple&#8217;s share of
U.S. PC shipments rose to 8.7 percent in the December quarter
from 7.2 percent a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those gains came at the expense of machines that run
Windows. To catch up in tablets, Microsoft said this month it
would make its next version of Windows run on ARM Holdings Plc&#8217;s
chip technology for the first time. The aim is to create
smaller, thinner Windows tablets with better battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Klein says the tablet market presents an opportunity rather
than a threat in the long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m more excited about the opportunity,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All
these new devices are market expansive for us.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excluding the impact of a $1.71 billion in deferred sales
recognized in the year-earlier quarter, Windows unit growth was
in line with growth overall in the PC market of 2.7 percent as
reported by Framingham, Massachusetts-based IDC. Still, some
analysts had projected more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To address mobile market-share losses to Apple and Google
Inc.&#8217;s Android operating system, Microsoft released its
overhauled software for mobile phones -- Windows Phone 7 --
during the quarter. The company said this week it shipped 2
million licenses to use the software in handsets, a number that
analyst Kevin Burden at ABI Research called disappointing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number was &#8220;in line&#8221; with what the company was
expecting, Microsoft&#8217;s Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a good start,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I recognize that it&#8217;s
early and we have a lot of work to do and we&#8217;re going to
continue to focus on that.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter unearned revenue, a measure of multiyear
contracts, was $13.4 billion, missing analysts&#8217; $14.1 billion
average estimate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results in Windows overshadowed signs that Microsoft is
benefiting from rising demand for gaming devices and products
aimed at businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Net income was $6.63 billion, or 77 cents a share, compared
with $6.66 billion, or 74 cents, a year earlier, Microsoft said
in a statement. Sales rose 4.9 percent to $20 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Way Behind&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results beat the average projections of 68-cents in
profit and $19.1 billion in sales, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft has been executing extremely well on the
business side,&#8221; Robert Breza, an analyst in Minneapolis for
with RBC Capital Markets, told Bloomberg Television. &#8220;As people
start to really focus on Microsoft and what they are doing in
cloud computing -- with their Azure platform -- also with their
new Office 365 program that sits in the cloud, hopefully that
will get the company a little bit more respect.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Xbox division, the company kept expenses down,
widening margins for a sixth straight quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For some, that doesn&#8217;t make up for Windows-related woe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Microsoft management has to be frustrated -- they&#8217;ve
executed well for five quarters in a row and have got little to
show for it in the stock price,&#8221; Ursillo said. &#8220;But they have
to take a look at themselves and realize they&#8217;re losing share in
their most profitable business and coming from way behind in the
efforts they needed to stem those losses.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. was
sued for an &#8220;abuse&#8221; of repurchase agreements that effectively
&#8220;looted&#8221; $450 million from a Bermuda reinsurance unit when the
assets were pledged to the unit&#8217;s biggest lender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lehman took the cash in 2008 when it was increasingly short
of funds, according to the complaint by Pulsar Re Ltd., which is
claiming the money from defunct Lehman Re in Bermuda. Lehman
saddled the unit with illiquid assets &#8220;worth far less than the
inflated market values assigned to them by Lehman personnel,&#8221;
Pulsar said in the complaint, filed Jan. 26 in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Lehman&#8217;s abuse of repurchase agreements throughout 2008
to create the false appearance of financial health was
rampant,&#8221; Pulsar said, citing a report on Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy
by examiner Anton Valukas. Under orders from former Chief
Executive Officer Richard Fuld, Lehman tried to disguise its
leverage by resorting to short term repos secured by
&#8220;inflated&#8221; or improperly valued collateral, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pulsar&#8217;s lawsuit is one of several that make use of the
Valukas report and other investigations into the largest
bankruptcy in U.S. history. Most of the lawsuits seek money from
former Lehman executives rather than bankrupt Lehman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; James Sprayregen, a lawyer for Pulsar at Kirkland  Ellis
LLP, said his client has been negotiating with Lehman over the
money as part of the liquidation of Lehman Re. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are still hopeful of resolving things consensually,&#8221;
Sprayregen said a phone interview yesterday. &#8220;Pulsar as
creditor is interested in a significant chunk of the cash in
Lehman Re that Lehman seized.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is Pulsar Re Ltd. v. Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc., 11-01283, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New
York (Manhattan). Lehman&#8217;s bankruptcy case is In re Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., 08-13555, U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Sues Boston Scientific Over Faulty Defibrillators &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Justice Department sued Boston Scientific Corp.
and its Guidant unit for allegedly knowingly selling defective
implantable electronic heartbeat-regulating defibrillators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidant, which Boston Scientific bought in 2006 for
$27.5 billion, hid problems with its defibrillators from
patients, doctors and the Food and Drug Administration,
according to the lawsuit filed yesterday in Minnesota federal
court. In February 2010, Guidant pleaded guilty to misleading
the FDA about the problems. It paid a total of $296 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidant knew as early as 2002 that implantable cardiac
devices known as Prizm 2 had a potentially life-threatening
defect, yet it still sold them, the U.S. claimed. The company
also knew as early as 2003 that its implantable cardiac device
known as the Renewal had a similar life-threatening defect, and
it sold them anyway, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Patients with serious heart conditions who depend on
these devices should not have to second-guess whether they are
safe and effective,&#8221; Tony West, assistant attorney general in
the Justice Department&#8217;s civil division, said in a statement.
Concealing the problems wasted taxpayer money and put lives at
risk, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paul Donovan, a spokesman for Natick, Massachusetts-based
Boston Scientific, said in an e-mail: &#8220;We have been aware of
the government&#8217;s interest in this civil matter, and we have
previously disclosed it in our regulatory filings. Guidant plans
to respond to the government&#8217;s allegations and claims for
damages in the appropriate fashion.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boston Scientific, the world&#8217;s second-largest heart-device
maker, agreed in 2007 to pay $240 million to settle more than
8,000 lawsuits claiming Guidant hid defibrillator defects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guidant LLC pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of
submitting false and misleading reports to the FDA and failing
and refusing to report a medical device correction. The company
was fined $253.9 million and forfeited $42 million. U.S.
District Judge Donovan W. Frank accepted the plea on Jan. 12 in
Minnesota. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. ex rel. Allen v. Guidant LLC, 11-cv-00022,
U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota (St. Paul). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.K. Arrests Five Over WikiLeaks-Related Cyber Attacks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;London police arrested five males, including three
teenagers, in connection with an investigation of a group that
has performed cyber attacks on companies deemed hostile to the
anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours later in the U.S., agents of the Federal Bureau of
Investigation executed 40 search warrants in a similar probe of
the attacks and a group known as Anonymous that took credit for
them, the agency said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The British suspects, between the ages of 15 and 26, were
arrested yesterday in connection with online assaults on
corporate websites by the loose-knit group, which enlisted the
computers of volunteers worldwide, the Metropolitan Police
Service said yesterday in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the police didn&#8217;t name the five or specifically link
their arrests to WikiLeaks, people affiliated with Anonymous
previously targeted EBay Inc.&#8217;s PayPal unit, MasterCard Inc., Visa Inc. and Moneybookers.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigation of so-called denial of service attacks is
being carried out in cooperation with law enforcement in Europe
and the U.S., according to the London police statement. The
attacks require &#8220;minimal knowledge&#8221; and consist of
&#8220;exhausting the resources of a computer,&#8221; the London police
said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;XO Holdings Sued Over 70 Cents-a-Share Icahn Offer &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; XO Holdings Inc. was sued by a shareholder who contends a
70 cents-a-share takeover offer from an affiliate of Chairman
Carl Icahn undervalues the telecommunications company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XO directors have a duty to get the best price for the
shares, which recently have been trading above the offer, said
Cindy Henzel, an investor in the Herndon, Virginia-based
company, in a Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed Jan. 26. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Henzel said the consideration &#8220;is indeed a discount to the
company&#8217;s shareholders,&#8221; and &#8220;is unfair and grossly
inadequate&#8221; for XO, which reported $1.52 billion in sales for
2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Icahn, with 91.5 percent of the stock, said Jan. 21 he
would buy 100 percent of the company through his ACF Industries
Holding Corp., according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XO said Jan. 21 it had formed a special board committee to
evaluate the offer. Icahn didn&#8217;t immediately return a call to
his New York office seeking comment on the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XO rose 2 cents, or 2.7 percent, to 76 cents in over-the-
counter trading in New York. The stock has climbed 23 percent in
the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is Henzel v. XO Holdings, CA6150, Delaware
Chancery Court (Wilmington). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawsuits/Pretrial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman&#8217;s Tourre Seeks to Halt February Depositions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader accused
by U.S. regulators of misleading investors in a product linked
to subprime mortgages, asked a judge to halt depositions
scheduled to begin on Feb. 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre can&#8217;t &#8220;effectively participate&#8221; in the depositions
until he gets documents from Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG, a &#8220;purported &#8216;victim&#8217; of the alleged
fraud,&#8221; his lawyer said yesterday in a court filing. Tourre
also is awaiting other material and must review about 300,000
documents he has already received, according to the filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Mr. Tourre is compelled to proceed with depositions
beginning on Feb. 1, 2011, it will be without the benefit of
anything like adequate document discovery,&#8221; Pamela Chepiga,
Tourre&#8217;s lawyer, wrote in the filing in federal court in
Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued Goldman
Sachs and Tourre on April 16, accusing them of failing to tell
investors that hedge fund Paulson  Co. helped pick underlying
securities for a collateralized debt obligation and planned to
bet against them. The SEC reached a $550 million settlement with
New York-based Goldman Sachs in July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Florence Harmon, a spokeswoman for the SEC, didn&#8217;t have an
immediate comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre is awaiting a judge&#8217;s ruling on his request to
dismiss the lawsuit because, he said, the transactions involving
the collateralized debt obligations called Abacus 2007-AC1
occurred outside the U.S. Tourre can&#8217;t be held liable under U.S.
securities law, his lawyers have argued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC opposes the request, saying in court papers that
&#8220;unlawful securities transactions&#8221; occurred in the U.S. Tourre
worked at the Goldman Sachs &#8220;headquarters in New York during
the relevant period&#8221; and did business in New York, the agency
said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court filing provides insight into the course of the
litigation. Tourre&#8217;s lawyers have hired 25 attorneys to review 1
million documents with about 10.5 million pages. Attorneys for
the SEC say they plan to depose about 25 witnesses, including
representatives of Goldman Sachs and IKB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-CV-3229, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam Prosecutors Seek to Offer Pay Evidence &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors asked a judge for permission to tell
jurors at an insider-trading trial next month about the pay of
Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj Rajaratnam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a filing Jan. 26 in Manhattan federal court, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Jonathan Streeter also asked a judge to block
Rajaratnam from challenging the government&#8217;s motives for
prosecuting him. Streeter cited a similar ruling in the 2004
trial of Martha Stewart, who was convicted of obstructing
justice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Evidence linking a defendant&#8217;s financial compensation to
his possible motives for participating in an alleged fraud is
relevant,&#8221; Streeter wrote in the filing. &#8220;Rajaratnam should be
precluded from attacking the government&#8217;s motives, conduct and
investigative methods,&#8221; he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, who denies wrongdoing, will go on trial on Feb.
28 on charges that he led an insider-trading conspiracy which
earned his fund about $45 million. Prosecutors say they will
offer wiretaps of his phone conversations and testimony from his
alleged accomplices, while Rajaratnam says there were innocent
reasons for his stock trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His spokesman, Jim McCarthy, declined to comment on
Streeter&#8217;s filing. On Jan. 26, Rajaratnam&#8217;s lawyer, John Dowd,
filed his own request to exclude prosecutors from offering
certain evidence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dowd wants to block prosecutors from telling jurors about
statements from Rajaratnam stock tippers who didn&#8217;t tell him the
source of their tips, who passed along &#8220;general and non-
specific&#8221; comments about companies or who fabricated
information about companies. Dowd also wants to exclude evidence

&lt;p&gt;Renault Told Spying Suspect to &#8216;Keep the Money,&#8217; Lawyer Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Renault SA told one of three executives accused of selling
company secrets to go quietly and &#8220;keep the money,&#8221; his lawyer
said. The French carmaker denied making the offer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian Husson, Renault&#8217;s legal director, said Matthieu
Tenenbaum could resign and escape punishment during a meeting on
Jan. 3, according to attorney Thibault de Montbrial. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t
even understand what the proposal meant,&#8221; De Montbrial said by
telephone yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renault spokeswoman Caroline de Gezelle said Husson had
made no such suggestion. Tenenbaum &#8220;had the choice to resign
but not to keep the money,&#8221; she said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renault said on Jan. 5 it suspended three executives
without pay after an ethics probe. Tenenbaum and the two other
managers, upstream development chief Michel Balthazard and his
deputy Bertrand Rochette, have denied selling electric-car
secrets, contested their subsequent dismissals and filed
criminal defamation claims. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renault kept the government in the dark about the alleged
leaks until they were reported by the French media, Industry
Minister Eric Besson said Jan. 13. The carmaker filed espionage
charges against persons unknown with Paris prosecutors the same
day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Renault&#8217;s internal probe found that offshore accounts in
their names had received payments traced to Chinese companies, a
French official said Jan. 12. China rejected the allegations as
&#8220;baseless and irresponsible.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Balthazard and Rochette said they had no
immediate comment on whether they received similar offers during
disciplinary interviews. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Milan Used Swap Dealers as Advisers in Past, Witness Says &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The city of Milan, which says four banks defrauded it in a
2005 derivatives agreement, hired banks as both advisers and
swap dealers in previous deals, a former city finance official
told a court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angela Casiraghi, 44, a prosecution witness who helped
arrange the city&#8217;s disputed sale of bonds and swaps in 2005,
said at the Jan. 26 hearing in Milan that the roles had been
assumed by a single lender in at least one previous deal. She
said in testimony last week the city typically sought to split
the roles of advisers and arrangers, and as a result she trusted
the banks on trial were acting in the city&#8217;s best interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Alfredo Robledo says the banks set out to
mislead the city by treating it as a so-called market
counterparty in the swap and stripping it of protection against
the banks&#8217; potential conflicts of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank AG, Depfa Bank Plc, JPMorgan Chase amp; Co. and UBS AG are accused of misleading Milan officials into thinking
they could save the city about 55 million euros ($74 million) by
selling the bonds and related derivatives, while they earned 101
million euros in hidden fees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks, which deny the charges, first sold interest-rate
swaps to the city in 2005 on 1.7 billion euros of 30-year bonds.
Officials for the banks declined to comment on the Jan. 26
cross-examination by defense lawyer Giuseppe Iannaccone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OMV Chief Ruttenstorfer Acquitted in Insider-Trading Trial &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; OMV AG Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer was
acquitted by a Vienna court of charges he used inside
information to buy shares of the company a week before a major
divestment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of 26,500 OMV shares on March 23 by
Ruttenstorfer, 60, was not in conflict with the company&#8217;s sale
of a 21.2 percent stake in Mol Nyrt a week later, Judge Claudia
Moravec-Loidolt said at the Criminal Court of Vienna yesterday.
The offense would have been punishable by as long as three years
in prison under Austrian law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruttenstorfer has been CEO of central Europe&#8217;s biggest
energy company since 2002 and is due to retire at the end of
March. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New York to Pursue Corporate Tax Fraud With New Unit &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said he&#8217;s
creating a taxpayer-protection unit to target multistate
corporate tax-fraud schemes, corrupt contractors and firms that
rip off public pension funds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unit, which also will encourage whistleblowers to
expose corruption, will be empowered by the state&#8217;s newly
strengthened False Claims Act, which Schneiderman called &#8220;the
strongest anti-fraud statute in the United States.&#8221; The revised
act makes New York the only state that can bring false claims
accusations against those who commit tax fraud, Schneiderman
said yesterday at a press conference in Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman also will bolster his office&#8217;s Medicaid Fraud
Control unit, taking advantage of a federal program that matches
state investment three-to-one. The money to expand the unit will
come from recoveries, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The enhanced False Claims Act, sponsored by Schneiderman
when he was a state senator and approved by the Legislature last
year, has a provision aimed at illegal off-shore tax shelters,
he said in a statement when it passed. The provision is a first-
in-the-nation state program to allow whistleblowers to go after
what he called &#8220;millionaire tax cheats&#8221; that defraud the state
of more than $350,000, he said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schneiderman said yesterday that the new unit also will
pursue off-shore tax cheats. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K1 Hedge Fund Founder Kiener&#8217;s Fraud Trial to Start in March &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helmut Kiener, founder of the K1 Group hedge fund, was
ordered to stand trial over an alleged Ponzi scheme that saddled
investors and banks, including Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas SA,
with 345 million euros ($473 million) in losses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A German court allowed the charges to go to trial, Dietrich
Geuder, spokesman for the Prosecutors&#8217; Office in Wurzburg, Germany, said in an interview yesterday. The trial is scheduled
to start March 2 at the Wurzburg Regional Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kiener was charged in November with tax evasion, 35 counts
of aggravated fraud and 86 counts of forgery. Almost 5,000
private investors in the K1 Global Ltd. and K1 Invest Ltd. funds
lost money, according to prosecutors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lutz Libbertz, Kiener&#8217;s lawyer, declined to comment, a
spokeswoman for the attorney said yesterday. Kiener has denied
the allegations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OPEC will have to raise oil prices
in coming years to maximize revenue even as it acts to quell
crude&#8217;s rally toward $100 a barrel in the short term, according
to JPMorgan Chase amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indications that members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries are raising output unilaterally are the
first signs of a response to rising prices, said analysts at the
second-largest U.S. bank by assets. Crude fell to a five-week
low Jan. 24 after Ali al-Naimi, the oil minister of OPEC&#8217;s
biggest member, Saudi Arabia, said the 12-member group will
boost supply this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The producer group does not want oil prices to rise too
high, too quickly,&#8221; JPMorgan analysts, led by New York-based
Lawrence Eagles, said in a monthly report dated yesterday. &#8220;But
we believe the group has little option but to incrementally
raise prices over the coming years to maximize the revenue from
each barrel of oil produced.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude has increased 3.4 percent this year on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange amid speculation
strengthening global economic data signals a recovery in fuel
demand. Futures reached $99.20 a barrel on Jan. 14, the highest
since October 2008. Prices, trading near $98 today, are up 0.4
percent this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tightness Subsides &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC, which pumps 40 percent of the world&#8217;s oil, is moving
to cool oil prices just as &#8220;physical tightness looks set to
subside from mid-February,&#8221; according to JPMorgan. Refiners on
the U.S. Gulf and West Coast have started shutting plants for
seasonal maintenance and will be joined by operators in Europe
in the coming weeks, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the group acts to cap oil&#8217;s rise now, it will have to
increase prices in years ahead if it wants to protect its
revenue, according to the bank. End-user prices will rise
regardless of OPEC&#8217;s actions, as governments in consuming
countries raise taxes for a greater share of revenue, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A large tax take is a long-standing thorn in OPEC&#8217;s
side,&#8221; the analysts said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gasoline prices in the U.K. are about $320 a barrel and
diesel near $330, leaving OPEC with &#8220;less than a third&#8221; of
sales revenue, according to JPMorgan. China, the world&#8217;s largest
energy user, has also imposed some oil taxes and introduced
policy to reduce energy intensity, it said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC, next scheduled to review production policy at a
meeting in June, agreed at its last gathering Dec. 11 to
maintain formal output targets at levels set two years earlier.
Current prices are in a &#8220;comfortable zone,&#8221; said the group&#8217;s
Secretary-General Abdulla El-Badri. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand Forecast &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan increased its forecast for global oil demand
growth next year by 300,000 barrels a day to 1.7 million
barrels. It estimates consumption will average 89.4 million
barrels a day in 2011, higher than the 89.1 million predicted by
the International Energy Agency. It also forecasts oil prices
will increase $15, or about 19 percent, to $95 a barrel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc. this week said oil&#8217;s rally from
$75 a barrel since September has partially been driven by OPEC
holding back supply. The group should boost supply to prevent
prices threatening the global recovery, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OPEC&#8217;s members are Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela. Iraq is exempt from the quota system. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader Fabrice Tourre, accused of misleading investors in a product
linked to subprime mortgages, challenged a judge&#8217;s order denying
his request to delay government depositions in a U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge Michael Dolinger, in an order Jan. 26
in Manhattan federal court, denied the application to postpone
&#8220;previously scheduled domestic depositions.&#8221; Dolinger said
there will be a conference to discuss the status of later
foreign depositions. Tourre on Jan. 27 asked U.S. District Judge
Barbara Jones to review Dolinger&#8217;s order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued New York-based Goldman Sachs and Tourre on
April 16, accusing them of failing to tell investors that hedge
fund Paulson  Co. helped pick underlying securities for a
collateralized debt obligation and planned to bet against them.
The SEC reached a $550 million settlement with New York-based
Goldman Sachs in July. Tourre denies wrongdoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourre had asked to postpone the Feb. 1 start of the
pretrial interviews, partly because he is awaiting documents
from Dusseldorf, Germany-based IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG,
which he described as a &#8220;purported &#8216;victim&#8217; of the alleged
fraud.&#8221; The SEC opposed Tourre&#8217;s request. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v. Goldman Sachs, 10-cv-03229, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Panamericano lost 3 percent to 4.26 reais in Sao Paulo

after Valor Economico newspaper reported that the bank deposit

&lt;p&gt;The fund, known as FGC, and shareholder Caixa Economica

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the world&#8217;s
largest company, posted its biggest quarterly profit in more
than two years as energy demand boosted oil and fuel prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter net income rose to $9.25 billion, or $1.85 a
share, from $6.1 billion, or $1.27, a year earlier, Irving,
Texas-based Exxon said in a statement today. Per-share earnings
were 25 cents more than the average estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural-gas output from Exxon&#8217;s wells rose 19
percent during the fourth quarter to the equivalent of 4.97
million barrels a day, the most in the 128-year history of the
company. Refining rebounded from a loss a year ago as demand for
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel rose 3.5 percent, widening margins
from processing crude into fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They&#8217;re hitting their production growth at exactly the
right time,&#8221; Jason D. Gammel, an analyst at Macquarie Capital
Europe Ltd., said today during an interview on Bloomberg
Television&#8217;s &#8220;In the Loop with Betty Liu.&#8221; &#8220;Their production
is going to be up over 7 percent this year and when you&#8217;re doing
that into the face of a rising commodity-price environment, the
earnings and cash-flow effects are just magnified.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon rose $1.69, or 2.1 percent, to $80.68 at 4 p.m. in
New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the biggest gain in
eight weeks. The stock has 10 buy ratings from analysts, 13
holds and one sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth-quarter sales climbed 17 percent to $105.2 billion.
For the full year, Exxon&#8217;s revenue was $383.2 billion, a figure
that exceeds the gross domestic product of Thailand, Denmark or Chile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share Buybacks &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spending on new oil platforms, liquefied gas plants,
exploratory drilling and refinery repairs jumped 19 percent to
$32.2 billion last year, the company said in the statement.
Exxon plans to spend $5 billion to buy back its shares this
quarter, after spending that amount on share repurchases in the
fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Their share repurchase program is back up to very high
levels of activity&#8221; said Gammel, who has an &#8220;outperform&#8221;
rating on Exxon&#8217;s stock. &#8220;That will enhance the earnings
effects as well.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gammel said he expects the company to maintain the $5
billion quarterly buyback pace for the rest of this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent Vs. Nymex &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon benefited as Brent futures traded in London, the
benchmark for two-thirds of the world&#8217;s oil, rose at a faster
pace than New York-traded crude, said Pavel Molchanov, a
Houston-based analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc. who has
a &#8220;market perform&#8221; rating on Exxon stock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brent crude averaged $87.45 a barrel during the quarter, a
16 percent increase from a year earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Oil futures traded on the New York
Mercantile Exchange increased 12 percent to average $85.24.
Brent topped $100 a barrel today for the first time since 2008. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Exxon has a great deal of exposure to Europe and Africa,
which tend to price oil off of Brent,&#8221; Molchanov said in a
telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gas Production Increase &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon last year made its biggest acquisition since 1999,
buying XTO Energy as part of Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson&#8217;s expansion of its natural-gas portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon tripled gas production in the U.S. as a result of the
XTO deal and other purchases, including Ellora Energy, a closely
held operator in the Haynesville shale region. Gas accounted for
49 percent of Exxon&#8217;s global production during the last three
months of 2010, up from 43 percent a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, which traces its roots to John D. Rockefeller&#8217;s Standard Oil Trust of the 1880s, signed a $1
billion accord last week joining Russia&#8217;s OAO Rosneft to drill
for crude in the Black Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp., the second-largest U.S. energy company, on
Jan. 28 said profit from the last three months of 2010 rose 72
percent to $5.3 billion, a record for the company&#8217;s fourth
quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips, the third-biggest U.S. oil company, said on
Jan. 26 that fourth-quarter profit rose 59 percent to $2.04
billion as chemical demand increased and higher oil prices
offset a slump in output. &lt;/p&gt;

losing 4.2 percent to 15.44 euros. In the short-term, political
unrest in Egypt &#8220;might prove to be a negative catalyst&#8221; for
shares of Greece&#8217;s biggest producer of the building material,
which controls about 9 percent of the cement market in Egypt,
National PK Securities said in a note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines
Corp.&#8217;s head of social networking was in an Indian airport last
year when the client he was meeting changed topics. Unprepared,
Alistair Rennie used his BlackBerry to access IBM&#8217;s internal
network and poll colleagues on the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I had everything I needed,&#8221; Rennie said Jan. 28 in a
telephone interview. &#8220;It saved me hours.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rennie is betting IBM&#8217;s customers will have the same
reaction. The company is revamping its social-networking
programs for mobile devices, including Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and
iPad tablet and Research In Motion Ltd.&#8217;s BlackBerry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. continue to add millions
of users, IBM is aiming to carve its own space in corporate
social networking. Sales of social-business programs should
triple to almost $2 billion by 2014, IBM said, citing research
firm IDC Corp. Adding its collaborative software to mobile
devices will give IBM an extra boost in the industry as it
raises corporate productivity, Rennie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The network isn&#8217;t at the water cooler anymore,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software will feature an activity feed, which gathers
information about customers, relevant news and information about
colleagues, Rennie said. Customers also will be able to have
video Web meetings, share pictures and post blogs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM is announcing the software today at its annual
Lotusphere conference in Orlando, Florida. RIM co-Chief
Executive Officer Jim Balsillie will be on stage to talk about
how the software will work with the PlayBook, the company&#8217;s
tablet scheduled to come this quarter, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lotus Symphony &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other supported devices include those on Google Inc.&#8217;s
Android platform and Nokia Oyj smartphones. IBM will add devices
as they come out, Rennie said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM climbed 22 cents to $159.43 at 9:56 a.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares advanced 12 percent
last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company also is introducing a cloud-computing version
of its Lotus Symphony software, which lets users create and edit
documents and presentations. Cloud computing is designed to help
customers save money by letting them store and access data via
the Internet, rather than from their own servers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM, based in Armonk, New York, gets more than a fifth of
its revenue from software sales. The division will account for
more than half of the company&#8217;s profit by 2015, IBM said in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Statoil ASA, Norway&#8217;s biggest oil
producer, plans to challenge Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.&#8217;s
existing partners such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc for a role in the United Arab Emirates&#8217; resources. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are positioning ourselves for the relicensing rounds
in 2014 and 2018, showing Adnoc that they can have added value
from us,&#8221; Neri Askland, Statoil&#8217;s Abu Dhabi and Gulf
Cooperation Council country representative, said in an interview
in his office yesterday. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t earmarked any specific
field, because we don&#8217;t know how they will relicense them.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil opened an office in Abu Dhabi in August and will
add a business development executive in a month as well as
expertise in exploration and production in the coming year as it
seeks to export its knowledge of enhanced oil recovery and carbon capture, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abu Dhabi holds more than 90 percent of crude reserves in
the United Arab Emirates, one of the few Middle East nations
that allow foreign companies to explore for and produce oil. It
plans to spend as much as $60 billion over the next decade to
expand its oil and natural gas industry, including boosting
crude production capacity to 3.5 million barrels a day from
about 2.8 million now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil is expanding internationally as output from Norway,
the world&#8217;s seventh-largest oil exporter, diminishes. Production
has fallen almost by half in the past decade after 40 years of
pumping from fields such as Ekofisk and Troll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enhanced Recovery &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norway&#8217;s oil and gas investments may reach a record 150.8
billion kroner ($26 billion) next year as companies raise
spending on platforms to keep aging fields alive, the country&#8217;s
Statistic Agency said in December. The Norwegian Petroleum
Directorate has set a 10-year goal of adding 5 billion barrels
of oil to reserves by 2015, of which two-thirds are expected to
come from enhanced oil recovery, or EOR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the North Sea, it is very mature, we have developed
technology and experience in EOR, and we think that is a lot of
good knowledge where we can add value,&#8221; Askland said. &#8220;In
Norway, we have recovery rates of 70 percent, some of the
leading rates in the world.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil is already carrying out some natural-gas studies
for Adnoc, Askland said. The U.A.E. imports gas from neighboring
Qatar and aims to develop nuclear power to help meet electricity
demand, which is likely to double by 2020, according to
government studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We are also looking at gas opportunities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We
are doing studies in an area that has discovered and
undiscovered resources,&#8221; he said, declining to name the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing Partners &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.A.E. holds about 8 percent of the world&#8217;s oil
reserves and is the fourth-largest member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, which supplies about 40 percent
of the world&#8217;s oil. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil, Shell and Total SA, whose stakes in Adnoc&#8217;s
onshore unit Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil Operations expire in
2014, are keen to extend their oil-production contracts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil would prefer to operate fields alone to avoid
sharing knowledge with commercial rivals, Shell has been in Abu
Dhabi since 1939 and hopes to be involved in Adnoc&#8217;s plans for
the future, and Total is &#8220;confident&#8221; it will continue to be a
partner with Abu Dhabi after its concession expires, officials
from those companies said last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japanese Financing &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Japan, whose companies working in Abu Dhabi include Cosmo
Oil Co. and Inpex Corp., agreed in November to lend $3 billion
to the sheikhdom in anticipation of new contracts. Abu Dhabi
will extend oil rights held by Cosmo by 30 years and will also
consider extending rights held by other Japanese companies after
they expire in 2018, Japanese trade ministry spokesman Hiroaki Wada said Jan. 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere in the region, Statoil would be interested in
developing offshore gas reserves in Saudi Arabia, and is waiting
for Oman&#8217;s next licensing round for offshore exploration,
Askland said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The Norwegian Continental Shelf is still a laboratory for
oil recovery from mature fields, and Statoil is one of the
biggest offshore operators, which may help it win contracts in
the Middle East,&#8221; Trond Omdal, an analyst at Arctic Securities
ASA, said by phone from Oslo. &#8220;Statoil definitely has the
technology to compete with the super-majors. It just depends on
whether Abu Dhabi and others want to attract new companies.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Statoil rose as much as 0.6 percent to 141.4 kroner in Oslo
trading and traded at 140.6 kroner at 2:11 p.m. local time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanish banks may need a
&#8220;manageable&#8221; 38 billion euros ($52 billion) of additional
capital amid new rules, according to JPMorgan Chase amp; Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savings banks may require as much as 30 billion euros on
top of about 15 billion euros provided over the past couple of
years, Ignacio Cerezo, Andrea Unzueta and Axel J. Finsterbusch
said in a report dated today. Lenders such as Banco Santander SA
and Banco Sabadell SA may need as much as 8 billion euros. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Spanish Finance Minister Elena Salgado announced
new rules for the banking industry, saying all lenders would
have to reach a minimum core capital requirement of 8 percent,
while those that aren&#8217;t publicly traded or depend on wholesale
debt markets will need core capital levels of as much as 10
percent. Salgado said recapitalizing the industry won&#8217;t cost
more than 20 billion euros and &#8220;all or part&#8221; of that amount
will come from financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan analysts said they were basing their estimates
on more rigorous stress testing of domestic loans, assuming
total expected losses of 7.7 percent for the industry. They also
used an average required capital ratio of 9.2 percent, compared
with 6 percent in stress tests published last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At about 3.5 percent of Spain&#8217;s gross domestic product, the
industry&#8217;s estimated 38 billion-euro capital shortfall is
&#8220;manageable&#8221; and paves the way for &#8220;a structural reduction in Spain&#8217;s risk premium from recent highs,&#8221; the analysts said.
Commercial banks would probably be able to raise all of the
required capital from private investors, &#8220;hence not needing an
additional injection from the government,&#8221; they said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan estimated capital needs of as much as 4 billion
euros for Santander, 1.5 billion euros for Sabadell, 900 million
euros for Banco Pastor SA, 750 million euros for Bankinter SA
and 400 million euros for Banco Popular Espanol SA. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Equity Partners LLC is
considering options for its Duropack GmbH corrugated board unit,
including a sale, according to two people with knowledge of the
matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity, JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#8217;s buyout arm, is working
with the New York-based bank and Austria&#8217;s Erste Group Bank AG,
said the people, who declined to be identified because the
matter isn&#8217;t public. A sale of the Vienna-based company may
fetch 350 million euros ($484 million), said another person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funds advised by One Equity took control of Duropack when
it bought 91 percent of Constantia Packaging AG in June,
according to One Equity&#8217;s website. The remainder of the shares
were transferred in a separate transaction, according to an Oct.
6 regulatory filing. Duropack is wholly owned by Constantia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our owner is continuously evaluating options to boost the
further development of Duropack&#8221; and Constantia&#8217;s Austria
Metall GmbH and Flexibles units, said Wolfgang Schwaiger, a
spokesman for Constantia, in a telephone interview. &#8220;There is
no sales process.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a spokeswoman for One Equity in New York,
declined to comment. Michael Mauritz, a spokesman for Erste in
Vienna, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity is also preparing a sale of its stake in
aluminum unit Austria Metall, known as AMAG, which it also holds
via Constantia, three people with knowledge of the process said
on Jan. 19. One Equity is weighing a sale or initial public
offering for AMAG and a sale may attract bids of more than 1
billion euros, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One Equity&#8217;s plans to sell Duropack were reported Jan. 30
by Wirtschaftsblatt, citing unidentified people involved in the
deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Duropack had sales of 262.4 million euros,
Constantia said in its annual report. Constantia Flexibles
Holding GmbH creates packaging for food, pet food,
pharmaceuticals and beverages. It had sales of 976.5 million
euros in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer Steve Samuels and a unit of
JPMorgan Chase  Co. purchased Landmark Center, a 950,000-
square-foot (88,260-square-meter) office and retail complex near
Boston&#8217;s Fenway Park, for $530.5 million. The seller was Abbey
Group, a Boston-based real estate company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbey Group, which is also a co-owner of the Boston Celtics
of the National Basketball Association, redeveloped the vacant
property after acquiring it about 15 years ago, Chairman Robert
Epstein said today in a telephone interview. The sale gives the
firm flexibility to take on other projects, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Landmark changed the image of the Fenway,&#8221; Epstein said,
referring to the neighborhood surrounding the famed baseball
park. &#8220;It was a very significant development and we&#8217;re very
hopeful the new owners will continue to maintain that and enjoy
the tenants.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sale was reported earlier today the Boston Globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Landmark Center, adjacent to Boston&#8217;s Longwood Medical
area, is 99 percent leased, Abbey Group said today in an e-
mailed statement. Tenants include Blue Cross Blue Shield of
Massachusetts, Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard
Medical School, Bed Bath  Beyond, Best Buy and Regal
Entertainment Group movie theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complex, known for decades as the Sears Building, was
built in 1928 as a warehouse and distribution facility for
Sears, Roebuck  Co. and was used by the retailer until the
mid-1980s. Epstein declined to say how much his company invested
in the redevelopment. The property includes 337,000 square feet
of property for expansion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samuels&#8217;s firm, Samuels  Associates, made the acquisition
in a joint venture with New York-based JPMorgan&#8217;s investment
management unit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Google Inc., owner of the world&#8217;s
most popular search engine, said Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s Bing is
&#8220;copying&#8221; its query results. Microsoft denied the accusation
and said the data in question comes from customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s own testing concluded that Bing was using its
search results, Google Fellow Amit Singhal said in an e-mailed
statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We look forward to competing with genuinely new search
algorithms out there, from Bing and others --algorithms built on
core innovation, and not on recycled search results copied from
a competitor,&#8221; Singhal said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;small piece&#8221; of the information Microsoft uses to
build search results comes from customers who choose to share
their data -- and that&#8217;s what causes the overlap, said Harry Shum, corporate vice president at Bing, in a blog post.
Microsoft uses more than 1,000 different signals and features to
improve search results, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We learn from all of our customers,&#8221; Shum said in the
posting. &#8220;What we saw in today&#8217;s story was a spy-novelesque
stunt to generate extreme outliers&#8221; in some search rankings, he
said. &#8220;It was a creative tactic by a competitor, and we&#8217;ll take
it as a back-handed compliment. But it doesn&#8217;t accurately
portray how we use opt-in customer data as one of many inputs to
help improve our user experience.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a panel discussion today with Google&#8217;s Matt Cutts at the
Farsight 2011 conference in San Francisco, Shum questioned
whether Google can say it owns the data when a customer uses its
search engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search Market Share &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is trying to preserve its lead in search as Bing
increases market share. Bing had 12 percent of U.S. searches in
December, up from 11.8 percent the previous month, according to
ComScore Inc. in Reston, Virginia. Google had 66.6 percent, up
from 66.2 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This seems pretty high-profile for them to take such a
public stance,&#8221; said Melise Blakeslee, founder and managing
partner of Sequel Technology  IP Law Pllc, a firm in Washington
that specializes in software and the Internet. &#8220;They&#8217;re
concerned about a competitor taking more of their market.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Website Search Engine Land earlier reported Google&#8217;s
allegation against Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google, based in Mountain View, California, rose $10.68 to
$611.04 at 4:30 p.m. New York time on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
Microsoft, based in Redmond, Washington, gained 27 cents to
$27.99. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ian Read, the new chief executive
officer of Pfizer Inc., plans to lower costs by closing labs and
reducing research spending by as much as $3 billion as the
company faces declining sales of its best-selling drug. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We have to fix our innovative core, and that&#8217;s what this
RD change is about,&#8221; Read told reporters at Pfizer
headquarters in New York today. The reductions are part of a
plan to overhaul the company&#8217;s research operation to focus on
the most-profitable programs, Read said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research and development spending will be $6.5 billion to
$7 billion in 2012, the CEO said. That compares with $9.4
billion in 2010 and is $1.5 billion lower than previous Pfizer
forecasts. Pfizer plans to buy back $5 billion in shares next
year as part of a $9 billion repurchase program, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today was the first earnings report under Read, who
succeeded Jeffrey Kindler in December. Pfizer is counting on
products from the $68 billion Wyeth acquisition in 2009 to
replace sales lost to generic copies of the cholesterol pill
Lipitor, the world&#8217;s best-selling drug. Read said Wyeth drugs
won&#8217;t be enough to make up for that shortfall, and the company
must rein in its unproductive spending. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No Pennant &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s like being the New York Yankees and having a huge
bankroll and never being able to win the pennant,&#8221; said Tony Butler, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York, referring to
the Major League Baseball team. &#8220;This is saying: &#8216;I&#8217;ll take the
Cleveland Indian budget and see what we can do with that.&#8217;
Spending more doesn&#8217;t mean getting anything out.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is all good,&#8221; Butler said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer rose $1, or 5.5 percent, to $19.22 at 4 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading of 133 million shares,
more than triple the three-month average. It was Pfizer&#8217;s
biggest gain in six months, helping the Dow Jones Industrial
Average to its first close above 12,000 since June 2008. Pfizer
shares have climbed 2.3 percent in the past 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company plans to halt funding research in the areas of
allergy, urology, respiratory, internal medicine and tissue
repair, Read said. Pfizer will focus on the more-profitable
areas of cancer, neuroscience, inflammation, vaccines and
immunology, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;At some point your shareholders and stakeholders demand
you have a return on investment in research,&#8221; Read said.
&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at areas where we think it&#8217;s not a competitive
advantage.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More Accountability &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama discussed
jobs, education and trade today with chief executive officers of
U.S. technology companies, including Ursula&#160;Burns of Xerox
Corp., Michael Dell of Dell Inc. and Samuel Palmisano of International Business Machines Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president held a private White House meeting with the
executives, who are members of the Technology CEO Council, an
advocacy group representing the biggest U.S. information
technology companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burns, as she left the hour-long meeting, called the
discussion &#8220;productive,&#8221; and declined to answer further
questions. Palmisano, chairman of the council, said Obama &#8220;was
very attentive and listened to our points.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using shorthand for research and development, Palmisano
said, &#8220;I think a lot of the things that he articulated in the
State of the Union the tech community is very supportive of:
innovation, R and D, education and competitive tax structures.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano said the group pledged support for the
administration&#8217;s work to get free-trade agreements passed in
Congress, citing the council&#8217;s support for the Korea Trade
Agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Seventy percent of our industry is outside the United
States and most of the growth is outside of the United States,
so we need a competitive playing field,&#8221; he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Math, Science &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A White House statement said the CEO&#8217;s talked with Obama
about &#8220;plans for their companies to invest in the United
States,&#8221; and they discussed the importance of math and science
education. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEOs and the president also talked about &#8220;ideas for
reforming and reorganizing the government to streamline the
process and improve efficiency through the use of technology,&#8221;
a topic Obama addressed in his nationally televised State of the
Union speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;In the coming months, my administration will develop a
proposal to merge, consolidate, and reorganize the federal
government in a way that best serves the goal of a more
competitive America,&#8221; he said in the Jan. 25 address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 31 the White House announced that Jeffrey Zients,
deputy director of the U.S. Office of Management and Budget,
would lead the administration&#8217;s effort to reorganize the federal
government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applied Materials &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other chief executives at today&#8217;s meeting included Michael Splinter of Applied Materials Inc., Steven Appleton of Micron
Technology Inc. and Joseph Tucci of EMC Corp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Palmisano said the council visits Washington twice a year
and always requests a meeting with the president to &#8220;express
the tech industry&#8217;s point of view.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his Jan. 25 State of the Union address, Obama pledged to
increase investments to &#8220;out-innovate, out-educate and out-
build the rest of the world.&#8221; Calling it &#8220;our generation&#8217;s
Sputnik moment,&#8221; he said that &#8220;maintaining our leadership in
research and technology is crucial to America&#8217;s success.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to its website, the Technology CEO Council is
made up of companies that generate $280 billion in annual
revenue and employ more than 800,000 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a Cabinet meeting earlier today, Obama stressed &#8220;the
need for greater investments in initiatives that foster
innovation and competitiveness,&#8221; according to a White House
statement. &#8220;The president also discussed the tough choices that
will be reflected in the 2012 budget, which will provide a
responsible 10-year path for reining in the deficit.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The administration will unveil its budget later this month. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan Chase  Co. branch in El
Paso, Texas, may have furniture and computers seized by the
sheriff unless the bank complies with a judge&#8217;s order to pay the
legal bills of a single mother whose eviction case he dismissed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The manager of the Chase branch was served on Jan. 26 with
court papers that instructed the New York-based company to pay
attorney Richard A. Roman&#8217;s $5,000 in fees, according to
Detective Hector Lara, an El Paso County sheriff&#8217;s officer. The
manager, Jose Gomez, told Lara that the branch&#8217;s gear is
protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and that he
would contact the bank&#8217;s security staff and the Federal Bureau
of Investigation, Lara said today in a telephone interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lara said he&#8217;s waiting for an opinion from the county
attorney on whether the bank&#8217;s property can be seized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They don&#8217;t have a problem putting my client out in the
street,&#8221; Roman said. &#8220;But when somebody prevails against a
bank, they pull every string in the book to avoid paying.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman, a former judge, is representing borrower Judith
French, whose home was sold in a foreclosure auction on Sept. 7
even though the lawyer had obtained a temporary restraining
order the same day. Roman said he&#8217;s seeking the legal fees from
JPMorgan because he believes the bank was French&#8217;s mortgage
servicer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Bruce King dismissed French&#8217;s eviction case in county
justice court on Dec. 15, saying the restraining was in effect
at the time of the foreclosure sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unusual Strategy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greg Hassell, a JPMorgan spokesman, said the company was
unaware of King&#8217;s judgment because it wasn&#8217;t named as the
plaintiff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Now that we are aware, we are taking steps to pay,&#8221;
Hassell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roman&#8217;s strategy of going after the bank&#8217;s property is
unusual, according to April Charney, a senior attorney with
Jacksonville Area Legal Aid in Jacksonville, Florida, who said
she has instructed thousands of lawyers on representing
consumers in foreclosure and bankruptcy cases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If it was me I wouldn&#8217;t go for a desk or chair, I would
execute on their business license,&#8221; Charney said. &#8220;When you go
into court and a judge orders you to do something and you don&#8217;t
do it, that&#8217;s the last step before lawlessness&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lara said he&#8217;s never faced a situation like this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Right now our concern is whether we can go ahead and
seize any equipment in a bank,&#8221; Lara said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investors should buy Cisco Systems
Inc. options to take advantage of potential gains when the
largest provider of computer networking gear reports second-
quarter earnings next week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equity derivatives strategists John Marshall and Maria Grant recommended a call spread, buying one Cisco February $22
call for every two February $23 calls sold. Telecom equipment
analyst Simona Jankowski expects the network-equipment maker to
post profit in line with estimates on Feb. 9 and give a better-
than-projected forecast for its third quarter. San Jose,
California-based Cisco rose 0.7 percent to $21.62 at 4 p.m. in
New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Our analyst thinks that sentiment has moved too negative
into the quarter and guidance is achievable,&#8221; the strategists
wrote in a note today, citing Jankowski. &#8220;With Street estimates
below Cisco&#8217;s guidance, a &#8216;not as bad as feared&#8217; quarter is
likely a positive catalyst for the stock.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cisco hasn&#8217;t missed profit estimates since at least 2005,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. Analysts forecast the company
will report earnings of 35 cents a share excluding some items,
according to the average of 37 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.
Jankowski has a &#8216;neutral&#8217; rating for the network-equipment maker
and a $23 price forecast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The call spread profits if the shares close between $22.12
and $23.88 at expiration on Feb. 18, the note said. Maximum
profit is achieved if Cisco closes at about $23, Bloomberg data
show. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Nokia Oyj and Microsoft Corp. need to
join forces to avoid the dinosaur fate of mainframe makers,
Berenberg Bank analyst Adnaan Ahmad wrote in an open letter to
the chief executive officers of the two companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Nokia&#8217;s investor meeting on Feb. 11, CEO Stephen Elop
ought to announce a deal that gives the Finnish company
exclusive access to Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone 7 and commits to a
date for product shipment, Ahmad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elop, a former Microsoft executive, said last week that
Nokia &#8220;must build, catalyze and/or join a competitive
ecosystem&#8221; to adapt to a faster-moving industry. His comments
fanned speculation Nokia may adopt Windows Phone 7 or Google
Inc.&#8217;s Android software. Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer is
grappling with a slow start for the company&#8217;s revamped Windows
Phone 7, which shipped just 2 million units in the 100-million
market in the last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Nokia is no longer in denial,&#8221; Ahmad wrote in his letter
to &#8220;Stephen and Steve.&#8221; &#8220;Microsoft also faces very big
strategic challenges as smartphones and tablets attack your
highly profitable installed base business.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia&#8217;s reported smartphone market share slid to 31 percent
in the fourth quarter from 40 percent a year earlier as
consumers defected to Apple Inc.&#8217;s iPhone and models based on
Android. Apple has changed the game for smartphone makers just
as Microsoft&#8217;s personal computer software changed it for
mainframe makers like International Business Machines Corp. and
Burroughs Corp., Ahmad said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbian, MeeGo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia spokesman Doug Dawson declined to comment on the
letter. Microsoft officials couldn&#8217;t be reached for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nokia rose 4.3 percent to 8.17 euros today in Helsinki.
Microsoft fell 5 cents to $27.94 at 4 p.m. New York time on the
Nasdaq Stock Market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By joining forces with Microsoft, Nokia would get a new
smartphone operating system to replace Symbian in high-end
devices, and access to the U.S. market where the world&#8217;s largest
phonemaker currently has a single-digit market share, Ahmad
said. It would also be able to shift research and development
costs to Microsoft, permitting it to cut staff, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahmad recommended Nokia scrap MeeGo, the platform it is
developing with Intel Corp., saying &#8220;it&#8217;s the biggest joke in
the tech industry right now, and will put you even further
behind Apple and Google.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold $3.5
billion of bonds in its biggest dollar-denominated sale since
2009, taking advantage of the lowest-ever short-term financial
company borrowing costs relative to longer-term yields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bank, which holds the record for the highest profit
earned by a U.S. securities firm, issued $1 billion of three-
year notes that yield 100 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The New York-based company&#8217;s $2.5 billion of 3.625
percent, 5-year fixed-rate securities pay a 158 basis-point
spread to similar-maturity Treasuries, the data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gap in yields between financial company bonds due in
one to three years and those maturing in seven to 10 years
widened to 3.18 percentage points on Jan. 31, the greatest gap
on record, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
going back to 1996. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;They are definitely taking advantage of the steep yield
curve,&#8221; said Nicholas Finkelman, who helps oversee $3.5 billion
of bonds as a money manager at New York-based Ryan Labs Inc.
&#8220;This general area is great for issuers to lock in low
yields.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets last month sold $2.5
billion of 6.25 percent, 30-year bonds, Bloomberg data show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yield Curve &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The yield curve has steepened amid signs that economic
growth is gaining momentum and as the Federal Reserve has kept
its benchmark overnight rate in a range of zero to 0.25 percent
for two years. Companies in the U.S. added more workers than
forecast in January, data from a private report showed today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new issue is the biggest from Goldman Sachs since March
12, 2009, when the bank sold $5 billion of debt under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.&#8217;s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee
Program. It&#8217;s the largest dollar-denominated sale without
government assistance since a $4.05 billion three-part offering
in January 2004, according to Goldman Sachs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new offering is &#8220;cheap,&#8221; compared with outstanding
similar-maturity debt, said Finkelman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs issued $2.25 billion of five-year, 3.7
percent notes in July that paid 205 basis points, or 2.05
percentage points, more than benchmarks, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &#8220;spread environment continues to be extremely
favorable for issuers,&#8221; Finkelman said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs&#8217;s new notes will likely be rated A1 by
Moody&#8217;s Investors Service and A+ by Standard  Poor&#8217;s, Bloomberg
data show. Libor is the rate banks charge each other on loans. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide were among the gases

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. may
flare gas at its Port Arthur site in Texas because its customer Valero Energy Corp., which uses the fuel, will shut units for
maintenance, according to a filing with state regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Valero is planning to shut down all but 3 or 4 of its
operating units&#8221; starting today, according to the filing with
the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The filing didn&#8217;t
say which plants would be idled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron Phillips&#8217;s ethylene unit produces feedstock for the
Valero plant, according to the filing. Chevron has to flare this

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp. may invest in shale-gas

&lt;p&gt;Chevron &#8220;wants to invest in extraction of shale gas in
Ukraine,&#8221; Azarov said today at the opening of a weekly
government meeting in the capital, Kiev. The company&#8217;s top
management yesterday met with the government, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ukraine seeks to develop gas deposits trapped in shale rock
as it aims to reduce its dependency on imported fuels. The
country gets about half of its energy needs from Russia and
price disputes between the neighbors has twice interrupted gas
flows to the West since 2006. Russia ships about 80 percent of
the fuels it sends to Europe via Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shale gas fields are difficult to develop and require large
investments, the prime minister said, without specifying amounts

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. is holding an
auction to find buyers for $143 million in loans owed to it by Australia&#8217;s Centro Properties Group, according to a person
familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York-based bank is seeking investors for senior
portions of the loans, denominated in both U.S. and Australian
dollars, the person said, asking not to be identified as the
details are private. The auction will be held today at 5:00 p.m.
London time, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Centro, a Melbourne-based shopping mall owner that had
A$18.4 billion ($18.6 billion) of debt as of June 30, ceded
control to creditors in 2008 as property prices slumped and debt
became harder to refinance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. sold about A$700
million of debt owed to it by the company in November, a person

A$495 million of senior debt priced at 63.5 cents in the dollar,
said the person, who asked not to be named because the
information was private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Commonwealth Bank of Australia also said in November that
it sold A$110 million of Centro&#8217;s debt for about 56.5 cents in

&lt;p&gt;New chief executive officers at Merck
 Co. and Pfizer Inc., torn between profit demands of investors
and the long-term funding needs of drug innovation, have chosen
opposing strategies for future investment in research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer CEO Ian Read said this week he will cut the
drugmaker&#8217;s research budget by a third to $6.5 billion to $7
billion over two years. Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier today
projected spending this year of $8.1 billion to $8.5 billion and
withdrew the company&#8217;s long-term profit forecast to prop up
research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merck and Pfizer both face generic competition over the
next two years to products with billions in annual sales.
Investors responded on Feb. 1 to Pfizer&#8217;s plan by driving up the
stock the most in six months, while U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron yesterday called the cuts &#8220;depressing.&#8221; Merck shares
fell as much as 3.9 percent today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I am not blind to what investors want us to do,&#8221; Merck&#8217;s
Frazier said during a conference call with analysts and
investors today. &#8220;They want us to invest in prudent ways, in
ways that actually drive return on investment and productivity.
But as a company we believe that the only sustainable strategy
in the health-care environment that we&#8217;re in is real innovation
that makes a difference to patients and payers.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co. put-option
volume surged as an investor took out protection from the bank&#8217;s
shares dropping through January, according to Joe Kunkle,
founder of OptionsHawk.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investor bought 25,000 January 2012 $40 puts at 1:19

fall to $30. The shares haven&#8217;t closed below $40 since Dec. 20
or fallen under $30 since April 2009. JPMorgan rose 1 cent to
$45.46 at 4 p.m. in New York. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;These spreads are often used as hedges to long equity
exposure,&#8221; Kunkle said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cost of buying insurance in the U.S. options market has
fallen toward the lowest levels since 2007, with the Chicago
Board Options Exchange Volatility Index dropping to 15.45 on
Dec. 22. Shares of New York-based JPMorgan have rallied two
straight years, and the company posted a record fourth-quarter
profit of $4.83 billion last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 122,000 puts to sell the stock changed hands,
double the four-week average and almost three times the number
of calls to buy. The January $30 puts were the most-traded
contracts and accounted for almost half of all put volume. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Asia Fueling Global Innovation." That was the theme of the 2-hour panel discussion I moderated as part of a full-day ceremony celebrating the groundbreaking of Procter  Gamble's SGD 250m Innovation Centre in Singapore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As promised, I asked Bruce Brown, PG's CTO, one of the questions readers submitted last week: "As you look forward into the future what do you see as PG's largest challenges, as seen through your eyes as CTO?" Brown noted three specific challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, the general challenge of growth. PG is about an $80 billion company. It typically shoots for 4 to 6 percent organic growth every year. Historically, 80 percent of its growth comes from innovation. Run the numbers and you're looking at close to $4 billion dollars in growth, every year. As a point of comparison, Hasbro &#8212; an 87-year-old company &#8212; has annual revenues of $4 billion. So PG has to create a new Hasbro, every year. This is a challenge when realizing some of that potential requires smartly re-thinking core systems and structures. (Brown and I are working on a more expansive piece on this very topic.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, Brown highlighted how PG has to deal with the fact that 50 percent of its RD scientists will reach retirement age in the next few years. While that presents a clear challenge &#8212; retaining the awesome accumulated knowledge of these scientists &#8212; it also creates an opportunity to make sure that RD talent is balanced with global opportunities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, PG has to deal with sustainability issues. It has publicly announced goals to reduce its dependence on petroleum and to increase its use of recycled and renewable materials. He noted how Singapore Agency for Science, Technology  Research (A*STAR) has told PG that sustainability is "no longer a program, it is part of how we do our work."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brown's remarks set off a fascinating back-and-forth among the panel about some of the general challenges facing companies in Asia and globally. At the end of the day's wide-ranging discussion, I shared the eight phrases that had stuck with me:&lt;/p&gt;



"For and amongst consumers." Bruce Brown used this phrase to describe how PG will achieve its stated goal of serving 5 billion consumers by the year 2015 (an increase of 800 million from today). Brown described how localizing research activities is a key component of that strategy.


"The Red Dot." A*STAR Managing Director Low Teck Seng used that phrase to describe how Singapore appears on a map. He described how the country's small size allowed it to be more nimble, reminding the audience that sometimes constraints can foster innovation.


"Florence." PG RD VP for Asia Maurizio Marchesini noted similarities between Singapore and Florence during the Italian Renaissance, with free-flowing ideas and disciplines colliding. He and I both noted how solving tough problems requires this kind of interdisciplinary co-location where people work together in new ways.


"Simplifying technology and new business models." Those are the two ingredients Shamik Dasgupta, the regional head of Medtronic's Cardiac Rhythm Management business unit, described as vital for driving disruptive growth in markets like India and China.


"Non-consumption." National University of Singapore Professor CC Hang used that term to answer the question of where there are the greatest opportunities for disruptive growth in Asia. He noted how there were more than 20 million electric bikes sold in China in 2010, many of them to women or other non-traditional vehicle purchasers.


"As common as possible, as different as needed." That's how Deb Henretta, the head of PG's Asia business, described how she thought about approaching Asian markets. She pointed out some of the real differences between consumers in different markets. For example, "beauty" means fair skin to many Asian consumers and tanned skin to many U.S. consumers. But using scale where appropriate can help companies like PG realize its full global potential.


"Non-obvious disruptions." Marchesini didn't quite use this term, but it was how I described an example he provided. He described how PG sells a product under the Downy brand that provides long-lasting scent benefits to clothes using microcapsules. In markets like the Philippines, this technology allows PG to bring scent benefits to consumers who can't afford higher end perfumes.


"Re-frame." Henretta noted how important re-framing was to manage many of the challenges inherent in mastering innovation in today's economy. One intriguing thing she noted, "You have to make sure your workforce reflects the consumers you are going to serve."
&lt;p&gt;It was great to see the energy around the topic, and the passion that the six leaders had for Asia's innovation potential.And, at the end of the day after Brown, Henretta, and key government officials officially broke ground on the Innovation Centre, I got a chance to participate in lo hei &#8212; the ceremonial tossing of a salad to bring good fortune in the coming Chinese Lunar New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, plans to sell $2.25 billion of debt as soon as
today as investment-grade companies tap the corporate bond
market to reward shareholders. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proceeds may be used for working capital, stock buybacks
and acquisitions, the Redmond, Washington-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. Microsoft is offering 5-, 10- and
30-year senior unsecured debt, according to a person familiar
with the transaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2011 is &#8220;going to be more the year of the shareholder than
the year of the bondholder,&#8221; said Tom Murphy, a money manager
who helps oversee about $23 billion of investment-grade credit
at Columbia Management in Minneapolis. &#8220;Some companies are
going to be taking that treasure trove of cash they have and
rewarding shareholders, whether it&#8217;s through share buybacks,
dividends, or doing strategic MA transactions.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit quality will weaken among investment-grade issuers
this year as companies facing &#8220;limited&#8221; business
opportunities, take advantage of relatively low interest rates
to repurchase stock, according to Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.
Bonds issued by Microsoft in its last U.S. offering in September
have tumbled, while the company&#8217;s shares have climbed 14.4
percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&#8217;s offering, a $750 million portion of 5-year notes
may pay 38 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
$500 million of 10-year debt may pay 48 basis points more than
benchmarks and $1 billion of 30-year bonds may pay a spread of
68 basis points, said the person familiar with the offering, who
declined to be identified because terms aren&#8217;t set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowest Coupons &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extra yield investors demand to own industrial
investment-grade debt instead of Treasuries fell to 137 basis
points on Jan. 24, the tightest spread since May, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. The spread was 138
basis points yesterday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, one of four non-financial U.S. companies with
AAA ratings, issued $4.75 billion of debt in September,
including 3- and 5-year notes that set records for the lowest
coupons for those maturities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The offering included $1 billion of 3 percent, 10-year
notes that priced at 99.14 cents on the dollar to yield 55 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The notes have dropped to 93.1 cents as
of yesterday to yield 3.86 percent, or a spread of 36.5 basis
points, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows, Xbox &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company&#8217;s 10-year notes lost 5.8 percent since their
first full day of trading on Sept. 23, compared with the 1.73
percent loss on its $1.75 billion of 1.625 percent, 5-year
notes, Bloomberg data show. Bonds rated AAA have lost 2.82
percent since then while overall investment-grade bonds have
declined 1.4 percent, Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data
show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maker of Windows and Xbox repurchased $5 billion of
shares and declared $1.3 billion of dividends in the quarter
ended Dec. 31, the company said in a Jan. 27 earnings call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft bonds fell because the extra yield the debt
pays relative to Treasuries offers little protection as a
&#8220;shock absorber&#8221; to rising interest rates, said William Larkin, a fixed income portfolio manager in Salem, Massachusetts, at Cabot Money Management, which manages $500
million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8216;Super Expensive&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I would look at this as super expensive,&#8221; Larkin said in
a telephone interview. &#8220;As inflation expectations shift and as
Treasuries sell off, basically Microsoft bonds will lose
value.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse Group AG are
managing today&#8217;s offering, said the person familiar with the
issue. Today&#8217;s filing didn&#8217;t include the size or maturities of
the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Investment-grade issuers are beginning to re-leverage
their balance sheets after cutting debt in 2008 through early
2010,&#8221; Guy LeBas, strategist and economist at Janney Montgomery
Scott wrote in the broker-dealer&#8217;s 2011 outlook on Dec. 20. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate cash balances are at record highs, close to 7
percent of total assets, Barclays Capital said in its global
credit outlook report for 2011. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I don&#8217;t necessarily think it&#8217;s such a terrible thing for
us, because we&#8217;re starting from such a position of strength from
a balance sheet perspective,&#8221; Columbia Management&#8217;s Murphy said
of bond sales fueling buybacks and acquisitions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AAA Rating &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard  Poor&#8217;s and Moody&#8217;s Investors Service also rank
Exxon Mobil Corp., Johnson  Johnson and Automatic Data
Processing Inc. as AAA, or an equivalent Aaa, the same level
they assign to U.S. government debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Kimberly-Clark Corp., the maker of Huggies Diapers and Viva
paper towels, sold $700 million of bonds on Jan. 27 that may be
used to buy back common stock, fund the company&#8217;s pension plans,
and redeem outstanding commercial paper, according to a
statement from the Dallas-based company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moody&#8217;s assigned an Aaa to the Microsoft offering, the
ratings company said today in a note. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse Group AG hired Imran Khan, an equity analyst from JPMorgan Chase  Co., to head
Internet investment banking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan will be a managing director based in San Francisco and
start in May, according to an internal memo, which was confirmed
by Duncan King, a spokesman for the Swiss bank. He will report
to David Wah, global head of technology, and Bryce Lee, head of
technology in the Americas, the memo said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an analyst, Khan covered Google Inc., EBay Inc., Yahoo!
Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. Wall Street firms are competing to win
mandates for initial public offerings of Internet companies such
as Groupon Inc. and Facebook Inc., amid increasing mergers and
acquisitions in the industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse is beefing up its technology investment
banking team after George Boutros, its former chairman of
technology and health care groups in San Francisco, left in
April to join Frank Quattrone&#8217;s Qatalyst Partners. Boutros was
one of Credit Suisse&#8217;s top dealmakers in the city and advised on
more than 300 transactions, including Sun Microsystems Inc.&#8217;s
sale to Oracle Corp., Google&#8217;s purchase of Youtube and Pixar&#8217;s
sale to Walt Disney Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khan was the head of JPMorgan&#8217;s global Internet research
since 2004. His recruitment follows the appointment of Citigroup
Inc.&#8217;s Mark Simonian as Credit Suisse&#8217;s global co-head of
telecommunications, media and technology in May. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp., the world&#8217;s largest
software maker, showed a fake copy of its Office 2007 software
found for sale on the streets of Mexico and &#8220;brazenly&#8221; stamped
with the rectangular &#8220;FMM&#8221; logo of the Familia drug cartel to
demonstrate the link between counterfeiting and organized crime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the real side, the scary side of counterfeiting
and it plagues the world,&#8221; David Finn, Microsoft&#8217;s associate
general counsel for antipiracy, said today at the Global
Congress on Combating Counterfeiting and Piracy in Paris. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of counterfeit and pirated goods within the Group
of 20 countries may rise to $1.77 trillion by 2015 from an
estimated $650 million in 2008, costing the economy $125
billion. These calculations, announced today by the
International Chamber of Commerce, expand on prior estimates
factoring in domestic trade in fakes and pirated goods as well
as pirated items distributed online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finn said consumers don&#8217;t seek out fakes as cheaper
alternatives, arguing that fears over identity theft and
computer viruses are more important considerations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The risk is higher when you don&#8217;t use the real thing,&#8221;
Finn said. Seventy percent of personal computers in China have
viruses, &#8220;a direct result&#8221; of purchases and downloads of
pirated and fake products, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Organized criminals are at the very center of the
problem,&#8221; said John Newton, head of Interpol&#8217;s intellectual-
property rights program. Counterfeiting and piracy are &#8220;low-
risk, high-profit crimes&#8221; with the proceeds often reinvested in
other criminal pursuits, as with La Familia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. offshore drilling regulator
wants to know when the oil industry will be ready to handle out-
of-control wells. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists of oil-containment equipment to be deployed when
deep-water wells blow out must be provided to the government
before the process of issuing drilling permits can move forward,
the Interior Department&#8217;s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management,
Regulation and Enforcement said today in a letter to the oil
companies assembling blowout-response fleets for the Gulf of
Mexico. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost four months after a federal moratorium on deep-water
exploration in U.S. waters was lifted, drilling remains off-
limits because energy companies haven&#8217;t proved they have ships
and other equipment ready to handle catastrophic blowouts. BP
Plc&#8217;s disaster at the Macondo well in April killed 11 and led to
the worst U.S. offshore oil spill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&#8217;s letter was sent to the Exxon Mobil Corp.-led Marine
Well Containment Corp. and Helix Energy Solutions Group Inc.,
which are developing separate blowout-response systems. Royal
Dutch Shell Plc and Chevron Corp. are among the companies
participating in the Exxon group; the Helix effort caters to
smaller explorers such as Marathon Oil Corp. and Newfield
Exploration Co. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8217;Missing Piece&#8217; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The most critical missing piece in the process of
approving applications for permits to drill in deep-water is the
demonstration of well control and subsea containment
capability,&#8221; Michael R. Bromwich, director of the Bureau of
Ocean Energy, said in the letter. &#8220;I ask that you provide a
detailed update as to when your proposed containment systems
will be operational.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael L. Moore, an Exxon spokeswoman assigned to the
Marine Well group, didn&#8217;t immediately return a telephone message
left at her Houston office after regular business hours. Cameron
Wallace, a spokesman for Helix, also didn&#8217;t return a message
left after hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Moore said Marine Well&#8217;s network of tankers,
pipes and pressure-control devices will be ready sometime
&#8220;early&#8221; this year. The other partners in the group are BP and ConocoPhillips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wallace said last week that the Helix fleet was already
fully operational and ready for deployment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bureau of Ocean Energy said on Jan. 25 that deep-water
drilling permits wouldn&#8217;t be forthcoming until explorers
demonstrate they can respond to and contain out-of-control
wells. BP&#8217;s Macondo well erupted when a surge of pressurized gas
seeped into the pipe lining the hole and rushed toward the deck
of Transocean Ltd&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon rig, where it exploded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
oil company, expects output to be affected as it starts a cogen
turbine at its Beaumont refinery in Texas, said Kevin Allexon, a
company spokesman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We anticipate some impact to production,&#8221; Allexon, who

conditions required flaring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Venezuela can &#8220;live without Coca-
Cola&#8221; if the company does not abide by the country&#8217;s laws and
settle a pay dispute with striking workers, President Hugo Chavez said today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa SAB&#8217;s production in Venezuela has been cut
by 52 percent for the past three weeks after workers paralyzed
the company&#8217;s main plant in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez, who has used nationalizations in the energy,
telecommunications, food and banking sectors to tighten state
control over the oil-exporting country&#8217;s economy, said his
government would support the strikers in their &#8220;fight against
capitalism.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If Coca-Cola doesn&#8217;t abide by the constitution and laws
then we can live without Coca-Cola,&#8221; Chavez said in comments
carried on state television. &#8220;Coca-Cola is not indispensible.
Who said you need Coca-Cola to live? Sugar cane juice is really
good, or guava juice -- I just had one.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Femsa, based in Monterrey, Mexico, fell 1.6
percent to 95.3 pesos a share in Mexico City trading today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Femsa spokeswoman Carolina Alvear declined to comment
immediately when contacted by Bloomberg News in Monterrey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chavez said on Feb. 2 that the government may take greater
control over the bottled water industry in Venezuela and force
companies such as Coca-Cola Femsa and PepsiCo Inc. to buy water
from the state. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase  Co. said it will
seek at least $778 million from Jefferson County, Alabama, if it
loses lawsuits brought by companies that insured the county&#8217;s
defaulted sewer debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which underwrote $3 billion of the debt sales and
sold the county derivatives to lower its borrowing costs, is
fighting claims filed by Syncora Guarantee Inc. and a unit of Assured Guaranty Ltd. in New York state court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bond insurers accuse the bank of concealing payments of
$3 million to friends of county commissioners in order to win
business. They also said the bank didn&#8217;t disclose an engineering
report saying the sewer system wouldn&#8217;t be able to pay its debt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;JPMorgan demands that Jefferson County agree to indemnify
and hold JPMorgan harmless for any losses or costs, including
attorney&#8217;s fees and expenses sustained by JPMorgan,&#8221; wrote Mary Beth Forshaw, an attorney at Simpson Thatcher  Bartlett LLP
representing JPMorgan, in a letter to the County Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The existence of the letter, dated Jan. 31, was previously
reported by the Birmingham News. Justin Perras, a JPMorgan
spokesman, declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Syncora and Assured took JPMorgan to court after Jefferson
County&#8217;s refinancing of sewer debt issued in 2002 and 2003
collapsed during the credit crisis and almost bankrupted the
county. Syncora insured about $1.2 billion of the sewer debt and
a $165 million surety policy. Assured provided almost $400
million in coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to a lawsuit from Jefferson County, the bank
said the county took on too much debt and knew the financing had
risks. Payments to friends of the commissioners were directed by
the county officials and disclosed in letters to them, according
to the bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil Corp. shut two processing
units at Fawley, the U.K.&#8217;s largest refinery, for about six
weeks of planned maintenance from today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;The refinery will shut down one of its pipestills
(primary distillation units) and one of the powerformers,&#8221; the
company said in a statement on its website today. &#8220;The work is
expected to continue throughout February and on to mid-March.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refinery can process about 320,000 barrels of crude oil
a day and supplies 15 percent of Britain&#8217;s petroleum products,
according to the country&#8217;s Petroleum Industry Association.
Refiners regularly halt equipment for inspections and repairs to
prevent problems and ensure efficient operations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powerformers make blending components for gasoline. Exxon
Mobil is based in Irving, Texas. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. turned
bullish on European banks for the first time since September
2009 as concern about the region&#8217;s sovereign-debt crisis eased
and the industry remained among the cheapest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. bank that makes the most revenue from trading
advised investors to take an &#8220;overweight&#8221; position on banks,
raising its previous &#8220;neutral&#8221; recommendation, according to a
group of equity strategists led Peter Oppenheimer. Investors
should pay for the trade by lowering holdings of consumer
shares, he wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#8220;For financials the narrowing of sovereign spreads in
peripheral eurozone, which our economists expect to continue, is
a clear positive,&#8221; London-based Oppenheimer wrote in the report
dated Feb. 3. &#8220;Banks are one of the least expensive sectors in
the market and the trade-off between their growth prospects and
earnings in the next few years looks especially attractive.&#8221; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Stoxx Europe 600 Index, a regional benchmark, has
rallied 23 percent since a low in May 2010 amid optimism that
the U.S. economy is strengthening and as European governments
implemented policies to support indebted countries using the
single currency. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron Corp.&#8217;s Kazakh oil venture
more than tripled crude extraction tax payments as the
government seeks a larger share of resource revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The TengizChevroil venture, Kazakhstan&#8217;s biggest crude
exporter, paid 445 billion tenge ($3 billion) in oil extraction
taxes last year, compared with 122 billion tenge in 2009, the
Finance Ministry&#8217;s Tax Committee said on its website. The
payments do not include export duties, Raikhan Sharipova, an
Astana-based spokeswoman for the committee, said today by phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kazakhstan, which holds 3 percent of the world&#8217;s oil
reserves according to BP Plc, introduced the extraction tax in
2009, replacing royalties, as it sought to boost revenue and
narrowed a budget deficit. In August 2010, the government
started levying export taxes on crude oil pumped under 146
contracts, including Chevron&#8217;s venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil increased oil production to 19 million tons
in the first nine months, compared with 22.5 million tons it
produced in 2009, according to the company&#8217;s website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venture&#8217;s total tax burden more than doubled to 991
billion tenge last year from 452 billion tenge in 2009, the tax
committee said. The venture paid 512 billion tenge in corporate
income tax, compared with 294 billion tenge in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TengizChevroil made over $8 billion in payments to
Kazakhstan in 2010, Novosti-Kazakhstan reported on Feb. 2,
citing General Director Tim Miller. Linsi Crain, an Atyrau-based
spokeswoman for TengizChevroil, didn&#8217;t answer her office phone
or replay to a message seeking comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, holds 50 percent
of TengizChevroil. Exxon Mobil Corp. has 25 percent, state-run
KazMunaiGaz National Co. owns 20 percent and Lukarco, owned by
Russia&#8217;s OAO Lukoil, 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. are among four New York-based firms picked by Ally
Financial Inc. to manage its initial public offering, according
to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally, the auto lender majority owned by the U.S.
government, also selected Citigroup Inc. and Morgan Stanley,
said the person, who declined to be identified because the
decision isn&#8217;t public. The U.S. Treasury Department, which owns
73.8 percent of the lender, will decide how much the
underwriters are paid, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally chose the underwriters after interviewing banks last
week as Chief Executive Officer Michael Carpenter, 63, positions
the company for an IPO and the government looks to begin
unwinding its stake. The size of the offering hasn&#8217;t been
decided, the person said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Detroit-based Ally, declined
to comment, as did spokespeople for the four banks. Earlier this
week, Ally reported a fourth straight quarterly profit, posting
$79 million in net income for the fourth quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and Goldman Sachs have previously advised Ally.
Last March, Ally was said to hire both banks to explore ways to
repay U.S. taxpayers, and helped consider strategic alternatives
for its mortgage unit, which is now complete. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was chosen to participate in the share sales for
General Motors Co., American International Group Inc. and now
Ally, all of which have stakes owned by the U.S. government.
JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs were among those picked to manage the
AIG offering, a person with direct knowledge of the decision
said on Jan. 18. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup were
among the firms that helped handle GM&#8217;s sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underwriting Fees &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The banks are unlikely to earn typical underwriting fees,
based on other transactions involving government ownership.
Treasury&#8217;s acting assistant secretary for financial stability,
Tim Massad, said Jan. 19 that underwriting fees in the AIG sale
will be &#8220;very low by normal standards&#8221; and that they &#8220;won&#8217;t
be any higher than GM.&#8221; GM paid 0.75 percent in fees to banks
managing its IPO. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ally, a former GM unit once called GMAC Inc., benefited
from three rounds of government aid totaling $17.2 billion. In
addition to U.S. taxpayers, so-called third-party investors own
8.5 percent, Cerberus Capital Management LP has about 7.8
percent and GM and an affiliated trust hold 9.9 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
