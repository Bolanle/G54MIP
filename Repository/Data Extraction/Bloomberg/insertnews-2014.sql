<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommends
selling the South Korean won and the most-accurate forecaster
Scotiabank sees possible interest-rate cuts, as exporter
earnings are wrecked by currency appreciation. </p>
<p>Goldman yesterday predicted a 3.1 percent drop in the won
against the dollar, after a 9.8 percent gain in the past two
years against the greenback and a 50 percent rally versus the
Japanese yen. Seven large exporters based their 2014 forecasts
on an average exchange rate of 10 won per yen, 12 percent
stronger than last year''s 11.23, according to a December survey
by Korea Trade Insurance Corp. </p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co. reported today fourth-quarter
profit missed analysts'' estimates, after Hyundai Motor Co. last
week predicted the slowest sales growth in eight years. Bank of
Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the benchmark rate by a
quarter-percentage point as early as Jan. 9 to mitigate the
won''s gains and spur growth, Goldman forecast. </p>
<p>Exporters are starting to feel the pinch from the
exchange rates, Kwon Goohoon, Goldman''s Seoul-based economist,
said by phone yesterday. There seems to be no other immediate
policy options than a rate cut to support growth. </p>
<p>Korean exports will see a significant impact should the
yen fall further, while currency volatility poses the biggest
risk to Asia''s fourth-largest economy, according to minutes of
last month''s central bank board meeting released on Dec. 31.
Finance Minister Hyun Oh Seok said on Jan. 3 that the
authorities are closely monitoring the yen''s volatility and
President Park Geun Hye said the Japanese currency''s weakness
was a burden eroding South Korean companies'' competitiveness. </p>
<h2>Samsung Earnings </h2>
<p>Seoul''s main bourse got off to the worst start since 2007
after Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors Corp. on Jan. 2 predicted a
4.1 percent increase in 2014''s combined deliveries, the slowest
since 2006, and as analysts cut estimates for profit at Samsung
Electronics. The Kospi index fell 2.6 percent since Dec. 30 as
foreign investors sold more shares than they bought. </p>
<p>The won touched 9.96 versus the yen on Jan. 1, the highest
since September 2008, and fell 0.3 percent to 1,068.46 per
dollar at 10:16 a.m. in Seoul, having reached a five-year high
of 1,048 last week. </p>
<p>Shares in Samsung Electronics, which got 85 percent of
sales from outside its home market in 2012, slid 4.8 percent
this year. Operating profit was 8.3 trillion won ($7.8 billion)
in the final quarter, the Suwon, South Korea-based company said
in a statement today. That compares with the 10 trillion-won
average of 32 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Currency Fluctuations </h2>
<p>Samsung Electronics is paying close attention to global
foreign-exchange trends and strives to protect its interests
against currency fluctuations, the company said in a Jan. 3 e-mailed statement in response to questions. It couldn''t confirm a
Nov. 29 report by the Korea Economic Daily that the company has
based 2014 plan on a rate of 1,050 won per dollar. </p>
<p>Foreign investors bought a net 3.1 trillion won of Kospi
stocks last year, while dumping Indonesian and Thai shares,
exchange data show, as South Korea is positioned to benefit from
a recovery in the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>Overseas shipments, which account for about half of Korea''s
economy, will increase 6.4 percent in 2014, after an estimated
2.2 percent gain last year, the trade ministry said on Jan. 1. </p>
<p>A stronger won brings down import costs, helping companies
counter falling overseas income. Steel giant Posco is seeking a
natural hedge by paying for imports of raw materials in foreign
currency earned abroad, spokesman Jeong Yong Min said in a Jan.
3 e-mail. </p>
<h2>Crying Foul'' </h2>
<p>Smaller exporters with fewer hedging tools are crying
foul over what they see as an unfair advantage Japanese rivals
are gaining from the retreating yen, Oh Joo Hyun, Korea
Trade''s head of foreign exchange risk management, said Jan. 3. </p>
<p>In Japan, Toyota Motor Corp. will post a record operating
profit of 2.4 trillion yen for the year ending March 31,
according to a Dec. 30 report from the Sankei Newspaper. The
Bank of Japan, which has embarked on an unprecedented stimulus
and debased its currency, has scope to expand purchases even
more, according to 71 percent of economists polled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Rising Risk </h2>
<p>Korean policy makers may now become more vocal as risks
rise in respect to an erosion of Korea''s external position,
Sacha Tihanyi, a Hong Kong-based strategist at Scotiabank, said
yesterday. Risks are rising and I''d be looking for the won to
weaken off for a bit, particularly given the weaker levels of
the yen. There is also the rising risk that the Bank of Korea
eases policy as a counterweight to won strength. </p>
<p>The won will decline to 1,070 versus the dollar by the end
of March, Tihanyi forecasts. That''s weaker than the median
estimate of 1,064 in a Bloomberg survey of 37 strategists. He
predicted the won will strengthen to 9.54 against the yen at the
end of 2014. </p>
<p>Goldman recommended selling the won with a target of 1,100
per dollar, without specifying a timeframe. The yield on five-year sovereign debt fell five basis points this week to 3.26
percent, amid speculation the Bank of Korea will trim the key
rate from 2.5 percent. The yield added 26 basis points in 2013.
All 15 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News expect no change
this week. </p>
<p>Consumer inflation has stayed below the BOK''s target range
of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent since May 2012. South
Korea''s current-account surplus will narrow to $38 billion this
year after reaching $63 billion last year, while the economy
will expand 3.8 percent from an estimated growth of 2.8 percent
in 2013, according to central bank projections. </p>
<p>Korea is a victim of its own success as the economy is in
better shape than most Asian neighbors, Suresh Kumar Ramanathan, regional currency strategist in Kuala Lumpur at CIMB
Investment Bank Bhd., said in a Jan. 3 interview. The won''s
strength has become a problem for exporters like Samsung. It can
be quite dangerous and policy makers can''t intervene or engage
in a race to the bottom without causing a reaction elsewhere in
the region. </p>

Ryse: Son of Rome and Dead Rising 3. </p>

supply chain checks, and appears to have a slight momentum edge
among core gamers, Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W.

console battle as too close to call, with both platforms selling
well over the holidays. </p>
<p>Dan Race, a spokesman for Sony, didn''t immediately respond

York. The stock gained 40 percent last year. Sony American

<p>Atlantis Resources Corp., a Morgan
Stanley-backed maker of tidal turbines, appointed a former Bank
of England and Royal Mail Plc director as it plans an initial
share sale on London''s Alternative Investment Market. </p>
<p>Atlantis named John Neill non-executive chairman of its
board to help grow the company as it plans to raise about 20
million pounds ($32.7 million) on AIM, Tim Cornelius, chief
executive officer of Singapore-based Atlantis, said today. It
expects to complete the share sale as early as this month. </p>
<p>Atlantis, in which Morgan Stanley holds a 45.7 percent
stake, will spend about half of the proceeds of the share sale
to fund the 86-megawatt first phase of its MeyGen project in
Scotland. Construction is expected to start just after the first

in early 2015. It may eventually reach a capacity of as much as
398 megawatts. </p>

power, one of the costliest forms of energy. Scotland''s waters

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), which agreed to
pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil allegations it
facilitated Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme, failed miserably
as a financial institution, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. </p>
<p>One reason, among others, that Madoff was able to get
away with his crime for so long was that JPMorgan had an
inadequate and inefficient anti-money-laundering program,
Bharara said at a press conference today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
prosecution by entering into an accord with Bharara''s office
that acknowledged oversight lapses related to an account Madoff
used to fund his fraud. The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion
to settle the U.S. allegations, $350 million in a related case
by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, plus
$543 million to cover separate private claims. </p>
<p>The bank connected the dots when it came to its own
profits, but not when it came to its own legal obligations,
Bharara said, adding that the bank was aware of Madoff''s
questionable transactions as early as 1994. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank didn''t file any suspicious activity
reports required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. </p>
<h2>Timeline Chart </h2>
<p>The Bank Secrecy Act is a law that requires financial
institutions to establish and maintain effective anti-money
laundering compliance programs and to know their customer,
Bharara said. It is not a tip. It is not a suggestion. It is a
legal requirement enforceable through criminal sanction. Today''s
charges have been filed because in this regard, JPMorgan as an
institution failed and failed miserably. </p>
<p>At the press conference, Bharara displayed a timeline chart
with comments by JPMorgan employees who suspected Madoff''s
fraud, which ended when he was arrested in December 2008 and
cost investors about $17 billion. Madoff is serving a 150-year
federal prison sentence in North Carolina. </p>
<p>A JPMorgan fund manager wrote in December 1998 that
Madoff''s returns are possibly too good to be true and that
there were too many red flags for the bank to do business
with Madoff, according to the timeline. </p>
<p>In June 2007, a senior JPMorgan chief risk officer said
there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that
his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme,
according to the exhibit. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Probes </h2>
<p>The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. </p>
<p>We recognize we could have done a better job pulling
together various pieces of information and concerns about Madoff
from different parts of the bank over time, Joseph Evangelisti, a spokesman for JPMorgan, said in an e-mailed
statement. We do not believe that any JPMorgan Chase employee
knowingly assisted Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>From late 1986 to the Madoff firm''s collapse, the Ponzi
scheme was conducted almost exclusively through a demand
deposit account and other linked cash and brokerage accounts
held at JPMorgan, prosecutors said in a criminal information
in Manhattan federal court. Virtually all client investments
were deposited into the primary Madoff Securities account at
JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. and virtually all client redemptions''
were paid from a linked disbursement account. </p>
<h2>Vantage Point'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, because of its vantage point as Madoff''s
banker, had plenty of reasons to be uniquely suspicious about
him. Warning signs abounded, Bharara said. </p>
<p>The volume, movement and use of funds should have generated
suspicions among JPMorgan employees, Bharara said. From 1986 to
2008 an astounding $150 billion went in and out of Madoff''s
JPMorgan account. </p>
<p>In 2006, a derivatives trading desk in JPMorgan''s London
office offered products linked to Madoff''s performance and
invested its own money in Madoff''s feeder funds, Bharara said.
By October 2008, the bank was so concerned about Madoff''s
returns that it redeemed $275 million it had in the funds, he
said. </p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, the bank learned Madoff and a client of
JPMorgan''s Private Bank were engaged in questionable banking
processes known as round-trip transactions that amounted to
what Bharara said was a check-kiting scheme. </p>
<h2>Closed Account </h2>
<p>These transactions were so questionable that another U.S.
bank involved in the transactions filed a suspicious activity
report and closed Madoff''s account, Bharara said. JPMorgan
allowed the transactions to continue for close to a decade, he
said. </p>
<p>It took until after the arrest of Madoff, one of the
worst crooks this office has ever seen, for JPMorgan to alert
authorities to what the world already knew, George Venizelos,
the FBI assistant director in charge, said in a statement today.
We all need to be invested in making our markets safer and
more equitable. The FBI can''t do it alone. Traders, compliance
officers, analysts, bankers, and executives are the gatekeepers
of the financial industry. We need their help protecting our
markets. </p>
<p>Bharara said today his office plans for every penny of
the $1.7 billion to go to help make Bernie Madoff''s victims
closer to whole. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley''s rates business had a return on equity -- a
measure of profitability -- of 5 percent to 10 percent in 2012
and aimed to boost that to more than 10 percent, Chief Executive
Officer James Gorman, 55, said in June. Interest-rates trading
involves buying and selling products including U.S. Treasury
notes and bonds, other government debt, inflation-linked
securities and interest-rate derivatives. </p>
<p>Derivatives Week reported the personnel changes yesterday. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley hired Hadden from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
as part of an effort to boost trading revenue from interest-rate
products and currencies. Gorman said in June that the firm had
rebuilt its client coverage in those areas, and Hadden said the
bank had made enormous gains in its share of client
business. </p>
<p>Nadel joined Morgan Stanley in 2010 and was head of the
fixed-income division in Japan before his most recent role in
New York. Horder previously ran the interest-rates trading unit
in Europe, Middle East and Africa. </p>
<h2>CME Suspension </h2>
<p>Jakob and Mitch will focus on aligning the strategy of
global rates with the other business units in fixed income, with
an intense focus on return on equity, Heaney and Rooney said
in the memo. </p>
<p>Rates and currency trading, or so-called macro trading,
contributed more than half of Morgan Stanley''s fixed-income
revenue in 2012, from less than half in 2007, Gorman said in
June. Porat said in 2012 that rates trading was the primary
driver of the increase. </p>
<p>Still, the unit lost at least tens of millions of dollars
in the second quarter of 2011 on a wager on U.S. inflation
expectations, Bloomberg News reported at the time. Hadden lost
more than $200 million in the first half of 2013, the New York
Times reported last year. </p>
<p>Hadden was suspended from accessing all CME Group Inc. (CME)
trading floors for 10 days and fined $80,000 last year to
resolve claims tied to transactions in Treasury futures. The
trades came on Dec. 19, 2008, when Hadden, then at Goldman
Sachs, made orders in the final minute prior to expiration of a
10-year futures contract. </p>
<p>Hadden''s attorney said at the time of the fine that the
trades were routine risk-management procedures and that he had
difficulty selling his positions because of illiquid market
conditions. </p>

<p>The U.S. prosecution of JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) was deferred by a federal judge after the bank
agreed to pay $2.6 billion to resolve criminal and civil
allegations it failed to stop Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Stephen Cutler, JPMorgan''s general counsel, pleaded not
guilty today on behalf of the bank to two violations of the Bank
Secrecy Act in connection with Madoff at an arraignment before
U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel. The judge deferred
prosecution of the case until January 2016, when the case will
be dismissed if the bank complies with the settlement. </p>
<p>The required judicial intervention to protect the
integrity of the process is not necessary, Castel ruled. He
set the next hearing for Jan. 15, 2016. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, avoided
prosecution by entering into an accord with the office of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara that acknowledged
oversight lapses related to a JPMorgan account Madoff used to
fund his fraud. </p>
<p>The bank said it will pay $1.7 billion to settle the U.S.
allegations and $350 million in a related case by the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, plus $543 million to cover
separate private claims. </p>
<h2>No Reports </h2>
<p>Bharara said yesterday that the criminal charges will be
dismissed after two years if JPMorgan complies with the
agreement and implements reforms of its anti-money laundering
compliance program. </p>
<p>While JPMorgan had been Madoff''s bank for decades and
discovered questionable transactions as early as 1994, the New
York-based bank didn''t file any suspicious activity reports
required under federal banking rules, Bharara said. JPMorgan
acknowledged in the accord that it ignored red flags for about
15 years that Madoff used his account to run a fraud, Bharara
said. </p>
<p>The U.S. agreement includes the largest ever bank
forfeiture and also the largest ever Department of Justice
penalty, Bharara said. JPMorgan, led by Chief Executive Officer
Jamie Dimon, agreed in 2013 to pay $15.7 billion to resolve
other U.S. regulatory probes into practices including mortgage-bond sales and energy trading. </p>
<p>The accord brings its legal settlements from the past two
years to more than $29 billion and further eroding its once-record earnings. </p>

<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) and Morgan Stanley
sold $32.5 million of structured notes tied to a U.S. and a
European stock index in offerings that may gain value when the
relevant benchmark declines as well as when it rises. </p>
<p>Citigroup sold the larger $17.6 million offering of 66-month securities on Dec. 30. The notes yield 1.3 times the gains
of the Euro Stoxx 50 Index, as well as the unleveraged absolute
value of as much as 35 percent of losses, according to a
prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission. Investors can lose their entire investment if the
index plummets. </p>
<p>The securities, known as dual directional or absolute
return notes, are distinct from other structured notes that
yield a set coupon even when protecting against some losses,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The notes make sense for mildly bullish investors
concerned about moderate, short-term losses, said Deryk Rhodes,
a Boca Raton, Florida-based executive director at Incapital LLC,
a brokerage that specializes in selling structured notes. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) sold $14.9 million of six-year notes that
have a similar structure, Bloomberg data show. The securities,
issued Dec. 30, yield 1.15 times the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index''s gains, according to the prospectus. Should the benchmark
fall as much as 35 percent, the notes would pay the absolute
value of that loss. All capital is at risk if the index falls
any more than that. </p>
<h2>Brokerage Stakes </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley distributed both notes for a maximum fee of
3.5 percent while Citigroup also sold the Euro Stoxx 50 notes on
the same terms. Both banks were stakeholders in the world''s
largest brokerage, known as Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC,
until last year. The company changed its name to Morgan Stanley
Wealth Management in 2012, and its parent completed its purchase
of the wire house last year. </p>
<p>Citigroup estimated its note''s initial value at 93.5 cents

dollar. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management has been
buying South Korean electronics and auto stocks in recent weeks,
saying concern that the won''s strength will erode exports is
overblown after valuations fell to eight-year lows. </p>
<p>We have been adding into weakness, Grace Tam, a Hong
Kong-based global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset, which
oversees about $1.5 trillion, said by phone yesterday. She
declined to name specific stocks. People worry about the
competitiveness of Korean exports. We think this is overdone. </p>
<p>The Kospi index has dropped 4.9 percent from last year''s
high on Oct. 30 as the won strengthened 5.9 percent against the
yen. The benchmark index''s valuation fell to about the same
level as its companies'' net assets last week, a 50 percent
discount versus the MSCI All-Country World Index, the widest gap
since July 2005. Samsung Electronics Co. (005930), the world''s biggest
maker of handsets and televisions, has slumped 14 percent while
Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) and Kia Motors Corp. (000270), South Korea''s largest
automakers, fell at least 12 percent. </p>
<p>Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo may lower the
nation''s benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point
as early as tomorrow to mitigate the won''s gains and spur
growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Hyundai Motor and
Kia Motors predicted the slowest growth in combined deliveries
since 2006 on Jan. 2, while Samsung Electronics posted its first
profit decline in nine quarters yesterday. </p>
<h2>Global Outlook </h2>
<p>International investors sold a net $2.2 billion of Kospi
shares since the end of October, snapping a record stretch of
inflows into Asia''s fourth-largest economy. The Kospi fell less
than 0.1 percent to 1,958.96 at the close today. Samsung
Electronics slipped 1 percent, while Hyundai Motor climbed 0.2
percent. The two stocks comprise more than 20 percent of the
Kospi''s weighting. </p>
<p>Emerging-market stocks trailed developed-nation equities by
the most since 1998 last year, leaving the MSCI Emerging Markets
Index at the biggest valuation discount since 2004. The
developing-nation gauge trades for 1.5 times net assets, or
about 31 percent below the multiple on the MSCI World Index,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Improving growth in advanced economies including the U.S.
will give South Korean exporters a boost in coming months, Tam
said. The International Monetary Fund plans to raise its global
growth forecast in coming weeks, Christine Lagarde, the fund''s
managing director, told reporters in Nairobi yesterday. </p>
<p>The Korean market is still very cheap, Tam said.

<p>Bafin official Frauke Menke wrote in the letter that
Deutsche Bank''s alleged provision of false information to Bafin

<h2>Courts </h2>
<h2>Former UBS Banker Weil Pleads Not Guilty in Tax-Probe Case </h2>
<p>Raoul Weil, once a top UBS AG banker, pleaded not guilty to
charges that he conspired to use Swiss bank secrecy to help
thousands of Americans cheat on their taxes. </p>
<p>Weil, 54, appeared yesterday in federal court in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, where his lawyer entered the plea on his
behalf. Weil, a Swiss citizen, first appeared in the court Dec.
16, five years after he was indicted and declared a fugitive. He
was arrested Oct. 2 after checking into a hotel in Bologna,
Italy, and later extradited to the U.S. </p>
<p>We look forward to coming back to Florida and defending
him when we have a trial date, Weil''s attorney, Aaron Marcu,
said outside the courtroom. </p>
<p>The former head of UBS AG''s global wealth-management
business, Weil is the highest-ranking banker charged in a U.S.
crackdown on offshore tax evasion. If he doesn''t plead guilty
and cooperate with prosecutors, they must prove that he oversaw
60 private bankers who helped UBS make $200 million a year by
managing $20 billion in assets not declared to the Internal
Revenue Service. </p>
<p>Weil is free on $10.5 million bail and staying under house
arrest in New Jersey. </p>
<p>To prove their case, prosecutors will rely on
substantially the same evidence that led UBS, the biggest
Swiss bank, to pay $780 million in February 2009 to avoid
prosecution, Mark Daly, a U.S. Justice Department trial
attorney, said at Weil''s bail hearing on Dec. 16. The Zurich-based bank admitted it helped defraud the U.S. by setting up
accounts that taxpayers hid from the IRS. </p>
<p>At last month''s hearing, Marcu said his client didn''t know
about a rogue division of bankers. Swiss regulators concluded
that Weil was not involved and was not aware of any wrongdoing
by any of these underlings who were multiple levels below him,
said Marcu of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP in New York.
The weight of the evidence at the very best, very best, is
equivocal. </p>
<p>UBS must cooperate on any matter related to the
government''s criminal investigation of its cross-border
business, according to the deferred-prosecution agreement. </p>
<p>If Weil cooperates with prosecutors, they can urge a judge
to give him a shorter sentence. He faces as long as five years
in prison. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s second-largest energy company by market value, will report a drop in
fourth-quarter profit after oil and natural gas production
declined amid slumping prices for the commodities. </p>
<p>Net income during the period was comparable to the $5
billion earned during the third quarter, the San Ramon,
California-based company said in a statement yesterday. That
compares with a $7.25 billion profit posted during the final
three months of 2012. </p>

underperformed its biggest U.S. rivals -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and
ConocoPhillips -- last year in stock performance and lagged the
industry average by almost half. </p>
<p>Chevron really struggled on production last year but it
looks like they''re going to turn that around in 2014, Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis who

<p>Chevron pumped the equivalent of 2.564 million barrels of
crude daily during October and November, according to the
statement. That''s almost 4 percent lower than the full-quarter
average of 2.668 million from the year-earlier period. </p>
<p>Given the decline in output, the company has no chance of
meeting its full-year output target announced in March of 2.65
million barrels a day, Youngberg said. </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips warned investors this week that fourth-quarter production slipped to a nine-year low because of bad
weather in the U.S. and the North Sea that interfered with
operations. The Houston-based company said Jan. 7 that output
dropped to a daily average equivalent to 1.475 million barrels a
day. </p>
<p>ConocoPhillips is scheduled to release full quarterly

<p>Banking clients at DBS Group Holdings
Ltd. (DBS) will soon get investing assistance from Watson, the same
International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) technology that triumphed
over human Jeopardy! contestants. </p>
<p>The Singapore-based bank plans to begin using the tool,
which can answer questions in conversational language and learn
from responses, to aid financial planners in guiding its wealth-management unit''s affluent customers, IBM said today. Watson
will analyze large volumes of financial data to help DBS,
Southeast Asia''s largest lender, offer more customized service. </p>
<p>The agreement gives IBM a proving ground as it tries to
show clients the value of its Watson technology. The Armonk, New
York-based company announced today it''s creating a separate
division for Watson to spur growth after six consecutive
quarters of falling revenue. IBM will invest more than $1
billion in the unit, including $100 million in venture funding
for businesses that develop applications based on the
technology. </p>
<p>Based in New York with a staff of 2,000, the new unit will
be separate from IBM''s hardware, software and services
divisions, said Stephen Gold, vice president of Watson
Solutions. </p>
<p>It''s the first time that IBM is bringing together all of
the disparate functions that support a business, Gold said in
an interview. It''s a kind of doubling down. </p>
<h2>High-Profile Bet </h2>
<p>As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down
sales, IBM has been selling off businesses to focus on more
profitable, faster-growing areas such as data analytics and
cloud computing. Watson is one of its highest-profile bets. </p>
<p>By putting these parts of the business into one group, I
can do things I couldn''t do,  Michael Rhodin, who will lead
the Watson Group as senior vice president, said in an interview
today in New York. I can make decisions much, much faster on
how to redeploy resources over new opportunities and new ideas.
It''s what the whole structure is all about -- it''s about
speed. </p>
<p>Rhodin, previously head of IBM''s Software Solutions Group,
will continue to report to fellow Senior Vice President Steve Mills, who oversees software. </p>
<p>IBM has stumbled amid the industrywide shift into the cloud
era, where information is stored online instead of onsite. The
transition has eroded demand for traditional hardware and
spawned a new crop of competitors. To cope, IBM has spent more
than $7.5 billion since 2010 on 43 software business
acquisitions, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Big Data </h2>
<p>In July, the company purchased cloud-computing storage
provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc. for about $2 billion. IBM
will adapt Watson''s technology so it can be delivered through
SoftLayer''s cloud infrastructure, it said today. </p>
<p>Watson and other big-data services, which let customers
mine vast troves of information to make better decisions, were
the company''s biggest focus in 2013, Chief Executive Officer
Ginni Rometty said in March. IBM boosted its expected sales from
the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with
an earlier forecast of $16 billion. </p>
<p>IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $187.38 at the close
in New York. The stock fell 2.1 percent in 2013, the year''s lone
decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. </p>
<p>The Watson Group will also include an incubator for
businesses to build on the technology, which IBM began offering
to outside developers in November. The goal was to have three
apps developed on the platform ready to enter the market early
this year, the company said at the time. </p>
<h2>Two-Way Street </h2>
<p>IBM has received about 890 requests from programmers to
build applications in Watson''s so-called developer ecosystem,
Rhodin said today. The company declined to comment on the number
allowed to use the services. </p>
<p>IBM has to be selective in choosing clients who can use
Watson because customers must upload large amounts of data
before the system can work, Rhodin said. </p>
<p>There''s work on both sides here, he said. To even get
started, you have to first find all of your data. For a lot of
companies, that is proving to be harder than they thought it was
going to be. </p>
<p>DBS is willing to invest S$15 million ($12 million) over
three years in IBM''s technology, and it plans to extend the
Watson service beyond wealth management to its small-business
and payment services, CEO Piyush Gupta said today at a briefing
in Singapore. </p>
<p>IBM has collaborated on Watson-based projects with health-care organizations, including insurer WellPoint Inc. and
Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The company is also
working with Nielsen Holdings NV and Royal Bank of Canada on
services that use Watson to interact with customers. Those first
projects will show other potential clients Watson''s promise,
Gold said. </p>
<p>The immediate focus is to ensure the success of those
early engagements, he said. It''s a much more interactive way
to work with clients and partners. </p>

<p>The largest U.S. and European oil
companies will pay more for Abu Dhabi crude when the end of a
75-year partnership reduces their direct stakes in the emirate''s
output, according to two people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Plc, Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) and Total
SA (FP) lose their rights as shareholders in the company operating
Abu Dhabi''s onshore oil fields after their joint venture expires
this week. The international companies will then start paying a
premium of 11 cents a barrel over Abu Dhabi''s official selling
price for Murban grade crude, the two people said, declining to
be identified because the contract terms are private. </p>
<p>As long as their crude price is reasonably competitive
and they''re feeding their trading arms, it''s something they can
deal with, Robin Mills, head of consulting at Manaar Energy
Consulting and Project Management, said by telephone from Dubai
today. The companies will be betting that they can trade the
crude to add more than 11 cents of value. </p>
<p>The end of an accord accounting for more than half of the
output from OPEC''s fourth-largest supplier further weakens, at
least temporarily, the role of international companies in the
group, as member nations seek to retain more oil wealth. Abu
Dhabi holds most of the reserves in the United Arab Emirates,
which pumped 2.76 million barrels a day in December, or 9.2
percent of all oil supplied by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Murban Pricing </h2>
<p>The expiring partnership between the international
companies and state-run Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., or Adnoc,
accounts for about 1.5 million barrels a day of Murban crude,
the U.A.E.''s main blend. Murban for December costs $113.85 a
barrel under Abu Dhabi''s retroactive monthly pricing system. </p>
<p>Adnoc will take full control of the unit operating the
fields while completing a bidding process to award new
concessions, according to a statement from the producer
yesterday. Until a new concession agreement is reached, Exxon,
Shell, BP and Total will buy Murban crude from Adnoc under six-month contracts that will replace some of the oil they would
have taken as equity partners, the people said. </p>
<p>Abu Dhabi has pumped oil from its onshore fields under
concession deals with Exxon, Shell, Total, BP and Portugal''s
Partex Oil  Gas, or their predecessors, that have been in
effect since January 1939. Adnoc became a partner in the 1970s,
forming Abu Dhabi Co. for Onshore Oil Operations, or ADCO, in
which the five foreign partners held a 40 percent stake. </p>
<h2>Production Loss </h2>
<p>BP, Shell, Total and Exxon, each of whom held a 9.5
percent interest, will see an end to some 150,000 barrels a day
of annual production and the loss of about $50 million of annual
fixed income, Deutsche Bank AG analyst Lucas Herrmann wrote in
a note today. More surprising is that at this stage there has
been no temporary extension and that Adnoc, the state oil
company, has taken full control of the fields. </p>
<p>The four companies, which retain some stakes in Abu Dhabi''s
offshore production, are among 11 from the U.S., Europe and Asia
that submitted bids in October for new production agreements in
the Persian Gulf emirate. Partex, the smallest partner in ADCO
with a 2 percent stake, wasn''t invited to bid. Adnoc may take
until January 2015 to choose new partners, Abdulla Nasser Al Suwaidi, the company''s director general, said in November. </p>
<h2>Interim Agreements </h2>
<p>Adnoc at first considered signing yearlong oil supply
contracts with BP, Exxon, Shell and Total, the people with
knowledge of the matter said. By signing six-month agreements
instead, the state producer will have greater flexibility in the
event concession agreements are reached earlier than next
January, they said. </p>
<p>Spokesmen at BP, Exxon and Shell declined to comment. Total
media representatives didn''t immediately comment when contacted
by phone. An Adnoc spokesman declined to provide additional
comment beyond what the company said in the statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Korea National Oil Corp. and Italy''s Eni SpA (ENI) have said
they''re bidding for the new concessions. The remaining bidders
are Japan Oil Development Co., China National Petroleum Corp.,
Norway''s Statoil ASA, Occidental Petroleum Corp. of the U.S. and
Russia''s OAO Rosneft, according to Energy Intelligence Group. </p>

<p>Major broadcasters are heading for a
showdown in their bid to block a Barry Diller-backed company
from upending the industry''s economics by offering subscribers
live television over the Internet. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court will say as soon as tomorrow whether
it will consider the claim by companies including Walt Disney
Co. (DIS)''s ABC and 21st Century Fox Inc. (FOX) that Aereo Inc.''s business
is built on copyright violations, obtaining broadcast signals
for free and distributing them for a profit. </p>
<p>Both sides in the dispute are seeking a high court hearing,
increasing the chances the justices will step in. If so, the
case will determine the fate of Aereo, a startup that threatens
the billions of dollars in retransmission fees broadcasters get
from pay-TV systems that provide signals to subscribers. </p>
<p>It''s nothing short of a watershed moment, said David Bank, a media analyst with RBC Capital Markets. If the Supreme
Court agrees to hear it, we''re going to finally resolve the
issue. </p>
<p>A federal appeals court in New York ruled that Aereo, which
provides broadcast signals to subscribers after capturing them
with thousands of small antennas, isn''t violating broadcasters''
copyrights. Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s NBCUniversal and CBS Corp. (CBS) are
joining Disney and Fox in urging reversal. </p>
<p>A decision to take up the case this month would mean a
Supreme Court ruling by early July. The justices could also ask
the Obama administration for input, a step that would delay a
resolution. </p>
<h2>Retransmission Fees </h2>
<p>Retransmission fees have become increasingly important for
broadcast networks, supplementing advertising revenue. </p>
<p>Broadcasters are expected to reap more than $4.29 billion
in fees paid by satellite and cable companies this year, a 30
percent gain from last year, according to research firm SNL
Kagan. That revenue is projected to reach $7.15 billion by 2018. </p>
<p>Fox and CBS have said they may abandon their broadcast
signals and become cable networks if Aereo continues unabated. </p>
<p>We need to be able to be fairly compensated for our
content, 21st Century Fox President and Chief Operating
Officer Chase Carey said at an industry conference last year.
We can''t sit idly by and let an entity steal our signal. We
will move to a subscription model if that''s our only recourse. </p>
<p>Conversion to a cable network would mean that broadcast
signals would no longer be freely available over the airwaves. </p>
<h2>Cable Switch </h2>
<p>Should broadcasters make the switch, it would affect about
12 percent of households, according to estimates based on data
from SNL Kagan and Nielsen. About 100 million of 114 million
U.S. homes with televisions subscribe to pay-TV services. </p>
<p>Diller, the billionaire investor who helped create the Fox
network, says New York-based Aereo may eventually get as much as
35 percent of U.S. households to subscribe if it overcomes legal
challenges. The service charges customers $8 a month. </p>
<p>DirecTV, Time Warner Cable Inc. and Charter Communications
Inc. are considering using the same approach, capturing free
broadcast-TV signals to avoid paying retransmission fees,
according to people with knowledge of the companies'' plans. </p>
<p>The cable companies could use Aereo''s approach in an effort
to bypass or reduce the fees they now pay, the people said. </p>
<p>The court fight centers on a provision in the federal
copyright law that gives owners the exclusive right to perform
their works publicly. The appeals court said Aereo''s service
was legal because the separate antennas let each customer create
a distinct copy of a broadcast program for viewing, so no public
transmission was taking place. </p>
<h2>Technical Detail'' </h2>
<p>The broadcasters argued in their appeal that Aereo is
trying to use a technical detail to circumvent well-established legal rights. </p>
<p>There is no dispute that Aereo has developed a business
model around the massive, for-profit exploitation of the
copyrighted works of others, the broadcasters argued. </p>
<p>Aereo is taking the unusual step of encouraging Supreme
Court review of a ruling in the company''s favor, saying it wants
to resolve legal doubt. That stems in part from rulings by two
federal trial judges declaring another company''s similar system
to be a copyright violation. </p>
<p>Litigation has created uncertainty that undermines
Aereo''s efforts to expand its footprint and further develop its
business, the company told the court. </p>
<p>Chet Kanojia, chief executive officer of Aereo, told
Bloomberg Television yesterday that it will become clear what
the road map looks like on the legal front over the next few
months if the Supreme Court takes up the case. </p>
<h2>NFL Backing </h2>
<p>Lower court disagreement often prompts the high court to
consider a case, though the justices tend to wait until the same
issue has been decided differently at the appeals court level. </p>
<p>The National Football League and Major League Baseball,
whose games appear on broadcast TV, are backing the media
companies. The broadcasters also have support at the high court
from companies that produce television programs, including Time
Warner Inc. and Viacom Inc. </p>
<p>Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC) is taking a middle ground in the
debate, saying that while Aereo''s service violates the copyright
laws, the broadcasters'' arguments go too far and threaten
legitimate services. </p>
<p>The local TV broadcast industry is run separately from the
national networks and would face a different challenge if Aereo
is found to be legal. Local broadcasters act as affiliates of
the national networks and negotiate separate deals with pay-TV
operators. </p>
<h2>Consolidating Business </h2>
<p>Local broadcasters have consolidated in the last few years,
a move partly spurred by the growth in retransmission revenue as
well as the value of their broadcasting bandwidth, also known as
spectrum, parts of which could be sold. </p>
<p>The situation led to more than $10 billion in acquisitions
last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Aereo''s
legality could threaten the value of those deals, according to
Bank. </p>
<p>It''s super-complicated from an investor perspective, he
said. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court case is American Broadcasting Companies

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
decide whether a rival drink-maker can sue Coca-Cola Co. (KO) for
allegedly deceiving consumers about the amount of pomegranate
juice in one of its beverages. </p>

the Coca-Cola product''s name. The label on the drink says
Pomegranate Blueberry Flavored Blend of 5 Juices, with the

authorizes false-advertising suits, can apply even when the FDA
regulates a product. </p>

to impose the requirements urged by Pom. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. agreed to lease 120,000 square feet in a new tower in
Manhattan''s East Village for its Watson Group, developer of the
technology that beat Jeopardy! champion Ken Jennings. </p>
<p>IBM, based in Armonk, New York, will bring the occupancy of
the Fumihiko Maki-designed building at 51 Astor Place to 73
percent, said Ed Minskoff, founder of developer Minskoff
Equities. The 400,000-square-foot (37,000-square-meter), 12-story tower was completed about four months ago, he said. </p>
<p>Minskoff started construction in the aftermath of the
credit crash without any tenants committed. The project tested
the appetite of New York''s technology and media companies for
new offices at a time when they were flocking to converted
factories and warehouses elsewhere in the area known as Midtown
South, roughly from 30th to Canal streets. </p>
<p>I always said from the day we announced we were going to
develop this property, it would lease after people could walk
through it, Minskoff said in a telephone interview. Now that
they''re walking through it, the response from most of the people
we''re doing deals with is, Wow.'' </p>
<p>As part of the deal, the tower will be named the IBM Watson
Building, Minskoff said. Watson is cloud-based technology that
answers questions in plain language and learns from the
responses. It''s known for beating Jennings after he won a record
74 straight Jeopardy! matches against other humans in 2011. </p>
<p>Lori Bosio, a spokeswoman for IBM, declined to comment on
the lease. </p>
<h2>Facebook, Yahoo </h2>
<p>Minskoff declined to reveal terms of the agreement, saying
only that it would be for between 10 and 20 years. He said in
general, tenants are paying rents that are in the range of
the $88 to $115 a square foot he said he was seeking in 2012. </p>
<p>Facebook Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) last year took space in
buildings completed in the early 20th century. Facebook is
leasing offices at 770 Broadway, which is across the street from

<p>Morgan Stanley said inflation and overspending threaten to push Japan''s finances to the brink, amid signs government-bond investors are preparing for rising consumer prices. </p> <p>An auction of inflation-linked sovereign notes yesterday drew a higher-than-expected price, as investors bid for 2.87 times the amount available. The benchmark 10-year yield on non-protected securities will probably climb to 0.84 percent by the end of 2014, delivering a 0.5 percent loss, based on analyst estimates and data compiled by Bloomberg. That would be the first negative return since 2003, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data. </p> <p>The Japanese government has two to three years to curb expenditures or face a possible crisis, according to Robert Feldman, the head of Japan economic research at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co. The government is doubling the nation''s 5 percent sales tax in two steps from this year, as a more than 4 percent jump in welfare expenditures and debt servicing costs next fiscal year is set to outpace revenue growth, according to the Ministry of Finance budget plan. </p> <p>There''s the risk interest payments would swell should the government fail to cut budget deficits when inflation and yields grind higher, Feldman said in an interview in Tokyo on Jan. 8. Absent an increase in tax revenues stemming from a tangible improvement in the real economy, there is a risk of collapse. </p> <h2>Linkers Demand </h2> <p>The ministry sold 300 billion yen ($2.86 billion) of 0.1 percent 10-year inflation-linked notes yesterday at 105.90 yen, exceeding the median estimate of 105.65 in a Bloomberg News survey of 13 traders. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.87, compared with 3.74 at the prior auction on Oct. 8. Sales have resumes after a five-year halt, with the last offering in August 2008 getting 2.52 times the amount on offer. </p> <p>The yield gap between 10-year nominal government bonds and linkers climbed five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 1.08 percentage points yesterday, and was little changed today. The breakeven rate, which signals bond investors'' expectations of future inflation, may advance to as high as 1.4 percentage points this year, said Yuya Yamashita, a rates strategist in Tokyo at JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p> <p>What''s most important is if there will be wage hikes and also whether they will spread in the country, and I have a positive view on that, said Yamashita. All things equal, faster inflation increases nominal bond yields. </p> <h2>Abenomics Impact </h2> <p>JPMorgan expects 10-year yields to finish this year at 0.8 percent, he said. The benchmark yield was little changed at 0.695 percent today, compared with 2.97 percent for similar-maturity Treasuries. </p> <p>Japan''s government bonds due in one to 10 years have had posted annual losses only three times since 1986, a Merrill Lynch index shows. They last recorded a decline in 2003 at 0.67 percent after yearly slides in 1994 and 1989. </p> <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe''s economic policy, which is made up of fiscal spending, monetary easing and growth initiatives, helped pushed inflation to the halfway point of the Bank of Japan''s 2 percent target. Consumer prices excluding fresh food rose 1.2 percent in November from a year earlier, the most in five years. </p> <p>Social-security expenditures will rise 4.8 percent in fiscal 2014 and make up the largest part of total spending at 32 percent, according to the Ministry of Finance''s website. Debt servicing costs, which account for 24 percent of the total, will increase 4.6 percent while revenue grows 3.5 percent. </p> <h2>BOJ Purchases </h2> <p>The central bank has been buying more than 7 trillion yen of government bonds every month since April, keeping the nation''s borrowing costs at the lowest globally </p> <p>Economy Minister Akira Amari told reporters in Tokyo today the BOJ is steadily conducting its monetary policy and that the Group of 20 nations understand Japan''s easing isn''t targeted at foreign exchange rates. </p> <p>The yen slid 0.2 percent to 104.97 per dollar as of 3:47 p.m. in Tokyo from yesterday after plunging 18 percent last year, the most since 1979. Depreciation typically enhances exporters'' competitiveness while boosting inflation through higher import costs. The BOJ might come in for more asset purchases to alleviate the impact on the economy from the planned tax hike, said Alvin Liew, a Singapore-based economist at United Overseas Bank Ltd. We expect longer-term JGB yields to edge higher in 2014 but not much. </p> <h2>Tax Increase </h2> <p>The government will raise the sales levy by 3 percentage points to 8 percent in April and to 10 percent in October 2015. Abe needs to boost tax revenue to close the nation''s budget gap as the government struggles to pay for the care of the world''s fastest-aging society. </p> <p>Budgeting may become increasingly difficult, setting off an unstoppable negative debt spiral, that''s why bold spending cuts are necessary, said Feldman, who previously served as an economist at the International Monetary Fund. Relying too much on tax increases to improve fiscal health is extremely dangerous. </p> <p>Japan''s public debt has ballooned to more than 1 quadrillion yen. The nation''s net liabilities, or total debt less financial assets, will reach 142 percent of gross domestic product this year, compared with 88 percent for the U.S., according to estimates by the International Monetary Fund. </p> <h2>Bond Risk </h2> <p>The cost to protect Japan''s debt for five years against nonpayment was at 45 basis points yesterday, up from 40 at the end of last year, according to data provider CMA. The premium on the credit-default swaps plunged 42 basis points in 2013, following a 62 drop the previous year. </p> <p>You think where the crowded trades are in the system today -- people are riding Japan, Rick Rieder, the chief investment officer for fundamental fixed income at BlackRock Inc., the world''s biggest asset manager, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Jan. 8. It''s a good trade, but you got to watch it carefully. </p> <p>Japan is the only place in the world where you have fiscal, structural and monetary policy, said Rieder, who runs the $11.4 billion BlackRock Strategic Income Opportunities Portfolio. They also have a burden that''s incredibly high in front of them in terms of the size of debt load. In 2014 are we going to have all the signs that things are going reasonably well? I think so in Japan. </p> <p> ', 'Morgan Stanley Warns of Crisis Amid Inflation Sign: Japan Credit', 'By Masaki Kondo, Shigeki Nozawa and Mariko Ishikawa', 'Jan 10, 2014  1:59 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-10/morgan-stanley-warns-of-crisis-amid-inflation-sign-japan-credit.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>The commodities cycle that sent
prices rising almost fourfold over 10 years is reversing and
will eventually drive raw materials into a structural bear
market, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) said. </p>
<p>Growth in shale oil output will keep U.S. energy prices
low, reinforcing economic growth and leading to more tapering of
government stimulus, the bank said in a report dated yesterday.
That will cut raw-material demand in emerging markets and lead
to weakened currencies that will encourage more production. The
new cycle is the opposite of the super cycle that ran from
2002 through 2011, Goldman said. </p>
<p>I can''t tell you about one commodity out there that has a
bullish supply-side story, Jeffrey Currie, head of commodities
research at Goldman, said at the company''s investor conference
in London today. A decade of higher commodity prices generated
a supply response. </p>
<p>Commodities posted the first annual drop in five years in
2013 as supply exceeded demand for corn to sugar to nickel and
investors lost faith in precious metals as a store of value amid
signs that economies are improving. As higher prices spurred
miners and farmers to boost production at time when China''s
economic growth slowed, Citigroup Inc. said the super cycle
of gains has ended. </p>
<p>The rotation away from emerging markets and towards
developed market demand as well as the supply increase,
particularly the U.S. shale revolution, are creating a new
commodity cycle, Currie said in the report. On net, this new
commodity cycle eventually suggests a structural bear market in
commodities, but we believe that is still in the distant
future. </p>
<h2>Weakening Currencies </h2>
<p>The new cycle will lead emerging market nations to increase
production to raise cash to make up for weakening currencies,
which will further weaken prices and reinforce the U.S.
recovery, Goldman said. A structural bear market is only in
the future because of transportation, processing and
distribution bottlenecks, Goldman said. Surging U.S. oil output
is largely trapped in the country and copper smelters are
failing to process rising supplies from mines, according to the
report. </p>
<p>Commodity cycles last about 25 to 30 years, with the first
half spent on building production capacity to meet demand and
the next 10 to 15 years spent on building capacity to consume,
Currie said. Returns in the last 10 to 15 years will be positive
for industries such as petrochemicals, he said. </p>
<h2>Precious Metals </h2>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s Enhanced Commodity Index will fall 3
percent in the next 12 months, with precious metals dropping 15
percent on top of last year''s 30 percent decline and agriculture
falling 11 percent after sliding 18 percent in 2013, Goldman
said. Industrial metals are forecast to decrease 5 percent and
livestock 3 percent, according to the report. Energy will lose 1
percent, after gaining 5.6 percent in 2013, the bank said. </p>
<p>Gold prices will fall to $1,050 an ounce in 12 months from
$1,246 an ounce now, while copper will be at $6,200 a metric ton
from $7,283 a ton now as the market moves into surplus, the bank
said. A record soybean crop in South America will send prices to
$9.50 a bushel from $12.7325 a bushel now. </p>
<p>While Brent will be at $100 a barrel in 12 months and West
Texas Intermediate oil at $90 a barrel, price risk is skewed
to the downside, Currie said in the report. Uncertainty about
oil supplies due to geopolitical risks in Libya and South Sudan
means the bank is neutral commodities over the next three
months, with prices forecast to return 3 percent in the period. </p>

<p>The two largest U.S. home lenders
are feeling the bite of competition from smaller firms as
mortgage originations tumble at the fastest rate since 2011. </p>
<p>New loans at Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest, fell 38

<p>Big banks are facing dual challenges of increased

attention, said Clifford Rossi, a former Citigroup Inc. (C) risk

<p>A lot of these guys are using the internet and social

<p>     Jan. 15 (Bloomberg) --- Dennis Lynch, along with the 18-member growth investing group he leads at Morgan Stanley (MS), was
named domestic stock fund manager of the year by Morningstar
Inc., which judged a team from Pacific Investment Management Co.
as best fixed-income managers. </p>
<p>The four funds led by Morgan Stanley''s Lynch all returned
more than 35 percent last year, Morningstar said today in a
statement announcing its annual winners. The top performer of
the four, the $2.5 billion Morgan Stanley Small Company Growth
Portfolio (MSSGX), gained 62 percent in 2013. Chicago-based Morningstar
has been handing out the awards since 1988. </p>
<p>Daniel Ivascyn and Alfred T. Murata of the Pimco Income
Fund (PONAX) were named the best fixed-income managers by Morningstar.
The $29.9 billion Pimco Income Fund (PIMIX) rose 4.8 percent in 2013, as
the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Total Return index of bonds declined
2 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>David Samra and Daniel O''Keefe, who run Artisan

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) amassed more U.S. patents than any other company for the
21st straight year, helped by its push into big-data services,
which glean insights by mining large quantities of information. </p>
<p>IBM''s 6,809 patents in 2013 scored an annual record, the
company said yesterday in a statement. With inventors in 41
countries, more than 31 percent of the patents came from
overseas. South Korea''s Samsung Electronics (005930) Co. and Tokyo-based
Canon Inc. (7751) ranked second and third. While computer-related
patents can take almost three years to process, the annual list
shows where companies are seeking growth opportunities. </p>
<p>As sluggish demand for computer hardware has dragged down
revenue, IBM is focusing more on fast-growing areas such as
analytics and cloud computing. Last week, IBM said it''s forming
a separate division for its Watson tool -- a so-called cognitive
technology that can analyze vast amounts of data and answer
questions in plain English. Bernie Meyerson, vice president for
innovation at IBM, said the unit relies on recent patents. </p>
<p>The work on cognitive is based on numerous of the patents
that were just issued related to Watson, Meyerson said in an
interview from IBM''s headquarters in Armonk, New York. That
new division is now a major commercial focus. By funding
research in that area, you will fund patents in that area. </p>
<p>Samsung claimed the No. 2 spot in the U.S. patent tally,
which it has held since 2007. It received almost 4,700, an 8
percent drop from the previous year. </p>
<p>Once again, only two U.S. companies made the top 10 in
addition to IBM. In 2013, it was software maker Microsoft Corp.
and phone-chip maker Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM); the year before it was
Microsoft and General Electric Co. (GE) </p>
<p>Google Inc., which ranked 11th, and Apple Inc., coming in
at 13th, both rose into the top 20 for the first time together,
research firm IFI Claims Patent Services said in a statement.
BlackBerry Ltd. was 20th in 2013, up from 29th the previous
year. </p>
<h2>Allergan Wins Order Blocking Copies of Lumigan Until 2027 </h2>
<p>Allergan Inc. (AGN) won a patent-infringement lawsuit that will
prevent copies of its Lumigan 0.01% glaucoma treatment from
entering the U.S. market until 2027. </p>
<p>Novartis AG (NOVN)''s Sandoz unit, Actavis Plc (ACT), Hi-Tech Pharmacal
Co. and Lupin Ltd. (LPC) would infringe Allergan''s patents on the
medicine, U.S. District Judge Michael Schneider in Tyler, Texas,
said in an opinion posted on the court''s website yesterday. The
judge also rejected arguments that the patents were invalid, and
ordered that regulatory approval not be granted until they
expire. </p>
<p>Lumigan, which comes in different solution formulas,
generated $452.7 million in sales for the nine months ended
Sept. 30 and accounts for about 10 percent of the Irvine,
California-based company''s revenue. The solution slows the
progression of glaucoma, which can cause blindness. </p>
<p>The case involved five patents. Four expire in 2025 and the
fifth in 2027, according to the website of the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. </p>
<p>The generic-drug companies argued that the patents were
little different from ones covering Lumigan 0.03%. An appeals
court last year upheld a patent on that treatment that expires
in August. The judge said the newer patents are for a solution
that limited red eyes, which caused some patients to stop taking
the treatment. </p>
<p>Bonnie Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Allergan, said the company
had no comment. Officials with the generic-drug makers either
had no immediate comment or didn''t immediately respond to
queries. </p>
<p>Lumigan is Allergan''s second-biggest drug, after Restasis
eye drops. Allergan yesterday received a new patent on Restasis. </p>
<p>The case is Allergan Inc. v. Sandoz Inc., 11-cv-00441, U.S.
District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). </p>
<h2>Microsoft Sued for Infringement by Former Litigator''s Client </h2>
<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s largest software company, was
sued for infringement by a company whose lawyer has litigated
patent cases in the past for Microsoft. </p>
<p>IpLearn-Focus LLC filed its lawsuit Jan. 10 in federal
court in San Francisco. The Mountain View, California-based
company is represented by Matthew D. Powers of the Tensegrity
Law Group LLP of Redwood Shores, California. </p>
<p>Powers, who left New York-based Weil Gotshal  Manges LLP
in 2011 to form a patent-litigation firm, represented Microsoft
in cases including a lawsuit filed in June of that year against
TiVo Inc. (TIVO) He defended the Redmond, Washington-based software
maker in a 2007 case brought by patent owner I4i LP, according
to court files. </p>
<p>As of yesterday afternoon, the electronic docket for the
IPLearn-Focus lawsuit didn''t show an entry of any motion by
Microsoft to disqualify Powers. No counsel for Microsoft is
listed. </p>
<p>The lawsuit concerns three patents covering learning
methods and systems that use a remote sensor. IpLearn-Focus said
Microsoft''s Xbox video-game console and services infringe
patents 8,475,174, 8,538,321 and 8,538,320. According to the
database of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, those are the
only three patents belonging to IpLearn-Focus. </p>
<p>The company, which doesn''t have a functioning website, also
is listed as the owner of patent application 20140004498, which
was published in the office''s database Jan. 2. That application
is related to the use of detached sensors in a learning
environment. </p>
<p>IpLearn-Focus said in court filings that it put Microsoft
on notice of its alleged infringement on Nov. 1 and that at the
time the complaint was filed it had received no response from
the software maker. </p>
<p>The company said it''s seeking money damages and a
reasonable royalty. It asked that damages be tripled for
Microsoft''s allegedly deliberate infringement. It also requested
attorney fees and litigation costs. </p>
<p>Microsoft didn''t immediately respond to an e-mailed request
for comment on the lawsuit. </p>
<p>The case is IpLearn-Focus LLC v. Microsoft Corp., 14-cv-00151, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Francisco). </p>

<h2>Trade Secrets/Industrial Espionage </h2>
<h2>Energy Panel Head Decries Number of Fracking Secret Claims </h2>
<p>The head of a panel convened by the Obama administration to
look at safety issues related to hydraulic fracturing said trade
secrets claims about fracking made by the oil and gas industry
harm the industry itself, EE Publishing''s EnergyWire reported. </p>
<p>Professor John M. Deutch of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, at a meeting at the U.S. Energy Department of the
panel he heads, said people are dramatically interested in
the makeup of fracking fluids and that the industry''s trade
secret claims damage public''s confidence, according to
EnergyWire. </p>
<p>At the same meeting, Eric Milito of the American Petroleum
Institute, said he disagreed with Deutch and the disclosures
being made by the industry are adequate. </p>
<p>The committee was meeting to look at the effectiveness of
the FracFocus website, on which oil and gas drillers identify
the chemicals they use in their fracking fluids, according to
EnergyWire. </p>

<p>Asian currencies are poised to
extend declines amid concern an increase in borrowing costs in
China and a weakening yen threaten economic growth in the
region, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said. </p>
<p>A trend of bearish Asian currencies will kick off,
JPMorgan analysts including Hong Kong-based Bert Gochet wrote in
a report yesterday. Worries over China''s tight liquidity
stance generate downside risks to growth. </p>
<p>China''s money market rates jumped in December to a six-month high, raising concern that tighter lending conditions may
slow the world''s second-largest economy. The yen''s 15 percent
decline over the past year is fueling speculation that a cheaper
currency may help Japanese companies grab export market share
from its competitors in South Korea and Taiwan. </p>
<p>The Philippine peso touched the weakest level since 2010
yesterday on concern the Federal Reserve may accelerate the
withdrawal of stimulus as the U.S. economy improves. The
Malaysian ringgit posted its biggest two-day drop since
November, while the South Korean won fell 1.3 percent from the
five-year high set in December. </p>
<p>The Fed started reducing its monthly bond purchases in
January by $10 billion to $75 billion, reducing capital flows to
emerging markets. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index of stocks has
slid as much as 16 percent since May 22, when the Fed signaled
its stimulus program could be trimmed. </p>
<h2>Cash Squeeze </h2>
<p>China''s seven-day repurchase rate surged to 4.98 percent
today in Shanghai, the highest level since Jan. 2, according to
National Interbank Funding Center. New yuan loans slumped to a
one-year low in December and money-supply growth eased, central
bank data showed on Jan. 15. </p>
<p>The cash squeeze will persist this month because
authorities are determined to curb shadow-banking financing and
reduce banks'' reliance on interbank funding amid concerns about
delinquent loans, Haitong International Securities Co., part of
China''s second-largest brokerage, said in a Jan. 15 report. </p>
<p>The yen, which traded at 104.33 per dollar today, may yet
reach 115 this year as the Bank of Japan weighs more stimulus to
offset a sales-tax increase, former board member Nobuyuki
Nakahara said in an interview yesterday. </p>
<p>The World Bank on Jan. 14 raised its forecast for global
growth to 3.2 percent this year, while lowering the estimates
for China and other emerging-market economies. </p>
<h2>Purest Expression'' </h2>
<p>Based on conversations with customers, JPMorgan said local
bond funds haven''t received any inflows so far this year. It
would be the first time that has happened in January since 2008,
JPMorgan said, citing data from research company EPFR Global. </p>
<p>The analysts recommend selling the ringgit as the purest
expression of positioning for a lack of EM local bond inflows.
Foreign investors held 45 percent of ringgit-denominated debt in
November, the most among 10 developing countries, making
Malaysia susceptible to capital outflows, according to Credit
Suisse Group AG. </p>
<p>JPMorgan advises further underweight the Philippine
peso, saying local interest rates are too low. Investors should
also exit a bet that the South Korean won will rise as the yen
weakens. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is leading a
rebound in bank lending to mining and energy companies, which
are taking out the most loans since 2011 to refinance debt as
commodity prices slump and acquisitions slow. </p>
<p>Raw-material industries boosted borrowing by 17 percent
last year to $684.7 billion, after a 22 percent drop in 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The top lenders were U.S. banks
JPMorgan at $57.1 billion, Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) at $47.1 billion
and Bank of America Corp. (BAC) at $37.8 billion. The figures reflect
transactions involving more than one bank and include credit
lines, project or term loans and trade finance. </p>
<p>While increased scrutiny from regulators is prompting
JPMorgan and other banks to exit physical commodity businesses
such as warehouses and power plants, lending rose as companies
including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group and Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc refinanced
to take advantage of low borrowing costs. Tumbling metal prices
also eroded revenue at mines and smelters last year during the
first commodity slump since the recession of 2008, while the
value of mergers and acquisitions slid 31 percent, data show. </p>
<p>It was generally not a good year for commodities in 2013,
and that required companies to raise external financing, said
Larry Landry, vice chairman of investment banking for JPMorgan
in New York. There will be less opportunistic-driven
refinancing in 2014, but hopefully that will be offset by a
meaningful pickup in mergers and acquisitions. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) plans to invest $1.2 billion to expand its cloud services,
bolstering a business it''s counting on for growth after spending
$2 billion last year to acquire SoftLayer Technologies Inc. </p>
<p>The company, the world''s largest provider of technology
services, plans to add 15 new data centers worldwide by the end
of 2014, said Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of
SoftLayer. IBM is winding down its separate SmartCloud
Enterprise product as early as the first quarter of this year,
except for a premium service that will be offered along with
SoftLayer''s, he said in an interview. </p>
<p>IBM is trying to keep up as customers shift from buying
their own computer servers to relying on the cloud, where data
and applications are delivered online instead of being stored
locally. A slump in demand for hardware has contributed to six
straight reported quarters of declining revenue, forcing the
Armonk, New York-based company to adapt. </p>
<p>That''s the transformation that IBM is in right now,
Crosby said. That''s why we are spending the money. </p>
<p>The new investment shows that IBM views SoftLayer as one of
its biggest bets. The price the technology giant paid to acquire
the Dallas-based company last year was the biggest it has
disclosed for a takeover since the purchase of software company
Lotus Development Corp. in 1995, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Data Centers </h2>
<p>SoftLayer has added about 2,400 customers since the
takeover, up from about 20,000 at the time of the acquisition,
Crosby said. </p>
<p>IBM didn''t specify how soon it will invest the $1.2 billion
nor how it was budgeting for the expense. The company averages
about $4 billion a year in capital expenditures. </p>
<p>SoftLayer is becoming the backbone for IBM''s cloud
business, with related services being integrated with the
platform, Crosby said. The 15 new data centers will bring the
company''s total to 40 locations in 13 countries, IBM said today
in a statement. </p>
<p>This is fundamental because this allows us global
coverage, Erich Clementi, senior vice president of global
technology services, said in an interview. We are continuing
to invest in where we think the growth areas are going to be
over the next years. </p>
<h2>Government Contracts </h2>
<p>Two of the centers will serve the Washington area to better
support possible government contracts, Crosby said. While IBM
won a cloud-computing contract of as much as $1 billion with the
U.S. Department of the Interior last August, the industry is
filled with new rivals eager to convert IBM''s hardware customers
into cloud users. In October, IBM abandoned a court fight over
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency''s decision to award
Amazon.com Inc a $600 million cloud-computing contract. </p>
<p>IBM clients using SmartCloud Enterprise, its previous
service, have already been switched to the newer product. Crosby
said some of the employees who worked on SmartCloud Enterprise
have moved to SoftLayer, while others have found positions
elsewhere at IBM. </p>
<p>The company declined to comment on whether any jobs were
lost due to the closing of SmartCloud. </p>
<p>IBM reported more than $1 billion in sales from cloud
services last quarter, the first time it has disclosed revenue
from that segment. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
is looking into how IBM reports its revenue from the cloud
business, the company said in July. </p>
<h2>Watson Division </h2>
<p>The plans for investment in SoftLayer''s cloud platform
follows IBM''s move last week to create a new business division
around its Watson technology, which can analyze large volumes of
data and answer questions in conversational language. IBM will
invest more than $1 billion in the unit and give it its own
headquarters in New York. Watson''s big-data services, which let
customers mine vast troves of information, will be run on
SoftLayer''s cloud, the company said. </p>
<p>IBM shares climbed less than 1 percent to $190.09, the
highest since September, at the close in New York. Technology
companies in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index were little
changed. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) is seeking to sell

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s largest brokerage, reported profit that beat analysts'' estimates as equity-trading revenue increased and earnings from wealth management climbed to a record. </p> <p>Fourth-quarter net income fell to $181 million, or 7 cents a share, from $594 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier, the New York-based company said today in a statement. Profit was 50 cents a share excluding an accounting charge tied to the firm''s own debt, a tax benefit and legal expenses, beating the 44-cent average estimate of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley''s stock climbed 64 percent in 2013, the most among the 10 largest global investment banks, as Chief Executive Officer James Gorman cut costs and improved margins at the brokerage unit. A 30 percent jump in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index helped boost equity trading and wealth-management revenue. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley is a little more levered toward the equity-centric businesses than competitors, Devin Ryan, a bank analyst at JMP Group Inc. in New York, said before the results were announced. There''s positive momentum in those businesses going into 2014. </p> <p>The company''s $1.2 billion addition to legal reserves in the fourth quarter pertained to mortgage-related matters, specifically litigation and investigations related to residential mortgage-backed securities and the credit crisis, according to the statement. </p> <h2>Legal Issues </h2> <p>We are continuing to address many of the legal issues from the financial crisis, Gorman, 55, said in the statement. We look forward to further progress on our strategic goals as we move into 2014 with strength and momentum. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley rose 3 percent to $32.96 in New York trading at 9:51 a.m. The shares have more than doubled since June 2012, and through yesterday were 8.1 percent above the price when Gorman took over at the end of 2009. </p> <p>Revenue excluding accounting adjustments rose to $8.2 billion from $7.47 billion a year earlier. Book value per share climbed to $32.29 from $32.13 at the end of September. </p> <p>The company surpassed revenue expectations with better-than-expected strength in investment banking, global wealth management, and asset management, Keith Horowitz, a Citigroup Inc. analyst, wrote in a note to investors. </p> <h2>Profit Goal </h2> <p>The firm''s return on equity excluding the accounting charge was 5.1 percent for the year, unchanged from 2012. While Morgan Stanley achieved its goals on cost cutting and reducing capital used by the trading business, the firm hasn''t reached its target of doubling ROE, a gauge of profitability. </p> <p>Gorman said in May that the bank can post a 10 percent ROE by this year if regulators allow it to return a reasonable amount of capital to shareholders. The company announced a $500 million stock buyback in July. It repurchased $228 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the yearly total to $350 million. </p> <p>The accounting charge is known as a debt-valuation adjustment, or DVA. It stems from increases in the value of the company''s debt, on the theory it would be more expensive to buy it back. The firm had a $368 million charge from DVA, versus a $511 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2012. </p> <p>Pretax profit from global wealth management, overseen by Greg Fleming, 50, jumped 26 percent to $709 million as revenue climbed to a record $3.73 billion. The division''s pretax profit margin rose to 19 percent from 17 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012. </p> <h2>Margin Target </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley today set a margin target of 22 percent to 25 percent for the fourth quarter of 2015, assuming no change in interest rates or market levels. That was higher than the previous target of 20 percent to 22 percent Gorman laid out in June. </p> <p>The brokerage also provides the firm with a growing deposit base that it''s seeking to use for lending in products such as mortgages and corporate lending. Morgan Stanley is targeting a 70 percent loan-to-deposit ratio next year, up from 55 percent in 2012, and Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said growth in the bank unit will be the biggest driver of ROE improvement. </p> <p>The increase in asset prices globally in 2013 has helped boost performance at the brokerage, which generates more than a third of revenue from fee-based accounts that often earn a percentage of assets. Rising stock indexes have also benefited Morgan Stanley, which is the only Wall Street firm to generate more revenue from equity trading than fixed-income trading. </p> <h2>Equities Trading </h2> <p>In equities trading, headed by Ted Pick, Morgan Stanley''s revenue rose 7 percent from a year earlier to $1.5 billion, excluding DVA. That compared with $904 million at Bank of America Corp. and $1.73 billion at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. UBS AG''s Brennan Hawken had estimated equities revenue of about $1.58 billion, while Wells Fargo  Co.''s Matt Burnell predicted $1.43 billion. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley topped all global investment banks in equity-trading revenue in the third quarter. The firm is now seeing an acute battle for equity traders, Colm Kelleher, head of the investment bank and trading division, said last month. </p> <p>Fourth-quarter revenue from fixed-income sales and trading, run by Michael Heaney and Robert Rooney with commodity trading co-heads Colin Bryce and Simon Greenshields, fell 14 percent to $694 million, excluding DVA. That compared with estimates of $919 million from Wells Fargo''s Burnell and $800 million from UBS''s Hawken. </p> <h2>Interest-Rates Trading </h2> <p>Porat said the firm suffered from weak interest-rates trading revenue. Fixed-income revenue was $1.89 billion at Goldman Sachs and $2.33 billion at Citigroup. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley''s head of interest-rates trading, Glenn Hadden, left earlier this month after two years with the firm. He said he had different views over how the business should be run than Heaney and Rooney, who took over leadership of the fixed-income division last year. Mitch Nadel and Jakob Horder were named to replace Hadden. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley had its lowest share of fixed-income revenue among U.S. peers in at least four years. While the firm''s credit, securitized products and currency units reached their 10 percent return-on-equity goals, low returns in the commodity and interest-rates groups dragged down ROE. Morgan Stanley reiterated its goal of reaching 10 percent ROE firmwide. </p> <p>Given the continued weak performance of FICC, we remain skeptical that Morgan Stanley will achieve even this relatively low financial target, Richard Staite, an analyst at Atlantic Equities LLP in London, said in a note to clients. </p> <h2>Fixed Income </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley exited some units within its fixed-income and commodities division and shrank capital dedicated to that segment. It had $210 billion of risk-weighted assets tied to the division at the end of December. The bank moved up its target for driving that number below $180 billion by one year, to 2015. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve is weighing further restrictions on banks'' trading and warehousing of physical commodities as Congress scrutinizes potential conflicts of interest and manipulation in those markets. The central bank said recent accidents and natural disasters have increased concerns about the businesses. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley agreed last month to sell a unit that stores, trades and transports oil products to a subsidiary of Russia''s OAO Rosneft. Porat said that unit broke even last year on a pretax basis. The firm has also said it''s exploring strategic options for its stake in TransMontaigne Inc., the Denver-based petroleum and chemical transportation and storage company. </p> <h2>Investment Banking </h2> <p>Investment banking, led by Mark Eichorn and Franck Petitgas, generated $1.36 billion in fourth-quarter revenue. That figure, up 11 percent from a year earlier, included $451 million from financial advisory, $416 million from equity underwriting and $495 million from debt underwriting. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley was the second-ranked adviser on global announced mergers and acquisitions in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was the No. 3 underwriter of global equity, equity-linked and rights offerings, the data show. </p> <p>Asset management reported a pretax gain of $337 million, compared with $221 million in the previous year''s period. </p> <p> ', 'Morgan Stanley Tops Estimates on Record Brokerage Earnings', 'By Michael J.

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s planned sale of a
physical oil unit to Russia''s OAO Rosneft will bring the bank in
line with regulators'' efforts to reduce risks posed by such
businesses, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley expects to say it''s also selling its stake
in TransMontaigne Inc., the petroleum and chemical
transportation and storage company, sooner rather than
later, Porat, 56, said today in an interview. The sale to
Rosneft of the oil-merchanting unit, which stores, trades and
transports oil products, will probably be completed in the
second half of this year, New York-based Morgan Stanley said
last month. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve is weighing more limits on banks''
trading and warehousing of physical commodities as Congress
scrutinizes potential dangers to the financial system, conflicts
of interest and manipulation in those markets. The central bank
this week issued a white paper seeking comment on the risks of
those units and said recent accidents and natural disasters have
increased those concerns. </p>
<p>Our focus on commodities is actually quite consistent
with the tenor of the questions within the white paper, Porat
said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s return on equity will also benefit from
the sale, she said, adding that the oil-merchanting business
broke even last year with $4 billion of risk-weighted assets.
The firm has set a goal of a 10 percent ROE in the fixed-income
and commodities business, and said low returns in commodities
and interest-rates-trading units kept it from achieving that in
2013. </p>
<h2>ROE Drag'' </h2>
<p>The commodities ROE is not near the level it should be,
Porat said. It''s a drag on overall ROE, and we''re very much
focused on that. </p>
<p>The bank moved up its target of holding less than $180
billion of risk-weighted assets in its fixed-income and
commodities unit by one year, to 2015. It had $210 billion in
that division at the end of 2013, down from about $300 billion
18 months earlier. </p>
<p>Risk-weighted assets determine how much capital a bank must
hold against certain activities under Basel III rules. </p>

understand the transaction and was misled by JPMorgan and the
bank''s law firm, Clifford Chance LLP. The owner of OK! Magazine,
dentists and elderly care homes have sued lenders over the sale
of derivatives they say they didn''t need or fully comprehend. </p>
<p>Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan, declined
to comment. BVG didn''t immediately respond to e-mails seeking
comment. Anna Ward, a spokeswoman for London-based Clifford
Chance, said the law firm should never have been sued. </p>
<p>We believe the claims against us are misconceived and
entirely without merit and we will continue to defend our
position robustly, Ward said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>0.19 Percent </h2>
<p>The chance of any defaults in the underlying portfolio for
the swap were 0.19 percent when it was signed, Rabinowitz said.
One of the companies linked to the transaction was Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc., which collapsed in 2008, sparking
turmoil in the markets. </p>
<p>Taking on a small risk, even vanishingly small, isn''t the
same thing as taking on no risk at all, Rabinowitz said. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps are agreements for one party to pay
another if a target goes bankrupt or fails to pay its debts. The
product can be used as a type of insurance, or to speculate on
the credit-worthiness of companies or assets. </p>
<p>JPMorgan staff shut their eyes to the fact that BVG had
misunderstood the complex credit derivative it was signing,
the transport body said in legal documents. Bank employees knew
BVG had no experience in this type of transaction, and gave a
misleading presentation about its risks, according to the
documents. </p>
<h2>Let Down'' </h2>
<p>BVG was badly let down by Clifford Chance, which had a
conflict of interest because it simultaneously advised both
JPMorgan and the BVG, the German company said in the documents.
The law firm should have turned down the work, or ceased to act,
because of the risk of a conflict of interest, BVG said. </p>
<p>JPMorgan fought for three years to have the case heard in
the U.K., with the European Court of Justice ruling in its favor
in 2011. BVG had sought a trial in Germany. </p>
<p>The trial is scheduled to last for 10 weeks. </p>
<p>The case is: JPMorgan Chase Bank  Anr v Berliner

<p>A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) unit won
a bid to halt Singaporean wealth-management client Oei Hong Leong''s lawsuit over trading losses on the Brazilian real in
favor of private arbitration. </p>
<p>The ruling was made in a closed hearing today at
Singapore''s High Court. Oei''s lawyer Siraj Omar said he planned
to appeal the decision. Edward Naylor, a Hong Kong-based
spokesman for Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the verdict. </p>
<p>Oei sued Goldman Sachs International in Singapore and the
parent company in New York, alleging the bank misled him into
trading real-yen options. He sought at least $31 million in
damages in each lawsuit. The bank has rejected allegations that
it acted improperly or cheated him, according to a letter it
wrote to Oei in July and filed in court. </p>
<p>Oei said he relied on the bank''s advice that the real was a
stable and liquid currency anchored to the U.S. dollar before
betting in May the yen would fall against the Brazilian
currency. </p>
<p>The real has fallen 12 percent since May 15 against the
yen, the second-worst performer among 16 major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, after the South African rand. The real has
declined three straight years as widening budget deficits
threaten to trigger Brazil''s first credit-rating downgrade since
2002. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs plans to ask a U.S. judge to dismiss the
lawsuit there in favor of arbitration or move it to Singapore,

<p>When her sister graduated from
Harvard University in 1981, Kathy Matsui''s father gave her a
choice: Get accepted, or get ready for a lifetime of labor
raising roses. </p>
<p>From the farm in Salinas, California, to Harvard and
Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. in Tokyo, the family work ethic has
underpinned a career that lifted Matsui to the top of her
profession. Now, 14 years after publishing her ideas on how to
upend gender roles in the Japanese workforce under a doctrine
known as womenomics, Matsui has the ear of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who made her research into a plank of his growth plan. </p>
<p>Warmness alone doesn''t make flowers bloom, Andy Matsui,
whose daughter later became Goldman Sachs'' first female partner
in his native Japan, said in a telephone interview last month.
You never hear a success story for a spoiled child. </p>
<p>Kathy Matsui arrived 24 years ago at her first brokerage
job in Tokyo at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities speaking
conversational Japanese. The mother of two, now 48 and fluent,
joined Goldman Sachs as chief Japan equity strategist in 1994
and was ranked the No. 1 stock market forecaster for Japan in
2000, 2001 and 2006 by Institutional Investor magazine. </p>
<p>Matsui''s interest in gender issues was piqued by her own
climb. She published the first womenomics report in August 1999,
arguing that equalizing roles in the workforce was a better
solution to Japan''s shrinking labor pool than loosening
immigration laws or raising the birth rate. Back then, the
proportion of working-age women with jobs was 56.7 percent,
according to the Statistics Bureau. In 2012, it was 60.7
percent, a record, though still not high enough, she says. In
the U.S., 69 percent of women between 25 and 54 had jobs in
2011, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. </p>
<h2>Change Needed </h2>
<p>Japan''s aging population and a debt burden twice as big as
its economy mean more must be done fast, according to Matsui. By
2035, one third of all Japanese will be 65 or older, up from 23
percent in 2010, according to the National Institute of
Population and Social Security Research. Japan could expand its
workforce by 8 million and increase its gross domestic product
as much as 14 percent by raising women in employment to about 80
percent, the same level as men, Matsui wrote in an April report. </p>
<p>We have to convince the Japanese people that running a
marathon with one leg is going to take a very long time,
Matsui said in an interview last month. It''s still an alien
concept that women might be working full-time. </p>
<h2>Work Ethic </h2>
<p>Matsui attributes her own work ethic to growing up in
Salinas. She attended Japanese language school on Saturdays,
went to church on Sundays and cut flowers by hand after classes
the rest of the week. Her mother, Mary, toiled in the family
nursery every day and learned English at night while raising
four children. </p>
<p>Despite wearing four layers of gloves, you still ended up
with thorns in your hands, Kathy Matsui said. But we got
used to it, that was our life. In my family, money didn''t just
fall from the sky. </p>
<p>With degrees in social studies from Harvard in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and international affairs from Baltimore-based
Johns Hopkins University, Matsui visited Japan for the first
time in 1986 on a Rotary scholarship. She moved to Tokyo to be
with Jesper Koll, now her husband, whom she met during an
internship at Mitsui Bank. </p>
<h2>Vital Component'' </h2>
<p>Invoking Matsui by name in a Sept. 25 essay for the Wall
Street Journal, Japan''s Abe said womenomics is a vital
component of his growth strategy. The premier has said he
wants a society where women can shine by eliminating waiting
lists for childcare and training mothers returning to work. He
has encouraged publicly-traded companies in Japan to have at
least one female executive and set a goal of women holding 30
percent of leadership positions in all areas of society by 2020,
when Tokyo hosts the summer Olympics. </p>
<p>Since he elevated this issue and made it a core part of
his growth strategy agenda, people started waking up, Matsui
said. The fact that he is even mentioning it is massive
progress compared to any of his predecessors. </p>
<p>Promoting women''s rights in Japan has long been a losing
battle. The World Economic Forum ranked the Asian nation 105th
out of 136 nations in its 2013 Global Gender Gap Report, which
measures economic, political, education and health differences
between men and women. Iceland was No. 1, followed by Finland
and Norway. The U.S. was 23rd and China 69th. </p>
<h2>Female Managers </h2>
<p>In Japan, female executives make up about 11 percent of
managerial jobs in the private sector, according to 2012 data
from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. Women are paid
about 71 percent as much as men, according to the ministry.
About 62 percent of Japanese women quit their jobs after their
first child is born, according to the IPSS. </p>
<p>Many of Matsui''s friends did. She thought about what would
happen if they kept working and it prompted her to write the
first report on gender in the workplace. </p>
<p>Very few of my Japanese clients reacted to it at the
time, though that wasn''t surprising since 99.9 percent of them
were male, she said. Since I had ''three strikes'' against me
as an inexperienced, foreign, female strategist, I knew the only
way I could succeed was to write differentiated research. </p>
<p>Competitors noticed a report that went past stock picking. </p>
<p>The female labor participation had risen in the 1990s,
but I found it interesting how she shed light on it, said
Chisato Haganuma, chief equity strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co., who has been Matsui''s competitor
for about 20 years. It was a very good report and strategy in
that it highlighted a change in our society rather than just
talking about which stocks would rise and fall. </p>
<h2>Stock-Picking </h2>
<p>In a study released on Oct. 1, 2010, Matsui listed 44
public companies in industries from daycare to nursing and food
preparation that she said reflected women''s values. They rose 86
percent through Dec. 27, compared with a 55 percent increase for
the Topix index, according to Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Her broader forecasts for Japanese equities have usually
been bullish, a stance that paid off last year when the Nikkei
225 Stock Average (NKY) beat every developed-market index. In
November, she raised her 12-month projection for the Topix to
1,450, about 11 percent higher than the gauge''s 2013 close and a
level unseen since 2007. The measure rose 0.2 percent to
1,295.95 yesterday. </p>
<p>Logic, intuition and contacts inform the calls, said Hiromi
Suzuki, a Tokyo-based analyst at Goldman Sachs who has worked
with Matsui since 1994, when they started the firm''s strategy
team for Japanese stocks. She described Matsui, who was named
managing director in 1998 and partner in 2000, as a serious,
energetic and honest person who doesn''t micromanage. </p>
<h2>Long Hours </h2>
<p>She''s tough mentally and physically and sticks to her
schedule, Suzuki said in an interview on Jan. 10. She always
tries her best to fulfill what she intends to do. Even if she
has five minutes to the deadline, she focuses on what she can do
within that time. </p>
<p>A nanny has enabled Matsui to work long hours and travel,
while her husband, Koll, runs Japanese equity research at
JPMorgan Securities Japan Co. The biggest challenge came in
2001, after her second child was born, when she was diagnosed
with breast cancer. </p>
<p>Just when I thought nothing could go wrong, everything
went wrong, she said. You just don''t know what twists and
turns life brings. I was naturally shocked when I received my
diagnosis, but facing my mortality at the age of 36 was actually
a giant wake-up call. </p>
<p>She took eight months off to recuperate in California with
her parents and received chemotherapy. She returned to Goldman
Sachs wearing a wig, deciding that staying at home all the time
would be more stressful. </p>
<h2>Demonstrating Womenomics'' </h2>
<p>I saw how hard she worked when she faced difficulties and
I learned what it''s like to be a strategist, said Naoki Kamiyama, who worked for Matsui from 2000 to 2002 and is now
chief equity strategist at Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Co.
In a way, she''s demonstrating womenomics by herself. It''s
perfectionism. She embodies it. </p>
<p>Matsui''s travel usually keeps her away from her family for
two to three months a year, triggering maternal guilt, she
said. While it may be a sign that you''re really busy, I always
feel guilty about spending so much time away from my husband and
children. </p>
<p>Yoga at 8 a.m. on Saturdays helps her body, and Nutella, a
Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, warms her spirit. When times are
toughest, though, Matsui said she thinks about her mother. </p>
<p>I learned a tremendous amount from my mother and
developed a newfound respect for her the minute I became a
mother myself, she said. Whenever I have those moments when
I''m really stressed out, I just think about what my mom had to
go through and it puts everything in perspective. </p>

<p>General Mills Inc. (GIS) sold its first
dollar-denominated bonds in about a year as relative yields on
investment-grade securities in the U.S. fell to the lowest level
since before the start of the credit crisis in 2007. A measure
of U.S. company credit risk increased. </p>
<p>General Mills issued $750 million of securities in two
parts, including a $250 million floating-rate portion paying 20
basis points more than the three-month London interbank offered
rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The cereal maker was joined by banks from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) to Morgan Stanley (MS) in offering $11.7 billion of bonds in what
was the busiest day since Jan. 15, Bloomberg data show. The
extra yield investors demand to own the notes instead of
Treasuries fell 2 basis points last week to 123 basis points,
the least since July 2007, the Bank of America Merrill Lynch
U.S. Corporate Index shows. </p>
<p>The backdrop for corporate bonds is good, Anthony Valeri, a market strategist in San Diego with LPL Financial
Corp., which manages about $415 billion, said in a telephone
interview. The economy looks like it''s accelerating. </p>
<p>The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark used to hedge against losses or
to speculate on creditworthiness, added 0.3 basis point from
Jan. 17 to 65.5 basis points as of 4:15 p.m. in New York,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The market was closed
in the U.S. yesterday for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day
holiday. </p>
<h2>General Mills </h2>
<p>The swaps gauge typically rises as investor confidence
deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts pay the
buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations,
less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals
$1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of debt. </p>
<p>When spreads are narrow, obviously it lowers the cost of
potential debt, so in general, you''ll always see corporates come
to market when spreads are tighter, Valeri said. </p>
<p>General Mills also sold $500 million of 3.65 percent, 10-year notes to yield 85 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The transaction was rated A3 by
Moody''s Investors Service, the credit grader said in a
statement. A portion of the proceeds will be used to repay
commercial paper. </p>
<h2>JPMorgan Offering </h2>
<p>JPMorgan sold $5.25 billion of securities in five parts,
including $1 billion of 4.85 percent, 30-year bonds to yield
112.5 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
Bloomberg data show. Morgan Stanley issued $2 billion of 2.5
percent, five-year notes and $750 million of floating-rate
securities, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>International investors are the most upbeat about the
global economy than at any time in almost five years, buoyed by
the U.S.-led revival of industrial nations, according to the
Bloomberg Global Poll. On the eve of the World Economic Forum''s
annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, 59 percent of Bloomberg
subscribers surveyed last week said the economic outlook is
improving. That''s up from 33 percent in November and marks the
most optimistic result since the poll began in July 2009. </p>
<p>The risk premium on the Markit CDX North American High
Yield Index, tied to the debt of 100 speculative-grade
companies, added 1 basis point to 318.7 basis points from Jan.
17, Bloomberg prices show. High-yield, high-risk bonds are rated
below Baa3 by Moody''s and less than BBB- at SP. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point. </p>

corporate bonds rather than government debt was little changed

<p>At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
Sachs''s revenue from investment banking had been falling in
Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
people familiar with the matter said last year. </p>
<p>About a quarter of Goldman Sachs''s roughly 45-person Brazil
investment-banking division have departed, four people with
knowledge of the moves said in November. </p>
<p>Our headcount in Brazil is going to be steady at around
300 people, though it may go up 5 percent or down 5 percent,
Stephen Scherr, Goldman Sachs''s chief for Latin America and
global head of the investment bank''s financing group, said in an

people is going to change -- and that is by design, Scherr

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) said it will drop its
remaining claims in a lawsuit against Joseph Chip Skowron
after a federal judge ordered the former fund manager and
convicted inside trader to repay $31 million in compensation. </p>
<p>Kevin Marino, a lawyer for Morgan Stanley, said today in a
letter to U.S. District Court Judge Shira Scheindlin in
Manhattan that it has decided to drop the remaining claims for
breach of contract and fraud. </p>
<p>Skowron has already reimbursed Morgan Stanley $6.4 million
for compensation he received while working as a fund manager at
the New York-based bank''s FrontPoint Partners LLC., Marino said
in his letter to the court. He asked the judge for a final order
directing Skowron to reimburse the bank for the remaining
$24.6 million. </p>
<p>The judgment that we secured last month was clearly in
excess of Mr. Skowron''s assets, so to continue to pursue
additional claims was pointless, Marino said in a phone
interview. We secured a judgment so now we''ll proceed to
collecting on it. </p>
<p>Skowron, 44, managed FrontPoint until he was charged by the
U.S. in 2011 with using inside information to avoid $30 million
in losses. He is one of 83 people who have been accused of
insider trading by prosecutors in the office of Manhattan U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in probes during the past six years of
hedge fund managers, company insiders and expert networking
firms. So far, 78 of the people charged by the U.S. have been
convicted while none have been acquitted at trial. </p>
<p>Joshua Epstein, a lawyer for Skowron, declined to comment
on Morgan Stanley''s decision to drop the claims. </p>
<h2>Guilty Plea </h2>
<p>The bank sued Skowron after he pleaded guilty to conspiring
to commit securities fraud and obstruct justice. </p>
<p>Scheindlin last month granted Morgan Stanley''s request for
summary judgment, or a ruling before trial, on a faithless
servant claim alleging that Skowron failed to fulfill his
duties to the bank. </p>
<p>In August 2011, Skowron admitted using secret tips he got
from a French physician to help FrontPoint avoid more than $30
million in trading losses on Human Genome Sciences Inc., a
Rockville, Maryland, pharmaceutical firm that was acquired by
GlaxoSmithKline Plc. (GSK) </p>
<p>Skowron, a Yale University and Harvard University-trained
doctor who quit medicine for Wall Street, is serving a five-year
term at McKean Federal Correction Institution in northwestern
Pennsylvania, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons
website. </p>
<p>The case is Morgan Stanley v. Skowron, 12-cv-08016, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley is approaching hedge
funds and buyers of distressed debt to gauge interest in a
possible Puerto Rico bond sale to boost the island''s cash flow,
according to three people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank has been talking with investors in
the past week to assess demand for a potential borrowing of as
much as $2 billion, said the people, who requested anonymity
because the conversations are private. </p>
<p>The U.S. territory, rated one step above junk, needs to
borrow through the financial markets or face a possible cut to
speculative grade. The island and its agencies have issued $70
billion of debt. Because the bonds are tax-exempt in all states,
about 70 percent of municipal-debt mutual funds own the
securities, according to Morningstar Inc. </p>
<p>Lauren Bellmare, a spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley (MS), declined
to comment. The Government Development Bank, which handles
Puerto Rico''s debt transactions, declined to comment, said Alix
Anfang, a spokeswoman in New York. </p>
<p>Discussions about a potential deal were said to have
revived this past week after talks in November and December
sputtered when Puerto Rico officials didn''t show interest. </p>
<p>The taxable general-obligation deal said to be under
discussion would have maturities of at least five to seven
years. The funds would assist the commonwealth as it struggles
to turn around its shrinking economy. </p>
<h2>10 Percent </h2>
<p>The discussions have cited possible yields of about 10
percent, the people said. </p>
<p>The New York Times reported the discussions between Morgan
Stanley and the funds earlier. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico bonds are luring hedge funds and buyers of
speculative-grade corporate and sovereign debt after the
island''s securities posted their biggest annual decline since
1999. Commonwealth debt lost 20 percent in 2013, compared with a
2.6 percent loss for the entire municipal market, Standard 
Poor''s data show. </p>
<p>The island''s strained finances have also drawn Wall Street
banks and law firms trying to boost trading and advisory fees.
The firms are typically acting on their own, without the
involvement of Puerto Rico officials. </p>
<p>Jones Day, the law firm shepherding Detroit through
bankruptcy, held a seminar last week on the commonwealth''s debt. </p>
<h2>Payment Promise </h2>
<p>Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla, who took office a year
ago, has said the island of 3.6 million people will repay its
obligations on time and in full. The territory''s officials have
also said they have sufficient funds to last them through June
30 without selling bonds. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico debt has rallied this month as investors added
the most money since September to high-yield muni mutual funds,
Lipper US Fund Flows data show. </p>
<p>General obligations maturing in July 2041 traded today at
an average yield of 8.82 percent, down from 9.2 percent at year-end, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Puerto Rico officials plan to sell long-term debt this
month or in February after they said rising interest rates last
quarter prevented issuance of as much as $1.2 billion of sales-tax debt. </p>

lower relative cost to borrow than before the financial crisis
even after ceding more than a year''s profit to settle disputes
linked to faulty mortgages and Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank borrowed $5.25 billion yesterday in
an offering that included 10-year securities yielding 1.125
percentage points more than Treasuries, the narrowest spread
among similar JPMorgan notes since 2005. The measure, used to
gauge creditworthiness, has contracted from 1.33 points a year

settlements in 2013, which helped end a three-year streak of
record annual earnings even as it led the world in corporate-bond underwriting for the sixth straight year. While litigation
expenses may remain elevated in 2014, JPMorgan''s earnings power
means any legal issues should be manageable, according to

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Westpac
Banking Corp. pushed back their forecasts for when Australia''s
central bank will lower interest rates, with the strongest
inflation in two years offsetting rising joblessness. </p>
<p>They join Bank of America Corp. and Royal Bank of Canada,
which shifted their predictions in the past three months. The
estimates for delayed easing come as reports paint a mixed
picture of the economy''s transition to new growth sources amid
the ebbing of a mining boom. Having priced in a 26 percent
chance of a first-quarter rate cut after the weak jobs report on
Jan. 16, swaps traders slashed the odds to 11 percent after Jan.
22 data showed inflation was accelerating. </p>
<p>There are some fundamental problems in the economy,
said Stephen Walters, JPMorgan''s chief economist in Australia,
citing below-trend growth and rising unemployment in a phone
interview yesterday. Yet, an inflation number like that makes
it difficult for the Reserve Bank to do anything about those
issues in the near term. </p>
<p>A report this week showed the trimmed mean gauge of core
prices unexpectedly rose 2.6 percent in the last three months of
2013 from a year earlier, climbing above the mid-point of the
central bank''s target range and the strongest reading since
2011. That followed data showing the worst annual drop in full-time jobs in more than two decades. Australia''s Treasury
predicts the unemployment rate will increase to 6 percent by
July 1, the highest since 2003, from 5.8 percent in December. </p>
<p>The pickup in the pace of consumer-price gains is almost
exclusively due to a decline in the Australian dollar last
year, Bill Evans, chief economist at Westpac, wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. The acceleration will prove short-lived
and policy rates will be cut once the data confirms this
outlook, he wrote. </p>
<h2>Secondary Impact'' </h2>
<p>Weakness in domestic demand will contain the secondary
impact on inflation from the weaker currency, Evans wrote.
The Reserve Bank is likely to require convincing evidence of
our assessment of inflation risks before it opts for lower
interest rates. </p>
<p>Australia''s cash rate stands at a record-low 2.5 percent.
Westpac now sees it at 2 percent by the end of 2014, after two
0.25 percentage point reductions in the second half. That
compares with a previous call for cuts in the second and third
quarters. </p>
<p>Bank of America said in a Jan. 10 note that the RBA will
trim its benchmark to 2.25 percent by mid-year, from an earlier
prediction for February. RBC pushed its call for a quarter-point
cut to the three months through June, from December 2013
previously, according to an Oct. 14 report. </p>
<p>The median forecast of 29 economists is for the cash rate
to remain unchanged through 2014, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. </p>
<h2>Lower Aussie </h2>
<p>The Australian dollar fell 0.2 percent this week to 87.68
U.S. cents as of 9 a.m. in Sydney and yesterday touched 87.32,

pressures will keep the central bank from lowering its key rate
further after slashing it 2.25 percentage points over two years. </p>
<p>The RBA has indicated it would prefer a lower exchange rate
to stimulate the economy. Governor Glenn Stevens said last month
in an Australian Financial Review interview that a level of 85
U.S. cents would be closer to the mark. The Aussie won''t
fall to that level until the final quarter of this year,
according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Policy makers will probably keep trying to verbally drive
the local currency lower, according to JPMorgan''s Walters. </p>
<p>Even so, it''s very difficult, seemingly, for the Aussie
to break meaningfully to the downside, said Walters, who sees
the currency at 87 by Dec. 31. The onus is going to be on the
cash rate to do the work. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the right investor for Dong Energy A/S, a top official of Denmark''s ruling Social Democrats said, defending the Wall Street firm against criticism from other parliament members. </p> <p>Goldman''s European merchant banking unit is seeking to buy an 18 percent stake in state-controlled Dong, a utility in need of new equity after losing money on failed natural gas bets. Some Danish lawmakers want to block the 8 billion-krone ($1.5 billion) purchase, saying Goldman Sachs bears responsibility for the global financial crisis and that the government is giving the New York-based company too much control. </p> <p>If we were to not deal with banks until we had bashed all those who deserved to get bashed, we would never get anywhere, and we have to move on, Benny Engelbrecht, the Social Democrats'' business spokesman, said in an interview in Copenhagen. Applying that kind of logic would leave us without any banks to work with. </p> <p>According to the government''s Dec. 3 proposal, Goldman Sachs will be able to veto a possible sale of new shares or hybrid capital, any change in Dong''s senior management or acquisitions before a possible 2018 initial public offering. The state will retain a 57.3 percent stake in Skaerbaek-based Dong, which also operates offshore wind parks and explores for oil and gas. </p> <h2>Fascinated'' </h2> <p>Other minority owners are ATP and PFA, the country''s two largest pension funds, as well as five local energy companies. Neither will get the same veto powers. </p> <p>The Red-Green Alliance, which has 12 of 179 seats in parliament, says the state, not Goldman Sachs, should inject the money that Dong needs. The alliance, which includes former members of Denmark''s communist party, has filed more than 100 questions to the finance ministry regarding the sales process and the privileges given to Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>We would have liked if the government had considered who Goldman are and what they want, Stine Brix, the deputy financial speaker for the party, said in an interview. Goldman has a very doubled-faced story. On one hand, everybody is fascinated with how good they are, but they also act without guilt or remorse. </p> <h2>Abusive'' </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs in July 2010 agreed to pay $550 million and change its business practices to settle the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission''s claims that the firm misled investors in a 2007 product linked to subprime mortgages. The firm didn''t admit or deny wrongdoing. </p> <p>A U.S. Senate subcommittee''s report in 2011 said Goldman Sachs relied on abusive sales practices and was rife with conflicts of interest that encouraged putting profits ahead of clients. While Goldman Sachs said it disagreed with many of the Senate report''s finding, the firm also noted that it undertook a review of its business practices and released a 63-page report on its findings. </p> <p>This is a long-term investment and we support the management team''s current strategy across the company''s activities, including the significant renewable energy investments, Sophie Ramsay, a London-based spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. This strategy, supported by the Danish State and other minority shareholders, will create value for all shareholders in the years to come. </p> <h2>Morally Wrong </h2> <p>Selling to Goldman Sachs is morally wrong, jeopardizes Denmark''s green agenda and will prove to be a financial mistake, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, a former Danish prime minister, was quoted as saying in an interview published by newspaper Politiken today. Nyrup Rasmussen, a Social Democrat, has also served as leader of the Europe-wide socialist group in the European Union. </p> <p>Bjarne Corydon, Denmark''s current finance minister and also a Social Democrat, defended the sale in an interview broadcast by TV2 News. </p> <p>I can understand that there''s a debate about banks'' behavior in the wake of the financial crisis, Corydon said in response to Nyrup Rasmussen''s comment. Dong was in a situation where money was needed. We have chosen a proactive answer, the green answer, by going with the investment strategy. </p> <h2>Opposition Growing </h2> <p>The Danish People''s Party, which has 22 seats in Denmark''s assembly, initially backed the government''s plan to find private investors for Dong. Now the party has threatened to withdraw its support. </p> <p>We don''t understand why Goldman should be able to hire and fire the management or why they need to be able to veto the strategy when it''s already in place, said Rene Christensen, financial spokesman for party. The government says there''s no need to worry about the clauses, but that only made us more curious as to why they had to make them in the first place. </p> <p>Even as opposition to the Goldman Sachs deal is growing, the government will probably be able to pass the proposal with the support of the Conservative Party and the Liberals Party, Engelbrecht of the Social Democrats said. The Liberals are Denmark''s biggest opposition party. </p> <p>Engelbrecht last year led lawmakers'' push for rules that require Denmark''s biggest lenders, including Danske Bank A/S to hold additional capital reserves to prevent a future banking crisis. While Goldman played a role in the financial crisis, the bank is no worse than others, Engelbrecht said. </p> <p>Goldman is getting bashed for the same reason Danske Bank got bashed. It''s the icon of capitalism and greed, though at a whole different level than Danske Bank, he said. The critics forget that this investment is being made by the division in Goldman that actually specializes in renewables, and with the level of professionalism displayed by Goldman, that''s not a bad thing. </p> <p> ', 'Goldman Defended by Danish Lawmaker in Dong Buyout Dispute', 'By Peter Levring', 'Jan 23, 2014  3:08 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-23/goldman-defended-by-danish-lawmaker-in-dong-buyout-dispute.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) gave Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon a 74 percent raise to $20 million last year, bringing his pay closer to where it stood before he was penalized for faulty oversight of botched derivatives bets. </p> <p>The board''s compensation package for Dimon, 57, who also serves as chairman, included $18.5 million in restricted stock, the New York-based lender said today in a regulatory filing. His salary was unchanged at $1.5 million and he got no cash bonus, according to the filing. </p> <p>Board members decided to keep Dimon''s pay below previous peak levels after criminal and regulatory probes cost JPMorgan more than $23 billion in settlements during 2013. The directors cut his 2012 package in half last January to $11.5 million, saying he bore ultimate responsibility for failures that led to derivatives trading losses in the London Whale episode. </p> <p>In raising Dimon''s pay, the board of directors cited sustained long-term performance; gains in market share and customer satisfaction; and the regulatory issues the company has faced and the steps the company has taken to resolve those issues, according to the filing. </p> <p>The restricted stock vests 50 percent after two years and 50 percent after three years, the bank said. Awarding Dimon''s total bonus in shares ties his pay to the company''s future performance, including continued progress on the company''s regulatory agenda, the firm said. </p> <h2>Performance Priority </h2> <p>The board''s compensation committee is led by Lee Raymond, 75, Exxon Mobil Corp.''s former chairman and CEO. JPMorgan''s stock climbed 33 percent last year, matching the 81-company Standard  Poor''s 500 Financials Index. </p> <p>Obviously they paid more attention to the operational performance and stock-price performance and less to the litigation issues, said Joseph Sorrentino, a managing director at Steven Hall  Partners, a New York-based compensation consulting firm. Maybe there''s an argument that settling those items at those levels and removing the uncertainty there, maybe that''s worth something as well, but hard to know. </p> <p>Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake, 44, received 80,346 shares, worth $4.65 million at the price of $57.875, the level at which Dimon''s shares were valued. Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames, 43, received stock valued at $9.75 million, as did Mike Cavanagh, 48, co-head of the firm''s corporate and investment bank. </p> <h2>Shareholder Support </h2> <p>Daniel Pinto, 51, the other co-head, received the same total pay as Cavanagh, and it was structured differently because of compensation rules in the U.K. where Pinto is based, according to a person briefed on the awards. </p> <p>Any cash awards for named executives will be disclosed in the firm''s proxy statement later this year. </p> <p>Dimon became CEO at the end of 2005 and added the title of chairman a year later. His reputation as a top manager, along with his pay, has fluctuated since then. While JPMorgan emerged from the financial crisis as the only large U.S. bank to avoid quarterly losses, the trading debacle in 2012 prompted some investors to call for splitting his dual roles. Shareholders rejected that proposal at a meeting in May. </p> <p>Dimon was paid $49.9 million for 2007, including special stock awards. During the financial crisis a year later, he took only a $1 million salary. He got $15.2 million for 2009, and $23 million for each of the two years that followed. </p> <h2>Settlement Costs </h2> <p>In last year''s third quarter, the bank posted its first loss on Dimon''s watch after taking a $7.2 billion charge to cover the cost of mounting litigation and regulatory probes. The deficit ended the firm''s streak of three record annual profits. Full-year net income fell 16 percent to $17.9 billion. </p> <p>Dimon pushed last year to resolve government investigations, including at least eight Justice Department probes listed in the firm''s quarterly report in October. </p> <p>Settlements since then have included a record $13 billion deal to resolve inquiries into mortgage-bond sales. The bank paid $2.6 billion and avoided criminal prosecution while settling claims it failed to stop Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. The firm also paid more than $1 billion last year tied to the botched derivatives bets, which lost more than $6.2 billion in 2012. In that case, U.S. and U.K. regulators faulted its oversight of a trader known as the London Whale because his positions were so large. </p> <p>Dimon told journalists earlier this month that he couldn''t predict whether he might be able to put the legal disputes behind the bank this year. </p> <p> ', 'JPMorgan Gives CEO Dimon 74% Raise to $20 Million in 2013', 'By Michael J.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is working
for EBay Inc. (EBAY) as it faces calls from Carl Icahn to split off its
PayPal unit, people with knowledge of the matter said, the
investment bank''s latest assignment with a technology company
facing an activist investor. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is a long-time adviser to EBay on a number of
issues, Amanda Miller, spokeswoman for the online marketplace,
said while declining to discuss the specifics of the bank''s current
role regarding Icahn''s efforts. We did not engage them specifically 
for this matter, she said. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank also has advised Apple (AAPL) Inc. and
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the people said, asking not to be identified
discussing private information. Apple faces calls for a bigger
stock buyback from Icahn, and Microsoft recently said it will
allow ValueAct Capital Management LLC President Mason Morfit to
join its board. </p>
<p>Investment banks are building up practices that advise
companies on how to deter and respond to activists, as the
investors garner more money and institutional backing. Funds
managed by activists have almost tripled over five years, to $93
billion at the end of last year from about $32 billion in 2008,
according to data compiled by Hedge Fund Research. </p>
<p>At Goldman Sachs, the activist defense practice has been
spearheaded by partner Bill Anderson, who joined the bank in
2000. Anderson was previously an MA lawyer at Simpson Thacher 
Bartlett LLP. </p>
<h2>Engaging Activists </h2>
<p>Icahn informed EBay last week he had begun purchasing the
online marketplace''s shares and was nominating two directors to
its board, the company said. Icahn called a separation of PayPal
-- one of EBay''s faster-growing businesses -- from the company a
no-brainer in an interview on Bloomberg TV. </p>
<p>Tony Imperati, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to
comment, as did Andrew Williams, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Lately, companies have been more proactively engaging
activists before their efforts become public. Icahn''s demands
for for the PayPal split were disclosed by the San Jose,
California-based company in its quarterly earnings report. </p>
<p>EBay Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe spoke with Icahn
last week and said on a conference call the company should stay
together, citing how the intertwined entity helps fund PayPal''s
expansion into areas such as mobile. The payments unit boosted
sales 19 percent last quarter, outpacing 12 percent sales growth
at EBay''s marketplace unit, which faces stiff competition from
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) </p>
<h2>Technology Targets </h2>
<p>Icahn''s EBay investment follows a string of actions by
activists taking on Silicon Valley technology firms, especially
as some of the companies'' rapid growth rates slow. Icahn has
this week tweeted that he increased his stake in Apple. </p>
<p>He is proposing that the company commit to buying back at
least $50 billion worth of shares in fiscal 2014, something that
Apple is recomending investors vote against. Goldman Sachs
advised Apple''s board as it weighed an earlier push from
Greenlight Capital Inc.''s David Einhorn to issue more preferred
stock which would pay a higher dividend than common stock. </p>
<p>Microsoft signed a pact to cooperate with ValueAct in
August, four months after the activist fund disclosed a stake of
about $1.9 billion in the software maker and at the deadline for
proxy contests ahead of a November annual meeting. ValueAct, the
San Francisco-based firm headed by Jeffrey Ubben, has since
increased its stake. </p>
<p>As part of the agreement, Microsoft said it would allow
Morfit to join the board and hold regular meetings with Morfit,
directors and select management. </p>
<p>Technology companies Hewlett-Packard Co., Juniper Networks
Inc. and Riverbed Technology Inc. are also facing activist
pressure. </p>

<p>This week''s decline in financial
markets isn''t surprising because the value of those assets has
risen sharply during the past year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein said. </p>
<p>It would be very abnormal if we didn''t have consolidating
moves in the assets that have gone up so much, Blankfein, 59,

of emerging-market assets, Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn
said in a separate interview. While the recent moves are not
extraordinary, investors should expect larger swings than in
the past as banks that serve as market-makers pull back amid new
restrictions and capital rules, Cohn said. </p>

increase capital charges, you''ve seen all of the banks reduce

<p>AMP Capital Australian Corporate
Bond Fund (AMPACBA), which outperformed its peers over the past decade,
prefers U.S. and European banks to the South Pacific nation''s
lenders on improving economic prospects in those two regions. </p>
<p>Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY), 2013''s best-performing corporate
bond, is the fund''s biggest holding, the AMP website shows. BNP
Paribas SA, JPMorgan Chase  Co. are among the top 10, which
include Westpac Banking Corp. as the only Australia-based
lender. The AMP fund returned 6.2 percent in 2013, beating 21 of
its peers, according to Morningstar Australia Pty. It topped the
ranks of funds that invest mainly in Australian bonds over the
past decade with an average return of 7.4 percent. </p>
<p>Australia''s growth will trail the U.S. for the first time
in four years as a mining boom cools, according to a Bloomberg
survey of economists. The cost premium for protecting debt of
the Big Four Australian banks over U.S. counterparts touched the
most in almost six years this month. </p>
<p>The kind of banks that we''ve identified in places like
the U.S., in parts of Europe and the U.K., and to a lesser
extent in Australia, were all going to benefit from economies
that were improving, said Mark Beardow, 46, who runs the A$2
billion ($1.75 billion) fund in Sydney. Many parts of the
global corporate bond market are continuing to meaningfully
deleverage, particularly financials. </p>
<h2>Six-Year High </h2>
<p>The average cost of credit-default swaps on Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, Westpac and the country''s next two biggest
lenders versus the seven biggest U.S. banks widened to 17.4
basis points on Jan. 3, the most since March 2008. It was 12.4
basis points as of yesterday. </p>
<p>Beardow, who talked by telephone yesterday, manages the
fund in Sydney with Jeff Brunton and David Carruthers. </p>
<p>U.S. economic growth will quicken by 0.9 percentage point
this year to 2.8 percent, based on Bloomberg News surveys of
economists. The euro area''s economy will go to a 1 percent
expansion from a 0.4 percent contraction. In Australia, the pace
will pick up by 0.35 percentage point to 2.75 percent. </p>
<p>The bonds of London-based Lloyds returned about 8 percent
on average last year, the most among the biggest 50 corporate
issuers in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch''s Global Corporate
 High Yield Index. The bank''s debt issued in Australia returned
4.95 percent in 2013, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
indexes. </p>
<h2>Big Four </h2>
<p>The returns beat the bonds of Commonwealth Bank, Westpac,
Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. and National
Australia Bank Ltd., the nation''s four biggest lenders. The
latter topped the list with a 4.71 percent gain, the data show. </p>
<p>Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Glenn Stevens cut the
benchmark interest rate to a record low of 2.5 percent last year
to maintain economic growth as the economy struggles to
diversify amid a drop-off in mining investment. </p>
<p>Beardow said he favors shorter-term securities in case
yields rise. The fund''s duration was 1.39 years in December,
versus 2.76 years for the benchmark it uses to gauge
performance, according to the AMP website. Duration is a measure
of a portfolio''s sensitivity to changes in bond yields, and a
smaller figure offers more protection should borrowing costs
increase. </p>
<p>U.S. 10-year yields will be 3 percent to 3.5 percent by
year-end, he said, from 2.76 percent as of 1:31 p.m. today in
Sydney. </p>
<p>Australian 10-year yields will climb to 4.25-4.75 percent,
according to Beardow, from 4.05 percent today. Yields on U.S.
and Australian government securities due in 10 years and longer
have a correlation of 0.948. A figure of 1 means they move in
lock-step. </p>
<h2>Fair Value'' </h2>
<p>Now we think rates are largely fair value, he said.
We see fair value continuing to edge up. The RBA will keep
its benchmark at 2.5 percent this year, he said. </p>
<p>Bill Evans, the top-ranked chief economist at Westpac, says
Stevens will need to cut the benchmark rate to 2 percent. Evans
is the most accurate forecaster on Australia''s economy,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>I would expect to see yields down in this country,
Evans said in a Jan. 24 interview. That would suggest that you
should be buying bonds. We''re not concerned about any credit
risks associated with the banking sector. Bank bonds would
similarly track the capital appreciation that we''re expecting in
government bonds. </p>
<p>Ten-year yields will fall to 4 percent by year-end, Evans
said in a Bloomberg survey of banks conducted Jan. 16 to Jan.
21. It was the lowest forecast among 15 responses. An investor
who bought today would earn about 4 percent if the forecast is
correct, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The AMP Australian Corporate fund can invest up to 30
percent of its assets in global corporate bonds, Beardow said.
The challenge is to generate income with company notes and
protect returns against higher borrowing costs, he said. </p>
<p>We''re pretty positive about the economy, he said. We
want to be particularly active around the possibility that
yields do rise very sharply, and we''re keeping duration pretty

that it will expand its food and beverage business in Mexico,

long-term growth. The maker of Cheetos and Pepsi Cola controls
more than 65 percent of Mexico''s sales of sweet and savory
snacks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Japanese leaders are unlikely to
roll out major new economic policies to boost growth this year,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Officials who fought deflation last year through measures
including quantitative easing, monetary stimulus and increased
government spending will opt for policy stability, said Kathy Matsui, chief Japan strategist at the New York-based bank. </p>
<p>This year, I don''t think you are going to get major
bazooka-type policy announcements, Matsui said in an interview
to Bloomberg Radio today. I think it is more a question of
looking for the fundamental improvement both in the macro
economy and corporate level. </p>
<p>Japan has pledged to forge ahead with structural reforms
designed to open business opportunities in industries from
health care to agriculture as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe leads
efforts to break the legacy of 15 years of deflation. The
administration''s attempts helped propel Japan''s Topix index of
shares up 51 percent last year, its best performance since 1999. </p>
<p>Abe''s stimulus program caused an 18 percent weakening in
the yen against the dollar last year, helping exporters. The
Japanese currency fell 0.1 percent to 102.79 per greenback as of
9:45 p.m. in Tokyo today, while the benchmark 10-year yield was
at 0.63 percent compared with 0.745 percent a year earlier. </p>
<p>Matsui said the depreciation in yen is not completely
beneficial to Japan as it increased the cost of growing fossil-fuel imports in the wake of nuclear-plant shutdowns. Japan
reported a record annual trade deficit for 2013. </p>
<p>The weaker the yen becomes the more expensive that fuel
becomes, so it is not a unanimous positive for everybody, she
said. Therefore, I think the currency at this kind of level
anywhere from 100 or around 100 yen to a dollar is actually not
too bad for most companies be they exporters or importers. </p>

Nov. 7. It yielded 5.67 percent on Jan. 9 before the criticism
intensified over New York-based Goldman''s investment. That was

<p>A rate cut is the European Central
Bank''s best option to respond to rising borrowing costs in euro-area money markets, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a note. </p>
<p>Overnight interbank rates were above the central bank''s
benchmark interest rate this month for the longest stretch since
2011. ECB President Mario Draghi said on Jan. 9 that officials
are ready to act as needed in response to unwarranted
tightening of the short-term money markets. </p>
<p>It is only a matter of time before the ECB will have to
address the issue, Dirk Schumacher, an economist at Goldman
Sachs in Frankfurt, said in the e-mailed note. A cut in the key
rate seems in principle the best option if the ECB wants to
guarantee short-term money market rates close to zero. </p>
<p>Policy makers gathering in Frankfurt on Feb. 6 for their
monthly rate-setting meeting have to assess whether the tighter
financing conditions show a resurgence of tensions that justify
a policy response or simply increased confidence in the region''s
economic recovery. The bank cut its benchmark rate to a record-low 0.25 percent in November. </p>
<p>The overnight unsecured lending rate for banks in euros was
above that level for the four days through Jan. 21 and climbed
as high as 0.359 percent on Jan. 20. It fell for a fifth day
yesterday, declining to 0.188 percent. </p>
<h2>Liquidity Drop </h2>
<p>Excess liquidity in the euro area, the surplus cash in the
financial system that isn''t immediately needed by banks to meet
their obligations, was at 170.3 billion euros ($232.3 billion)
yesterday after dropping last week to 125.5 billion euros, the
least since December 2011. </p>
<p>The ECB failed for a second week to sterilize government
bond purchases conducted under the now-terminated Securities
Markets Program. That may be a signal that banks are reluctant
to part with liquidity. </p>
<p>The central bank''s key rate will fall to 0.1 percent and
the deposit rate, which is currently at zero, to minus 0.1
percent by March, according to Barclays Plc and Commerzbank AG
in reports this month. Royal Bank of Canada said the main rate
will be reduced while the deposit rate stays at zero. Alessandro
Giansanti, a rates strategist at ING Bank NV in Amsterdam, said
the benchmark will be cut within three months. </p>
<p>Schumacher said that while the ECB will probably keep rates
unchanged at the February meeting, an eventual cut in the
benchmark rate to 0.1 percent would be the most effective
measure. He said that one negative side-effect of a
reduction may be that a narrowing of spreads between official
rates could curb the incentive of banks to lend to each other. </p>

- it''s like 100 percent, Zolfaghari said in an interview at
Bloomberg''s Sao Paulo office about the number of towers needed
in Brazil. They need to be doubled to properly attend to
current needs. </p>
<h2>Blackstone, Fishman </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Gavea Investimentos Ltda., the Brazilian
hedge-fund firm founded by former central bank president Arminio Fraga, last year unveiled tower-investment fund Cell Site
Solutions, while Patria Investimentos SA, a firm that includes
Blackstone Group LP (BX) among its investors, has allocated 300
million reais ($123 million) of capital to its Highline do
Brasil. </p>
<p>Other companies planning to build towers in Brazil are T4U
Tower Management, which is backed by Israel''s Fishman Group; QMC
Telecom International Holdings, whose investors include Peterson
Partners LP and Housatonic Partners; and Brazil Tower. </p>
<p>An outside spokeswoman for Goldman declined to comment on
behalf of the company, as did an outside spokesman for Patria.
Representatives from Peterson, Fishman and QMC didn''t respond to
requests for comment. </p>
<p>More Brazilians are buying smartphones, while providers
like Telefonica''s Vivo brand and America Movil SAB (AMX)''s Claro unit
are pushing data services to boost revenue, according to the
companies'' financial reports. </p>
<h2>Regulatory Crackdown </h2>
<p>Tim was among the companies forced by regulatory agency
Anatel to stop selling new lines for about 10 days in 2012 to
address complaints about dropped calls. The crackdown, along
with millions of reais in fines in the past several years, is
putting pressure on companies to improve customer satisfaction. </p>
<p>Vivo needs 10,000 new towers in the next two years to meet
traffic growth and government quality mandates, Chief Executive
Officer Antonio Carlos Valente said in an interview. </p>
<p>We are starting to feel difficulties in the availability
of steel and labor, Valente said about challenges in building
new towers. </p>
<p>Anatel doesn''t regulate the tower market and sees demand
increasing significantly in coming years. </p>
<p>This is a good business for tower builders, said Anatel
Superintendent Carlos Baigorri. Third-party tower builders
will allow operators to focus on their core business. </p>
<p>Of the 6,680 new sites needed in Brazil, about 2,780 will
be towers built by the operators themselves or shared towers in
which companies install equipment alongside competitors. </p>
<h2>Profitable Sites </h2>
<p>Brazil Tower builds towers for 200,000 reais to 500,000
reais apiece, its CEO says. That values the 3,900 to be built by
third parties at 780 million to 2 billion reais, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Brazil Tower then expects to sell
the sites in bulk for as much as $300,000 each, he said. </p>
<p>Tower operating companies including SBA Communications
Corp. (SBAC) and American Tower Corp. (AMT) have been expanding in the past
two years as wireless providers prefer to lease towers rather
than maintain them internally to preserve cash and limit
investments. SBA agreed last month to pay 1.53 billion reais for
2,007 Oi towers, or about 760,000 reais per tower -- more than
twice the rate it paid for a previous acquisition of other Oi
towers, according to Wells Fargo  Co. </p>
<p>We have a long-term view of the market, Kurt Bagwell,
SBA''s international president, said in a phone interview. We
basically try to predict the growth of the revenue of these
sites over time and we feel that the price we paid for these
works for our business, no problem. </p>
<p>SBA rose 1.9 percent to $92.29 at the close in New York,
while American Tower rose 2 percent to $81.18. </p>
<h2>Open Door </h2>
<p>Cell Site, Brazil Tower, Highline do Brasil, T4U and QMC --
the five largest builders in Brazil -- have the capacity to
construct only as many as 1,600 towers a year, opening the door
for other companies to step in to help build towers, according
to the investor analysis obtained by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Everybody wants to do business in Brazil -- the problem
is that to do business in Brazil is so difficult, Brazil
Tower''s Zolfaghari said. Just in the state of Florida, you
have 60 companies like us. Why do you think I''m in Brazil? Over
there I would be one guy among hundreds. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
largest oil producer by market value, said fourth-quarter profit
dropped the most in four years as it pumped less natural gas
from wells and energy prices stagnated. </p>
<p>Net income fell 16 percent to $8.35 billion, or $1.91 a
share, from $9.95 billion, or $2.20, a year earlier, the Irving,
Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon was
expected to post per-share profit of $1.91, based on the average
of 18 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Exxon''s global output dropped for the ninth time in 10
quarters, disappointing investors who had been encouraged when
the company snapped its losing streak during the July-to-September period, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward
Jones  Co. Exxon hasn''t sustained output growth for two
consecutive quarters since the first half of 2011. </p>
<p>Production fell again so the question becomes,Have they
already lost the momentum they gained in the last quarter,''
Youngberg said in a telephone interview from St. Louis today. </p>
<p>Sales declined 3.3 percent to $110.86 billion. Exxon''s
shares fell 1.2 percent to $93.99 at the close in New York. </p>
<p>Exxon pumped the equivalent of 4.216 million barrels of
crude a day during the final three months of 2013, the lowest
fourth-quarter output since 2010, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Gas Declines </h2>
<p>A 1.5 percent rise in crude production, led by new wells in
the Western Hemisphere, was more than canceled out by a 5.2
percent decline in gas output, the company said. Gas supplies
fell in every region of the world where Exxon does business
except for Canada and South America, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Brent crude, the benchmark for more than half the world''s
oil, declined 0.7 percent to an average of $109.35 a barrel
during the final three months of last year. U.S. natural gas
rose 8.8 percent to $3.85 per million British thermal units.
West Texas Intermediate crude, the bellwether U.S. oil, climbed
11 percent to $97.61 a barrel. </p>
<p>Refining and marketing profit tumbled 48 percent to $916
million. Exxon''s chemical earnings dropped 5 percent to $910
million, according to the statement. </p>
<p>Exxon earns about three-quarters of its global net income
outside the U.S., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson is
seeking to revive production growth and limit costs amid
shrinking access to the world''s remaining untapped petroleum
reservoirs. </p>
<p>Exxon''s majority-owned Canadian subsidiary, Imperial Oil
Ltd. (IMO), said profit declined to C$1.056 billion ($946 million), or
C$1.24 a share, from C$1.076 billion, or C$1.26, a year earlier.
Record earnings from processing crude into fuels were more than
offset by slumping prices received for Imperial''s western
Canadian crude, the Calgary-based company said in a statement
today. </p>
<p>Imperial fell 0.6 percent to C$45.52 in Toronto. </p>

<p>Banks led by Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. and Citigroup Inc. say commodities are heading for losses
in 2014 as rising supplies and slowing demand compound slumps
that led to bear markets last year in gold, copper and corn. </p>
<p>Open interest measuring holdings across the 24 commodities
tracked by the Standard  Poor''s GSCI Spot Index (BUSY) fell for three
straight quarters through December, the longest slump since the
global recession in 2008. The super cycle that led commodities
to almost quadruple since 2001 is reversing, with prices set to
drop 3 percent in 12 months, Goldman said. The asset class will
be a wallflower compared with equities, Citigroup said. </p>
<p>Raw materials from copper and corn to sugar and coffee will
be in surplus this year after a decade-long bull market spurred
producers to build new mines, drill more wells and expand
planting of crops. Investors pulled a record $43.3 billion last
year from commodity funds tracked by EPFR Global, and hedge
funds cut bullish bets across 18 U.S. futures by 53 percent from
an all-time high in September 2010. </p>
<p>Supply growth is still formidable across most
commodities, said Rob Haworth, a Seattle-based senior
investment strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, which
oversees $115 billion. It will take some time for actual
demand trends to start to overwhelm that increasing supply. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI dropped 0.8 percent this month and 2.2 percent
last year, while the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities
slid 3.5 percent, after surging 20 percent in 2013. The
Bloomberg Dollar Index, a gauge against 10 major trading
partners, has climbed 1.1 percent since the end of December. The
Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index advanced 1.6 percent. </p>
<h2>Lagging Equities </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index, which measures
investor returns after some rolling positions are taken into
account, will drop 3 percent in the next 12 months, Goldman said
in a Jan. 12 report. Precious metals will lose 15 percent, while
agriculture will decline 11 percent, the bank said. Industrial
metals will decrease 5 percent, livestock 3 percent, and energy
will fall 1 percent, Jeffrey Currie, the bank''s head of
commodities research, said in the report. </p>
<p>We are still at below-trend GDP growth, and typically in
this environment you see weak commodity returns and low
volatility, Currie said by e-mail Jan. 22. The expectations
are the U.S. grows near trend, but Europe won''t, and the
emerging markets won''t. If the growth was above trend
everywhere, we''d be jumping into commodities. </p>
<h2>More Supply </h2>
<p>While the 18 euro-area nations emerged from the longest
recession since they began using the currency 15 years ago,
economic growth this year will be just 1 percent, below the
annual average of 1.5 percent since 1997, according to 56
economists in a Bloomberg survey. China, the top user of
everything from zinc to cotton, will expand 7.5 percent, the
slowest pace since 1990, a Bloomberg survey showed. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI gauge surged 170 percent from the end of 1999
to Dec. 31, 2009, the most of any decade since the data begins
in 1971. Higher commodity prices encouraged investment in new
production technology and expanded development of farms, oil
reserves and mines. </p>
<p>Global refined-copper output this year will jump to 22.2
million metric tons, or 55 percent more than in 1999, according
to New York-based researcher CPM Group. Last year''s record corn
harvest of 13.925 billion bushels in the U.S., the world''s
largest grower and exporter, was 48 percent bigger than the
harvest 15 years earlier, government data show. World crude-oil
output has expanded by 19 percent since 1999, according to the
U.S. Energy Information Administration. </p>
<h2>Back Seat'' </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI lagged behind the MSCI equity index for two
straight years, the first time that''s occurred since 1998.
Commodities will continue to take a back seat to other
assets because raw-material gains from 2009 to 2011 were built
on unsustainable factors, Citigroup analysts including Jon Bergtheil and David Wilson said in a Jan. 6 report. Metals have
little encouragement from the balance of supply and demand
this year, they said. </p>
<p>The super cycle has ended because supply has caught up
with demand, Citigroup said in November 2012. A year later,
analysts led by Ed Morse said the bank remains neutral to
bearish commodities with muted demand expected in 2014. </p>
<p>Producers expanded output, after tight supplies led to a
tripling of the SP GSCI since the end of 1999, with record
prices for commodities including oil, gold and copper. More
supply led to a divergence of commodity and equity markets that
had rallied together since the recession, Goldman''s Currie said. </p>
<h2>Bullish Case </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. says commodity bears are overly
confident on the reliability of supply and underestimate
demand. All but eight of the 65 commodity indices the bank
tracks will gain over the next two years, with five of them
posting double-digit annual returns, analysts led by Colin Fenton wrote in a Dec. 30 report. The super cycle is just
beyond its midpoint, and the markets are still in the bull
phases, JPMorgan said. </p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund raised this year''s global
growth forecast to 3.7 percent, from an October estimate of 3.6
percent. The jobless rate in the U.S. fell to a five-year low
last month, and Euro-area factory output grew faster than
economists forecast in January, according to Markit Economics.
The U.S. is the top consumer of corn and crude oil. Europe
accounts for about 18 percent of copper demand and 14 percent of
global energy use, Barclays and BP Plc data show. </p>
<p>Caterpillar Inc., the largest maker of mining and
construction equipment, sees global growth this year at 3
percent, up from 2 percent in 2013, the Peoria, Illinois-based
company said in a Jan. 27 statement. That will boost demand for
mined commodities and energy, keeping most prices high enough
to make investments attractive, the company said. </p>
<h2>Demand Continues </h2>
<p>Even if we don''t see a sharp rebound in China, emerging
markets in general, they are still growing, and that economic
growth would bode well for continued demand for food, said
Peter Sorrentino, a senior portfolio manager who helps manage
about $4.7 billion at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati.
As the population becomes more affluent, even in slower
growth, diets continue to improve, and demand for higher volumes
of food and better quality, that should continue. </p>
<p>Gold and silver, after plunging last year by the most since
1981, should see a decent rebound coming as mines cut back
on output, Sorrentino said. It''s just purely based on physical
volumes. </p>
<h2>Bearish Bets </h2>
<p>Hedge funds and other large speculators have reduced their
net-long holdings to 735,217 futures and options across 18 U.S.-
traded commodities as of Jan. 21, compared to the all-time high
of 1.56 million, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data
show. Only eight of the 139 funds, including ETFs, in the Lipper
Global Commodity group made money last year, according to fund
data. </p>
<p>There are shades of bearishness across commodities,
Morgan Stanley analysts said in a Jan. 17 report. The stronger
dollar in 2014 will be a major problem, Julien Garran, a
London-based analyst at UBS AG, said in a Jan. 20 report. Supply
growth also puts prices at risk, Deutsche Bank said in a
Jan. 14 report. </p>
<p>Investors should stay underweight agriculture, gold and
silver this year, Societe Generale SA said in a Jan. 10 report. </p>
<p>West Texas Intermediate crude oil will drop 8.1 percent to
$90 a barrel in 12 months, Goldman forecasts. The U.S. is
extracting the most oil since 1989 as producers tap shale-rock
formations, cutting costs for refiners and driving fuel prices
at the pump down 9.8 percent since March. </p>
<p>Total domestic petroleum consumption averaged 18.8 million
barrels a day in the four weeks ended Jan. 17, the lowest since
Oct. 18., government data show. Global output will rise faster
than demand this year and next, the EIA estimates. </p>
<h2>Precious Metals </h2>
<p>For gold investors, there''s more pain to come after
prices tumbled 28 percent last year, the most since 1981, Morgan
Stanley analysts Peter Richardson and Joel Crane wrote in a
report Jan. 22. The bank cut its 2014 target 12 percent to
$1,160 an ounce. Goldman sees prices at $1,050 in the next 12
months. Investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value
amid a rally in equities and muted inflation. Holdings through
exchange-traded products fell 33 percent in the past year,
erasing $68.8 billion from the value of the funds. </p>
<p>Copper prices will slump 13 percent to $6,200 a metric ton,
Goldman projects. Supplies will top demand by 385,000 tons this
year, up from a surplus of 45,000 tons in 2013, the bank said in
a Jan. 21 report. </p>
<h2>Agriculture Prices </h2>
<p>The SP GSCI Agricultural Index of eight crops fell 22
percent last year, the biggest slump since 1981, as record
harvests from India to the U.S. expanded supplies. Corn futures
have tumbled 50 percent from a record $8.49 a bushel in August
2012. Worldwide wheat output will be at an all-time high for the
fourth time in six years, U.S. government data show. </p>
<p>Global food costs tracked by the United Nations dropped 14
percent from an all-time high in February 2011. J.M. Smucker
Co., the Orrville, Ohio-based maker of Folgers coffee, is
passing along savings from the lower cost of beans via
promotions, Chief Executive Officer Richard Smucker said on a
Nov. 20 earnings conference call. </p>
<p>Cost inflation peaked in the six months through Nov. 24 at
General Mills Inc., the maker of Cheerios cereal, and the rate
will ease in the second half of the fiscal year that ends
May 31, Chief Executive Officer Kendall J. Powell said on an
earnings call Dec. 18. </p>
<p>There''s adequate inventories in grains and in copper,
said Donald Selkin, who helps manage about $3 billion of assets
as chief market strategist at National Securities Corp. in New
York. Crude-oil inventories are going to return to excess once
cold weather is done. Commodities should drift lower in an
overall sense, absolutely. </p>

At the same time, he spent two decades working for Ballmer and Bill Gates and shareholders may be disappointed no outside candidate was found, said Donald Selkin of National Securities Corp. </p> <p>Microsoft''s board is preparing to make Nadella, the company''s enterprise and cloud chief, its CEO, and is discussing replacing Gates as chairman, according to people briefed on the process who asked not to be identified because the process is private. Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment. </p> <p>It''s a safe choice, said Kevin Walkush, a business analyst at Jensen Investment Management in Lake Oswego, Oregon. The firm oversees $7.2 billion and has 6.7 million Microsoft shares. There''s a large faction that wants a disruptive tech visionary to take over Microsoft and that group will probably be disappointed. Another group of people think we need a person like Satya who knows the business because it''s so complex and needs someone that has the inside knowledge. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the third-largest oil
company by market value, said production this year will rise
less than 1 percent as fourth-quarter profit tumbled 32 percent
amid slumping prices. </p>
<p>Crude and natural gas output will average the equivalent of
2.61 million barrels a day this year, a 0.5 percent increase
from 2013, the San Ramon, California-based company said in a
slide presentation today. For the final three months of last
year, net income dropped to $4.93 billion, or $2.57 a share,
from $7.25 billion, or $3.70, a year earlier, Chevron said in a
separate statement. </p>
<p>Costs have ballooned at Chevron''s flagship $54 billion
Gorgon liquefied natural gas development in Australia, which is
almost 75 percent complete, as the company looks to deep fields
in Kazakhstan and the Gulf of Mexico to add supplies. Chevron is
the latest major international energy producer to disclose
production shortfalls while facing surging costs and unplanned
project delays. </p>
<p>Production growth is going to be modest this year, said
Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James  Associates Inc.
in Houston. In the absence of large project startups,
production growth beyond the very low single digits is just not
realistic. </p>
<h2>Worst Performing </h2>
<p>Chevron slid 4.1 percent, the most since October 2012, to
$111.63 at the close in New York. It was the day''s worst-performing energy producer in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>Both Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the top
two oil companies by market value, reported lower quarterly
earnings this week compared with 2012. Chevron''s stock
underperformed Exxon and ConocoPhillips last year and lagged the
industry average. </p>
<p>Brent crude, the global benchmark oil price, averaged
$109.35 a barrel in the last three months of 2013, a 78-cent
drop from the prior fourth quarter. </p>
<p>Global crude oil prices and refining margins were
generally lower in 2013 than 2012, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson said in today''s statement. These
conditions, as well as lower gains on asset sales and higher
expenses, resulted in lower earnings. </p>
<p>Per-share results at Chevron matched the average estimate
of 18 analysts. Sales fell 7.3 percent to $56.2 billion. </p>
<p>Chevron said its fourth-quarter production fell 3.4 percent
to an average of 2.58 million barrels of oil equivalent a day in
the quarter, from 2.67 million barrels a year earlier. Earnings
from oil and gas sales dropped 29 percent to $4.85 billion. </p>
<p>Watson has said he plans to spend $39.8 billion this year
on gas-export facilities, offshore crude platforms and
exploratory drilling as part of a plan to increase global
production 20 percent by the end of 2017. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is close to a
programming agreement that would settle litigation over Dish
Network Corp. (DISH)''s ad-skipping technology, according to two people
with knowledge of the situation. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, could
receive compensation for technology, known as AutoHop, that lets
Dish subscribers skip commercials in broadcast shows they have
recorded, according to the people, who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. </p>
<p>Resolution of the dispute with Dish, the second-largest
U.S. satellite TV service, could make ad-skipping a regular
feature of TV viewing, and ease the tension between Dish and
other programmers. The company is also involved in litigation
with CBS Corp., Comcast Corp.''s NBC and 21st Century Fox Inc.''s
Fox over the feature, which threatens to undermine the
effectiveness of network ads. </p>
<p>Discussions to settle the ad-skipping litigation are part
of wider contract talks between Burbank, California-based Disney
and Dish, based in Englewood, Colorado, for future rights to
programming from ABC, ESPN and the Disney Channel. An existing
accord between the parties expired in September. </p>
<p>By agreeing to let Dish customers skip ads on ABC network
programs they have recorded, Disney could receive higher monthly
subscriber fees, the people said. Broadcast networks have been
asking pay-TV providers for compensation for their over-the-air
programming, similar to what they get for their cable networks. </p>
<h2>Retransmission Fees </h2>
<p>Disney has said such fees could bring in as much as $500
million annually by 2015. </p>
<p>The AutoHop technology, introduced by Dish in May 2012,
lets the company''s satellite-TV customers skip commercials on
recorded broadcast TV shows. The company had 14 million U.S.
subscribers as of the third quarter. </p>
<p>Dish is working with TV networks to deliver more targeted
ads based on consumer information collected by set-top boxes,
Warren Schlichting, the company''s senior vice president of media
sales and analytics, said in an interview in December. </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.2 percent to $73.11 at 2:25 p.m. in New York.
The stock rose 53 percent last year. Dish gained 0.2 percent to
$56.60 and gained 59 percent in 2013. </p>

<p>Twitter Inc. (TWTR), the microblogging
service that went public last year, agreed to buy 900 patents
from International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) to gain access to new
technology and build a defense against infringement suits. </p>
<p>The agreement, signed last month and announced today, also
resolves a dispute that prompted IBM to write to Twitter last
year about possible infringement of at least three patents.
Financial terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<p>The purchase provides us with greater intellectual
property protection and gives us freedom of action to innovate
on behalf of all those who use our service, Ben Lee, legal
director for Twitter, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Twitter had nine patents and 95 pending applications before
its initial public offering in November, far fewer than other
leading technology companies. It said in a regulatory filing
that the lack of intellectual property could make the company a
target for litigation and limit its ability to fight back by
asserting its own patents. </p>
<p>Patent battles are an increasing distraction for
technology companies, even if Twitter itself wasn''t facing much
of an immediate threat,  said Richard Doherty, research director
of Envisioneering Group, a technology assessment consulting firm
in Seaford, New York. At some point it becomes just a
balancing function to take advantage of warehouses of
intellectual property, like at IBM. </p>
<h2>Video Delivery </h2>
<p>In its letter to Twitter, IBM cited patents relating to a
networking technique based on common contacts, a way to show
advertisements without interfering with an interactive site, and
using interconnected computers to reduce Web traffic. San
Francisco-based Twitter also will probably gain IBM inventions
related to things like video compression, Doherty said. </p>
<p>As Twitter expands and starts delivering video, they need
to increase their intellectual property portfolio, he said.
We believe some know-how is going along with the patent
transfer, not just patent numbers. </p>
<p>The patents include some that directly relate to Twitter''s
business plan. One covers a way to enable compliance with
international shipping requirements. Twitter is seeking to get
more revenue from retailers and is trying to make it easier for
users to shop via its 140-character messages. </p>
<h2>Messaging Technology </h2>
<p>Another of the patents is for improved messaging, according
to information posted on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
website. Others are less clearly connected, such as a way to
prevent damage to semiconductor chips. </p>
<p>For Twitter, the deal marks its first patent acquisition,
not counting intellectual property it gained by purchasing other
companies. The companies also entered a cross-licensing
agreement. Of the three patents cited by IBM in its initial
letter to Twitter, only one -- for interconnected computers --
has been assigned to Twitter, according to the patent office. </p>
<p>Shares of Twitter gained 1.4 percent to $64.35 at 11:52
a.m. in New York. IBM''s stock was little changed at $176.37. </p>
<p>IBM, which has received the most U.S. patents of any
company for 21 straight years, has made deals with patent-light
technology firms before. The Armonk, New York-based company has
sold patents to Google Inc. (GOOG) to aid the Android software maker''s
battle with rivals over smartphone technology. A sale of 750
patents to Facebook Inc. helped the social-networking site
settle a lawsuit with Yahoo! Inc. </p>
<p>It illustrates the value of patented IBM inventions and
demonstrates our commitment to licensing access to our broad
patent portfolio, Ken King, general manager of intellectual
property for IBM, said in a statement. We look forward to a
productive relationship with Twitter in the future. </p>
<p>The licensing and sales deals mean IBM has agreements with
almost every technology company in business. Its patents
generate approximately $1 billion a year in licensing income,
about 1 percent of its sales last year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)''s fixed-income
trading unit offers opportunities on its own merits and isn''t
being propped up by more profitable businesses, Chief Financial
Officer Ruth Porat said. </p>
<p>We are not looking at fixed-income as being subsidized by
the other businesses, we look at it as a strong business on its
own, one that is supportive of the balance of the firm, Porat,
56, said on a conference call with bond investors today. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman has set goals for
reducing the amount of capital the fixed-income unit requires
and boosting its return on equity to 10 percent, which the New
York-based firm has said is its cost of equity. Bond-trading
revenue dropped in each of the last four years, raising
questions about whether Gorman, 55, should shrink the business
further. </p>
<p>Many products within fixed-income are already exceeding the
10 percent ROE target, and the overall business can surpass that
level eventually, Porat said. The bank boosted its ROE within
currency trading to around 10 percent last year and plans to do
the same with the interest-rates unit next, she said. Return on
equity is a gauge of profitability that measures how well a
company reinvests earnings. </p>
<p>It''s an ROE opportunity for the firm, Porat said. We
want to take it from where we are today to hit our cost of
capital, but I don''t mean to imply that that''s an endpoint. </p>

<p>The ruble''s plunge in this week''s
emerging-market selloff holds the promise of more competitive
Russian exports and higher budget revenue, JPMorgan Chase 
Co.''s asset-management unit and Capital Economics Ltd. said. </p>
<p>There has been limited official rhetoric about the need
to prevent the ruble from weakening, Liza Ermolenko, an
emerging-markets economist at Capital Economics, said by phone
from London. A weaker ruble improves competitiveness in
international markets and boosts government revenue from oil. </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry canceled a scheduled bond auction amid
the developing-nation rout after selling less than 25 percent of
the securities on offer this month. Russia should abstain from
following Turkey and South Africa in raising interest rates to
bolster the ruble, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Jan. 29. </p>
<p>The ruble tumbled to the lowest on record against the
central bank''s basket of dollars and euros this week as Chinese
manufacturing contracted and the Federal Reserve pushed ahead
with stimulus cuts. That slide helped drive the yield on
Russia''s February 2027 bond 14 basis points higher on Jan. 29,
the most since June. That compares with a 10 basis-point advance
for similarly dated debt from Mexico, which carries the same
rating at Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<h2>Commodity Dependence </h2>
<p>Crude oil and natural gas exports account for about 50
percent of Russia''s budget revenue and President Vladimir Putin
has urged officials to diversify the economy and reduce its
dependence on commodities. Brent was steady yesterday at $107.95
a barrel in London, compared with $36.61 in December 2008,
before the currency reached its previous low. </p>
<p>I''m sure the government is happy seeing the currency
weaken a bit, Matias Silvani, who helps manage $35 billion of
emerging-market debt at JPMorgan Asset Management in New York,
said by e-mail yesterday. Russia is facing a weaker economy,
exposure to commodities and is trying to gain
competitiveness, he said. A weaker currency, managed, helps
on all three fronts. </p>
<p>Elvira Nabiullina, the economic aide to Putin who took
charge of Bank Rossii in June, resisted cutting rates last year
to boost economic growth as inflation remained above target. The
economy expanded 1.2 percent in the third quarter from a year
earlier, matching the weakest pace since a 2009 contraction. </p>
<h2>Auction Axed </h2>
<p>The Finance Ministry axed its auction on Jan. 29, citing
market conditions, after issuing 750 million rubles out of 10
billion rubles of 2019 bonds offered at a sale the previous
week. While the ministry plans to sell bonds next week, it''s not
a problem if the first-quarter borrowing plan isn''t met,
Konstantin Vyshkovsky, head of Finance Ministry''s debt
department, told reporters in Moscow yesterday. </p>
<p>When the local currency depreciates, Russia''s budget
receives more rubles from taxes and duties paid by energy
companies whose export revenue is priced in dollars. </p>
<p>Russia''s budget deficit may be equal to 0.6 percent to 0.7
percent of gross domestic product this year, the Interfax news
service said Jan. 23, citing Siluanov. </p>
<p>The yield on Russia''s 2027 OFZ bond has increased 50 basis
points this year to 8.4 percent, the highest since July 2012,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on Mexico''s debt is
up 26 basis points this year at 7 percent. </p>
<h2>Third Worst </h2>
<p>The ruble climbed for the first day in six yesterday,
adding 1 percent to 40.5092 against the basket after 6 p.m. in
Moscow when the central bank ends its market operations. The
ruble lost 6.5 percent against the dollar this year, the worst
performer among the 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg, behind Argentina''s peso and South Africa''s rand. The
currency retreated 0.3 percent to 40.6059 by 12:18 p.m. in
Moscow today versus the basket. </p>
<p>Many investors are saying that it would be good for the
central bank to raise rates, Evgeny Kochemazov, head of fixed
income at Alfa Capital in Moscow, said by phone yesterday.
That''s probably the only way to stabilize the situation in the
currency market, to prevent the growth of OFZ yields. </p>
<p>Russia is rated Baa1 at Moody''s Investors Service, the
third-lowest investment-grade category. The yield on the
government''s April 2020 dollar bonds was steady at 3.83 percent
today. The extra yield investors demand to hold the nation''s
dollar debt over Treasuries dropped one basis point to 246. </p>
<p>Russian policy makers are scheduled to discuss borrowing
costs on Feb. 14. Bank Rossii will leave the key one-week rate
at 5.5 percent in the first and second quarter, according to the
median estimate of 22 economists in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The economy stands to gain from the ruble''s drop, according
to Alexei Kudrin, a former Finance Minister. </p>
<p>Overall it''s positive, he said in Moscow yesterday.
It will support industry. </p>

<p>Billionaires Alice Walton, George Soros and Marc Benioff are helping to finance a super-political
action committee encouraging former U.S. Secretary of State
Hillary Clinton to run for president, according to a report
filed yesterday with the Federal Election Commission. </p>
<p>Each gave $25,000 to Ready for Hillary PAC, organized a
year ago to provide Clinton outside support if she chooses to
seek the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. </p>
<p>The super-PAC earlier reported raising about $4 million
last year from 30,000 donors, most of them giving small amounts,
such as $20.16. Walton, Soros and Benioff were among 33 people
or companies that gave $25,000 in the second half of 2013, the
FEC report shows. New Yorkers who chipped in to help their
former senator include Roger Altman, the chairman and founder of
New York-based Evercore Partners Inc. </p>
<p>The super-PAC can''t coordinate with Clinton if she becomes
a candidate. It can, however, sell her campaign its data --
almost 2 million supporters have signed up for the group so far
-- or mobilize voters and advertise for her on its own. The
group, based in Arlington, Virginia, is limiting contributions
to $25,000 even though it is permitted to accept donations in
unlimited amounts. </p>
<p>Its early fundraising success, still more than two years
before Election Day, could give Clinton a competitive advantage;
there''s no comparable candidate-specific super-PAC for any of
the prospective Republican candidates, who include Kentucky
Senator Rand Paul, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and New
Jersey Governor Chris Christie. </p>
<h2>Leading Polls </h2>
<p>Clinton, 66, dominates other Democrats in voter preference
polls and has said she''ll make a decision about a White House
campaign sometime this year. A Jan. 30 Washington Post-ABC News
poll found her with 73 percent of support from Democrats and
Democratic-leaning independents, a 6-to-1 lead over her rivals. </p>
<p>I''ll think about it in the future sometime, Clinton
said Jan. 27 at the National Automobile Dealers Association
convention in New Orleans. </p>
<p>Walton, the daughter of Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Walton, is the world''s 13th-richest
person with a fortune of $33.9 billion, according to the
Bloomberg Billionaires Index. </p>
<p>Alice Walton''s donation underscores the Clintons''
longstanding ties to business leaders in Arkansas, where Bill Clinton was governor for 12 years prior to becoming president in
1993. The pro-Clinton group also received $25,000 from John Tyson, chairman of Springdale-based Tyson Foods Inc. </p>
<h2>Obama Backers </h2>
<p>Benioff, the chief executive officer of San Francisco-based
Salesforce.com, was a top fundraiser for President Barack Obama''s 2012 re-election campaign and hosted the president for a
Democratic fundraiser at his residence last November. His wife,
Lynne Benioff, also contributed $25,000. </p>
<p>Soros, who''s given millions of dollars to Democratic
causes, funded the super-PAC, as did his son Robert Soros,
managing partner of Soros Fund Management LLC. </p>
<p>Former advisers to Bill Clinton donating to Ready for
Hillary included Altman, a former deputy treasury secretary, who
gave $5,000. William Galston, a Washington-based Brookings
Institution senior fellow and a former White House domestic
policy adviser, gave $1,000. </p>
<h2>New York Donors </h2>
<p>The super-PAC for Clinton, a U.S. senator from New York
from 2001 to 2009, received $25,000 each from developer William Rudin, chief executive officer of Rudin Management Co. in New
York, and Jon Stryker, a New York architect who gave about $2
million to Priorities USA Action, a super-PAC that helped re-elect Obama and is now converting to a pro-Clinton effort. </p>
<p>Silda Wall, a principal at NewWorld Capital Group LLC, who
is divorcing former New York governor Eliot Spitzer, gave
$5,000. </p>
<p>The pro-Clinton super-PAC received $25,000 from the Houston
law firm of Steve and Amber Mostyn, who gave about $5 million to
Democratic groups and candidates in the 2012 election. </p>
<p>Ready for Hillary is led by Adam Parkhomenko, a 28-year-old
college student who has advocated for a Clinton presidential
campaign for more than a decade. The super-PAC''s advisers
include Jeremy Bird, Obama''s former national field director, and
Harold Ickes and James Carville, who have longstanding ties to
the Clintons. </p>
<p>The super-PAC said in an e-mail to supporters that it had

<p>International Business Machines Corp. has reduced its tax rate to a two-decade low with help from a tax strategy that sends profits through a Dutch subsidiary. </p> <p>The approach, which involves routing almost all sales in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and some of the Americas through the Netherlands unit, helped IBM as it gradually reduced its tax rate over 20 years at the same time pretax income quadrupled. Then last year, the rate slid to the lowest level since at least 1994, lifting earnings above analysts'' estimates. </p> <p>IBM is aiming for $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015, up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a goal made more difficult as the company posted seven straight quarters of declining revenue. To stay on target, IBM has bought back shares, sold assets, and fired and furloughed workers. A less prominent though vital role is played by its subsidiary in the Netherlands, one of the most important havens for multinational companies looking for ways to legally reduce their tax rates. </p> <p>They''ve got a lot of ways to beat earnings and they definitely take advantage of it, said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. It''s part of how IBM operates. </p> <p>IBM ended 2013 with a tax provision $1.84 billion lower than it initially projected, thanks to a tax rate of 15.6 percent -- compared with its forecast of 25 percent. Without the lower rate, the company''s earnings per share would have fallen from the previous year instead of rising, and net income would have missed analysts'' estimates by about 14 percent instead of 2.9 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>A spinoff of French phone company SFR
from owner Vivendi SA (VIV) is the only plan for the unit, its chief
executive officer said, dismissing an alternative merger
involving the country''s second-largest carrier. </p>
<p>The planned separation of SFR with 2012 revenue of 11.3
billion euros ($15.3 billion) is well advanced, and will
lead to a stock listing on July 1, SFR Chairman and CEO Jean-Yves Charlier told reporters in Paris today. </p>
<p>We have one plan, and only one -- it''s splitting SFR from
Vivendi, Charlier said. We''re not at all operating a dual-track scenario. There''s only a single track. </p>
<p>While Vivendi and cable operator Numericable SAS (NUM) have held
talks on and off in the past year about a merger without being
able to agree on valuation, Altice SA, Numericable''s biggest
investor, is making a renewed push to consolidate
telecommunications assets in Europe, people familiar with the
matter said last month. </p>
<p>Altice raised 1.3 billion euros in an initial public
offering last week, giving the company founded by entrepreneur
Patrick Drahi a vehicle for raising capital for possible deals.
While the IPO is subject a so-called share lockup for 180 days,
an exception allows Altice to issue new shares starting 45 days
after the IPO if the proceeds are used to finance a merger or
acquisition, according to regulatory filings. </p>
<h2>Listing Vehicle </h2>
<p>Altice, which debuted in Amsterdam last week, rose for a
second day, adding 1.2 percent to 28.92 euros at 12:39 p.m.
local time and valuing the company at 6 billion euros. Vivendi,
which relied on SFR for almost 40 percent of its 2012 revenue,
slipped 1.1 percent to 19.72 euros in Paris trading. Numericable
lost less than 1 percent to 27.96 euros. </p>
<p>Vivendi, which will ask shareholders in June to approve a
split of the Paris-based company into two, is aiming to file
details of SFR''s spinoff plan to market regulators by March,
people familiar with the matter have said. </p>
<p>The separation is part of Vivendi''s reorganization around
media, music and broadcasting assets. SFR is valued at 12
billion euros, according to analysts at Liberum Capital Ltd. </p>
<p>SFR and smaller rival Bouygues SA (EN) agreed last week to share
part of their mobile-phone networks, allowing each other to
cover more ground for less money. Charlier today called analyst
estimates of 200 million euros in annual savings for SFR from
the pact realistic. The savings will fully kick in from
2018, he said. </p>
<p>The network-sharing agreement is part of plans by SFR to
reduce spending to preserve cash as it fights price wars and
declining phone bills. Differentiating from rivals'' fixed-line
and wireless offers will also be key, Charlier said. </p>
<p>We have an ambitious plan to re-position SFR, focused on
cash flow and differentiating products, he said. It will be
up to investors to decide if this, as well as the French
telecoms industry eventually being reshuffled, makes for an
attractive equity story. </p>

<p>Data generated from the work will be made public for other
scientists to use, a move the U.S. National Institutes of Health
called groundbreaking. The targeted diseases are some of the

billions of dollars in treatment and lost productivity. </p>
<p>The venture may be particularly important in Alzheimer''s
research. Since 1998, there have been more than 100 attempts to
develop a treatment, and all have failed. The last two years
have featured setbacks by Pfizer and Johnson  Johnson. Sanofi (SAN)
Chief Executive Officer Chris Viehbacher has said his company
won''t pursue therapies there because the science isn''t advanced
enough to justify the risks and cost to develop a drug. </p>

right targets to go after for the next generation of drug
development,'''' Francis Collins, the NIH director, said today at
a press conference in Washington. We want to pick them at the
very beginning of the development process and thus avoid wasting
precious time and money chasing down drugs. </p>
<p>The companies and the NIH will split the $230 million cost
about equally, Collins said. </p>
<p>More than 5 million Americans suffer with Alzheimer''s
disease, and the number is expected to triple by 2050. The only
drugs approved for the condition ease symptoms for a few months
while the debilitating brain disease rampages on. Still, the
treatments generate more than $5 billion annually. </p>
<h2>Biomarker Research </h2>
<p>Research coordinated by the NIH will include collecting
tissue samples from thousands of patients to look for common
biomarkers that might be good targets for new drugs, the
agency said in a statement. The first projects are expected to
last three to five years, and may lead to collaborations on
other diseases if the research is successful, NIH said. </p>

the innovation ecosystem in a more unified way, Mikael Dolsten, president of worldwide research and development for New

<p>Rupert Vessey, senior vice president at Whitehouse Station,
New Jersey-based Merck  Co. (MRK), identified new, innovative ways to

individuals and are a burden to our society, he said in an e-mail. </p>

<p>Other companies involved are AbbVie Inc., Biogen Idec Inc. (BIIB),
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK), JJ (JNJ), Sanofi and
Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
will also participate, as well as nonprofit advocacy groups
representing patients suffering from the diseases, the
government said. </p>

four years ago, but not because we weren''t interested in it, but
because we thought it was so difficult alone, said Lon Cardon,

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s $543 million settlement with the trustee for Bernard Madoff''s defunct firm was approved by the judge overseeing its liquidation, ending a case in which thousands of investors accused the bank of turning a blind eye to the U.S.''s biggest Ponzi scheme. </p> <p>The accord, reached Jan. 7, was approved today by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Stuart Bernstein in New York. The deal resolves a lawsuit by the trustee, Irving Picard, and two related class-action cases filed by Madoff victims who accused the bank of negligence. </p> <p>The settlements are fair, reasonable and in the best interest of the Madoff estate, Bernstein said. The deals provide substantial benefit to victims, he said. </p> <p>Related: Madoff Ex-Aides Seen Facing Hurdle With Duped'' Defense</p><p>With the JPMorgan deal, Picard''s recoveries for victims topped $10 billion, or 59 percent of the $17 billion in principal lost by thousands of customers in Madoff''s investment advisory business. Picard alleged the bank helped perpetuate Madoff''s scam for years by ignoring signs of fraud. </p> <p>Madoff deposited money from new customers into the account instead of investing it in securities, and made withdrawals to pay back earlier investors. The Ponzi scheme collapsed after Madoff''s confession and arrest in December 2008. </p> <p>Picard said New York-based JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, ignored signs of wrongdoing to benefit financially from the con man''s business. </p> <h2>Class Actions </h2> <p>JPMorgan agreed to pay Picard $325 million to settle his lawsuit on behalf of thousands of victims, and another $218 million to resolve two related class-action lawsuits that were filed with Picard''s assistance after an appeals court barred him from bringing common-law claims against the bank. </p> <p>Picard had appealed the JPMorgan decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which hasn''t decided whether it will hear the case. </p> <p>The amount of the accord indicated there was a value to the claims and the compromise made good sense, David Sheehan, a lawyer for Picard, said at today''s hearing. There is no guarantee Picard will win at the Supreme Court, Sheehan said. </p> <p>A group of about 200 Madoff victims who are net winners -- customers who withdrew more money from the scam than they deposited -- get nothing under the deal and have said in court filings they will sue the bank. They advised Bernstein in court papers that they were declining to be part of the JPMorgan accord. </p> <h2>Opting Out </h2> <p>You''re opting out of a class you''re not a member of -- sounds like a Groucho Marx joke, Bernstein said to a lawyer for the group at today''s hearing. </p> <p>Picard is pursuing claims totaling about $3.5 billion from UBS AG (UBSN), HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and UniCredit SpA (UCG), which the trustee has also accused of benefiting from Madoff''s fraud. The banks have denied the claims. </p> <p>At the same time Picard reached the deal with JPMorgan, the bank agreed to pay $1.7 billion to the U.S. to resolve related criminal allegations, and $350 million in a case by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. </p> <p>The parallel efforts by the trustee and federal investigators have resulted in a total recovery for victims of almost $14 billion, or 82 percent of the lost principal. Picard has distributed about $4.9 billion to victims, with billions more held in reserve until legal issues are resolved. </p> <p>Madoff, 75, pleaded guilty to fraud in 2009 and is serving a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina. At least seven others pleaded guilty, including his brother Peter Madoff, who is serving a 10-year term. </p> <h2>Picower Estate </h2> <p>Before the JPMorgan accord, Picard''s team had recovered $9.5 billion through lawsuits and out-of-court settlements, including $5 billion from the estate of Jeffry Picower, who began investing with Madoff in the 1970s. Picower, whom Picard called the biggest beneficiary of Madoff''s scheme, had a heart attack and drowned in a pool in Florida in October 2009. </p> <p>U.S. investigators had recovered about $2.3 billion for Madoff investors before reaching their deal with JPMorgan, including $2.2 billion from Picower''s estate and $100 million from Madoff''s Midtown Manhattan penthouse apartment and other belongings. The JPMorgan deal brings total U.S. recoveries to $4 billion -- a sum it will distribute through a separate process from the one used by Picard. </p> <p>The liquidation case is Securities Investor Protection Corp. v.

<h2>
By Kristen Haunss </h2>
<p>Feb. 5 (Bloomberg) - Morgan Stanley (MS) cut its collateralized
loan obligation forecast by as much as 27 percent to $55 billion
as issuance slowed last month because of questions about the
Volcker Rule''s impact on the funds that finance buyouts. </p>
<p>Five new-issue U.S. CLOs for $2.55 billion were sold in
January compared with 17 transactions for $9.04 billion in the
same month last year, Morgan Stanley said today in a report.
The New York-based bank lowered its 2014 forecast to $55 billion
to $65 billion, from its initial projection of $65 billion to
$75 billion, according to the report. </p>
<p>Issuance of CLOs surged 49 percent last year to $82
billion, the most since 2007, when $92.8 billion were arranged,
according to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. A lack of
enthusiasm from AAA investors, the largest portion of a CLO,
because of the Volcker Rule''s unknown effects has led to a
slowdown in the pace of new issuance, Morgan Stanley said. </p>
<p>The most notable aspect of the CLO market has been
lackluster new issuance year-to-date, driven mainly by Volcker
Rule uncertainties, analysts led by Vishwanath Tirupattur
wrote in the report. </p>
<p>CLOs pool high-yield loans and slice them into debt
securities of varying risk and return, typically from AAA
ratings down to B. The lowest portion, known as the equity
tranche, offers the highest potential returns and the greatest
risk because investors are the first to see their interest
payouts reduced when loans backing the CLO default. </p>
<h2>Tightening Spreads </h2>
<p>CLO sales of deals backed by widely syndicated loans
plunged to $1.22 billion in 2009, the year after the collapse of
Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. precipitated the biggest financial
crisis since the Great Depression, according to Morgan Stanley
data. </p>
<p>Spreads on existing AAA CLO debt fell to 110 basis points
in December from a 2013 high of 130 basis points during the
first quarter, according to Morgan Stanley data. They rose to as
high as 725 basis points in April 2009 from a nine-year low of
23 basis points in 2007. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>The CLO new-issue market may remain sluggish until there
is regulatory/legislative relief from Volcker for existing
holdings of CLO tranches for banks or until clarity emerges
about the way forward for resolving Volcker compliance, the
analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Under Volcker, banks would not be able to own debt of CLOs
that are invested in bonds or other securitized products.
Industry groups including the Loan Syndications and Trading
Association submitted a proposal with alternatives to regulators
to clarify the language around ownership, according to the
report. An Interim Final Rule for Volcker released Jan. 14
didn''t provide any clarification or a reference to CLOs, Morgan
Stanley said. </p>

<p>Right from the start, new Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella is showing that he will operate differently from predecessor Steve Ballmer. </p> <p>On his first day leading the world''s largest software maker, Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran who was yesterday named CEO, exuded an understated calm during a less than 20-minute webcast for customers and employees. Rather than the customary press conference, the 46-year-old used the event to introduce himself and take questions from Microsoft Vice President Susan Hauser. The first line in his memo to employees started with today is a very humbling day for me. </p> <p>That contrasts with Ballmer, who for 14 years as Microsoft CEO was famous for his oversized personality. Ballmer, 57, once jumped out of a cake at Microsoft''s 25th anniversary party at Seattle''s Safeco Field and ran through the crowd giving high-fives as if he''d won the Super Bowl. In a memo to employees yesterday, Ballmer said he was pumped. </p> <p>If jarring, the change in style will be one of the advantages of choosing Nadella as Microsoft''s third CEO, said David Yoffie, a professor at Harvard Business School. Ballmer''s aggressive salesmanship during the boom days of the personal-computer industry exemplified how Microsoft became the world''s most valuable company. Now the software maker needs a new approach as it plays catch-up in areas including tablets, smartphones and cloud services. </p> <p>Nadella''s obviously a deep technologist, and he''s going to bring that back to a Microsoft that hasn''t had it in the CEO office for years, Yoffie said. </p> <h2>Changing Guard </h2> <p>Nadella''s low-key manner is also a sign of a changing of the guard in technology, as larger-than-life founders and near-founders such as Ballmer leave the scene. As part of yesterday''s changes, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also stepped aside as chairman and was replaced by lead independent director John Thompson. </p> <p>Microsoft isn''t the only technology company that has hired a product-focused CEO in recent years. Yahoo! Inc. recruited engineer Marissa Mayer from Google Inc. in 2012 to be CEO, while networking-equipment maker Juniper Networks Inc. recently appointed Shaygan Kheradpir, who had built networks for Verizon Communications Inc. and others, as CEO. </p> <p>Opinion: Why Microsoft and Everyone Else Loves Indian CEOs</p><p>This industry goes through cycles, and we''re in a cycle where customers are looking for new products, Kheradpir said in an interview yesterday. It''s not a sales or a marketing thing right now. </p> <p>Microsoft''s decision to forgo a press conference on Nadella''s ascension may also be an effort to show that the business isn''t about one person or personality, said Carol Blymire, a communications consultant. Maybe we''ve come to the end of the era of the rock star technology CEO. </p> <p>Frank Shaw, a spokesman for Microsoft, declined to comment. </p> <h2>Employee Rally </h2> <p>At a rally with employees yesterday at the atrium in Studio D, one of the newer buildings at Microsoft''s corporate campus in Redmond, Washington, Nadella demonstrated some continuity with the Ballmer-Gates era. Amid a standing-room-only crowd, Nadella appeared with Gates and Ballmer, who have been Microsoft''s only other two CEOs. Nadella emphasized the importance of software and talked about how the company is moving into devices and cloud services, according to a person who attended. </p> <p>Yet Nadella also delivered a message that it was time for a change. In his e-mail to employees, he wrote, Our industry does not respect tradition -- it only respects innovation. Make no mistake, we are headed for greater places. </p> <h2>Basketball, Cricket </h2> <p>The differences between Ballmer and Nadella begin with their backgrounds. Nadella is an engineer with degrees in electrical engineering and computer science, as well as an MBA that he earned by taking weekend classes after he had started at Microsoft. Ballmer is an Ivy League-educated businessman who specialized in sales and marketing. </p> <p>The dissimilarities extend into the two men''s personal lives. Ballmer is known as a ferocious defender and rebounder on the basketball court. Nadella lists poetry as an interest and one of his favorite sports is cricket, which features scheduled tea breaks. </p> <p>He''s a thoughtful, quiet leader who rallies people around him, former Microsoft Chief Financial Officer John Connors said of Nadella. He works harder than anybody. He''ll make the tough calls but he''s very urbane and civil. </p> <h2>Ballmer''s Changes </h2> <p>Ballmer has made some changes in the past year that will help Nadella, said Will Poole, a former Microsoft vice president who left in 2008 and remains in close touch with the company. Last year, Ballmer discontinued a review system he had implemented that ranked each person in every work group on a bell curve, an approach that forced some employees to behave more politically. </p> <p>Ballmer also pushed through a major reorganization in July to break down walls at Microsoft. Rather than run their own discrete businesses, top executives now oversee functional areas, such as software and hardware engineering. </p> <p>Ballmer''s strained relationship with Wall Street also leaves Nadella plenty of room for improvement, said Daniel Ives, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets. </p> <p>Ballmer wasn''t hands on with the Street, said Ives, who has the equivalent of a hold rating on the stock. I expect Nadella to be a lot more front and center, because it''s needed. He needs to prove that his vision is right. </p> <p>Nadella will still work with Ballmer in the boardroom, where both are directors. Having Ballmer there may make it complicated for Nadella to undo major initiatives from his predecessor, Yoffie said. </p> <p>Communicating with his board will be as challenging in some ways as all the other challenges he''ll face with the external world, Yoffie said of Nadella. </p> <p> ', 'Microsoft Gets Style Shift With Nadella Replacing Ballmer', 'By Peter Burrows and Dina Bass', 'Feb 05, 2014 12:01 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-05/microsoft-gets-style-shift-with-nadella-replacing-ballmer.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>The head of Goldman Sachs (GS) Group
Inc.''s operations in Germany and the country''s second-highest
ranking bank regulator will testify at the trial of former
managers of Sal. Oppenheim Jr.  Cie this month. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s Alexander Dibelius will give evidence on
Feb. 12 at the tribunal in Cologne where the case is being
heard, according to the court''s witness list. Frauke Menke, the
head of banking supervision at Bafin, is scheduled to testify
Feb. 20, the same day as Thomas Middelhoff, the former chief
executive officer of Bertelsmann AG. </p>
<p>The former Sal. Oppenheim managers are charged with breach
of trust over bad investments, including property deals
prosecutors say resulted in about 150 million euros ($204
million) of losses. The court is also reviewing loans to
Arcandor AG (ARO), a German retailer which went bankrupt in 2009, in
the trial, which began last year. </p>

over the Arcandor investment at the moment, he said. </p>
<p>Sal. Oppenheim put itself up for sale after reporting a

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
is raising its bet on Africa by spending $100 million to bring
its Watson technology to the continent. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest computer-services provider plans to
introduce Watson, an artificial-intelligence system best known
for beating humans on the Jeopardy! game show, to government
agencies, universities, scientists and other partners in Africa
to process socioeconomic information, the company said in a
statement. It will also establish a research center to help
advance a 10-year IBM initiative to spur development. </p>
<p>The moves are part of an effort by Chief Executive Officer
Ginni Rometty to make the continent into a growth engine for
IBM, which has reported seven consecutive quarters of falling
revenue. Last year''s 5 percent sales decline in its traditional
growth markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China helped drag
down total revenue. </p>
<p>In Africa, we''re getting more partners and we''re helping
the economic development, Solomon Assefa, an IBM researcher,
said in an interview. Africa is really moving forward. We
believe that this investment reflects that it''s also a very good
business decision. </p>
<p>IBM will be expanding its investment in Watson as the
Armonk, New York-based company looks to data analytics to boost
growth. IBM said last month that it will spend $1 billion to
create a new division around Watson, which analyzes troves of
data and can answer questions in conversational language. </p>
<h2>Research Center </h2>
<p>Last year, the company opened a research laboratory in
Nairobi, Kenya, its 12th in the world. In 2013, IBM had
operations in more than 20 African countries, up from four in
2006. </p>
<p>Watson can analyze large amounts of data after the
information is uploaded to the tool. Assefa said IBM''s new
research center, the Center of Excellence for Data-Driven
Development, will serve as a central point for universities,
government agencies and other partners to upload data. Assefa
declined to comment on partners for the project. </p>
<p>Health care and education will be two initial focus areas
for which IBM intends to deploy the Watson technology, he said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s current
and former employees, including former U.S. Treasury Secretary
Henry Paulson, have helped Republican Neel Kashkari raise almost
$1 million in his bid for California''s governorship. </p>
<p>Kashkari, a former Goldman vice president who as a Treasury
official managed the $700 billion rescue of the U.S. banking
system, reported $976,000 in contributions since announcing his
candidacy on Jan. 21. The donations included $79,400 from
Goldman employees and $54,400 from Paulson and his wife, Wendy,
according to a filing yesterday with the California Secretary of
State. </p>
<p>Our campaign''s robust fundraising in these first two
weeks underscores Neel''s strength as a candidate, and it will
help ensure that we have the resources necessary to share with
voters his vision for turning California around, Pat Melton,
Kashkari''s campaign manager, said in a statement. </p>
<p>Kashkari, 40, is running in California''s June 3 primary,
where the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, advance to
the November general election. Also running for governor is
Republican state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, 47, who raised
$374,000 last year. </p>
<p>Governor Jerry Brown, a Democrat who hasn''t said whether
he''ll seek another term, has $17 million in campaign funds from
donors including Exxon Mobil Corp., Facebook Inc. (FB) and Microsoft
Corp., as well as porn mogul Larry Flynt. </p>
<p>Brown was elected in 2010 after having previously served as
governor from 1975 to 1983. Prior to his second stint as
California''s chief executive, he also was elected mayor of
Oakland and the state''s attorney general. </p>
<h2>Equity Work </h2>
<p>After his work in the Troubled Asset Relief Program under
Paulson, Kashkari joined Pacific Investment Management Co. in
Newport Beach, California, in 2009, where he led the world''s
largest bond fund''s expansion into equities. He left in January
2013 and has said he spent the past year meeting with almost 700
potential donors from around the U.S. </p>
<p>Paulson, a former chief executive officer at New York-based
Goldman Sachs, and his wife each gave the maximum individual
contribution of $27,200 under California law. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs employees who donated to Kashkari''s campaign
include George C. Lee, II, listed as an executive living in
Tiburon, California, who gave $27,200; Jon Woodruff, a banker
from Menlo Park, California, who donated $27,200; and Andrew Gordon, an investment banker from Los Angeles, who gave $5,000. </p>
<p>Former Goldman Sachs employee Matthew L''Heureux of
Kentfield, California, gave $9,000 and O''Malley Miller, a
partner at the law firm Munger, Tolles  Olson LLP, who has
represented Goldman Sachs, gave $10,000, according to the

<p>Morgan Stanley, owner of the world''s
largest brokerage, named four executives to its operating
committee, including fixed-income trading co-heads Michael Heaney and Robert Rooney, a person briefed on the move said. </p>
<p>Shelley O''Connor, who runs the New York-based firm''s
private bank, and Andy Saperstein, head of the brokerage''s
investment products and services unit, were also added to the
committee, bringing it to 16 members, said the person, who asked
to remain anonymous because the decision wasn''t yet public. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 55, has signaled his
commitment to the fixed-income trading unit as some rivals have
exited large parts of the business. Gorman has also identified
higher profit margins at the brokerage and an increase in
lending to clients through the private bank as major parts of
his strategy to boost Morgan Stanley''s return on equity. </p>
<p>These appointments reflect the importance to the firm of
the businesses these individuals run and the leadership role
each plays in driving our firm strategy and our future
success, Gorman wrote in an internal memo, according to the
person. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s operating committee is the highest group
of managers at the bank, helping Gorman set its strategy. The
firm said in its proxy letter to investors that it views the
committee''s members as highly talented executives capable of
rotating among the leadership positions of our businesses and
key functions. </p>
<h2>Salary Boost </h2>
<p>The bank last year raised the base salary to at least $1
million for all the committee members, who must must agree not
to sell 75 percent of equity awards granted during their service
on the committee. </p>
<p>Heaney and Rooney became co-heads of the fixed-income unit
last year after Ken deRegt left to join hedge-fund firm Canarsie
Capital Group. Morgan Stanley (MS) has set a goal of a 10 percent
return on equity for that business, and Chief Financial Officer
Ruth Porat said last week that the unit offers opportunities for
profit beyond that target. </p>
<p>O''Connor, 53, has run the private bank for more than three
years, helping the company boost lending to its 4 million
brokerage clients. Morgan Stanley has said it wants 10 percent
of its customers to have loans with the firm, up from the
current 5 percent. Gorman said the company can generate about 3
percent yield from lending its rising deposits, compared with
the 0.3 percent it gets from investing in short-term securities. </p>
<p>Saperstein, 47, who followed Gorman to Morgan Stanley from
Merrill Lynch  Co. in 2006, took over the investment products
and services group in 2012. He has sought to boost connections
between the brokerage and the investment bank, and Morgan
Stanley said last year it had 35 such initiatives. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
and BP Plc led a 25 percent jump in U.S. company bond sales this
week as borrowers rushed to lock in yields at about a seven-month low before a labor report today that showed employers
added fewer jobs than economists projected. </p>
<p>IBM, the world''s biggest computer-services provider, and
London-based BP led $23.8 billion of offerings that rose from
$19.1 billion in the five days ended Jan. 31, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance compares with $24.3 billion in
the first week of February 2013 and follows $140.8 billion of
sales last month. </p>
<p>Offerings increased as companies sought to borrow before
the report on employment growth that MFR economist Joshua
Shapiro said might be a crapshoot. Payrolls rose 113,000 in
January, the Labor Department said, less than the 180,000 median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. Investors are
watching for signs of weakness in the world''s biggest economy
amid a rout in emerging markets from Argentina to Turkey. </p>
<p>In any given month, it''s the date on the calendar that
issuers are most mindful about assessing, Edward Marrinan, a
macro credit strategist at RBS Securities in Stamford,

story. </p>

rather than government debentures reached 193 basis points
yesterday, unchanged from Jan. 31, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate  High Yield Index. Yields
increased to 3.9 percent from 3.89 percent, and compare with a
record low 3.35 percent in May. Yields last week touched 3.84
percent, the lowest since June. </p>
<p>IBM sold $4.5 billion of bonds in four parts including $2
billion of 3.625 percent, 10-year notes to yield 95 basis points
more than similar-maturity Treasuries, Bloomberg data show. The
Armonk, New York-based company also issued $1.5 billion of five-year notes in fixed- and floating-rate portions and $1 billion
of two-year floaters. </p>
<p>BP, Europe''s second-largest oil company, issued $2.5
billion of bonds in three parts through its BP Capital Markets
unit, Bloomberg data show. The largest portion, $1.25 billion of
3.81 percent, 10-year securities, priced with a relative yield
of 115 basis points. </p>
<p>Sales of investment-grade debentures reached at least $17
billion, compared with $13.2 billion last week and a weekly
average of $21.9 billion in 2013, Bloomberg data show. Offerings
of speculative-grade bonds reached at least $6.8 billion,
compared with $6 billion last week and a weekly average of $7.2

<p>     Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co. is offering $390
million of non-performing loans as banks including HSBC Holdings
Plc and Regions Financial Corp. increasingly look to sell
troubled mortgage debt. </p>
<p>JPMorgan put the pool of debt, a portion of which is tied
to residential properties in New York, on the market this week,
said two people with knowledge of the offering, who asked not to
be named because the sale is private. HSBC hired BlackRock Inc.
to manage the potential sale of as much as $1 billion in
delinquent loans and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is handling an
auction of about $700 million of modified loans for Regions,
according to two separate people. </p>
<p>Sales of the debt are accelerating amid financial
regulations that force banks to pledge more capital for some
assets they hold, including non-performing loans, or NPLs. The
government also is adding to the supply as it auctions the debt
to help prevent foreclosures and stem losses at the Federal
Housing Administration. </p>
<p>Banks have made a decision internally that a delinquent
borrower is not a core customer,Ashish Pandey, chief
executive officer of Altisource Residential Corp. (RESI), said at a
conference in Las Vegas last month. Pandey, whose firm had 6,300
delinquent loans as of the third quarter of 2013, said he

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and General
Electric Co. (GE)''s finance arm had their smallest Samurai-bond sales
in more than nine years as a global stock rout damped investor
demand for debt that offered investors record-low yields. </p>
<p>General Electric Capital Corp. sold 55 billion yen ($536
million) in three-year fixed-rate, yen-denominated notes that
pay 0.313 percent on Feb. 6, while JPMorgan offered 48.5 billion
yen in a two-tranche deal, including three-year fixed-rate notes
offering 0.373 percent. Those rates are the lowest ever paid by
the companies on the yen-denominated debt, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Japanese investors are wary of buying overseas debt
offering such low yields after concerns that the Chinese economy
is slowing and the impact from U.S. Federal Reserve stimulus
cuts triggered a selloff in emerging-market currencies and
global stocks. JPMorgan joined Morgan Stanley last week in
agreeing to pay $1.86 billion to settle U.S. accusations of
misconduct in their handling of home loans and related
securities that left taxpayers shouldering losses after the
global financial crisis. </p>
<p>Compared with notes from local issuers, Samurai bonds are
more exposed to overseas risk, said Yoshihiro Nakatani, a
Tokyo-based senior fund manager who oversees about 100 billion
yen of bonds at Asahi Life Asset Management Co. Spreads on
Samurai have fallen to unattractive levels, and it will be
difficult for Japanese investors to buy at the kind of rates
offered by JPMorgan and GE in future. </p>
<h2>Spread Unattractive'' </h2>
<p>Nakatani, who has invested in GE Capital''s debt in the
past, said he didn''t buy the Norwalk, Connecticut-based
company''s notes this time because the spread was
unattractive. He doesn''t invest in U.S. banks like JPMorgan
as they can be affected more by financial regulation, he said. </p>
<p>Tom Steiner, a London-based spokesman for GE Capital,
declined to comment on the company''s sale. Yukako Yoshino, a
spokeswoman for JPMorgan in Tokyo, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last had a Samurai sale smaller than last week''s
in September 2004, when it issued 25 billion yen in notes,
following two bigger sales the same year, according to
Bloomberg-compiled data. General Electric hasn''t had a smaller
sale, according to the data going back to 1999. </p>
<p>GE Capital sold 95 billion yen of Samurai notes in
September, including 72.1 billion yen in debt also 10 basis
points over yen swaps. The spread on securities of the same
length offered last week declined to 4 basis points. A basis
point is 0.01 percentage point. </p>
<p>JPMorgan issued 105.6 billion yen of Samurai bonds in June,
including 51.5 billion yen in three-year notes at 10 basis
points over swaps, the same level as last week. </p>
<h2>Falling Spread </h2>
<p>The average spread on Samurais was at 41 basis points on
Feb. 6, the least since November 2007, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch index data. </p>
<p>GE is rated AA+ by Standard  Poor''s, its second-highest
ranking, and four levels above the A grade it gives JPMorgan.
SP lowered its outlook on JPMorgan to negative from stable in
June, saying that the likelihood of extraordinary government
support for the U.S. bank is waning. </p>
<p>The Topix index of Japanese shares has fallen 8.7 percent
this year after a 52 percent gain in 2013. The gauge rose on
Feb. 7 to pare a fifth straight week of losses. </p>
<p>Stock prices are falling and investors are worried, so
they aren''t going after credit investments, said Mana Nakazora, the chief credit analyst at BNP Paribas in Tokyo, in a
telephone interview. There''s very little incentive to make
investments at such low levels at a difficult time to assess
risk. </p>
<h2>Biggest Seller </h2>
<p>JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. seller of Samurai bonds since
the global financial crisis, issuing 426.7 billion yen of the
notes from 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
General Electric is the second largest, at 370.7 billion yen. </p>
<p>Issuers from Australia to Norway have raised about 370
billion yen via Samurai sales this year, up from 60 billion for
the entire first quarter of last year. National Australia Bank
Ltd. is the biggest issuer of the securities this year, having
sold 123.8 billion yen last month. Norway''s DNB Bank ASA sold
81.6 billion yen also in January. </p>
<p>Following the emerging-market shock, and possibility of
spreads widening for overseas names, there appears to have been
a feeling that there wasn''t a need to rush to buy GE Capital''s
Samurai this time, said Yusuke Ueda, a Tokyo-based credit
analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For JPMorgan, the
tone seems to have been a little different and the bank had
less of a need to sell Samurai debt, he said. </p>
<h2>Mortgage Settlement </h2>
<p>JPMorgan will pay $614 million after admitting it submitted
ineligible loans for Federal Housing Administration and Veterans
Affairs insurance, according to a statement on Feb. 4 by the
U.S. Justice Department. </p>
<p>The company said in a statement the same day that the
settlement represents another significant step in the firm''s
efforts to put historical mortgage-related issues behind it.
The bank separately agreed last year to pay $4 billion to settle
Federal Housing Finance Agency claims related to about $33
billion in mortgage bonds. </p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, JPMorgan probably would have
liked to sell a lot, lot more bonds at a premium of as little
as 10 basis points, said BNP''s Nakazora said. It''s litigation
risk has been very big. </p>

declined to comment on the complaint. </p>
<p>The department is confident that the settlement reached
with JPMorgan Chase complies with the law, Ellen Canale, a
Justice Department spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<h2>Financial Reform'' </h2>
<p>Better Markets describes itself as a nonprofit,
nonpartisan organization that promotes the public interest in
financial reform. It was founded by Michael Masters, founder
and managing member of Atlanta-based Masters Capital Management. </p>
<p>The group expects that its standing to bring the complaint
will be challenged, Kelleher said. </p>
<p>It will be hotly contested but I believe we have a solid
foundation to prove and demonstrate concrete and demonstrable
harm that give us ample standing to assert both the
constitutional claims and the statutory claims, Kelleher said. </p>
<p>If we do not, what that means is that no one in the
United States can ever challenge a backroom deal like this cut
by any attorney general, he said. </p>
<p>Better Markets'' standing derives from its public interest
purpose being thwarted by a lack of transparency in the
settlement process and the lack of a judicial forum in which
it could seek to participate to influence the outcome, the
group said in its complaint. </p>
<h2>Novel Claim'' </h2>
<p>The complaint doesn''t cite any precedents for challenges to
similar Justice Department settlements with banks. </p>
<p>I think it''s fair to call it a novel claim, driven by
uniquely damaging and far-reaching circumstances, Kelleher said
in a phone interview following his press conference. </p>
<p>At least one portion of the settlement, a $2 billion civil
penalty obtained under the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, or FIRREA, explicitly
required a court to levy the sanction, according to the
complaint. </p>
<p>Better Markets also alleged that the Justice Department and
U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder have an apparent conflict of
interest because they have been criticized for failing to be
tough enough on large Wall Street firms and have aggressively
used the $13 billion agreement to try to restore their
reputations. </p>
<p>The settlement is a mere contract whereby JPMorgan
agreed to pay in exchange for complete civil immunity from DOJ
for years of pervasive, egregious and knowing alleged fraud and
other illegal conduct related to the worst financial crash in
the U.S. since 1929, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>The case is Better Markets Inc. v. U.S. Department of
Justice, 14-cv-00190, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia
(Washington). </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)''s New Zealand unit
isn''t liable for the cost of cleaning up waterfront land it
leased in Auckland partly because the country has no laws to
deal with the issue, a judge ruled. </p>
<p>The Auckland Waterfront Development Agency, which is
undertaking New Zealand''s biggest urban revitalization project,
sought NZ$10 million ($8.3 million) from Mobil Oil New Zealand
Ltd. to pay for the cost of the clean up in the area known as
Wynyard Quarter, according to the ruling. </p>
<p>Mobil Oil operated a bulk fuel storage and distribution
center at the site since the 1950s, leaving the properties
heavily contaminated when it ceased operations in 2011, the
judge said. The contamination was caused by Mobil''s own
operations as well as what was left by previous oil company
tenants and what had spread from neighbors, such as a 1.8
million liter spill of jet fuel by a Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) unit
in 1986, the judge said. </p>
<p>Unlike a number of other countries, New Zealand has no
specific legislation dealing with liability for historic
contaminated sites, High Court Justice Sarah Katz wrote in the
Feb. 7 decision, posted on the court''s website today. </p>
<p>Mobil acted reasonably, leaving the property in a condition
suitable to be taken over by another industrial tenant, Katz
said. </p>
<p>When it signed the last lease in 1985, there was no
realistic possibility of the land being used for commercial or
residential purposes, the judge wrote. It was not until a
further plan change became operative in 2010 that there were
concrete provisions to develop the Wynyard Quarter. </p>
<p>The area is now being developed to include a mix of
residential, retail and commercial uses, while retaining
existing marine and fishing industry uses, the judge said. </p>

<p>The unit now oversees $343 billion in traditional equity

<h2>Expansion Plans </h2>
<p>Fleming said he''ll boost assets and revenue by increasing
the North American sales force, adding more choices within long-only fund offerings and raising new merchant-banking funds. The
firm will also seek more assets for its liquidity products and
reduce capital tied up in hedge funds, he said. </p>
<p>Risks to the plans include new regulations, an investor
shift toward passive investments and fee compression, Fleming
said. Merchant banking will take 18 months to 36 months to show
benefits from raising new funds, he said. </p>

Stanley (MS) Wealth Management, that serves mostly individual
investors. </p>

<p>As they marketed one of the biggest commercial-mortgage bond deals ever in June 2007, just as credit markets began to crumble, bankers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) handed out T-shirts depicting a glass it declared half full. </p> <p>Six years later, after the $7.6 billion of securities plunged in the collapse of the U.S. property market that pushed loans included in the deal into default, the glass is filling up.

<p>Bill Ackman, the activist hedge-fund
manager, said he sold his firm''s General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP)
shares because the expected returns on the investment after
management fees wouldn''t be high enough for his investors. </p>
<p>There''s still meaningful upside in General Growth,
Ackman said yesterday at the Harbor Investment Conference in New
York. I do view this as a teens compounded return over the
next four or five years, so I think that''s actually a good
investment. </p>
<p>Continuing to own stock in the Chicago-based company, the
second-largest U.S. shopping-mall owner, wouldn''t work with the
expected return after Pershing Square Capital Management LP''s
fees of 1.5 percent of assets and 20 percent of profit, Ackman
said. You don''t get to a high enough number to please our
investors, so that''s why we sold General Growth, he said. </p>
<p>The real estate investment trust, one of Ackman''s most
profitable investments, bought back about 28 million shares from
New York-based Pershing Square for $556 million, General Growth
said this week. The hedge-fund firm, which in September sold 25
million shares for $500 million, no longer holds any General
Growth common stock, the mall owner said. </p>
<p>Ackman, 47, helped rescue General Growth from near-collapse
by pushing it to file for bankruptcy in 2009, and was part of an
investor group in its subsequent reorganization. The effort
turned $60 million into $1.6 billion, the hedge-fund manager
told Bloomberg News in 2011, and contributed to his flagship
fund''s net return of 29 percent in 2010. </p>
<p>General Growth Properties is a great company, Ackman
said yesterday. I''d recommend it to my sister, my mother. </p>
<h2>Largest Bankruptcy </h2>
<p>General Growth filed the largest real estate bankruptcy in
U.S. history in April 2009 after amassing $27 billion in debt
that it was unable to refinance because of the financial crisis
and collapse of the commercial mortgage-backed securities
market. The company''s restructuring plan provided a full
recovery for creditors and a rare recovery for shareholders. </p>
<p>Pershing Square was in an investor group that included
Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Bruce Berkowitz''s Fairholme
Capital Management LLC. The partnership committed more than $8
billion to bring General Growth, the biggest U.S. mall owner
after Simon Property Group Inc., out of Chapter 11. </p>
<p>General Growth shares rose 0.1 percent to $21.62 today.
They''ve climbed 8.6 percent in the past year. </p>
<p>The company used available liquidity to fund the
purchase of Pershing Square''s shares, according to General
Growth''s Feb. 10 statement. </p>

<p>Morgan Advanced Materials Plc (MGAM), whose
insulation protects airplane black-boxes, will consider making
acquisitions to gain technology, according to Chief Executive
Officer Mark Robertshaw. </p>
<p>The company is looking to expand in aerospace and
healthcare markets, Robertshaw said today. Shares of Morgan,
whose ceramics are used in everything from body armor to medical
instruments, gained as much as 2.4 percent in London trading
after reporting better-than-estimated pretax profit. </p>
<p>We have more of these types of businesses in North
America, and it''s no coincidence that margins for the region are
16 percent compared with just under 13 percent for the group,
the CEO said in an interview. </p>
<p>Robertshaw is leading the company''s transformation as it
focuses on higher-growth and more profitable areas to counter
weaker demand for ceramics used in semiconductors. Windsor,
England-based Morgan sold businesses with 20 million pounds in
sales last year, and that tally could reach 50 million pounds in
2014 through additional divestments, split between electrical
carbon and thermal-ceramic products, the CEO said. </p>
<p>The stock rose 1.1 percent to 315.8 pence as of 12:26 p.m.
in London, giving the company a market value of 901.8 million
pounds. </p>
<h2>Medical Market </h2>
<p>Healthcare and aerospace industries in emerging markets
such as China and India have good growth potential in the
future as these economies become more sophisticated, the CEO
said. Morgan makes ceramics used in medical instrumentation and
implantable devices. China contributes about 9 percent to group
revenue. </p>
<p>Boeing Co., the world''s largest planemaker, and Airbus
Group NV, the No. 2, have pushed output to record levels helping
lift sales at their suppliers. </p>
<p>The U.K. company, previously known as Morgan Crucible, is
also poised to benefit from expansion in the U.S. petrochemical
industry as manufacturers take advantage of shale gas and
cheaper raw materials, the CEO said. Morgan has about 40 percent
of the North American market for high-temperature fibers, used
for heat insulation in ethylene plants and fire-protection
products. </p>
<p>After a pretty subdued 2013, the last couple of weeks
has seen an uptick in enquiries converting into contract wins,
Robertshaw said. Morgan won a $5 million contract to supply a
petrochemical project in India at the end of last year, and
another one of a similar amount in North America. </p>
<p>We''re feeling a bit more optimistic in 2014, he said. </p>
<h2>Middle East </h2>
<p>A new insulating-fiber plant being built in the Middle East
will bring Morgan closer to the attractive petrochemical and
aluminum markets, while also giving it access to low-cost energy
supplies, Robertshaw said. </p>
<p>Bolt-on acquisitions will supplement what will be
predominantly organic growth, Robertshaw said. Morgan will
spend as much as 6 million pounds on restructuring this year,
down from 10.5 million pounds last year, he said. </p>
<p>The company was seen in 2012 as potentially a takeover
target because of its cheap valuation and after 3M Co. agreed to
buy rival Ceradyne Inc. </p>
<p>The operational performance of the business stands up
incredibly well versus all of our direct competition,
Robertshaw said, when asked whether the company had been
approached by potential buyers. That''s the best possible
defense. </p>

<p>India will award permits this month
to build solar power plants in the first national auction since
2011 as a trade spat with the U.S. over import curbs deepens. </p>
<p>ReNew Power Ventures Pvt., a company backed by Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., the Tata group, whose businesses span software
to automobiles, and First Solar Inc. (FSLR), the biggest U.S. maker of
solar panels, are among 68 bidders vying for projects as India
seeks clean alternatives to fossil fuels. The winners for the
750 megawatts of capacity will be announced by the end of this
month. </p>
<p>India plans a sixfold increase in solar capacity that may
draw $11.7 billion of investment by 2017 as the technology sheds
perceptions that risks are high. In contrast, banks are slowing
lending to coal and gas-fired projects hamstrung by a fuel
squeeze. Rising demand for equipment is also prompting panel
makers to seek a bigger share of the trade as the U.S. lodged a
complaint with the World Trade Organization this week against
India''s barriers. </p>
<p>The advantage of renewables is that you know that the
cost is going to be forever, said Sumant Sinha, chief
executive officer of ReNew Power, which is backed by a $385
million investment from Goldman Sachs. You lock in the price
today. You''re not impacted by the rupee''s depreciation. There''s
no fuel risk. </p>
<h2>Yarn Maker </h2>
<p>Three years ago, India''s first national solar auction drew
skepticism with record-low bids from a woolen yarn maker and
animation company. Tata Power Co. shunned that tender, saying
banks wouldn''t loan to projects deemed too risky. </p>
<p>The current tender received bids for more than double the
capacity available. The offers include 100 megawatts by ReNew,
150 megawatts by a unit of India''s Infrastructure Leasing 
Financial Services Ltd. and 40 megawatts by Tata Power. </p>
<p>The growth of the industry has boosted inbound shipment of
photovoltaic gear, with the value of the purchases reaching $2.4
billion since 2010 when India started its solar program,
according to data from the Ministry of Commerce. </p>
<p>In order to help local makers of solar modules including
Moser Baer India Ltd. (MBI), India is requiring half of the capacity
being auctioned to be built with locally made equipment. That''s
375 megawatts or about 10 percent of the total capacity India
has offered in the past year. The U.S. said this rule unlawfully
restricts access to American manufacturers such as First Solar. </p>
<p>India said it will dispute the complaint lodged by the U.S.
with the WTO against the unfair barrier to U.S. exports. </p>
<h2>Offsetting Costs </h2>
<p>India is offering as much as 18.75 billion rupees ($302
million) in grants for the first time to solar developers to
offset project costs. That will enable the plants to reduce the
electricity tariff to 5.5 rupees a kilowatt-hour, equal to the
cost of grid power. </p>
<p>That eliminates one of the main investment hurdles the
industry faced: the risk that cash-strapped state utilities
buying the power would default, leaving plants unable to sell
their output elsewhere. At 5.5 rupees, the plants could find
alternate buyers, including industrial and commercial consumers
who pay the highest rates for power. </p>
<p>Renewables are attracting a different class of investors
who want stable yields, said Sunil Wadhwa, chief executive of
ILFS Energy Development Co., a developer of gas, coal and
clean-energy projects. These are stable cash flows. For the
investor, the costs are highest in the beginning, but it''s more
predictable. </p>
<h2>Stable Returns </h2>
<p>Clean energy projects in Europe are luring institutional
cash as retirement and insurance funds, including Allianz SE,
Aviva Plc (AV/) and PensionDanmark A/S seek stable returns to match
their long-term liabilities. Copenhagen-based PensionDanmark has
invested about $1.8 billion in renewable energy, while Allianz
Capital Partners, a unit of Europe''s largest insurer, invested
more than 400 million euros ($545 million) last year. </p>
<p>In India, investors from Goldman to Morgan Stanley (MS) have led
about $2 billion of private-equity buyouts, project and company
acquisitions in the renewable industry since 2010, according to
Bloomberg New Energy Finance. In the past year, the Government
of Singapore Investment Corp. invested 100 million pounds ($166
million) in Greenko Group Plc (GKO), a developer of Indian wind farms.
GE Energy Financial Services invested 2.57 billion rupees in a
hydropower plant in northern Sikkim state under development by
Gati Infrastructure Pvt. </p>
<p>Photovoltaic plants in India are likely to earn a 16
percent return, according to calculations by the central
electricity regulator to set tariffs. That compares with a yield
of 8.87 percent offered by India''s benchmark 10-year bond. </p>
<h2>Thermal Power </h2>
<p>Foreign direct investment in India''s thermal power sector
has collapsed to less than one-third its level two years ago as
fuel risks, regulatory uncertainties and environmental delays
hold up projects, according to government data. </p>
<p>More than 60 percent of power stations owned by NTPC Ltd.,
the nation''s biggest generator, are running below capacity due
to a lack of coal supply, NTPC Director A.K. Jha said this week.
India plans to raise local gas prices by as much as 90 percent
to $8 per million British thermal units, a level that will be
unviable for power plants, Oil Secretary Vivek Rae said on Jan.
12. </p>
<p>With coal and gas prices rising and an increasing share to
be imported, a clean-energy project may already be able to
supply electricity about 3 percent cheaper over the long term,
said Wadhwa of ILFS Energy, which is building a 750-megawatt
gas power plant and is India''s second-biggest owner of wind
farms. </p>
<p>Indonesia, the biggest coal supplier to India, banned
exports of raw ores last month. Tomorrow it might be coal,
said Wadhwa. In thermal, you''re never sure. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is poised
to become the first U.S. commercial bank to sell bonds in
Australia this year, while Westpac Banking Corp. is also
planning a new line of notes. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is marketing fixed- and floating-rate
Australian dollar bonds due August 2019 at a yield of about 135
basis points more than swap rates, according to an e-mailed
statement today from the issuer. Sydney-based Westpac,
Australia''s second-biggest lender by market value, plans to sell
five-year securities at a spread of around 95 basis points,
according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to
be identified because the terms aren''t set. </p>
<p>Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
in Australia with the yield premium over the swap rate on bank
paper averaging 99 basis points yesterday and 94 on Feb. 7, a
low unseen since February 2008, according to a Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds in
Australia since Goldman Sachs''s last transaction in July, when
it priced A$750 million ($670 million) of five-year fixed and
floating-rate notes at a 170-basis-point spread. </p>
<p>Investment banks were one of the strongest performing
sectors in 2013 and I''d expect the Goldman Sachs deal to perform
well, although recent emerging-market ructions could damp demand
a bit, said Justin Davey, a money manager at BT Investment
Management Ltd. </p>
<h2>Rabobank, ABN Amro </h2>
<p>Dutch lenders Rabobank Groep and ABN Amro NV are the only
other foreign commercial banks to have come to the Australian
market so far this year, issuing A$600 million and A$500 million
of notes respectively last month. </p>
<p>The August 2018 fixed-rate bond that Goldman Sachs sold
last year yielded 106 basis points more than the swap rate
today, Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. prices show.
The American bank carries a credit rating of A- at Standard 
Poor''s, the seventh highest, and is ranked Baa1 at Moody''s
Investors Service, one level lower. </p>
<p>National Australia Bank Ltd. was the last of the so-called
four-pillar domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its
home market, pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures
in November at a spread of 88 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Both Commonwealth Bank of Australia and
ANZ priced five-year securities in October. The last new
benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac (WBC) was issued in
January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. </p>
<p>There haven''t been many primary bank issues since the
latter part of 2013, BT''s Davey said. I''d expect there to be
solid interest for the Westpac transaction given the lack of
supply and the benign conditions for banks as evidenced by
recent results announcements from ANZ and CBA. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is managing its own offering along with CBA,
NAB and Royal Bank of Canada. Westpac is also managing its own
sale, the person familiar with that matter said. Both
transactions are expected to price by tomorrow. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Australian unit was
sued by the country''s competition regulator for misuse of market
power relating to sales of its generic version of the Lipitor
cholesterol drug. </p>
<p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it
filed the lawsuit today in federal court in Sydney claiming
Pfizer Australia Pty.''s deals with pharmacies in 2012 for the
sale of atorvastatin breached competition rules. A copy of the
filing wasn''t immediately available. </p>
<p>Patent protection on Lipitor, the biggest selling
prescription drug in Australia under the federal drug plan,
expired in May 2012. At the time Lipitor was prescribed to more
than 1 million Australians with annual sales exceeding A$700
million ($625 million), according to the ACCC. Prior to the
expiry Pfizer struck a deal with pharmacies, offering discounts
and rebates on the condition they bought a minimum 12 months''
supply of atorvastatin, the generic equivalent, the ACCC said. </p>
<p>Pfizer engaged in this conduct for the purpose of
deterring or preventing competitors in the market for
atorvastatin from engaging in competitive conduct, ACCC
Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. This case also raises
an important public interest issue regarding the conduct of a
patent holder nearing the expiry of that patent. </p>
<p>Pfizer said in an e-mailed statement today it believes the
offers made to the pharmacies were competitive. Since the matter
is before the court, the company said it wouldn''t be appropriate
to comment further. </p>

declarations, without specifying them. </p>

<p>Corporate-bond trading volumes are
surging to the highest ever to start the year as investors adapt
to a new reality of reduced dealer balance sheets by turning to
electronically exchanged debt and smaller transactions. </p>
<p>Even as issuance of the securities slowed, the amount of
investment-grade and junk bonds changing hands increased to
$20.3 billion on average each day this year, 3 percent more than
during the same period in 2013, Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority data show. Bond investors are turning to exchange-traded funds at a record pace, with BlackRock Inc.''s junk-bond
ETF posting record withdrawals and the greatest volume of
bearish wagers ever. </p>
<p>The trading surge is part of a bond-market evolution that
Morgan Stanley strategists led by Sivan Mahadevan say is
allowing debt buyers to maneuver without Wall Street''s biggest
banks using their own money to buy and sell in bigger blocks. As
the size of trades shrink, investors are transacting about 50
percent more than five years ago, the analysts said in a Feb. 13
report. </p>
<p>We''ve seen an increase in trading volumes despite the
fact that dealers are devoting less of their balance sheets,
Mahadevan said in a telephone interview. We''ve seen a more
efficient market, more velocity of trading. </p>
<h2>Issuance Declines </h2>
<p>Corporate-debt volumes have been higher this year than in
any other similar period and are up from the average $18.1
billion that changed hands daily in 2013, according to Trace (NTMBIV),
Finra''s bond-price reporting system. Transactions jumped even as
the amount of U.S. corporate-bond sales, which typically fuel
volumes, fell to $190.1 billion this year from $218 billion in
the period in 2013, Finra and Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>Buyers exchanged $58.1 billion of debt on MarketAxess
Inc.''s electronic platform last month, 15 percent more than in
January 2013 and the most ever for the month, according to data
on the New York-based firm''s website. </p>
<p>Despite the banks'' unwillingness to commit capital to
facilitate client trading, people are still finding ways, said
Kevin McPartland, head of market structure research at
financial-research firm Greenwich Associates. There are new
ways that are not necessarily your traditional electronic
trading ways. </p>
<h2>Less Volatile </h2>
<p>Corporate bonds have benefited this year from a flight to
fixed-income assets amid signs that a pullback in U.S. monetary
stimulus threatens to weaken economies from South Africa to
Russia. Even speculative-grade corporates have gained 1.4
percent this year, as measured by the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch U.S. High-Yield Index (SPX), while the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index of stocks has lost 0.7 percent. </p>
<p>Company-bond prices have been less volatile than in the
period last year, with values swinging by 1.47 cents on the
dollar, a narrower swing than in the same period during the past
two years. Prices have been steadied by both declining benchmark
Treasury yields and increased demand from institutional money
managers as individual investors fled riskier assets. </p>
<p>Buyers from retirees to hedge funds yanked as much as $1.7
billion from the 10-biggest junk-bond ETFs in the two weeks
after Jan. 22, the day before a report showing that a gauge of
China''s manufacturing contracted and triggered the selloff,
Bloomberg data show. </p>
<h2>BlackRock ETF </h2>
<p>BlackRock''s $13.2 billion junk-bond ETF reported a $630
million outflow on Feb. 3, its biggest one-day withdrawal since
its inception in 2007, the data show. </p>
<p>Investors including Western Asset Management Co.''s Michael Buchanan saw the outflows as a buying opportunity. </p>
<p>We were buyers on days of weakness, Buchanan, who
oversees $127 billion of credit investments at Western Asset in
Pasadena, California, said in a Feb. 4 telephone interview. </p>
<p>Debt traders who wanted to bet against junk bonds borrowed
$3.87 billion of shares in BlackRock and State Street Corp.''s
high-yield ETFs (JNK) as of Jan. 31, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The two funds are the biggest of their kind and hold
$23.6 billion of the securities. </p>
<p>Investors are managing to slip in and out of a market even
with the diminished balance sheets of dealers, which
traditionally have bought larger pools of bonds that they could
sell over a longer period of time at a profit. The strategy,
credited with cushioning price swings and facilitating larger
trade sizes, was made costlier by regulations demanding a bigger
buffer of capital to protect against losses among bank holdings. </p>
<h2>Dealers Shrink </h2>
<p>Bond dealers jettisoned assets to comply with rules issued
in 2010 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the
Dodd-Frank Act passed by Congress the same year. Primary dealers
that trade directly with the Federal Reserve cut their holdings
of corporate bonds by 76 percent from a peak of $235 billion in
2007 to $56 billion at the end of March, Fed data show. </p>
<p>Investment-grade bond holdings fell to a net $12.5 billion
in the week ended Feb. 5 from $14.4 billion the previous week,
according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data. </p>
<p>Even as total trading volumes fell behind a 91 percent
growth in corporates outstanding since 2008, investors are
adapting, the Morgan Stanley strategists said this week. They''re
trading 53 percent more frequently than they did five years ago
and larger trades were 8 percent smaller in 2013 than three
years earlier, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>While electronic platforms are unlikely to dominate a
business that''s often conducted over the phone and in e-mail
messages, some slices of the market are trading more like
equities and interest-rate products than they have in the past,
they said in the report. </p>
<p>Transparency and electronic platforms are driving a
credit-market evolution that is likely still in the beginning of
a multi-year process, the strategists wrote. The market

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) and Westpac (WBC)
Banking Corp. sold their largest Australian dollar-denominated
bonds in more than two years today. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, the first U.S. commercial bank to come to
the Australian market since July, issued A$950 million ($855
million) of notes maturing in August 2019 to yield 130 basis
points more than swap rates, a person familiar with the matter
said, asking not to be identified because the terms are private.
Westpac, the third-biggest issuer of bank debt in Australia last
year, priced A$3 billion of five-year securities at a 94-basis-point spread, according to an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Investor appetite for credit has helped cap borrowing costs
in the South Pacific nation with the average yield premium on
bank paper over the swap rate at 98 basis points yesterday and
94 on Feb. 7, a low unseen since February 2008, according to a
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. Today''s unsecured bond
sales, the largest in Australia this year, were also accompanied
by a A$2.5 billion securitized issue from Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. </p>
<p>More than A$6 billion of issuance on one day is massive
for the Australian market, said Ken Hanton, a director in
National Australia Bank Ltd.''s debt markets group. The level
of demand we have seen is a clear demonstration of the health of
the market at the moment. </p>
<p>The Goldman transaction was split into a A$700 million
fixed-rate portion and a A$250 million floating-rate component,
the person familiar said. No U.S. commercial bank has sold bonds
in Australia since Goldman''s last deal in July, when it priced
A$750 million of five-year fixed and floating-rate notes at a
170-basis-point spread, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Goldman Offerings </h2>
<p>The New York-based company raised A$600 million in November
2012 and A$1.25 billion in May 2011, its first Australian
offering following a five-year hiatus. The American bank carries
a credit rating of A- at Standard  Poor''s, the seventh highest,
and is ranked Baa1 at Moody''s Investors Service, one level
lower. </p>
<p>Westpac''s sale was also a two-part deal, comprising A$1.1
billion of fixed-rate notes and A$1.9 billion of floaters. The
last transaction from the Sydney-based lender larger than that
was in January 2012, when Westpac borrowed A$3.1 billion via its
debut domestic covered bond, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It''s rated higher than Goldman Sachs, with scores of
Aa2 at Moody''s and AA- at SP. </p>
<h2>Domestic Sales </h2>
<p>NAB was the most recent of the so-called four-pillar
domestic banks to sell new five-year notes in its home market,
pricing A$1.5 billion of floating-rate debentures in November at
a spread of 88 basis points, the data show. The last new
benchmark-sized five-year bond from Westpac was issued in
January 2013 at a 95-basis-point premium, the data show. </p>
<p>CBA (CBA), the nation''s biggest lender, also priced A$2.5 billion
of residential mortgage-backed securities today. It sold A$1.4
billion of class A1 floating-rate notes at a yield 80 basis
points above the bank-bill swap rate, A$610 million A2 class
floating-rate notes at a 90-basis-point spread and A$300 million
A3 class fixed-rated securities at a 110 basis-point spread, a
person familiar with the matter said. Pricing on a further A$201
million of notes wasn''t disclosed. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the U.S.

revenue relative to the world''s top firms last year, according
to Tricumen Ltd., a financial research company. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s share of total operating revenue from
equities in 2013 dropped 4.1 percent from the previous year,
while sales by the bank''s peer group rose a combined 15 percent,
Tricumen said in a report published today. UBS AG (UBSN), Switzerland''s
biggest bank, expanded its share by 1.4 percent, the largest
gain in the group, the data show. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs lost ground in equity derivatives due to its
limited range of services and products compared with No. 1
competitor JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), said Darko Kapor, a partner at
London-based Tricumen. Goldman Sachs fell to sixth from the
second rank by revenue in equity derivatives last year, and to
third from second in servicing hedge funds, according to
Tricumen. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, based in New York, reported $15.7 billion in
revenue from equity and fixed-income trading in 2013, down 13
percent from a year earlier, hurt mostly by interest-rate and
currency trading. In stocks, it remained the leader for cash
equities last year and is also the No. 1 in proprietary trading
by revenue, Tricumen data show. </p>

<p>A rebound in Israeli exports is
signaling to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) that central bank Governor
Karnit Flug will resist manufacturers'' calls to cut interest
rates to weaken the shekel. </p>
<p>We expect growth in total exports to pick up to around 4
percent in 2014, Kasper Lund-Jensen and Ahmet Akarli, London-based economists at Goldman Sachs, said in a report last week.
Imports will grow by a similar amount, making net impact on the
shekel fairly neutral and reducing the risks of a near-term rate cut, they said. </p>
<p>Manufacturers say the strength of the shekel, which
outperformed 30 other major currencies Bloomberg tracked last
year, was a major reason exports slipped 0.1 percent in 2013.
They kept their demand for a rate cut even after exports began
rebounding late last year and the shekel''s appreciation stalled. </p>
<p>Sales abroad rose to $4.2 billion in January from $4
billion in December, according to government data. The currency,
which gained 7.5 percent last year against the dollar, has
declined about 1 percent this year. </p>
<p>The Bank of Israel, which has held the rate at 1 percent
since October, is scheduled to announce its next decision on
Feb. 24. Sixteen of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
the bank will hold the rate again, with the rest predicting a
quarter-point cut. The shekel strengthened 0.1 percent to 3.5090
per dollar at 5:20 p.m. in Tel Aviv. </p>
<h2>Economic Upturn </h2>
<p>The bank''s monetary policy committee cited an economic
pickup and rising home prices when it kept the rate unchanged
last month. The Manufacturers Association of Israel called the
Jan. 27 decision disappointing and said borrowing costs
should be cut to 0.25 percent to weaken the shekel and make
goods sold abroad more competitive. The Israel Export 
International Cooperation Institute said on Dec. 10 that the
currency''s appreciation dealt exports a mortal blow. </p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Davos
last month that Israeli exporters must adjust to the stronger
shekel because policy makers have limited options to curb it. </p>
<p>The government today announced measures to aid exporters,
including raising the ceiling on export guarantees, expediting
approvals of export risk insurance and allocating 50 million
shekels ($14.2 million) to market goods abroad. </p>
<p>While exports have rallied in recent months, imports have
climbed more, widening the trade gap to $1.5 billion in January
from $1.2 billion a month earlier. </p>
<h2>Market Benefit </h2>
<p>The rise in exports, if maintained, will benefit equity and
bond markets, said Jonathan Katz, a Jerusalem-based economist at
HSBC Holdings Plc. The export figures were pretty broad-based
and varied, not limited to one sector like pharmaceuticals or
technology, Katz said. So although so far it''s just one
robust number, if exports and domestic demand continue trending
upwards, it will be good for companies and the whole economy and
eventually the markets. </p>
<p>The central bank has tried to weaken the shekel by stepping
up its purchase of foreign currency reserves. It bought $1.7
billion in January, after buying $630 million the previous
month, bringing its reserves to a record $83.2 billion. </p>
<p>The stabilization of the dollar-shekel rate in recent weeks
makes it probable the bank will pare its currency purchases this
month and hold the key rate, said Tal Zohar Avda, chief
executive officer of the Tel Aviv branch of FXCM Inc. (FXCM) U.S.
Federal Reserve head Janet Yellen''s Feb. 11 comment that she
intends to maintain the policy of gradually reducing bond
purchases, also support this view, Avda said. </p>
<h2>Less Pressure </h2>
<p>If the dollar continues to strengthen globally, mainly
against the euro, it will get stronger in Israel, too, Avda
said. As long as the dollar continues to stabilize or
strengthen, there will be less pressure from the exporters on
the Bank of Israel to cut the rate. </p>
<p>Goldman forecasts the bank will hold the rate through the
first half of 2014, until a continued improvement in exports, a
gradual quickening of inflation and rising housing prices
trigger a hiking cycle in the third quarter. </p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund, in its annual report on
Israel''s economy released Feb. 12, urged the government to rein
in housing costs by limiting loan-to-value ratios on mortgages
and raising the property purchase tax for secondary homes. </p>
<p>If global growth prospects improve sharply or
appreciation pressures on the shekel ease, the monetary policy
stance should be gradually normalized, the IMF said. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL) Managing
Director Terry Davis told investors he was sorry after a A$404
million ($367 million) writeoff at its packaged-foods unit SPC
Ardmona drove profit to its lowest level since 1992. </p>
<p>I apologize to not be able to bring you a better
result, Davis, who''s leaving the job March 3, told investors
on a call today after announcing an 83 percent drop in net
income to A$79.9 million for the year ended Dec. 31. Hopefully
we''ve turned the tide with SPC, he said. </p>
<p>Sales volumes at Coca-Cola Amatil''s main Australian soft
drinks business fell 3.2 percent to 338 million cases last year,
cutting group revenue by 1.1 percent to A$5.08 billion, the
first decline since 2006, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Australia''s biggest beverage company fell 5.3 percent
to A$11.22 at the close in Sydney, its lowest price since August
2011. </p>
<p>Australian food companies have been hurt by currency swings
in recent years. The Australian dollar''s rise to a 29-year high
of $1.11 in July 2011 lowered the cost of competing imports, and
its subsequent decline to 90 cents has increased the price of
raw materials. </p>
<p>Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502)''s Schweppes Australia unit, which
sells Pepsi in the country, raised prices for the first time in
two years this month, Citigroup Inc. analyst Gino Rossi wrote in
a Feb. 7 note to clients, driven by an estimated 3.5 percent
increase in costs of imported ingredients. </p>
<p>That will lessen pricing pressure on Coca-Cola, which sells
at a premium of more than 50 percent to Pepsi, according to
Rossi. </p>
<p>Aggressive competitor pricing was responsible for the
poor result from Coca-Cola Amatil''s Australian beverage unit,
the company said today. </p>
<h2>State Support </h2>
<p>The results were a negative for Coca-Cola Amatil''s credit,
Moody''s Investors Service senior vice president Ian Lewis wrote
in an opinion after the announcement. It wouldn''t affect the
company''s investment-grade ratings, which are stable at A3, he
wrote. </p>
<p>The high Australian dollar has enabled a flood of cheap
imported product to be sold in Australia below the cost of
production here while decimating SPCA''s export markets, Coca-Cola Amatil said in a regulatory statement today. The company
will pursue anti-dumping measures, changes to import tariffs,
and enforcement of standards on ingredients, according to the
statement. </p>
<h2>''Corporate Welfare'' </h2>
<p>Australia''s federal government, which has said it doesn''t
believe in corporate welfare, on Jan. 30 turned down Coca-Cola Amatil''s request for a A$25 million grant to fund
efficiency savings at SPC Ardmona. The government of Victoria
state will instead provide A$22 million alongside A$78 million
from the company, the parent company said Feb. 13. </p>
<p>The remaining book value of SPC Ardmona is just north of
A$300 million, Alison Watkins, who will take over from Davis
next month, told investors on the call. The state''s investment
won''t eliminate Coca-Cola Amatil''s ability to exit the business
if it continues to underperform, Davis said, without giving
further details. </p>

the currency to about 20 percent of its foreign-exchange
holdings for its higher yield and inexpensive valuation, said
Chicago-based fund manager Brian D. Singer. </p>
<p>The rupee has rebounded more than 10 percent from last
year''s all-time low of 68.845 per dollar as India curbed gold
imports to shore up the current account and the central bank
acted to spur dollar inflows. Only Indonesia''s rupiah has fallen
more than the rupee among Asian emerging markets. While India''s
finances have improved since last year, the nation needs a
coordinated plan to respond to volatility in global currency
markets as the U.S. reduces stimulus, the International Monetary
Fund said in a report. </p>
<p>The current-account numbers have been the key driver
because it''s a very transparent measure of whether the policy
prescriptions are having an impact, Philip Moffitt, Sydney-based head of fixed income for Asia-Pacific at Goldman Sachs
Asset, which oversaw more than $1 trillion on Dec. 31, said in 
an e-mail interview yesterday. If you can find something 
that''s relatively cheap and the fundamentals appear to be 
improving, it''s usually a good mix. </p>
<h2>Principal Risk'' </h2>
<p>The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade will shrink
to $45 billion in the year through March from an unprecedented
$88 billion the previous period, the government said Feb. 17. </p>
<p>The principal risk facing India is the inward spillover
from a tightening of global liquidity interacting with domestic
vulnerabilities, the IMF said in the report. Pressures
associated with India''s still-significant external financing
need could lead to higher borrowing costs, fund outflows and
disorderly adjustments in the exchange rate, it said. </p>
<p>Any plan should make rupee flexibility the key defense and
include measures to raise the benchmark interest rate, impose
cash curbs, open foreign-exchange swap windows and raise diesel
prices, the Washington-based lender said in an annual review of
India''s economy. </p>
<h2>Current Account </h2>
<p>Dollar-based investors will earn 9 percent including
interest by holding the rupee until the end of 2014, the second-biggest return in Asia, according to Bloomberg data based on
appreciation estimates and deposit rates. Two-year government
bonds pay 8.67 percent in India, compared with 0.31 percent in
the U.S. and 3.70 percent in China. The rupee was at 62.23 per
dollar yesterday. </p>
<p>India''s current-account shortfall decreased to $5.2 billion
in the third quarter of 2013, from $21.8 billion in the previous
three months, after Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram
raised tariffs on gold in the world''s largest bullion-consuming
nation. Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan lured $34
billion of foreign-currency inflows by offering discounted swaps
for dollars raised by banks, one of his first steps on taking
office on Sept. 4. </p>
<p>Rajan has also raised interest rates three times so far,
helping curb consumer-price inflation to 8.79 percent last month
from as much as 11.2 percent in November. </p>
<h2>Rising Confidence </h2>
<p>Options are signaling increased confidence in the rupee as
external balances improve and price pressures cool. One-month
implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the exchange
rate used to price options, has eased to 8.17 percent from last
year''s peak of 22.4 percent in September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Carry traders, who borrow in currencies with lower yields
and buy those with higher rates, have earned 4.1 percent on
rupee investments using dollars since Sept. 30, the most among
23 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Favorable
policies will help the rupee and Indonesia''s rupiah perform
better than currencies of other nations with current-account
deficits such as Brazil, Turkey and South Africa, Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. economist Fiona Lake wrote in a Feb. 19 report. </p>
<p>The appointment of Rajan, an economist credited with
presaging the 2008 global financial crisis, as the RBI''s head
encouraged William Blair, which oversaw more than $72 billion as
of Dec. 31, to boost bullish positions on the rupee, according
to portfolio manager Singer. </p>
<p>The rupee is a cheap currency with significant carry,
he said in an interview in Melbourne yesterday. It has
deviated from fundamentals and should not be included in the
fragile five, he added, referring to a description used by
Morgan Stanley last year to describe currencies most vulnerable
to capital flight. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the biggest
U.S. bank, revised its gauge of market gains and losses to
incorporate new regulatory requirements, resulting in a jump in
the frequency of losses last year. </p>
<p>Under the new method, JPMorgan posted gains on 177 of the
260 trading days in 2013 and twice exceeded its estimated value-at-risk, according to the New York-based firm''s annual filing
with the Securities and Exchange Commission today. With the old

surpassed its VaR target, the firm said. </p>
<p>Value at risk is one measure that banks use to gauge how
much traders could lose in a single day. JPMorgan disclosed in
June 2012 that a miscalculation in VaR was one reason the firm
failed to prevent a London-based trader from losing more than
$6.2 billion that year. The London Whale episode led to
criminal charges against two of the trader''s former colleagues,
management changes and more scrutiny from regulators. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s new formula calculates gains and losses by
excluding fees, commissions, fair-value adjustments, net
interest income and intraday trading fluctuations, the firm

<p>Atlantis Resources Corp., a Morgan
Stanley-backed maker of tidal turbines, raised 20 million pounds
($33 million) with a European grant, funds from a government
institution and an initial public offering in London. </p>
<p>The Singapore-based company raised 12 million pounds by
selling about 12.8 million new shares at 94 pence each on
London''s Alternative Investment Market, Chief Executive Officer
Tim Cornelius said. That values Atlantis at 72 million pounds. </p>
<p>Most investors were London-based institutions, with some
from continental Europe, Cornelius said. Morgan Stanley, which
had 45.7 percent before the placing, didn''t sell any shares. </p>
<p>We chose AIM because people in the U.K. market are
familiar with the renewables sector and there is good support,
Cornelius said. People understand the landscape here. </p>
<p>Atlantis also raised 8 million pounds through a cash grant
from the European Commission and from a government institution
that offered non-recourse financing repaid from future profits. </p>
<p>Funds investing in renewable energy have listed in London
in the past year as investors seek steady dividends that beat
returns on government bonds. Ingenious Media Holdings Plc last

testing prototypes in the hope of bringing systems to market. As
yet there are no commercial-scale projects in operation. </p>

may eventually reach as high as 398 megawatts. </p>

for the power it produces, with Scotland offering one of the
highest for tidal energy. Waters in the region are estimated to
account for as much as a quarter of Europe''s tidal resource. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is expanding its cloud services to lure customers to its
SoftLayer Technologies Inc. business, which it''s counting on to
help reverse seven quarters of falling sales. </p>
<p>IBM is making it easier for developers to build and adjust
applications in the cloud, where information is delivered online
instead of stored on local servers, said Danny Sabbah, chief
technology officer of IBM''s Next Generation Platform. The
Armonk, New York-based company plans to spend more than $1
billion on cloud-software development through 2015, a double-digit percentage increase from the past two years. </p>
<p>The move increases IBM''s bet on SoftLayer after acquiring
the company for $2 billion last year and committing $1.2 billion
in January to add 15 new data centers. As customers rely on the
cloud rather than buying their own servers, a slump in hardware
demand has contributed to IBM''s declining revenue. </p>
<p>This is crucial to expanding the potential audience and
helping them get benefit and value from using SoftLayer,
Sabbah said in an interview. This is not just about IBM''s
conventional enterprise customers. There will be a lot of
emerging companies in different areas. </p>
<p>The move underscores SoftLayer''s position as one of IBM''s
biggest gambles as it faces off with competitors such as
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) in cloud services. </p>
<h2>Big Bet </h2>
<p>The price IBM paid to acquire Dallas-based SoftLayer last
year was the biggest it has disclosed for a takeover since the
purchase of software company Lotus Development Corp. in 1995,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. SoftLayer is becoming
the backbone for IBM''s cloud business as the company wound down
its legacy SmartCloud Enterprise product this year, Lance Crosby, chief executive officer of SoftLayer, said in an
interview last month. </p>
<p>IBM is making these new capabilities available for
SoftLayer in hopes of attracting customers in different
industries than the typical bank and insurance clients that use
its cloud products at the moment, Sabbah said. One new addition
is an open-source enterprise software portfolio called BlueMix,
a platform-as-a-service that aims to help developers build
applications on its cloud infrastructure. </p>
<p>The service would rival existing platform-as-a-service
products like Amazon''s AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku Inc.''s
development platform and Red Hat Inc.''s OpenShift. </p>
<p>IBM has agreed to acquire Cloudant Inc., a cloud-delivered
database company, whose services will be offered in the BlueMix
portfolio, the company said today in a statement. Financial
terms weren''t disclosed. </p>
<h2>Watson Services </h2>
<p>SoftLayer will also gain middleware offerings, including
WebSphere, to let apps be installed on hybrid clouds, which can
access data both onsite and offsite. </p>
<p>IBM also said last month that it would create a new
business division around its Watson technology, which can
analyze large volumes of data and answer questions in
conversational language. IBM will invest more than $1 billion in
the unit and give it a headquarters in New York. Watson''s big-data services, which let customers mine vast troves of
information, will be run on SoftLayer''s cloud. </p>
<p>IBM will integrate its Power Systems servers into
SoftLayer''s cloud to help support Watson and will make it
available in the second quarter of this year, said Robert Leblanc, senior vice president of software and cloud solutions
at IBM. </p>
<p>We''ve been shifting resources for a number of years into
this space, Leblanc, said in an interview. The $1 billion is
additional investment over the next two years to continue down
that path and bring even more services out to the cloud. </p>

before credit ratings improve. </p>
<p>The yield on DP World''s $1.5 billion Islamic bonds due July
2017 slid 61 basis points this year to 2.6 percent at 2:22 p.m.
in Dubai, the lowest level since they were sold in 2007. The
yield on Jafza''s sukuk maturing two years later fell 32 basis
points. Moody''s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, which rate
DP World the lowest investment grade and business-park operator
Jafza junk, could raise both in 2014, JPMorgan said in a note
Feb. 18. </p>
<p>Dubai issuers are benefiting from an economic resurgence in
the Gulf business hub that''s boosting balance sheets, driving
funding costs lower and helping companies pay debt early. Emaar
Properties PJSC''s Islamic bond yields fell the most in more than
four months after the emirate''s biggest developer was raised by
Standard  Poor''s Feb. 5. </p>
<p>We continue seeing tangible credit momentum in Dubai
almost without exception, Zafar Nazim, a credit analyst at
JPMorgan Securities Ltd., said by phone Feb. 20. Companies are
paying off debt backed by strong cash flows, he said. </p>
<h2>Deep-Sea Port </h2>
<p>DP World lowered its net leverage by more than half since
its last upgrade three years ago, according to JPMorgan. At the
same time it invested in projects including London Gateway, a
new deep-sea port in the U.K. Jafza was raised to two steps
below investment grade by Moody''s in October after making
progress in reducing debt. </p>
<p>Jafza may not get to investment grade but they''re on
course for an upgrade with Moody''s given their deleveraging
trajectory, Nazim said. DP World was last upgraded in 2011
using 2010 numbers. Back in 2010 the world was still going
through a tight spot. </p>
<p>Moody''s said yesterday it doesn''t comment on speculation
regarding future rating actions. </p>
<p>Sukuk were among securities caught up in a developing
markets selloff last year when the U.S. said it would reduce its
$85 billion per-month bond-purchasing program. The yield on
Jafza''s debt climbed to as high as 5.84 percent June 26, while
that on DP World''s notes rose to 4.9 percent a day earlier. </p>
<h2>Another Bubble'' </h2>
<p>There are three main risks for the bonds, according to
Richard Segal, London-based head of international credit
strategy at Jeffries International Ltd. </p>
<p>Yields could rise if the U.S. Treasury (USGG10YR) market sells off
sharply again or if risk perceptions elsewhere in emerging
markets settle down and flight to quality flows reverse, he
said by e-mail Feb. 20. Segal sees a third risk if investors
begin to consider the possibility of another bubble in the
United Arab Emirates, he said. </p>
<p>Still, many feel equities are more expensive than fixed
income, so this is less of a near-term risk, Segal said. </p>
<p>Growing liquidity is another factor acting in DP World and
Jafza''s favor, Nazim said, as investors seek a place to put
their money. Sukuk sales from Dubai slowed this year, with $300
million raised compared with $750 million in the year-earlier
period. </p>
<p>Islamic bond sales in the emirate are expected to increase
as Dubai invests more than $8 billion preparing to host the
World Expo in 2020 and as $30 billion of debt comes due this
year. The sheikhdom, one of seven that make up the U.A.E., has a
stated ambition to become capital of the world''s Islamic economy
within three years. </p>
<p>Dubai expects economic growth to average 4.6 percent,
between 2012 and 2015, more than twice the pace as in the prior
four years. Amid the growth, property prices and trade are
soaring, helping Emaar, the operator of the world''s largest
mall, to regain the investment grade rating lost in 2009. </p>
<p>Upgrades will ensure that regional investors will get
more comfortable, Nazim said. You don''t need too many to
push the bonds tighter. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the lender

in settlements in 2013, said Chief Compliance Officer Cindy Armine left to join another firm after a year on the job. </p>
<p>Lou Rauchenberger, the chief administrative officer of the
corporate and investment bank, was named as interim replacement,
according to a staff memo from Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames obtained by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The departure was reported earlier today by the Wall Street

payment processor run by former JPMorgan executive Frank Bisignano. He left JPMorgan last year when Chief Executive
Officer Jamie Dimon named Zames sole chief operating officer at
the bank. Bisignano hired JPMorgan''s former Chief Information
Officer Guy Chiarello as president last year. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has clashed with regulators and law enforcement
officials over accusations that it misled buyers of mortgage
bonds, rigged markets and overlooked suspicious activity by
clients. The company agreed last month to pay $2.6 billion to

<p>Investors who have been pouring
money into funds that purchase leveraged loans need to be wary
of a reversal in demand, according to Justin Gmelich, the head
of credit trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>It''s been a bit of a one-way freight train, Gmelich
said in a question and answer session, posted on the company''s
website yesterday. I would just caution those that are
involved in the loan space to be mindful of the fact that
they''ve been beneficiaries of inflows for 88 straight weeks and
the tide can turn. </p>
<p>The floating-rate debt, which offers a shield for investors
from rising rates, has seen unprecedented demand with the funds
that purchase the debt receiving deposits every single week
since the summer of 2012. That enabled speculative-grade
companies to raise $676 billion last year of bank debt, with
more than 80 percent of that used to escape maturing debt
deadlines, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Leveraged loans in the U.S. have returned 1.2 percent this
year, after gains of 5.3 percent in 2013, according to the
Standard  Poor''s/LSTA Leveraged Loan index. Loans, which are
ranked higher up in the capital structure than junk bonds in
case of a bankruptcy, are better protected from rising interest
rates since they are generally pegged to floating-rate
benchmarks. The value of a fixed-rate security diminishes with
an increase in rates. </p>
<h2>Rate Protection </h2>
<p>Folks have been shrewd enough to try to protect against
some of the rate shock, Gmelich said. When you see fund
flows reverse, irrespective of whether or not the credit quality
is good, you see a risk retracement. </p>
<p>Retail inflow into loan mutual funds exceeded $63 billion
last year and have already netted $4.6 billion this year,
according to a Feb. 20 report from Bank of America Corp.
Companies have been able to find willing lenders as the assets
managed by mutual funds investing in the debt swelled to more
than $150 billion from about $70 billion at the start of last
year, according to data from the bank. </p>

The employees are from several of the bank''s business lines, the person said. </p> <p>JPMorgan is consolidating its real estate as it pushes to trim expenses and simplify itself by exiting businesses including student lending and private equity. Offices in and near downtown Brooklyn, where MetroTech Center is located, are among the most in demand in the city, in particular drawing young technology and social-media companies. </p> <p>If JPMorgan follows through with its plans, it will show that the market also can appeal to traditional financial firms while it tries to attract and retain young talent, said Tucker Reed, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, a group representing local businesses. </p> <p>Were they to come, it would be a validation of our office market here, Reed said in a telephone interview. The only drawback, if you can call it that, would be the challenge it creates. It means there would be even less office space for us to grow into. It makes our space dilemma a little more acute, but that''s a good problem to have. </p> <h2>Tightest Market </h2> <p>Brooklyn''s 15.5 million square feet (1.4 million square meters) of offices are more than 96 percent occupied, data from CBRE Group Inc. show. By comparison, Manhattan''s tightest office market -- the area roughly from 30th to Canal streets, known as midtown south -- has a 93 percent occupancy rate, according to the real estate services firm. </p> <p>MetroTech Center is a 3.7 million-square-foot office campus close to the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. JPMorgan owns two buildings at the complex. </p> <p>Another group of Chase Plaza-based staff members is bound for the bank''s offices at the Newport office complex on Washington Street in Jersey City, New Jersey, the person said. The transfers started in December and will continue throughout 2014, according to the person. </p> <p>The lender intends to keep about 300,000 to 400,000 square feet of offices at Chase Plaza, the person said. JPMorgan occupied about half the space in the 2.2 million-square-foot tower, according to data from CoStar Group Inc. </p> <p>We''re continually looking at ways to ensure that our space and occupancy strategy aligns with the ever-evolving needs of our business, Melissa Shuffield, a spokeswoman for the bank, said in an e-mail. </p> <h2>MetroTech Space </h2> <p>As recently as 2012, JPMorgan considered giving up at least some of its offices at MetroTech, listing about 700,000 square feet for rent, according to the person. After floods from Hurricane Sandy damaged bank offices at 4 New York Plaza, another downtown Manhattan tower, displaced workers were moved temporarily into the Brooklyn space. </p> <p>JPMorgan owns 4 MetroTech Center, with about 1.35 million square feet, and 3 MetroTech Center, according to Mrofficespace.com, a website that tracks New York office buildings. The other six buildings at the office park are owned by Forest City Ratner Cos., which started building MetroTech in the late 1980s. </p> <p>The 16-acre (6.5-hectare) campus was Brooklyn''s first modern office development, built in partnership with the New York City government. Many of its earlier tenants have been financial firms, including Bank of New York and Bear Stearns Cos., which used the properties for back-office operations. </p> <p>In recent years, the complex has attracted technology and media companies such as MakerBot Industries LLC, a developer of three-dimensional printers; and ImpreMedia LLC, which publishes Hispanic newspapers including New York''s El Diario La Prensa. </p> <p>Downtown Brooklyn has now become a very diverse ecosystem of varied companies that are more reflective of all of Brooklyn and all of New York City, said Ali Esmaeilzadeh, vice president of commercial development and leasing at Forest City Ratner. There''s still the presence of government and back-office, there''s also a surge in technology-based firms, entrepreneurial-type companies. </p> <p> ', 'JPMorgan Said to Plan Move of 2,000 Workers to Brooklyn', 'By David M.

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) named Shelley O''Connor to lead its brokerage workforce, the world''s largest,
replacing Doug Ketterer, who was appointed head of strategy and
client management. </p>
<p>Eric Heaton was named to succeed O''Connor as head of the
private banking group, Greg Fleming, president of wealth
management for Morgan Stanley, said today in a memo to
employees. Jim Wiggins, a spokesman for the New York-based firm,
confirmed the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Fleming is shuffling wealth management leaders after
boosting the unit''s targets for margins following its most
profitable year. Morgan Stanley doubled the size of its
brokerage through a joint venture with Citigroup Inc. (C) in 2009,
buying that bank''s remaining stake in the business last year. </p>
<p>O''Connor, 53, who was added to the bank''s operating
committee this month, will oversee 16,456 advisers and 649
branches as head of field management. She will manage the unit''s
three geographic regions and private-wealth business. </p>
<p>Given the breadth of her experience and proven ability to
execute strategies focused on clients and advisers, she is
ideally suited to lead the field, Fleming wrote in the memo. </p>
<p>Ketterer, who ran private-wealth management before taking
over field management in 2012, will take a new role developing
strategies for gaining customers among wealthy individuals,
foreign citizens and corporations, according to the memo. </p>
<h2>Strategy Focus </h2>
<p>Doug will focus on our overall client strategy,
acquisition and retention initiatives, how we engage with
clients, and our client-facing platforms, Fleming wrote.
Doug''s experience in each of our wealth-management,
investment-management and institutional businesses will serve us
well in this new function. </p>
<p>Heaton, who worked with Fleming at Merrill Lynch  Co. and
was recruited to Morgan Stanley in 2012, takes over O''Connor''s
role of helping the company boost lending to 4 million brokerage
clients. Morgan Stanley has said it wants 10 percent of its
customers to have loans with the firm, up from the current 5
percent. </p>

<p>Disney''s Marvel TV will start bringing the shows to Netflix
in 2015, according to a November statement. They will focus on
heroes battling villains in New York''s Hell''s Kitchen. Netflix
committed to a minimum of four 13-episode series, culminating in
the miniseries The Defenders. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) began dismissing U.S. workers yesterday, part of a $1
billion restructuring to help the company meet profit goals as
it adapts to shifts in the technology industry. </p>
<p>Workers in New York, Vermont, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri,
Oklahoma and North Carolina were fired yesterday, according to
Alliance@IBM, an employee group. The Armonk, New York-based
company had a headcount of 431,212 at the end of 2013, down 0.7
percent from a year earlier -- its first decline in a decade. </p>
<p>IBM is aiming for $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015,
up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a target made more difficult by seven
straight quarters of falling revenue. To get there, Chief
Executive Officer Ginni Rometty has fired and furloughed
workers, sold assets, cut IBM''s tax rate and bought back shares. </p>
<p>The company has already begun eliminating positions this
year in Europe, Asia and South America, according to
Alliance@IBM. Worldwide, this year''s job cuts could lead to the
elimination of at least 13,000 employees, Toni Sacconaghi, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., said in a Feb. 3 report. </p>
<p>Rometty is seeking to transform IBM as clients shift to
storing their data and applications offsite, or in the cloud,
rather than buying their own servers. </p>
<p>IBM continues to rebalance its workforce to meet the
changing requirements of its clients and to pioneer new, high-value segments of the IT industry, the company said in a
statement yesterday. At any given time, IBM has more than 3,000
job openings in its growth units, including its cloud business
and nanotechnology, the company said. </p>
<h2>Hudson Valley </h2>
<p>IBM had agreed to keep high-technology jobs in New York''s
Hudson Valley through 2016, increasing the number of positions
it has pledged to retain by 750 to 3,100, New York Governor
Andrew Cuomo said this week in a statement. That would restore
the 697 workers fired last year in Dutchess County, where the
company had about 8,000 employees as of 2012, according to the
county government. </p>
<p>Firings took place yesterday in Endicott and Poughkeepsie,
New York, Alliance@IBM said. </p>
<p>The job cuts in New York raise questions about the newly
brokered deal between the company and the state, said
Assemblyman Kieran Lalor, who represents Fishkill, New York.
Fishkill is a town in Dutchess County, where IBM has a
semiconductor chip manufacturing plant. </p>
<p>Both the state and IBM have been short on details about
the agreement, Lalor said in a letter dated Feb. 27 to Cuomo,
requesting disclosure of how many people IBM employs in New York
and information on the 3,900 jobs not guaranteed under the plan. </p>
<h2>Chip Plants </h2>
<p>IBM also makes semiconductor chips at its plant in
Burlington, Vermont, and servers in Rochester, Minnesota,
according to its website. The company has a delivery center in
Dubuque, Iowa, that was to create as many as 1,300 jobs when it
opened in 2009. The facility provides services including
outsourcing-client support, server-systems operations, security
services, and maintenance of hardware and software, according to
the website. IBM dismissed workers in all three cities, in
addition to Columbia, Missouri; Tulsa, Oklahoma; and the
Raleigh, North Carolina, area, Alliance@IBM said. </p>
<p>The company has already begun eliminating positions this
year in Europe, Asia and South America, according to
Alliance@IBM. </p>
<h2>Global Restructuring </h2>
<p>As part of the shift in its focus to products like cloud
services and data analytics, the company agreed in January to
sell its low-end server division for $2.3 billion to Lenovo. IBM
said it expects to send more than 7,000 workers to the Chinese
computer maker in the transaction. </p>
<p>The company is focused on finding a joint-venture partner
for its chip-manufacturing business after failing to attract a
buyer for the division, two people with knowledge of the matter
said this month. </p>
<p>IBM was little changed at $185.17 at the close of trading
in New York. The shares are up less than 1 percent since the
start of Rometty''s tenure at the beginning of 2012, compared
with a 48 percent gain for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p>

Assurant didn''t admit wrongdoing. </p>

prediction the facility would use 9,000 tons. </p>
<p>Tesla today sold $2 billion of convertible notes to fund
the factory intended to lower the cost of lithium-ion batteries
used in its vehicles and for power storage. The increasing
popularity of Tesla''s electric cars, which use larger battery
packs than competing models, should help narrow the coming
lithium oversupply, Koort wrote. </p>
<p>We continue to see a near-term oversupply scenario as
likely, Koort, who rates Rockwood neutral, said in the note.
An inflection in pure battery electric vehicles may help ease
oversupply of lithium around 2020. </p>
<p>Galaxy Resources Ltd. (GXY)''s decision not to resume production
in Mt. Cattlin, Australia, also contributes to the tighter
supply outlook, he said. </p>
<p>While companies like FMC Corp. don''t get a big portion of
earnings from lithium, Rockwood is positioning for an electric
vehicle inflection, Koort said. </p>
<p>Rockwood is divesting units to focus on lithium products
and surface treatments. The Princeton, New Jersey-based chemical
maker gained more access to lithium supplies with its December
agreement to form a joint venture with China''s Chengdu Tianqi
Industry Group Co. to get a stake in Talison Lithium Pty. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) awarded
employees restricted stock worth $2.3 billion for their 2013
performance, the smallest amount in two years as the firm cut
costs by lowering the portion of revenue it set aside for pay. </p>
<p>The firm granted 13.8 million restricted shares that vest
over several years, New York-based Goldman Sachs said today in
its annual regulatory filing. The value, down from $2.4 billion
a year earlier, is based on the closing price on Jan. 28, when
senior executives were given their awards. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, cut
compensation to 37 percent of revenue last year, the second-lowest portion since the firm went public in 1999. That
contributed to a 6 percent increase in net income even as
revenue was little changed. </p>
<p>Banks have been seeking to balance regulatory pressure to
tie awards to long-term performance with shareholders'' desire
for flexibility to cut pay costs if needed. Goldman Sachs Chief
Financial Officer Harvey M. Schwartz, 49, has said the firm is
reluctant to ramp up the amount of pay it defers because it is
a bit of mortgaging the future. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said about 70 percent of the restricted stock
awards were recognized as expenses immediately. The cost
recorded by the firm is probably lower than the current value of
the shares because the bank accounts for the fact that employees
can''t immediately sell the shares. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), owner of the world''s largest brokerage,
gave employees $2.72 billion in deferred awards for 2013
performance, including $1.25 billion of restricted stock and
$1.47 billion of deferred cash. About $100 million of the awards
were expensed in 2013. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs didn''t disclose any deferred cash awards, and
the firm hasn''t typically given such bonuses. </p>

<p>The plunging ruble is prompting
Morgan Stanley to switch its interest-rate forecast to an
increase from a cut as inflation risks mount, punishing holders
of Russian bonds already roiled by rising tensions with Ukraine. </p>
<p>The ruble, set for the biggest drop against the dollar this
month among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg, tumbled to
record lows this week as Russia conducted military exercises
near its border with Ukraine, where gunmen occupied a regional
parliament building and airport in the Crimean peninsula. The
slide is stoking inflation concern, jeopardizing the central
bank''s 5 percent target for consumer-price growth this year.
Policy makers suggested they may need to lift borrowing costs. </p>
<p>Recent ruble weakness is sparking the risk that inflation
will accelerate over the next few months, Dmitry Dorofeev, a
money manager at BCS Financial Group in Moscow, said in e-mailed
comments on Feb. 25. This may force the central bank to
temporarily raise rates. The biggest losers are the medium-dated
notes, where local players dominate. </p>
<p>The currency depreciated 0.5 percent to 42.2585 against
Bank Rossii''s target basket of dollars and euros at 2:23 p.m. in
Moscow, heading for another record-low close. It has weakened
2.6 percent against the greenback this month, while Russia''s
local-currency bonds lost 2.7 percent in dollars, the worst
performance in the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Sovereign
EMEA index. The gauge is up 2.6 percent in February. </p>
<h2>Game Changer'' </h2>
<p>This year''s depreciation is a game changer that will
lead to higher inflation and a 50 basis point, or 0.5 percentage
point, interest-rate increase by the end of June, Morgan Stanley
analysts led by Jacob Nell and James Lord said in an e-mailed
note on Feb. 24. They revised an earlier call for a half-percentage-point rate cut in the second half of 2014. </p>
<p>Such calls are weakening Russia''s shorted-dated government
notes most, compressing the spread with longer-dated securities. </p>
<p>The extra yield investors demand to hold 15-year government
bonds over five-year debt declined to 55 basis points today, the
lowest in 13 months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>A weaker ruble with pass-through effect into inflation
and more hawkish comments from the central bank have pushed up
the short end of the curve, Jetro Siekkinen, an emerging-market bond manager in Helsinki at Aktia Asset Management, which
has about $10.5 billion in assets, said by e-mail on Feb. 25. </p>
<h2>Armed Gunmen </h2>
<p>Ukraine''s acting president Oleksandr Turchynov said Russian
soldiers were directly involved in a conflict in Crimea as
armed troops wearing uniforms without insignia guarded the
region''s main airport in Simferopol. </p>
<p>This week gunmen occupied the Crimean parliament in the
same city after the ouster of Ukraine''s pro-Moscow President
Viktor Yanukovych following months of anti-government protests. </p>
<p>Russia, whose Black Sea fleet is based in Crimea, put
fighter jets on combat alert yesterday as part of its military
drills, Interfax news service said, citing the Defense Ministry. </p>
<p>The market is really afraid because it doesn''t understand
what''s going on, Vadim Bit-Avragim, who helps oversee about
$4.2 billion at Kapital Asset Management in Moscow, said by
phone yesterday. All investors are pricing in the possibility
of Russia''s military intervention in Ukraine. </p>
<h2>Credibility'' Issue </h2>
<p>Russia''s benchmark Micex (INDEXCF) stock index snapped four days of
declines, rising 0.1 percent today. The additional yield on
Russian dollar bonds over Treasuries declined three basis points
to 244, according to an index compiled by JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The yield on bonds due February 2027 rose two basis points
to 8.46 percent today, equal to a 19-month-high set last week.
The share of non-residents in the 3.7 trillion local ruble bond
market fell to 23.9 percent on Jan. 1 from 28.1 percent on May
1, according to central bank data. </p>
<p>Russia''s inflation rate may rise above 6.5 percent in March
and April, from 6.1 percent in January, pushing Bank Rossii to
hike to maintain its credibility, according to Morgan
Stanley''s note. Rates will stay on hold in the second half of
2014 before a gradual, 100 basis-point easing cycle once
inflation is in line with the target, the analysts wrote. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) appointed Gokul
Laroia as Asia-Pacific co-chief executive officer to replace
William Strong, who is retiring in May. </p>
<p>Laroia, 47, becomes head of the region excluding Japan with
Wei Sun Christianson and will retain his current
responsibilities as head of the New York-based firm''s
institutional equity and wealth-management business, Nick Footitt, a Hong Kong-based spokesman, said by telephone. </p>
<p>Strong, 61, will remain as a senior adviser at the firm,
Footitt said, confirming an internal memo. Strong, who has been
at Morgan Stanley since 1993, and Christianson were named to
lead the bank''s operations in the region in March 2011. </p>
<p>During his three-year tenure, Strong oversaw the firm''s
expansion in Indonesia and exit of businesses in India as Morgan
Stanley sought to cut costs and improve return on equity. In
2012, the firm started its local equities business in Indonesia.
Last year, it sold its domestic wealth management and mutual-fund business in India and surrendered an Indian banking
license. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley already had banking and capital markets
operations in Indonesia prior to establishing the domestic
institutional equities business, which Laroia oversees. </p>
<h2>Management Committee </h2>
<p>Laroia, who is based in Hong Kong, joined Morgan Stanley in
1995 and was earlier this month appointed to the firm''s global
management committee. He was co-head of investment banking in
the region for almost two years through April 2011, after
serving as head of global capital markets for Asia between 2006
and 2009. Prior to that, he was head of mergers and acquisition
for Asia-Pacific, excluding Japan. </p>
<p>Strong joined Morgan Stanley to run North American
investment banking offices outside New York. He was previously
head of international investment banking at Salomon Brothers,
based in London. He joined Salomon in 1979 in New York. </p>
<p>Last year, Strong was named by Hong Kong Chief Executive
C.Y. Leung as a member of the newly established Financial
Services Development Council, a 22-person committee tasked with
the development of the city''s financial services industry. </p>
<p>Strong graduated from Purdue University in 1973 with a
Bachelor of Science and has a Master of Business Administration
degree from Northwestern University''s Kellogg School of
Management. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s newly appointed
Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, in an effort to reignite
growth, is shuffling management and putting former political
operative Mark Penn in the new role of chief strategy officer. </p>
<p>Tony Bates, who was passed over for the CEO job, is leaving
the company, with Eric Rudder, the head of advanced strategy,
taking over his duties on an interim basis, Microsoft said today
in a memo to employees. Tami Reller, the executive vice
president in charge of marketing, is also leaving and being
replaced by Chief Marketing Officer Chris Capossela. </p>
<p>The shakeup is the most extensive yet for Nadella, who was
named CEO in February after a five-month search and is tasked
with speeding up a turnaround at the world''s biggest software
maker. He''ll be leaning on a former political strategist in
Penn, who worked on Hillary Clinton''s failed 2008 presidential
bid. More recently, Penn, 60, developed Microsoft''s Don''t Get
Scroogled advertising campaign, a political-style attack on
Google Inc. </p>
<p>He''s aggressive, Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein  Co., said of Penn. Maybe this will add a little
testosterone to the organization to counter the fact that Satya
is more of a deep thinker. </p>
<p>Penn''s background is in public relations -- he spent six
years as CEO of Burson-Marsteller. His aggressive style puts him
at odds with some managers, who were uncomfortable with the
Scroogled campaign, said people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<h2>Super Bowl Ad </h2>
<p>He''s also helped develop less controversial ads like
Microsoft''s first national Super Bowl commercial this year. In
the ad, former football player Steve Gleason, who suffers from
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and can''t speak, narrated
using Microsoft technology. </p>
<p>His focus on using data to quickly evaluate and evolve
our campaigns has driven new insights and understanding,
Nadella said in the memo. </p>
<p>Part of Penn''s job will involve helping the company decide
where to invest, and he will join the product leadership team,
said a person with knowledge of the change. </p>
<p>The overhaul follows last month''s announcement that
hardware group chief Julie Larson-Green will move to the
applications and services unit. Thom Gruhler, a vice president
who oversaw Windows and Windows Phone marketing, will lead
marketing for the applications and services group, people with
knowledge of the matter said. Reller notified employees of that
change in an e-mail, they said. </p>
<h2>Mobile Laggard </h2>
<p>Microsoft shares fell 1.4 percent to $37.78 at the close in
New York. The stock has risen 3.9 percent since Nadella''s
appointment on Feb. 4, and has trailed the Standard  Poor''s 500
Index in three of the past four years. </p>
<p>Nadella, a 22-year Microsoft veteran, is the company''s
third CEO after Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. He''s charged with
accelerating expansion at a company that hasn''t seen sales
growth exceed 6 percent since 2011. Microsoft''s investments in
mobile haven''t put a dent in Google and Apple Inc.''s control of
the smartphone market, while cloud applications from competitors
pose an increasing threat to Microsoft''s flagship Windows
business. </p>
<p>Nadella is trying things out, said Moerdler, who has
the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft. He said he expects
additional changes in senior leadership, including possible
outside hires. </p>
<h2>Job Split </h2>
<p>Bates was among the leading internal candidates for the top
job, along with Nadella and Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner. Bates, a former Cisco Systems Inc. executive, ran
Microsoft''s Skype unit before becoming an executive vice
president in July. He doesn''t have another job lined up and
plans to take some time to figure out his next move, said a
person familiar with his plans. </p>
<p>Reller, who joined Microsoft in 2001, was also promoted to
executive vice president in July and led marketing for the
Windows 8 operating system. Capossela had been named chief
marketing officer back in 2011, though his role was reduced in
July when Ballmer split marketing between Reller and Penn, with
the latter taking on advertising strategy. </p>
<p>Penn''s ties to the Clintons date back to the 1990s and his
work in the re-election campaign for President Bill Clinton. He
worked on Hillary Clinton''s campaign until April 2008, when he
came under fire for his firm''s role in promoting trade with
Colombia. </p>
<p>At Microsoft, Penn has a longstanding relationship with
Ballmer and Gates and advised the company during its antitrust
case with the U.S. government. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is unveiling a new
Web-based Office application that uses search and social data to
display a user''s most important files and projects, seeking to
boost sales and fend off competition. </p>
<p>The app, code-named Oslo, has versions for Windows 8, the
Internet and mobile devices, including those based on Apple
Inc.''s and Google Inc.''s software for smartphones and tablets,
Jeff Teper, a Microsoft vice president, said in an interview.
The first Oslo programs, probably for Windows 8 and the Web,
will be available in the second half of 2014, he said. </p>
<p>Microsoft wants to move more customers to cloud-based
versions of its Office productivity software, which are
delivered via the Internet, in order to boost growth and fend
off similar applications. Cloud programs are sold as
subscriptions, providing more regular sales compared with the
cycle of customers buying a version of Office every few years,
said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. </p>
<p>On the corporate side, they have a belief they can
significantly differentiate the Microsoft offering from others
with search and social features, Moerdler said. They want to
make Office massively more interactive. </p>
<p>The product incorporates features from two Microsoft
acquisitions: The 2012 purchase of Yammer Inc., which provides
social-networking tools for companies, and the acquisition in
2008 of Norway''s Fast Search  Transfer ASA, a search technology
developer. The Oslo code name is a nod to the Norwegian unit''s
team. </p>
<h2>Office Graph </h2>
<p>Instead of opening Outlook, Word or Excel, users of the new
app will have a dashboard of projects and files they''re working
on, as well as topics they should know about and those popular
among co-workers. Oslo will also let users search by categories,
such as modified by me, shared with me and trending
around me. Clicking on a colleague brings up not just that
person''s manager, peers and direct reports, but others working
on projects across an entire company. </p>
<p>Underlying Oslo is what Microsoft is calling the Office
Graph, an idea similar to the social graph, a term popularized
by Facebook Inc. for the depiction of personal relationships,
said Adam Pisoni, the Yammer co-founder who is now a Microsoft
vice president. The Office graph would act as a repository of
data culled from a user''s social relationships and actions.
Microsoft will also open up the data so other business-software
developers can create apps that can exchange such information
between Office and their programs. </p>
<p>With the Office unit now part of the same business as
Microsoft''s Bing search, future versions of Oslo will integrate
Web-search data from Bing, said Teper. Microsoft is still
working on pricing and will begin testing the software with a
few chosen customers in the next month or so, Teper said. </p>
<p>Don''t think of this as the version of Word you''ve got on
your machine, Teper said. It''s a really new experience for
how the office should work. </p>

access to financing for their small and medium-size companies.

<p>Payment networks, retailers and

as hackers find new ways to steal data, according to Byron Pollitt, chief financial officer of Visa Inc. (V) </p>
<p>This is an investment cycle that never ends, Pollitt
said today at a technology conference in San Francisco. The
resourcefulness, the intellect, the level of innovativeness in
the fraud sector is absolutely amazing. </p>
<p>Lenders and merchants are under pressure to convert from
magnetic strips to microchip technology that thwarts hackers
after millions of consumer records were breached at retailers
including Target Corp. One reason the conversion hasn''t happened
yet is because it''s expensive for merchants to upgrade their
systems and for lenders to issue new cards, said Pollitt, whose
company is the world''s biggest bank-card network. </p>
<p>It''s high investment and in the absence of a Target
catalyst, I doubt that we would be on the track we are on
today, Pollitt said. The chip will address about 70 percent of
fraud, he said. Including a requirement that consumers enter
personal identification numbers, or PINs, would dramatically
slow its implementation because about two-thirds of retailers
don''t have the necessary equipment, Pollitt said. </p>
<p>American Express Co., Foster City, California-based Visa

<p>Richard A. Friedman, head of Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s merchant banking division, said he sees
opportunities to invest in middle-sized companies as some other
private-equity firms sell their investments. </p>
<p>My peers, I see them at conferences, and they talk about
how it''s the greatest selling environment -- I actually think
it''s a good investing environment, Friedman, 56, said today in
a CNBC interview. We have continued improvement in the
economy, we have very low interest rates and access to capital,
and also for the first time, I''d say, in years, our CEOs can
actually put business plans together with more confidence. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s merchant banking unit makes investments in
private-equity and real estate assets using client funds and the
company''s own money. The firm''s investments are included in its
investing and lending segment, which produced $4.33 billion of
pretax earnings in 2013, the most profit of any of Goldman
Sachs''s four business units. </p>
<p>The bank has said it''s cutting its own stakes in private-equity funds to comply with the Volcker Rule, which limits such
investments. Still, the firm can often make direct investments
in debt or equity securities with its own money outside of fund
structures. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s merchant banking division has raised more
than $82 billion for investment funds in corporate equity and
debt since 1986, according to its website. The bank is
considering a different strategy than buying large companies to
take them private, which was popular before the financial
crisis, Friedman said. </p>
<h2>Not Happening'' </h2>
<p>What we''re looking at is actually buying mid-sized
companies or making early-stage investments and growing
companies, as opposed to what happened in 2005 through 2007,
which was a buying spree of taking companies private, Friedman
said. That''s just not happening anymore. </p>
<p>Friedman said he doesn''t expect interest rates to rise in
the near future. When that happens, it will probably lower
valuation multiples on companies, he said. </p>
<p>Friedman has worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 30 years
and was named a partner in 1990. He and Chief Executive Officer
Lloyd C. Blankfein are the only two executives to sit on the

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp.''s (XOM) biggest
international exploration opportunity may be imperiled by
Russian President Vladimir Putin''s Ukrainian foray. </p>
<p>U.S.-based companies could face restrictions on doing
business in Russia if Putin''s regime is slapped with sanctions
by western governments or the United Nations for its
intervention in Ukraine''s Crimea region. </p>
<p>Exxon, under the terms of a 2011 contract with state-controlled OAO Rosneft, owns drilling rights across 11.4 million
acres of Russian land, its biggest exploration holding outside
the U.S. Sanctions could stall Exxon''s plans to begin drilling
in the Russian Arctic later this year in partnership with
Rosneft, and threaten the lucrative Sakhalin-1 oil license off
Russia''s Pacific Coast. </p>
<p>Exxon Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson
agreed to invest billions of dollars and allow Rosneft to buy
stakes in premier North American projects in exchange for access
to Russia''s vast Arctic, deep-water and shale resources. </p>
<p>The 61-year-old University of Texas-trained engineer is
seeking to reverse sliding oil and natural gas output at the
world''s biggest energy producer by market value. Since assuming
the leadership post of Exxon in January 2006, the company''s
stock has increased 65 percent, lagging the 77 percent advance
in the price of crude, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Drilling Rights </h2>
<p>Exxon''s 11.4 million acres of Russian drilling rights are
eclipsed in size only by the company''s 15.1 million acres in its
home country, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission on Feb. 26. The next largest Exxon holdings
are in Canada, Germany and Indonesia, where the company owns
rights to 6.3 million acres, 5 million acres and 2.3 million
acres, respectively. </p>
<p>Exxon has repeatedly declined to comment on the impact the
Russian imbroglio in Ukraine may have on its operations or
investment decisions. Tillerson is scheduled to take questions
from analysts and the media later today at the company''s annual
strategy presentation at the New York Stock Exchange. </p>
<p>Exxon''s interests in the region aren''t confined to Russian
oil fields. The company dispatched high-level executives to the
Ukraine''s capital of Kiev six weeks ago to discuss exploring the
country''s vast shale deposits, Interfax reported on Jan. 23,
citing the website of then-President Viktor Yanukovych. </p>
<p>Yanukovych was ousted amid violent streets protests in late
February and has since fled to Russia. The January meetings
included Exxon executives Stephen Greenlee and Kevin Biddle,
according to the Interfax report. </p>
<h2>Rising Costs </h2>
<p>The Russian turmoil comes at a time when Exxon''s
exploration effort have stalled worldwide and costs to pump oil
and gas from the ground are rising. </p>
<p>The company found commercial quantities of oil or gas in 67
percent of the exploratory wells it drilled in 2013, unchanged
from 2012, according to the Feb. 26 regulatory filing. At the
same time, Exxon''s costs to produce the equivalent of a barrel
of crude jumped to $11.48 last year from $9.91 in 2012. </p>
<p>Exxon''s Russian drilling rights include 11.3 million acres
in the Kara and Black seas under the agreement with Rosneft, and
another 85,000 offshore acres beneath the Sea of Okhotsk near
Sakhalin Island. Rosneft is a partner in the Sakhalin-1
development, which began producing crude in 2005. </p>

<p>A U.S. judge handed Chevron Corp. a key victory in the energy company''s long-fought battle against a multibillion-dollar pollution lawsuit in Ecuador, ruling the American lawyer leading the case resorted to bribery and fraud. </p> <p>U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan agreed with Chevron yesterday that attorney Steven Donziger had paid off a judge and engaged in money laundering to secure a $9.5 billion judgment from an Ecuadorean court against the global oil giant. The ruling leaves Donziger, who spent the past two decades fighting Chevron, with a slimmer chance of securing compensation for rain forest dwellers in the country''s Lago Agrio area who claimed their land was turned into a toxic dumping ground for foreign oil interests. </p> <p>The New York plaintiffs'' attorney went over to the dark side and made a bargain with the devil, to obtain the 2011 judgment from the court in Ecuador, Kaplan said in a 500-page opinion yesterday. He ruled U.S. courts can''t be used to collect the award, cut in half from an original $19 billion by Ecuador''s highest court on Nov. 12. </p> <p>The defendants here may not be allowed to benefit from that in any way, the judge wrote. The ruling may also make it more difficult for Donziger and his clients to collect the Ecuador court''s award by seizing Chevron assets outside the U.S. </p> <p>Donziger would need to win a reversal of the decision on appeal in order to salvage a payday for himself and his clients after decades of litigation. Kaplan''s detailed findings will make winning an appeal more difficult, said Cassandra Burke Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland who has followed the case. </p> <p>The appellate court would have to conclude that the district court''s finding is clearly erroneous, which is a very hard standard to meet, Robertson said. Donziger definitely has an uphill battle to seek reversal. </p> <h2>Other Countries </h2> <p>Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company by market value, has waged a battle across multiple countries to prevent Donziger from collecting the award, which was almost half of its 2013 profit of $21.4 billion. Kaplan''s bar on profiting from the judgment applies anywhere in the world, even though it doesn''t stop Donziger from trying to make his case in foreign courts, Randy Mastro, a lead lawyer for Chevron, said yesterday in a conference call. </p> <p>Chevron claims Kaplan''s opinion should be respected by courts in other countries, including Brazil, Argentina and Canada, where Chevron has assets and where Donziger and his team have already sued to try to collect on the judgment. The Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled in December that the 47 villagers have the right to pursue Chevron''s Canada assets. The other cases are pending. </p> <h2>Brazil, Canada </h2> <p>Chevron General Counsel R. Hewitt Pate said yesterday that the company plans to share Kaplan''s ruling with judges overseeing proceedings in Brazil, Argentina and Canada. </p> <p>In view of the findings here about what really went on in this case, we don''t think any serious court will entertain enforcement of the fraudulent judgment, Pate said. </p> <p>Ecuadorean villagers and activists working on their behalf had argued that Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, should be held financially responsible for pollution of the Amazon rainforest in the Lago Agrio area by Texaco Inc. from the 1960s through the early 1990s. Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001, claimed the company already paid $40 million to clean up its share of the drilling contamination. </p> <h2>Secret Account </h2> <p>The case in Ecuador included things that normally come only out of Hollywood -- coded e-mails among Donziger and his colleagues describing their private interactions with and machinations directed at judges and a court-appointed expert, Kaplan wrote. </p> <p>Donziger and his team paid off a supposedly neutral court expert from a secret account, promised $500,000 to a judge handling the case who was so inexperienced he used an 18-year-old typist to do legal research, and wrote the judgment themselves, Kaplan said. </p> <p>Donziger began his involvement in this controversy with a desire to improve conditions in the area in which his Ecuadorean clients live, said Kaplan, who oversaw a seven-week non-jury trial on the judgment. In the end, however, he and the Ecuadorean lawyers he led corrupted the Lago Agrio case. </p> <p>The length of the opinion gives the parties more ammunition to continue their fight, said Robertson, the Case Western professor. I would be surprised if the ruling were upheld in full, but I think the ruling prohibiting Donziger from benefiting financially from the case will likely stand. </p> <h2>Helpful'' Ruling </h2> <p>John Watson, Chevron''s chairman and chief executive officer, told reporters yesterday at the IHS CERAWeek energy conference in Houston that having a judgment like this from a reputable court in the United States will certainly be helpful in preventing enforcement actions elsewhere. </p> <p>Chevron has also brought an arbitration case against Ecuador over its alleged failure to uphold agreements releasing predecessor Texaco from legal cases over the pollution. The arbitration in The Hague is pending. </p> <p>The Embassy of Ecuador said yesterday that Kaplan''s ruling explicitly does not exonerate Chevron from its own legal and moral responsibilities resulting from its decades of contamination of the rainforest that has endangered the lives, culture, and environment of countless poor, indigenous people. </p> <p>The embassy said Ecuador isn''t a party in Chevron''s case against Donziger. </p> <p>In a statement, Donziger called Kaplan''s ruling an appalling decision. </p> <h2>Wrong, Wrong </h2> <p>We believe Judge Kaplan is wrong on the law and wrong on the facts and that he repeatedly let his implacable hostility toward me, my Ecuadorean clients, and their country infect his view of the case, he said. </p> <p>Donziger said he will pursue an immediate and expedited appeal. </p> <p>The lawyer has argued that he did nothing wrong in Ecuador and that any aggressive tactics he may have used were no worse than Chevron''s actions. He said that Kaplan made it clear he would rule against us well before the trial began by refusing a request to hold the proceeding before a jury. </p> <p>Appellate lawyer Deepak Gupta, who joined Donziger''s team after the trial concluded, said in a statement that Kaplan has taken the extraordinary and unprecedented step of appointing itself a worldwide fact-finding commission, issuing what is in effect a global anti-collection injunction. </p> <h2>Appalling Verdict </h2> <p>This decision also effectively outlaws core activity protected by the First Amendment such as bringing lawsuits, holding protests, issuing press releases, and engaging public officials, he said, referencing tactics mentioned in Kaplan''s decision.

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) is cutting 700 jobs,
a quarter of the employees at its interactive unit, in a
realignment of its video-game and Internet advertising
businesses. </p>
<p>Future games for consoles such as Sony Corp.''s PlayStation
and Microsoft Corp.''s Xbox will be licensed, James Pitaro,
president of Disney Interactive, said today in an interview.
Burbank, California-based Disney is also paring its online ad
sales team to focus on fewer and bigger partners. </p>
<p>The company will continue to invest in interactive,
including the Infinity game system and the upcoming Fantasia
title, mobile game development in Japan and short-form videos on
the Web. It''s also extending the Club Penguin online virtual
world to iPhone and Android platforms. The cuts announced today
are part of an effort to make the division profitable on a
consistent basis. </p>
<p>The interactive division lost $87 million on sales of $1.06
billion in the year ended Sept. 28. While the unit made a profit
of $55 million in this year''s first quarter ended in December,
Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo said in February results this
period would be comparable to the $54 million loss in the second
quarter of 2013. </p>
<p>The division had one of the top 10 video games of 2013 with
its Infinity system, according to researcher NPD Group Inc.
Mobile traffic on its websites has about doubled since a
redesign two years ago, according to data from ComScore Inc. </p>
<h2>Web Ads </h2>
<p>Selling ads based on the mobile traffic has been
challenging, Pitaro said, explaining why the company is shifting
to more extensive sponsorships from display ads. </p>
<p>Playdom, a maker of games for social media that Disney
acquired for $563 million in 2010, has also struggled to come up
with hits as the business shifted to mobile and customers balked
at paying even 99 cents for games, Pitaro said. </p>
<p>The industry has shifted from social games to mobile
games, Pitaro said. Our focus is now mobile first. </p>
<p>Pitaro became sole president of interactive in November. He
previously shared that title with former Playdom Chief Executive
Officer John Pleasants, who left at that time. </p>
<p>Disney rose less than 1 percent to $83.34 at the close in
New York. The stock has advanced 9.1 percent this year. </p>

<p>Firms from Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
to Deutsche Bank AG are putting their faith in India''s rupee as
the country looks forward to the biggest improvement in its
broadest measure of trade in a decade. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which ranked India as the most vulnerable
Asian market in September, now predicts the rupee will beat
peers from Brazil to South Africa and Turkey. Deutsche Bank, the
largest foreign-exchange trader, and Barclays Plc say it''s their
favorite emerging-market currency. The rupee has risen 6.8
percent against the dollar over the past six months, the most
among 11 Asian currencies tracked by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Investors are seeking safe, high-yielding assets as the
U.S. Federal Reserve reduces stimulus and after a slowdown in
China contributed to the worst start to a year for emerging-market currencies since 2009. For many, India fits the bill, as
policy makers take steps to reverse a slump that sent the rupee
tumbling to a record last August. </p>
<p>India looks in much better shape now than it did six
months back, Kim Jin Ha, a global fixed-income fund manager in
Seoul at Mirae Asset Management Co., which oversees about $59
billion, said by e-mail March 3. Capital flows can continue. </p>
<h2>Funds Return </h2>
<p>The rupee''s recovery bodes well for India''s efforts to curb
the fastest consumer-price inflation after Argentina among the
Group of 20 nations, and to boost inflows to help revive the
slowest economic growth in a decade. Less than three months into
2014, foreigners have already plowed back more than half of the
$8 billion they pulled from local bonds last year. </p>
<p>India''s rupee climbed as much as 1.1 percent today to
61.1050 per dollar, the strongest level since Dec. 10, and was
at 61.1150 as of 10:33 a.m. in New York. It has risen from an
all-time low of 68.845 on Aug. 28. The rupee weakened 13 percent
in the second and third quarters of last year amid a decline in
the country''s manufacturing industry and monetary tightening. </p>
<p>The rupee may get a boost after India''s current-account
deficit narrowed to a four-year low as the world''s second-largest bullion-consuming nation raised gold-import tariffs. </p>
<p>The shortfall in the broadest measure of trade, which
tracks goods, services and investment income, was $4.2 billion
last quarter, down from $5.2 billion in the prior three months,
the Reserve Bank of India said yesterday in Mumbai. </p>
<p>The deficit will shrink to $45 billion in the year ending
March 31, from $88 billion in the prior period, Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted last month. </p>
<h2>Small Long'' </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs said in February that it saw the rupee at 62
in three months'' time, while its asset-management arm opened
this year what it called a small long position on the
currency. HSBC Holdings Plc advises buying the rupee and selling
Indonesia''s rupiah, while Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley
predict India''s currency will strengthen against the Brazilian
real, according to client notes last week. </p>
<p>Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. may buy Indian assets because
the economy is less exposed to China''s faltering growth than
nations including South Korea, Emmanuel Ng, a strategist at the
Singapore-based firm, said by e-mail on Feb. 26. </p>
<p>I see the inflows continuing, said Rajeev De Mello, who
oversees $10 billion as the head of Asian fixed income at
Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in Singapore. </p>
<h2>Big Doubts'' </h2>
<p>Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg lifted the median mid-year
forecast for the rupee to 62.6, from 63.25 three months ago. </p>
<p>While that''s a bigger increase than for any of its Asian
peers, it still signals a drop of more than 1 percent by June
30. Credit Agricole SA says the rupee will weaken to 70 per
dollar by mid-year as a clampdown on bullion shipments boosts
unofficial imports and India prepares for elections next month. </p>
<p>India''s external position is not as good as it looks,
Dariusz Kowalczyk, a Hong Kong-based strategist at France''s
third-biggest bank, said in an interview on March 4. India''s
imports of gold have actually increased. I have big doubts
whether the government that will come out of the elections will
be welcomed by the markets. </p>
<p>RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan lifted interest rates three
times since taking office in September, boosting returns to
rupee investors and helping slow inflation to 8.8 percent in
January, from 11.2 percent in November. </p>
<p>He boosted capital inflows by offering discounted foreign-exchange swaps for dollar deposits and debt raised by local
banks. That helped increase foreign-exchange reserves by $20
billion, from September''s three-year low of $247 billion. </p>
<p>Dollar-based investors can make a return of 6.5 percent,
including interest, by holding the rupee until the end of 2014,
the biggest gain in Asia, according to data based on
appreciation estimates and deposit rates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Current-account numbers have been the key driver because
it''s a very transparent measure of whether the policy
prescriptions are having an impact, Philip Moffitt, the
Sydney-based head of Asia-Pacific fixed income at Goldman Sachs
Asset Management, which oversees more than $1 trillion, said in
an interview. If you can find something that''s relatively
cheap and the fundamentals appear to be improving, it''s usually
a good mix. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Financial

<p>The $27 billion outlook compares with net income of $17.9

<p>Ginni Rometty, chief executive
officer of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), said the
company fell short of expectations last year and must address
its struggling hardware businesses. </p>
<p>We must acknowledge that while 2013 was an important year
of transformation, our performance did not meet our
expectations, Rometty, who is also chairman, said over the
weekend in a letter to investors in the company''s annual report.
While we continue to remix to higher value, we must also
address those parts of the business that are holding us back. </p>
<p>IBM has struggled in a shift to the cloud era, where data
and information are delivered online instead of being stored
onsite. Falling demand for hardware and weak sales in growth
markets have dragged down revenue for the last seven quarters,
prompting Rometty to sell assets, fire and furlough workers, buy
back shares and cut taxes to help meet profit goals. </p>
<p>The company announced today that Michael Eskew, the former
chairman and CEO of United Parcel Service Inc. who has been on
the IBM board since 2005, will become IBM''s first presiding
director on May 1. </p>
<p>In the newly created position, Eskew will serve as a
liaison between the chairman and independent directors and be
able to call meetings of independent directors, according to a
regulatory filing. The presiding director also will be available
to speak with major shareholders, if requested, after
discussions with Rometty. Warren Buffett''s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. is IBM''s largest shareholder. </p>
<h2>Leadership Structure </h2>
<p>Board members as a whole accepted the recommendation of
Mrs. Rometty and believe that this leadership structure will
provide the company with the continued benefits of combining the
leadership role of chairman and CEO, while also recognizing the
unique strengths and capabilities of IBM''s board members, the
company said in the filing. </p>
<p>IBM''s sales fell 5 percent last year, and the stock was the
only decliner in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. That led top
executives to forgo annual bonuses and shrink the company''s
headcount for the first time in a decade. </p>
<p>With no bonus, Rometty''s 2013 pay, calculated using U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission rules, fell 14 percent from a
year earlier to $14 million. On the recommendation of the
board''s compensation committee, IBM''s independent directors
approved a long-term incentive plan for Rometty of $12.75
million in performance-based stock awards for the period ending
in 2016. </p>
<p>The committee believes Mrs. Rometty performed well in
shifting investments into key segments of the portfolio and
advancing innovative solutions, creating a strong foundation for
transformation in 2014, the company said. </p>
<h2>Maintaining Goal </h2>
<p>Even as revenue has tumbled, Rometty reaffirmed IBM''s goal
of $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015 -- up from $11.67 in
2010, the letter said. </p>
<p>IBM shares fell less than 1 percent to $186.39 at the close
in New York. </p>
<p>The CEO said the company will continue shifting its focus
to cloud services and data analytics while making changes to its
hardware products. The company agreed in January to sell most of
its low-end server business for $2.3 billion to Lenovo Group
Ltd. (992) </p>
<p>After buying cloud provider SoftLayer Technologies Inc.
last year for $2 billion, IBM is integrating existing hardware
and data analytics with its services. </p>
<p>IBM will use its Power Systems servers to help deliver its
Watson tool through the cloud, the company said last month. The
company is spending $1 billion on building a new business group
around the technology, which analyzes troves of information and
answers questions in plain English. </p>
<p>This follows a $1.2 billion commitment to bolster
SoftLayer''s cloud offerings by adding new data centers and an

<p>Australia''s dollar has tumbled 15
percent from its high last year and strategists forecast more
pain ahead. For Goldman Sachs Group Inc., it''s the perfect time
to develop Sydney as a hub for trading local-currency assets. </p>
<p>Australia''s stable AAA credit rating makes it a haven and
encourages sovereign-wealth funds to allocate more money there,
said Simon Rothery, the chief executive officer of Goldman
Sachs''s operations in the country and neighboring New Zealand.
The New York-based firm moved its Australian credit derivatives
business from Hong Kong to Sydney last month after bringing over
bond and swaps trading last year, Rothery said. </p>
<p>The Aussie dollar is an ever more important part of
sovereign-wealth funds, central banks and global accounts,
Rothery said in a Feb. 27 interview in Sydney. Everybody wants
to play the China story, but you can''t get exposure directly so
people gain access through Australia. </p>
<p>In a sign of Australia''s rising prominence, the
International Monetary Fund began breaking out central banks''
holdings of the local dollar at the end of 2012. Before that, it
was lumped together in the organization''s other currencies
category. Offshore investors boosted their holdings of the
country''s government bonds -- the highest-yielding top-rated
sovereign securities -- by A$28 billion ($25 billion) in 2013,
to a record A$217.4 billion. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s fourth-largest energy producer by market value, reduced its 2017
production estimate and said it will sell $10 billion in assets
during the next three years. </p>
<p>Chevron lowered its production forecast by 6.1 percent as
it slows U.S. natural gas drilling and higher crude prices
reduce its share of production in some nations, the company said
during a presentation to analysts in New York today. The company
now sees output equivalent to 3.1 million barrels of crude a day
from a previous estimate of 3.3 million. Last year Chevron
produced the equivalent of 2.6 million barrels. </p>
<p>Lower-than-expected U.S. gas prices prompted the company to
curtail some drilling in Pennsylvania''s Marcellus Shale gas
formation, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson. New discoveries and acquisitions only added enough oil
and gas to reserves to replace 85 percent of the company''s
production last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Our growth strategy remains intact, though some things
have changed, Watson said. Higher crude prices will also have
a negative impact on output under production agreements in some
nations that curb a company''s share as prices escalate, he said. </p>
<h2>Rising Production </h2>
<p>Chevron is spending $39.8 billion this year on gas-export
terminals, offshore crude platforms and other capital projects
to reverse a three-year drop in production. Chevron is alone
among the world''s three-largest energy companies in forecasting
a production increase this year. </p>
<p>Chevron''s 2017 output target assumes crude prices will
average about $110 a barrel, the San Ramon, California-based
company said in a slide presentation prepared for today''s
meeting with analysts. That compares with the $79 price
assumption that underlaid the prior forecast from March 2013. </p>
<p>The company plans to increase drilling in the U.S. Permian
Basin by 8.6 percent this year to 505 wells, according to the
slides. The company''s production from the formation that
straddles the Texas-New Mexico border will double by the end of
2020. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. is the world''s largest energy producer,
followed by Royal Dutch Shell Plc and PetroChina. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs (GS) Group Inc. analysts
see Bitcoin as an innovative payments technology while doubting
that it will evolve into a true alternative currency, according
to a research report released today. </p>
<p>In the report, titled All About Bitcoin, the
researchers write that they examined multiple views of the
digital currency by people inside and outside of Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>So where does that leave us? With the conclusion that
Bitcoin likely can''t work as a currency, but some sense that the
ledger-based technology that underlies it could hold promise,
the report said. </p>
<p>Bitcoin emerged from source code written by an anonymous
developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto
in 2009, and attracted a following motivated in part by the
ability to escape the strictures of traditional currency,
notably government control. The report by Goldman Sachs lends
credibility to the virtual currency, said Michael Terpin, co-founder of BitAngels, a group of angel investors in early stage
Bitcoin startups. </p>
<p>The tone overall is conservative and measured, Terpin
said of the report. People will read it and draw their own
conclusions. It''s nice they are paying attention to it, and
don''t have a Bitcoin-is-evil view. </p>
<h2>Biggest Hurdle </h2>
<p>Dominic Wilson and Jose Ursua, the researchers at Goldman
Sachs who wrote the report, said that the ability to pay for
goods and services using Bitcoin is growing, saying that
obstacles to Bitcoin being used more broadly in the payments
system are arguably not insurmountable. </p>
<p>Roman Leal, an analyst at Goldman Sachs covering
information-technology services, said Bitcoin''s biggest
hurdle will be maintaining its cost advantage in the face of
greater regulation, higher operating costs, and competition from
entrenched players. </p>
<p>While it is too early to tell how banks and payment
processors will react to the threat of Bitcoin, we believe that
it is only a matter of time before major incumbents develop a
digital currency strategy, Leal wrote. </p>

in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Buse is retiring March 31, according to the filing. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management is
reducing its holdings of Europe''s higher-yielding debt as it
bets a rally in the bonds is ending. </p>
<p>Gains have sent yields from Greece to Spain tumbling to the
lowest since at least 2010 this month as data from gross
domestic product to manufacturing output add to evidence the
euro-area recovery is gathering pace. The rally has pushed the
securities to levels that are no longer good value for
investors, according to JPMorgan London-based money manager
Talib Sheikh. </p>
<p>A year ago we were pounding the table that European
peripheral debt was really cheap, Sheikh said in an interview
on Bloomberg Television''s Countdown with Anna Edwards and
Mark Barton. With valuations where they are it''s hard to make
the case that peripheral bonds look a buying opportunity here so
we''ve been reducing our exposure pretty aggressively into this
rally. </p>
<p>JPMorgan Asset Management oversees the equivalent of $1.6
trillion. </p>
<p>Italy''s 10-year bond yield fell to 3.36 percent on March
10, the lowest level since October 2005. The additional yield
investors demand to hold the securities over similar-maturity
German bunds slid to 173 basis points on March 11, the least
since June 2011. </p>
<p>The rate on Spanish bonds due in April 2024 dropped to an
eight-year low of 3.30 percent on March 10, reducing the
security''s yield spread over bunds to 165 basis points. That''s
the lowest level since October 2010. </p>
<p>While these spreads can narrow further it''s hard to say
that there''s real value in those bonds any more, Sheikh said. </p>
<p>Spanish bonds have returned 5.2 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy''s have gained
4.4 percent and Greece''s have surged 17 percent. German
securities have earned 2.3 percent. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (G), the
insurer that is part of the investor group that owns 22.4
percent of Telecom Italia SpA (TIT), plans to exit its holding as
early as June, Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco said. </p>
<p>We have two exit windows, one in June 2014 and one in
February 2015, Greco said today during a conference call as
Generali announced another writedown in its Telecom Italia
stake. It''s likely that we will exit in June''s window. </p>
<p>Generali owns a 19.3 percent stake in Telco SpA, the
investor group that controls the board of Milan-based Telecom
Italia, suggesting its holding in Italy''s largest phone company
is about 4.3 percent. A stake of that size is worth about 500
million euros ($700 million) based on today''s trading. </p>
<p>The insurer is likely to sell the stake on the market or
directly to another investor, said Carlo Alberto Carnevale Maffe, a professor of business strategy at Milan''s Bocconi
University. Generali could join the other Italian shareholders
of Telco, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA and Mediobanca SpA, to sell their
stakes to the same buyer, Carnevale Maffe said. Officials at
Mediobanca and Intesa declined to comment. </p>
<p>Spain''s Telefonica SA (TEF), the largest shareholder in Telco, is
unlikely to buy Generali''s stake because of regulatory hurdles,
Carnevale Maffe said. Brazil''s antitrust authorities fined
Telefonica in December and ordered it to reduce its Brazilian
holdings or convince Telecom Italia to sell its local unit.
Telefonica and Telecom Italia both own phone carriers in Brazil,
and together control more than half of its wireless market. </p>
<p>A representative for Madrid-based Telefonica, Spain''s
largest phone company, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Shareholder Pact </h2>
<p>Generali wrote down the value of its Telecom Italia holding
to 72 cents a share last quarter. Telecom Italia shares rose 0.7
percent to 81.2 cents at 12:37 p.m. in Milan. </p>
<p>An exit by any of the Telco partners would unravel a 2007
shareholder pact that put Italy''s biggest phone company under
the control of Telefonica and the Italian financial investors.
They have written down their stakes in Telecom Italia multiple
times over the years as intensifying competition has hurt sales,
earnings and the phone company''s stock price. </p>

<p>Assicurazioni Generali SpA (UCG), Italy''s
biggest insurer, reported a fourth-quarter profit after booking
a loss a year earlier on writedowns of equity holdings. The
insurer more than doubled its dividend. </p>
<p>Net income was 324 million euros ($452 million) compared
with a net loss of 1.04 billion euros a year before, when
Generali wrote down stakes in companies by 1.3 billion euros.
Profit missed the 604 million-euro average estimate of seven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>In 2014, the debt will be reduced further and significant
cost savings will be achieved, Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco said in the statement. We estimate to improve the
operating result and the net profit further, in line with the
plan. </p>
<p>Greco, who took over as CEO in 2011, is selling assets and
focusing on the company''s main business to strengthen finances
and boost profitability. The insurer is more than half way to
reaching its goal of raising 4 billion euros from disposals by
2015, after the sale of its U.S. reinsurance unit and Mexican
businesses last year. </p>
<h2>Dividend Raised </h2>
<p>Generali raised its dividend to 45 cents a share from 20
cents, the Trieste, Italy-based insurer said in a stock-exchange
statement. </p>
<p>Operating income fell 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter
from a year earlier to 859 million euros as income at the non-life business fell 40 percent to 291 million euros.      Claims
and costs as a proportion of premiums, known as the combined
ratio, improved to 95.6 percent in 2013. Life operating profit
increased 36 percent to 573 million euros. </p>
<p>Generali published mixed 2013 results below consensus
excluding the dividend, Raphael Caruso, an analyst at Raymond
James Euro Equities in Paris, wrote in a note today. Fourth-quarter results were impacted by a significantly higher than
expected combined ratio and some non-operating items, he said. </p>
<p>Generali rose 0.7 percent to 16.42 euros in Milan trading
as of 10:33 a.m. in Milan, giving the company a market value of
25.5 billion euros. The Bloomberg Europe 500 Insurance Index was
little changed this year, compared with Generali''s 4 percent
decline. </p>
<h2>Telco Exit </h2>
<p>Results were driven by extraordinary items including
proceeds of disposals and the gain on the stake in the Bank of
Italy which have been offset by negative impacts from the Telco
SpA stake writedown and the goodwill writedown of BSI group,
Generali said in the statement. </p>
<p>Generali, which owns 19.3 percent stake in Telco, the
holding controlling Telecom Italia SpA (TIT), wrote down its stake by
189 million euros in the fourth quarter. The insurer plans to
exit its holding as early as June, Greco said during a
conference call today. </p>
<p>We wrote down the stake at Telecom''s market value at the
end of December, as it''s likely that we will exit Telecom in
June, Greco said. We have two exit windows, one in June 2014
and one in February 2015. </p>
<p>Madrid-based Telefonica SA, Spain''s biggest phone company,
is the largest shareholder in Telco and agreed to increase its
stake last year. </p>
<h2>BSI Sale </h2>
<p>The CEO is confident to sell Swiss asset-management unit
BSI Group as part of his disposal plan to boost capital. The
sale is easier now, after rules on U.S. clients treatment are
clarified, he said, without disclosing details on talks.
Generali wrote down the company''s value by 217 million euros in
the quarter. </p>
<p>Generali''s solvency ratio, a measure of its capacity to
absorb losses, fell to 141 percent by Dec. 31 from 143 percent
in September, the insurer said. At the end of February, the
ratio was about 150 percent, the company said. </p>

Goldman Sachs and EQT will sell 1 million existing shares. ISS
will have a market value of about 29.6 billion kroner, excluding
the value of treasury shares held by the company. </p>

ISS Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gravenhorstsaid in today''s
statement. </p>
<p>U.K. retailers Poundland Group Plc and Pets at Home Ltd.
began trading yesterday after closing their sales early because
of high demand from investors. Poundland gained 23 percent, and
Pets at Home fell about 3 percent. </p>
<p>ISS said about 10 percent of its shares were allocated to
Danish retail investors while the rest went to institutional
investors. </p>
<p>ISS, based in Soeborg, Denmark, said on Feb. 18 it would
raise 8 billion kroner to repay debt. The company said on March
11 it would close the share sale early after receiving strong
demand. </p>
<p>The company, which has more than 530,000 employees, offers

could have delayed generic versions of the medicine. </p>
<p>A patent expiring in December 2015 was invalid because it
wasn''t different enough from one ending in May, a federal judge
in Norfolk, Virginia, said yesterday in a victory for companies
including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA), Mylan Inc., and
Lupin Ltd. (LPC) Pfizer will pursue all available remedies,
including an immediate appeal of the court''s decision, the
company said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Celebrex, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2
inhibitors, helps arthritis patients reduce pain by blocking a
chemical reaction in the body that causes inflammation. The
medicine had been projected to generate $2.5 billion between May
and when the 2015 patent was slated to expire, according to
sales estimates surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>It seems likely that odds are in favor of generics
launching early, said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with
Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. Pfizer''s earnings per share will be
cut by 4 percent this year and 8 percent in 2015 if copycats do
make it to market, he wrote in a note to clients. </p>
<p>There would be little to no impact to EPS from 2016
onwards because we have already been modeling generics in late
2015, Anderson said. </p>
<p>Pfizer fell 1.4 percent to $31.98 yesterday in New York. </p>
<h2>Reimburse Pfizer </h2>
<p>Actavis Plc (ACT) said it plans to begin selling a generic
Celebrex in May, as long as it gets regulatory approval. Denise Bradley, a spokeswoman for Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva, said
the company is pleased with the decision. Officials with Mylan
didn''t immediately return messages seeking comment. </p>
<p>Should the generic-drug companies enter the market and
later lose the appeal, they could be ordered to reimburse Pfizer
for any profits it loses from the low-cost competition. </p>
<p>An appeals court in 2008 had invalidated the patent, saying
it just covers a method of administering a therapeutically
effective amount of the compounds covered by the patent that
ends in May. New York-based Pfizer asked the patent office to
reissue it with modifications to work around the appeals court
decision. </p>
<p>District Judge Arenda Wright Allen said that the
modification sought by Pfizer wasn''t allowed under the law, so
the Federal Circuit''s reasoning stands. </p>
<p>The case is G.D. Searle LLC v. Lupin Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
13cv121, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Virginia (Norfolk). </p>

<p>U.S. energy regulators'' efforts to harden the power grid against snipers and terrorists are fueling a debate over whether they''re diverting resources from other threats, like cyber attacks. </p> <p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission last week ordered the power industry to identify critical facilities and come up with a plan to protect them from attack. </p> <p>My concern is that we don''t shift our focus and our resources, said John Norris, a FERC commissioner who voted for the order while cautioning against overreacting to the sniper attack last year on a power substation in California. The rush to do this seems to be based on a very incomplete set of facts about what happened. </p> <p>As the electricity network has become increasingly dependent on software and the Internet, the utility industry has focused on combating potential cyber attacks. The April attack at PGE''s Metcalf substation near San Jose resurrected a 20th century threat -- an old-fashioned, military-style assault on the power network. </p> <p>Regulators are now trying to find the best way to guard against all threats to the generators, transformers and thousands of miles of high-voltage power lines that make up the U.S. electric grid. They''re also trying to encourage modernization of the aging network. </p> <h2>Microgrids, Upgrades </h2> <p>Norris said the U.S. should focus on technologies, like the development of microgrids, that can quickly isolate damaged components from the rest of the network in the event of an attack. Advanced technologies can also make better use of data to improve awareness of incidents affecting the grid, he said. </p> <p>You address multiple threats, not just physical threats, Norris said. At at FERC meeting on Feb. 20, he said, Our future is in a much smarter and more nimble grid. </p> <p>Former FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff for years has warned that the grid''s most critical components, such as transformers that adjust electrical voltage, are vulnerable and could be better protected with relatively simple measures, like improved fencing. </p> <p>An attack knocking out major critical components would result in catastrophic failure, potentially, of the interconnect, Wellinghoff said by phone. </p> <p>Wellinghoff said he also favors measures to prevent cyber attacks and other threats, and supports the FERC''s March 7 order. It requires the North American Electric Reliability Corp., a non-profit organization responsible for ensuring the reliability of the grid, to produce by June standards to guard against physical attacks. The standards should require utilities to identify their most critical components and show that they''re adequately protected. </p> <h2>Good Step'' </h2> <p>It was a good step to take, ultimately, Wellinghoff said. We''ll see what NERC does and how long it takes. </p> <p>NERC Chief Executive Officer Gerry Cauley said he shares Norris''s concerns about overreaction to the California attack, while other incidents, from ice storms to potential cyber attacks also pose threats, and utilities will eventually pass along many costs to consumers. </p> <p>Where it could get really expensive and challenging is whether you need stronger barriers like walls and other protections around transformers, he said in a phone interview. You wonder which ones are so critical it would warrant that. </p> <p>Cauley said utilities can increase physical security by improving existing protections like lighting, cameras, surveillance equipment and key-card access at substations. The California incident showed that companies need to be concerned about the line-of-sight for potential shooters, he said. </p> <p>I would like the standard to drive a more heightened look than what we''ve seen in the past, Cauley said. </p> <h2>FERC Steps </h2> <p>After rifle-toting attackers shot up PGE''s Metcalf substation near San Jose on April 16, the FERC provided the industry with a list of steps to improve security at substations, said Tom Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, a Washington-based industry group for publicly traded utilities including Duke Energy Corp. and Exelon Corp. </p> <p>The list hasn''t been made public. FERC spokeswoman Mary O''Driscoll declined to acknowledge its existence. EEI spokesman Jeff Ostermayer said in an e-mail he couldn''t provide the list for operational security reasons. </p> <p>Disabling as few as nine electricity substations and destroying a transformer manufacturer could plunge the nation into a blackout that would last for 18 months, the Wall Street Journal reported yesterday, citing an internal FERC report. </p> <h2>Homeland Security </h2> <p>Acting FERC Chairman Cheryl LaFleur didn''t deny the existence of the report, though she said in a statement that publishing sensitive information crosses the line from transparency to irresponsibility, and gives those who would do us harm a roadmap to achieve malicious designs. </p> <p>Executives from the power industry in recent months have met at least 10 times with officials from the U.S. Energy Department, Homeland Security Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation and local law-enforcement agencies to discuss improving security at electric substations, Kuhn told editors and reporters at Bloomberg''s New York headquarters last month. </p> <p>He said safety measures include outfitting grid components with additional security technologies and establishing closer ties with local police. In November, more than 2,000 representatives from utilities and government agencies participated in a NERC-run, grid-security exercise. </p> <p>I don''t think we could be taking it any more seriously, Kuhn said. </p> <h2>PGE Spending </h2> <p>San Francisco-based PGE plans to spend $100 million in the next four years to bolster its network against further attacks, said Brian Swanson, a company spokesman. While the April attack disabled transformers at the substation, the company was able to prevent customers from losing power, he said. The utility has since worked with law enforcement to increase patrols and deployed security guards to provide a round-the-clock presence at critical units, Swanson said. </p> <p>I can''t get into every security measure we''re doing, he said in a phone interview. Swanson did say PGE is building buffer zones around major substations with opaque fencing; it has removed vegetation to eliminate potential hiding places for would-be attackers; and it has installed more lighting, cameras and security systems to detect intruders. </p> <p>The industry''s focus is risk management, not risk elimination, Courtney Nogas, a spokeswoman for Washington-based Pepco Holdings Inc., said in an e-mail. Pepco has in place multiple layers of protections for its network, she said, while declining to say what steps the company has taken for security reasons. </p> <h2>Dominion''s Plan </h2> <p>Dominion Resources Inc., Virginia''s largest power company, said it plans to spend as much as $500 million during the next five to 10 years to improve physical security at its power stations. The upgrades include two layers of perimeter security, fences that can''t be climbed and card-key access for its substation yards, the company said in a publication for investors this month. </p> <p>Ultimately, the steps industry and regulators take to guard against physical attacks will be a balancing act between securing the grid and shielding consumers from high costs. The FERC must approve rate changes resulting from investments to the generators and high-voltage power lines that make up the bulk-electric network. </p> <p>The U.S. should remain vigilant about other threats, including natural disasters, cyber attack and geomagnetic disturbances as it considers these expenses, Norris said in his statement supporting FERC''s order. </p> <p>We simply cannot erect enough barriers to protect North America''s over 400,000 circuit miles of transmission, and 55,000 substations, he wrote, acknowledging that some substations may need more physical barriers. </p> <p>According to Wellinghoff, there are probably fewer than 100 power substations, primarily in rural areas, that are most critical to the network and may need heightened protection. While costs would vary among substations, the expense would be minimal if spread among taxpayers, he said. </p> <p>They should be spread over everybody because it affects everybody, he said. </p> <p> ', 'Electric-Grid Attack Fuels Sniper-Versus-Hacker Debate', 'By Brian Wingfield', 'Mar 14, 2014 12:00 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-14/electric-grid-attack-fuels-sniper-versus-hacker-debate.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) was sued on
behalf of vehicle owners over an ignition flaw in some small-model cars as it faces regulators'' questions about this year''s
recall of 1.6 million vehicles. </p>
<p>Bob Hilliard, one of the lawyers who filed the complaint
yesterday in federal court in Corpus Christi, Texas, said he
seeks to recover $6 billion to $10 billion for the lost value of
cars affected by the recall. The suit is based on claims GM
concealed the defects and the diminution in value of the
owners'' vehicles, and not deaths resulting from crashes when the
engines stopped because keys came loose. </p>
<p>These vehicles, all they have to do is get on the road
for this defect to manifest, Hilliard said in a phone
interview. This is a true safety defect. </p>
<p>GM has said it identified 12 deaths in connection with the
recall of models made in the mid-2000s, including some Chevrolet
Cobalts and HHRs and other Opel, Pontiac and Saturn models.
Detroit-based GM, the largest U.S. automaker, has said it''s
continuing to review data and information related to the recall. </p>
<p>The GM recall and the multiple U.S. investigations that it
has spurred come as the company has sought to shed the
Government Motors stigma tied to its bankruptcy and
$49.5 billion U.S. bailout. Those investigating the company
include the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the Justice
Department and the Transportation Department. </p>
<p>GM has fallen 4.1 percent since Feb. 12, the day before the
first of the ignition-switch recalls were announced. It was
unchanged yesterday at $34.09 in trading in New York. </p>
<h2>Peace of Mind'' </h2>
<p>GM is focused now on ensuring the safety and peace of
mind of our customers involved in the recall, Greg Martin, a
company spokesman, said in an e-mail responding to a request for
comment on Hilliard''s lawsuit. Our principle throughout this
process has been to the put the customer first, and that will
continue to guide us. </p>
<p>The complaint filed by Hilliard seeks class-action status
to represent all vehicle owners affected by the recall. The
named plaintiffs in the case are Daryl and Maria Brandt of
Nueces County, Texas, who own a 2007 Chevy Cobalt, one of the
recalled vehicles. </p>
<p>Hilliard  also represents the families of two teenagers who
died in a 2006 crash of a Cobalt in Wisconsin. He said in an
interview earlier this week about that claim that GM''s
bankruptcy reorganization shouldn''t shield it from liability for
the pre-2009 crash. While bankruptcy typically protects
companies from new claims that predate the reorganization, GM
didn''t present the full extent of its ignition-switch
liabilities, Hilliard said. </p>
<h2>Liability Shield </h2>
<p>If you are aware of potential exposure to litigation and
you don''t reveal it, that''s fraud, he said. I''m going to go
back to that bankruptcy judge and say, You have to undo this,
the liability of old GM, because it was the new GM''s continued
coverup after the bankruptcy that allowed people to be hurt or
killed.'' </p>
<p>To persuade U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Gerber in
Manhattan to reconsider the terms of GM''s reorganization,
Hilliard or other lawyers would need to gather evidence and
prove that the old GM had knowingly deceived the judge, said
Chip Bowles, a bankruptcy lawyer with Bingham Greenebaum Doll
LLP who wasn''t involved in the GM liquidation. </p>
<p>A few bankruptcy cases have been set aside for fraud on
the court, but you have to establish deliberate fraud and
concealment, said Bowles, who writes articles on bankruptcy
issues. </p>
<p>Gerber earlier this week declined to comment on past or
pending cases. </p>
<h2>Toyota Case </h2>
<p>In 2010, Hilliard filed one of at least 10 wrongful death
lawsuits against Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) over claims its cars
suffered from a defect that caused sudden, unintended
acceleration. </p>
<p>Since the U.S. sold its last GM shares in December, the
company has named Mary Barra as chief executive officer, making
her the first woman to lead a major automaker. A lineup of new
vehicles helped improve GM''s reputation among consumers and
boosted quality to record levels, according to reviewers
including J.D. Power  Associates and Consumer Reports magazine. </p>
<p>The cars recalled were the 2003-07 Saturn Ion, 2005-07
Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-07 Chevy HHR, 2006-07 Pontiac Solstice,
2007 Saturn Sky, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2005-06 Pontiac Pursuit in
Canada and 2007 Open GT in Europe. </p>
<p>As early as 2004, two GM engineers involved in the Cobalt
said there had been discussions about how the model''s engines
could cut out when the keys were bumped, according to documents
and depositions gathered in a lawsuit over a 2010 crash that
killed a Georgia pediatric nurse. </p>

<p>The pound has weakened against all 16 of its major
counterparts this month as the Bank of England''s guidance on the
future path of interest rates has weighed against data that
suggests the recovery is strengthening. </p>
<p>We have provided guidance about how we think interest
rates will adjust, when the time comes to adjust them; in other
words, in a gradual, and to a limited extent, Carney said at a
hearing of the Treasury Committee in London on March 11. We''re
not complacent about the recovery. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) says
investors should favor debt from better quality companies, after
yield premiums jumped the most in almost six months last week. </p>
<p>The headlines from China and emerging markets have caused
volatility in the Asia credit market, analysts led by Hong
Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a March 15 note. We think
investors should look at stronger quality corporates. </p>
<p>The cost to borrow in dollars for companies in Asia outside
Japan climbed 11.1 basis points last week, the most since the
period ended Sept. 27, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co.
indexes. Bond risk in the region advanced, with a gauge of 40
investment-grade issuers gaining 8.5 basis points, the most in
seven weeks. </p>
<p>Emerging-market investors from Europe have mixed views on
Asia, according to Goldman Sachs. Defaults in China, where
Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science  Technology Co. failed to
fully pay a debt coupon earlier this month, are contributing to
caution, the analysts wrote. China bond funds extended their
longest streak of outflows since early in the third quarter of
2013 in the week to March 12, EPFR Global said in an e-mailed
report dated March 14. </p>
<p>Risk appetite weakened amid slowing Chinese industrial
output and emerging-market uncertainty, Goldman Sachs said.
Factory production rose 8.6 percent in January and February from
a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said last
week, the weakest start to a year since 2009. Voters in Crimea
chose to become part of Russia in a referendum deemed illegal by
the European Union and the U.S. </p>
<h2>India, Indonesia </h2>
<p>Although China high yield, especially the real estate
sector, has underperformed this year, we think it''s too early to
turn positive as we expect more credit differentiation and more
headline news on defaults to come, Ho said in the note. We
also maintain our preference for better quality corporates and
banks in India and Indonesia. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Asia index climbed 1.5 basis points to

McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 81
basis points as of 9:00 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. </p>
<p>Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) reached a
compromise with shareholders, saying it will split the roles of
chairman and chief executive officer in the future under what
the company called normal circumstances. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, amended
governance guidelines that already say the chairman will be an
independent director, unless the board decides the best
interests of shareholders would be otherwise better served,
according to a regulatory filing today. The change outlines
steps to be taken when the chairman isn''t independent. </p>
<p>The move averted a showdown at Disney''s annual meeting,
held today in Portland, Oregon, and led by Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Robert Iger. A group of investors had sought a
shareholder vote on a measure to let owners of 3 percent or more
of the stock nominate board candidates. That plan was withdrawn
after talks with the company, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The proposal was submitted by Hermes Equity Ownership
Services, the California State Teachers Retirement System and
the Connecticut Retirement Plans  Trust Funds, according to a
January filing by Burbank, California-based Disney. They cited
the board''s decision to make Iger chairman and CEO. </p>
<p>Connecticut expressly reserves its rights to re-file the
resolution for the 2015 proxy season, if the engagement between
the co-filers and Disney does not continue to demonstrate
transparency on board leadership issues, state Treasurer
Denise L. Nappier said in a statement. </p>
<h2>Annual Review </h2>
<p>In its filing today, Disney said that, when the chairman
isn''t independent, it will evaluate the arrangement annually and
include a written explanation in proxy materials. </p>
<p>Iger, 63, has been CEO since 2005 and added the role of
chairman in 2012. The board has turned back calls to split the
positions in previous years. Disney appointed an independent
chairman in 2004 amid a shareholder revolt against then-CEO
Michael Eisner. </p>
<p>At today''s meeting, investors voted 80 percent in favor of
the company''s executive compensation plan, an increase from less
than 60 percent the past two years. They also rejected a
shareholder proposal to limit accelerated executive pay in the
event of a change in control. </p>
<p>Iger earned $34.3 million in total compensation in fiscal
2013, a 15 percent decline as Disney failed to beat its targets
as handily as in the prior year. The company posted record sales
and profit for the third straight year. </p>
<h2>Adviser''s Take </h2>
<p>Institutional Shareholder Services Inc., an advisory firm,
recommended that investors back the executive pay plan this year
after suggesting they reject it in 2013. </p>
<p>CEO pay and company performance are reasonably aligned
for the year in review, and CEO total pay decreased, for the
first time since 2009, ISS said in a Feb. 25 report. The
company has engaged with shareholders to seek input following
notable investor dissent to the say-on-pay proposal last year. </p>
<p>So-called say-on-pay proposals, required by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, give shareholders a
nonbinding advisory vote on executive pay. </p>
<p>At the meeting, Iger said the company plans a pirate-themed
land in Shanghai Disneyland when it opens at the end of 2015. He
announced a third installment to Cars, the Pixar film
series, and said the Star Wars picture scheduled for 2015
will take place 30 years after Return of the Jedi. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.7 percent to $81.99 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 7.3 percent this year. </p>

<p>Financing arrangments in China
using commodities from copper to rubber as collateral to obtain
credit may be unwound in 12 to 24 months, driven by increased
yuan volatility, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>As much as 1 million metric tons of copper and 30 million
tons of iron ore could be released if the deals unwind, the bank
said in a report today. The unwinding would be bearish given
relatively limited physical liquidity to absorb the shock,
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote. For now, the deals remain
profitable and an abrupt government crackdown on them is
unlikely given the potential effect on the country''s economic
growth, they wrote. </p>
<p>Our view is that Chinese commodity financing deals will
gradually unwind over the medium term, driven by an increase in
foreign exchange hedging costs, which would slowly erode
financing deal profitability and eventually close the interest
rate arbitrage, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>The transactions using commodities as collateral made as
much as $160 billion, or 31 percent of China''s total short-term
foreign-exchange loans, the report showed. Gold, copper and iron
ore are most commonly used as collateral, followed by soybeans,
palm oil, rubber, nickel, zinc and aluminum, the bank said. </p>
<h2>Hot Money'' </h2>
<p>We believe Chinese commodity financing deals are ongoing
and facilitating hot money'' inflows into China by providing a
mechanism to import low-cost foreign financing, the analysts
wrote. The deals create excess physical demand and tighten the
physical markets artificially; in contrast, an unwind creates
excess supply and thus is bearish to prices. </p>
<p>With the exception of iron ore, profitability of most
hedged arrangements remains substantial because of positive
yuan- and dollar-based interest-rate differentials, limited
depreciation of the yuan last month and abundant commodity
supply, which limits hedging costs, the bank said. Continued
weakening of the yuan may spur some of the deals to unwind
sooner than expected, it said. </p>
<p>China''s yuan had the biggest three-day decline since at
least 2007 on concern rising financial risks will weaken growth
in the world''s second-largest economy. The yuan has dropped 2.4
percent from a 20-year high of 6.0406 per dollar reached on Jan.
14, after strengthening 2.9 percent in 2013. </p>
<h2>1 Million Tons </h2>
<p>Returns from using copper as collateral are still more than
10 percent and up to 1 million tons of the metal may be tied to
such arrangements, Goldman Sachs said. That''s up from 500,000
tons nine months ago, it said. </p>
<p>Imports of copper and iron ore into China rose to records
in January on financing demand, before sliding in February as
the currency weakened and the state moved to rein in shadow
banking. About 40 percent of iron-ore stockpiles at Chinese
ports are linked to finance deals, Mysteel Research estimates. </p>
<p>Financing arrangements probably lie behind a surge in
Chinese gold imports from Hong Kong, Goldman Sachs said. The
deals involve physical imports of gold and exports of semi-fabricated products to bring foreign exchange into China,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>The number of commodities used for financing increased
since mid-2013 as the government cut the amount of money that
could be borrowed per commodity unit, Goldman Sachs said. Copper
financing may account for about $23 billion worth of short-term
foreign exchange loans, iron ore for $10.4 billion and soybeans
for $7.7 billion in a base case, the bank said. </p>

The Standard  Poor''s GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials dropped last year for the first time since 2008.

<p>For years, Exxon Mobil has walked around with an environmentalist target on its chest. So it was news when the world''s biggest oil company by market value agreed to share its plans for dealing with climate change. A look at what we already know about Exxon''s climate strategy shows why disclosure may be a savvy move. </p><p>The chart below shows how companies estimate the future cost of carbon pollution. Right now, few countries outside Europe regulate it. That''s changing and is likely to intensify in the lead-up to key UN climate negotiations in 2015. Some companies use a so-called shadow price to anticipate the future cost from climate policy when planning new projects. Of 30 U.S. companies that use a shadow carbon price, Exxon''s is among the most aggressive.</p>

<p>Bloomberg BNA  Exxon Mobil Corp. has agreed to publish a report describing its plans for a future in which market forces and stricter climate regulation may leave some of its carbon reserves unburnable.</p><p>Exxon Mobil is the first oil and gas producer in the U.S. to commit to reporting on its risks of stranded assets due to climate change.</p><p>The commitment came in response to a shareholder resolution filed in the fall of 2013 by wealth management firm Arjuna Capital and shareholder advocacy group As You Sow. The resolution was withdrawn after months of negotiations with Exxon Mobil.</p><p>Investors have increasingly raised concerns that stranded assets, also known as a carbon bubble, could occur if fossil fuel reserves are suddenly revalued under future government policies for climate change or greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>In its report, Exxon Mobil will let shareholders know what types of reserves it holdsfrom deep sea drilling, tar sands or elsewhereso that investors have a better idea of where the risks lie and how well the company can withstand those risks, Danielle Fugere, As You Sow''s president, told Bloomberg BNA.</p><p>That kind of differentiation is important to shareholders as they decide which company to invest in, Fugere said.</p><p>The report will also discuss how climate risks could affect Exxon Mobil''s capital expenditure plans. The report will be posted on Exxon Mobil''s website by the end of March.</p><h2>Exxon Mobil''s Response
</h2><p>Natasha Lamb, director of equity research and shareholder engagement at Arjuna Capital, said she was very impressed by Exxon Mobil''s responsiveness to the shareholder resolution.</p><p>In the past, they''ve been seen as a climate denier, Lamb told Bloomberg BNA. Exxon Mobil seems to be making more of an effort to engage with shareholders on climate change and related issues, in part because you can only hide under a rock for so long, she said.</p><p>Lamb said Exxon Mobil made a big move recently when it disclosed to CDP, formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, that it has included a carbon proxy cost in its long-term business plans since 2007. Exxon Mobil is one of about 30 companies in the U.S. that put an internal price on carbon pollution.</p><p>Exxon Mobil invests billions of dollars in energy projects which take decades to plan and execute, Exxon Mobil spokesman Alan Jeffers told Bloomberg BNA in December. Although climate policies remain uncertain today, for the purposes of our business planning we assume that governments will continue to gradually adopt a wide variety of more stringent policies to help stem greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Exxon Mobil declined to comment on the shareholder resolution.</p><h2>Setting Standard
</h2><p>The agreement with Exxon Mobil has the potential to set a standard for other energy companies in terms of what kind of information is important to investors, Fugere said.</p><p>About 10 energy companies, including Chevron Corp., Hess Corp. and Anadarko Petroleum Corp., have received similar shareholder resolutions on carbon asset risk so far during the 2014 proxy season. Discussions with these companies are in various stages, with some proposals leaning toward withdrawals, while many of the other resolutions will likely go to a vote, Fugere said.</p><p>As You Sow filed the first shareholder resolution on carbon asset risk with CONSOL Energy last proxy season. The resolution went to a vote and received about 20 percent support, which is considered high among shareholder resolutions.</p><p>Since then, CONSOL has divested nearly half of its carbon-heavy coal holdings in favor of less carbon-intensive natural gas, which Fugere said is an indication of where the energy market is going.</p><p>Companies need to acknowledge that preparing for a low-carbon future is a necessity, not a choice, she said.</p><p>For more about Bloomberg BNA, click here.</p><p> ', 'Exxon Mobil Agrees to Report on PlansFor Low-Carbon Future, Carbon Risks', 'By Andrea Vittorio', 'Mar 21, 2014  1:23 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-21/exxon-mobil-agrees-to-report-on-plans-for-low-carbon-future-carbon-risks.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>The forint will probably drop to a
two-year low after Hungary''s central bank cut interest rates to
a record, pushing bond yields to a level that doesn''t compensate
investors for currency risk, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>The forint, which depreciated 5.1 percent this year to
313.21 per euro, will probably slide toward 320, which would be
the weakest since January 2012, New York- and London-based
analysts Themistoklis Fiotakis and Magdalena Polan wrote in an
e-mailed note yesterday. Hungarian policy makers will probably
signal an end to easing after a 10 basis-point cut next week and
won''t increase rates in the coming months, they wrote. </p>
<p>The forint''s slump was caused by a reduction in Federal
Reserve stimulus and the crisis in Ukraine and is beyond the
government''s control, Hungary''s Economy Minister Mihaly Varga
said in an interview with Gazdasagi Radio on March 18. Hungarian
bonds yield an average 286 basis points above U.S. Treasuries,
compared with an emerging-market average of 315, according to
JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. </p>
<p>Recent statements by Hungarian officials argue that there
still may be some way to go before tolerance to currency
depreciation runs out, the analysts wrote. Dovish surprises
are likely to maintain the tightening pressure on local currency
premia and bring EUR/HUF to 320. </p>
<p>Derivatives trading shows there is a 38 percent chance the
forint will weaken past 320 per euro in the next year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The probability it will
strengthen to 300 is 30 percent. The forint decline this year is
the fourth-worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg, following the Argentine peso, the Russian
ruble and Chile''s peso. </p>
<h2>Fed, Ukraine </h2>
<p>A gauge of 20 emerging-market currencies has fallen 1.5
percent in 2014. The Fed voted on March 19 to reduce its bond-purchase program to $55 billion a month. Russian President
Vladimir Putin signed legislation today to complete the process
of Crimea''s accession to Russia. The move is against the wishes
of Ukraine, last month ousted pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Yanukovych. </p>
<p>Magyar Nemzeti Bank cut its benchmark rate to a record 2.7
percent last month in 19 consecutive steps. The Monetary Policy
Council will probably cut the rate by 10 basis points next week,
in line with Goldman''s estimate, according to the median of 22
estimates in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The forint is vulnerable because the extra yield on
Hungary''s local-currency bonds over hard currency-denominated
assets offer little or no reward, the Goldman analysts wrote. </p>
<h2>Local Spread </h2>
<p>The yield on securities included in the Bloomberg Hungary
Local Sovereign Bond Index are 54 basis points below the
constituents of an index of Hungary''s dollar-denominated bonds.
That compares with a premium of as much as 200 basis points on
forint-denominated bonds before the monetary easing started in
2012. </p>
<p>Economic policy will have to adapt to a weak forint after
Hungary''s April 6 parliamentary election, said Varga, whose
Fidesz party is poised to win the vote according to all opinion
polls. The next administration should strengthen export-oriented
industries to exploit the currency''s weakness, rather than
trying to influence the exchange rate, he said. </p>

billions of dollars in settlements tied to mortgage-backed
securities and Bernard Madoff''s Ponzi scheme. </p>
<p>Under Dimon''s leadership, the New York-based company sold

<p>Analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co.,
Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are abandoning their
sell ratings on Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) as the stock
posts its best quarterly rally since 2005. </p>
<p>All three banks raised their recommendations on Teva, the
world''s biggest maker of generic drugs, to neutral from sell in
the past two weeks as the stock soared to a three-year high in
New York trading. The analysts said the company is making
progress in its push to maintain market share of its best-selling drug Copaxone while a boom in mergers and acquisitions
in the industry yields deals of as much as $21 billion. </p>
<p>Shares of Petach Tikva, Israel-based Teva have rallied 23
percent this year. The stock, the biggest investment in
billionaire George Soros''s fund, is the third-best performer on
the Market Vectors U.S. Listed Pharmaceutical 25 Price Index
after trailing the 21 other companies in the measure in 2013.
Mounting concern about the company''s leadership and growth
outlook has sent Teva''s valuation to 11 times estimated
earnings, the second-lowest multiple among 15 global generic
drug makers tracked by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The upgrades are not saying everything is great but, at
the valuation it got to investors are reconsidering their
positions, Jacob de Tusch-Lec, who helps oversee about $23
billion in equities at Artemis Investment Management LLP in
London, said by phone on March 20. Essentially things have not
gotten worse. </p>
<h2>Weekly Rally </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index rose 2.5 percent to
119.39 last week, the most since Feb. 14, extending its gain
this year to 7.3 percent. The TA-25 Index advanced 0.7 percent
at today''s close in Israel, extending its 2014 advance to 4.7
percent. </p>
<p>Leslie Shribman, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, Lauren Bellmare at Morgan Stanley, and Amanda Smith at JPMorgan
declined to comment on their analysts'' reports. Denise Bradley,
a spokeswoman for Teva in North Wales, Pennsylvania, didn''t
respond to an e-mailed request for comment. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has been advising clients to buy Mylan Inc. (MYL), the
biggest U.S. generic-drug maker, since October 2007. The shares
have more than tripled since then. Morgan Stanley rated Perrigo
Co. (PRGO), a maker of generic over-the-counter medicines, the
equivalent of buy on Feb. 4, 2013, before a 50 percent rally. </p>
<p>Teva converted 8.7 percent of 20-milligram Copaxone
prescriptions to its 40-milligram version in the week ended Feb.
28, according to Bloomberg Industries. Leerink Partners and
Cowen  Co. analysts said the results mean the company may
deliver on its plan to get 30 percent to 50 percent of patients
on the three-times-weekly injection. </p>
<h2>$4 Billion </h2>
<p>Moving patients to the new version is key because the
remaining U.S. patent on the $4 billion-drug expires at the end
of May, while the new version will be protected from generic
competition until 2030. Teva''s next hurdle will be persuading
insurers in the U.S. to continue paying for the branded, three-times-a-week shot once a cheaper copycat of the daily version
becomes available. </p>
<p>Fifteen out of the 29 analysts tracked by Bloomberg
recommend buying Teva''s shares, the highest level since
September. Thirteen analysts have a hold rating, while one says
sell, the data showed. The shares declined 1.4 percent to 172.60
shekels, or the equivalent of $49.54, today in Tel Aviv. </p>
<p>A wave of mergers and acquisitions among generic drug
companies has also triggered a rally in Teva''s shares, according
to Jason Kolbert, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC. </p>
<p>Actavis Plc (ACT) agreed to purchase Forest Laboratories Inc. for
$25 billion last month, and Mylan Inc. Chief Executive Heather Bresch said Feb. 27 that the generic-drug maker may make a large
acquisition this year. Chief Financial Officer Eyal Desheh said
March 4 that Teva is open for deals as the pace of industry
consolidation quickens. </p>
<h2>Hot Topic'' </h2>
<p>The acquisition of generic companies has now become a
very hot topic, Kolbert, who has a buy rating for Teva, said
in a March 20 phone interview from New York. Actavis'' purchase
was a gift for the Israeli drugmaker, he said. That was
the trigger that got people focusing on Teva. </p>
<p>Soros Fund Management LLC, the family office of billionaire
George Soros, boosted its stake in Teva in the last three months
of 2013, making the Israeli drugmaker its largest holding in the
fourth quarter. </p>

according to the Missile Defense Agency. </p>
<p>Boeing Co. (BA), based in Chicago, is the prime contractor on
the ground-based system of radar, interceptors and command
centers. Dulles, Virginia-based Orbital Sciences assembles the
booster that''s equipped with a non-explosive warhead made by
Waltham, Massachusetts-based Raytheon. Falls Church, Virginia-based Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) builds the command-and-control
network. </p>
<h2>System Costs </h2>
<p>The U.S. has spent $24 billion on ground-based missile
defense intended to protect the continental U.S. and Hawaii, and
that amount will grow to $30 billion by 2019, Vice Admiral James
Syring, director of the Missile Defense Agency, told a House
Armed Services Committee panel today. </p>
<p>In response to the findings on the failed test, the Missile
Defense Agency plans to improve the warhead''s battery and
implement a fleet-wide software change for the 20 already in
the field that are the same version, Frank Kendall, the
Pentagon''s top weapons buyer, wrote House Armed Services
Committee members in an update on the continuing review. </p>
<p>Crucial to expansion of the missile-defense system is
success in testing the newer warhead that had two failures in
2010, the first caused by a quality defect, the second by a
design shortfall that wasn''t detected in ground testing. The
Missile Defense Agency and Michael Gilmore, the Pentagon''s top
tester, have said the new warhead has been improved and is ready
for an interception test. </p>
<h2>More Testing </h2>
<p>While the agency has screened the newer warhead''s battery
and took steps to ensure it won''t fail, ongoing testing and
analysis may require delaying the test for several months
until an improved battery is available, Kendall said. </p>
<p>He told lawmakers he expected final results from the review
of the test failure by March 31. </p>
<p>John Patterson, a spokesman for Raytheon Missile Systems,
didn''t immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Rick Lerner, a spokesman for the Missile Defense Agency,
said he had no comment on Kendall''s letter. </p>
<p>Syring had said at a budget briefing on March 4 that the
July failure wasn''t caused by a quality defect. </p>
<h2>Quality Review </h2>
<p>Separately, the Pentagon''s inspector general said in
October that it had begun a quality review of Raytheon''s record
in manufacturing the interceptor. </p>
<p>The Missile Defense Agency is proposing four programs to
improve interceptor reliability, according to a 16-page report
to Congress submitted in January and labeled For Official Use
Only. </p>
<p>The programs are needed to achieve a higher probability
of engagement success'' against intercontinental ballistic
missiles, according the report. </p>
<p>The fiscal 2015-2019 budget plan for the Missile Defense
Agency calls for $4.39 billion for continued development of the
ground system, $189 million for a new common kill vehicle
that could replace the Raytheon warhead and $619 million to buy
additional interceptors and other equipment. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is the biggest broker on the upstart U.S. stock platform created by IEX Group Inc., according to a memo IEX sent some clients. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs said last week that markets would be well-served if the five-month-old venue achieved critical mass. The dark pool, which has ambitions to become an exchange, was built with defenses against the fastest traders. Yesterday, in a memo obtained by Bloomberg News, IEX said Goldman Sachs has more than double the volume of the No. 2 broker. </p> <p>It''s a bit surprising to see a major broker be such an active and vocal supporter of IEX early on, Justin Schack, partner and managing director for market structure analysis at Rosenblatt Securities Inc., said in a phone interview. It''s an important vote of confidence in IEX. </p> <p>Gerald Lam, a spokesman for New York-based IEX, declined to comment on the memo or the endorsement from Goldman Sachs. Tiffany Galvin, a Goldman Sachs spokeswoman, said the New York-based firm has no comment beyond last week''s memo. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs has played kingmaker before in the exchange industry. It was an early investor in IntercontinentalExchange Group Inc. and was among the firm''s largest shareholders when it went public in 2005. Atlanta-based ICE, which now owns the New York Stock Exchange, has grown to become the world''s second-biggest bourse owner by market value at $23 billion. Goldman Sachs was also a shareholder of Direct Edge Holdings LLC, which merged this year with Bats Global Markets Inc. to form an exchange operator with about 20 percent of American volume. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) agreed to buy Maker
Studios, a supplier of online video content to YouTube, for at
least $500 million, gaining technology and experience with
short-form entertainment. </p>
<p>Disney also agreed to pay as much as $450 million more if
Maker Studios meets strong performance targets, according to
a statement yesterday by the Burbank, California-based company.
That could boost the total to $950 million. </p>
<p>With Maker Studios, Disney is following DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) into an online video business with expanding
audiences and little profit. DreamWorks Animation, producer of
the Shrek movies, bought AwesomenessTV, a smaller competitor
of Maker Studios, for $33 million plus as much as $117 million
in incentives last year. The online outlets could help media
companies build awareness for films and TV shows. </p>
<p>Short-form online video is growing at an astonishing pace
and with Maker Studios, Disney will now be at the center of this
dynamic industry with an unmatched combination of advanced
technology and programming expertise and capabilities,Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said in the
statement. </p>
<p>With more than 55,000 channels, 380 million subscribers and
5.5 billion views a month on Google Inc.''s YouTube, Culver City,
California-based Maker has established itself as one of the top
online-video networks for young audiences, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Online Space </h2>
<p>There is a lot of good happening in digital video
networks, Mike Vorhaus, a technology consultant at Magid
Advisors, said in an interview. There are a ton of eyeballs
and the content isn''t expensive to produce. There just hasn''t
been a lot of meaningful profit yet. </p>
<p>The acquisition is one of the biggest for Disney, the
world''s largest entertainment company, since the $4 billion
purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. in 2012. In the online space, Maker
could potentially exceed the $563.2 million Disney spent in 2010
on mobile game maker Playdom. Disney paid $350 million in 2007
for the kids'' social network Club Penguin. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.4 percent to $79.84 in extended trading after
the deal was announced yesterday. The stock fell 1.1 percent to
$79.49 at the close in New York and has gained 4 percent this
year. </p>
<p>Maker Studios will report to Jay Rasulo, Disney''s chief
financial officer, according to the statement. The online
company was founded in 2009, according to a regulatory filing. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella said he will hold nothing back to get the company''s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker''s longtime focus on its Windows operating system. </p> <p>At his first public speech since taking the CEO job last month, Nadella unveiled Office software for Apple Inc.''s iPad, the first time Microsoft is putting the popular productivity programs onto the tablet. Nadella also said the company''s goal is to get its Internet-based Office 365 service on any gadget, even if it reduces sales of Windows-based personal computers or other products. </p> <p>It''s not a tradeoff, because it''s about going where customers are going, Nadella said after the company event in San Francisco. It''s not about today''s share position based on today''s form factors, because in the full arc of time there will be many new platforms that will require Office, from small screens to large screens. </p> <p>Nadella is presiding over Microsoft''s shift to a more open approach. While former CEO Steve Ballmer kept more of a focus on Windows, including pushing the operating system onto smartphones, Nadella is indicating that he proactively wants to get Microsoft software onto Apple''s iOS and Google Inc.''s Android-based gadgets. Since Apple and Android devices dominate in mobile, Microsoft risks having its software locked out if it can''t sell its programs for those platforms. </p> <h2>New Sheriff </h2> <p>There is a new sheriff in town, Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note about Nadella''s presentation. We believe the Office for iPad was a major positive step in the right direction and signals a strategic change at Microsoft. Ives has the equivalent of a hold on the stock. </p> <p>Microsoft shares fell 1 percent to $39.36 at the close in New York. </p> <p>Office for iPad, which now includes Word, PowerPoint and Excel, also heralds a new business model for the software, which has been a paid product. Now users will be able to view their Office documents for free on their iPad, though to edit or create documents they will need to pay $99 a year for a subscription to Office 365. </p> <p>Last year, Microsoft released paid versions of Office apps for the iPhone, which required a subscription to Office 365. That product cost $99.99 a year for a home version that works on five devices and $69.99 for a version that works for just one computer and one tablet. </p> <p>We''re excited that Office is coming to iPad  now part of the more than 500,000 apps designed specifically for iPad, said Trudy Muller, a spokeswoman for Apple. </p> <h2>Mobile, Cloud </h2> <p>On his first day as CEO, Nadella emphasized the Redmond, Washington-based company''s focus on devices and Web-based cloud services and said those priorities would define Microsoft going forward. </p> <p>At the event today, Nadella reiterated that the intersection of mobile and cloud is the most critical, though he added that it was just one aspect of our overall strategy. </p> <p>He also rolled out technology to enable developers to create what he called a cloud for everyone on every device. </p> <p>Nadella said Windows remains a massive agenda for us and the company plans to innovate with the operating system. The CEO said Microsoft will unveil more of its strategy as soon as next week at its Build developer conference in San Francisco, where Windows will be front and center. </p> <h2>Bigger Opportunity </h2> <p>Microsoft is in the process of migrating the lion''s share of its business to the cloud and subscription, Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., wrote in a note to clients last week. </p> <p>The iPad version of Office, a suite of software that includes Microsoft''s Word, Excel, Outlook and other programs, may add $1.1 billion to $1.5 billion in consumer Office subscription revenue a year, Moerdler said. </p> <p>Microsoft is taking a risk by asking people to pay $99 a year to edit, rather than just look at, their documents, said Milind Gadekar, CEO of CloudOn Inc., which makes a free mobile application that lets users access and edit their Office documents on mobile devices. </p> <p>Consumers expect editing to be free, he said. You have to find other advanced features to charge for. </p> <p>Milind said that while Microsoft is becoming more open, its new strategy still requires Office 365 users to use its OneDrive online storage system, rather than popular alternatives such as Dropbox, Box.net and Evernote. </p> <h2>Productivity Programs </h2> <p>Still, consumers are spending more than twice as much time using mobile productivity apps than they did a year ago, according to research measuring usage between January and March by Flurry, a mobile analytics firm which tracked usage on both phones and tablets. </p> <p>Microsoft''s announcement of Office for iPad couldn''t be more timely, the company said in a blog post. In fact, it can define Microsoft and its newly appointed CEO''s tenure in the post-PC world. The study included phones and tablets with both iOS and Android. This growth rate eclipsed all other categories including Messaging, Games and News. </p> <p>Asked if selling Office on other devices would cause big changes in sales of Windows-based PCs, phones and tablets, Nadella said at the event, I would leave it to Wall Street to do the analysis, but we are going after huge opportunities that are ahead of us. </p> <p> ', 'Microsoft CEO Unveils Office for IPad in Mobile-App Push', 'By Dina Bass and Peter Burrows', 'Mar 27, 2014  5:20 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-03-27/microsoft-ceo-unveils-office-for-ipad-in-mobile-app-push.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) will pay $490,000 to
settle U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission allegations
that the company failed to adequately oversee customer funds. </p>
<p>The bank''s Smith Barney futures brokerage in April 2013
transferred $16 million to the wrong type of account holding
customer funds, resulting in a violation of CFTC rules, the
agency said in a statement today announcing the settlement.
Customers didn''t lose any funds as a result of the company''s
failures in internal controls and supervision, the regulator

<p>In 2012, the brokerage also commingled customer and company
funds and improperly titled accounts for customer funds, the
CFTC said today. The bank hired KPMG LLP to review policies for
overseeing customer funds. </p>

New York-based Morgan Stanley , said in a statement. We
cooperated fully with the CFTC, hired an outside auditor to

<p>Investors'' confidence in companies
making acquisitions is emboldening management to execute deals,
spurring a mergers and acquisitions boom, according to Michael Carr, co-head of Americas MA at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>Shareholders have been embracing the acquiring companies,
Carr said today at the 26th annual Tulane University Corporate
Law Institute in New Orleans, signaling faith in the lasting
value of transactions as well as challenging the conventional
wisdom that they should brace for a selloff. </p>
<p>Public U.S. companies worth more than $1 billion have risen
an average of 5.2 percent in 2014 the day after announcing they
are acquiring a target, a reversal from the 1.9 percent one-day
decline buyers experienced five years ago, according to data
from Goldman Sachs. Almost 75 percent of acquiring companies
have gone up following deal announcements in the fourth quarter
of 2013 and the first quarter this year. </p>
<p>This is all about shareholder sentiment, Carr said.
Shareholders are accepting the companies'' view of synergies
and cost savings, and they''re giving a lot more credit than they
did. </p>
<p>There have been more than 6,500 deals announced globally in
the year to date, valued at almost $650 billion, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That''s the most volume in the first
three months of the year since the first quarter of 2007, when
volume reached $960 billion, the data show. </p>
<p>The first-quarter volume reflects a 28 percent jump from
the year-earlier quarter, and a 12 percent increase from the
fourth quarter of 2013. </p>
<h2>Strategic Shift </h2>
<p>More companies are shifting toward strategic MA in 2014
and away from financial engineering, such as share buybacks,
Carr said. </p>
<p>Comcast Corp.''s $45.2 billion agreement to buy Time Warner
Cable Inc. was the largest announced in the first three months
of the year, topping a failed hostile bid from Charter
Communications Inc. Actavis Plc''s $21 billion offer for
drugmaker Forest Laboratories Inc. and Facebook Inc.''s $19
billion takeover of mobile messaging service WhatsApp Inc.
followed the cable combination to round out the quarter''s top
three acquisitions. </p>
<p>This year''s deals have been motivated by expansion of
market presence and consolidation, rather than many of 2013''s
biggest takeovers, which were clean-up trades, Carr said. </p>
<p>Comcast Corp.''s buyout of the remainder of NBCUniversal
from General Electric Co., and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ)''s
acquisition of Verizon Wireless from Vodafone Group Plc were two
2013 deals driven by financial concerns and cheap debt, rather
than building influence in their particular industries, Carr
said. </p>
<p>The character of the market feels different than a good
part of 2013. </p>
<h2>Shareholder Sentiment </h2>
<p>While the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index has gained more than
65 percent since September 2011, earnings growth has risen just
14 percent in the same time period, indicating the market is
expecting profits to rise from deals, he said. This supports
deal advisers, who must count on shareholder sentiment to propel
future acquisitions, Carr said. It''s very, very hard for MA
activity to pick up without that optimism, he said. </p>
<p>Comcast''s Time Warner Cable acquisition, the largest U.S.
cable deal since Comcast''s $72 billion merger with ATT
Broadband in 2001, helped propel Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan
Chase  Co. to the top rankings for fees for the quarter, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley advised Time Warner Cable and JPMorgan
advised Comcast, according to the press release announcing that
deal. Bankers earned about $143 million on that merger, the
third-largest payday for any deal since 2009, according to New
York-based research firm Freeman  Co. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has advised on 58 deals this year, valued at
more than $215 billion, followed by JPMorgan''s $162 billion for
59, the data show. </p>
<p>While Goldman Sachs landed in third place for advising on
$132 billion of deals, it worked on more transactions than
either bank, at 77. Citigroup Inc. and Barclays Plc rounded out
the top five. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) and Suzuki Motor

<p>Coca-Cola, which opened a bottling plant in Myanmar last

<p>More Chinese companies are heading
toward default as higher funding costs and slowing growth weigh
on existing debt commitments, according to Morgan Stanley. (MS) </p>
<p>The pressures are now on for the corporate default rate
to be moving higher, said Viktor Hjort, the Hong Kong-based
head of Asia fixed-income research at the U.S. lender. Any
economy that generates defaults usually needs three things,
leveraged balance sheets, sluggish growth and tighter financial
conditions. China ticks all three boxes. </p>
<p>Chinese issuers pay an average 6.22 percent for dollar-denominated securities, after yields touched 6.39 percent on
March 20, the highest since September, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
indexes show. Top-rated companies pay an average 6.05 percent
for 10-year notes onshore, the most in a month and poised for
the biggest monthly increase since November, according to
Chinabond indexes. </p>
<p>Corporate borrowing spiraled during the global credit
crisis, as the Chinese government encouraged banks to lend to
support the economy. Financial institutions are now clamping
down on non-performing loans and curbing new lending, pushing up
the cost of servicing this debt as the nation''s economy slows. A
preliminary gauge of manufacturing missed estimates this week,
suggesting factory output weakened for a fifth straight month in
March. </p>
<p>Solar-cell maker Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science 
Technology Co. became the first company in China to default on
its onshore notes earlier this month. </p>
<h2>Credit Caution </h2>
<p>Access to credit has become increasingly tight, Hjort
said in an interview yesterday. That''s what''s starting to
create tensions in terms of credit risk in China, creating the
basis to expect default rates will go up, and is the main reason
why one needs to be cautious. </p>
<p>China''s economic growth is expected to slow to 7.4 percent
this year, according to the median estimate of 55 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Total lending by Agricultural Bank
of China Ltd., the nation''s third-largest, grew 12 percent in
2013, down from 14 percent a year earlier, according to annual
results published yesterday. </p>

11th straight day, the longest streak in seven years. </p>
<p>The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific corporate and sovereign
bonds from default rose, according to credit-default swaps
traders. </p>
<h2>Risk Rises </h2>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President
Gary Cohn said prices in global markets don''t reflect the risks
from geopolitical conflicts such as Russia''s annexation of
Crimea. </p>
<p>For the last six to 12 months, markets for some reason
have been ignoring a lot of the geopolitical risk, Cohn, 53,
said in an interview with Canadian television network CBC.
Russia, Crimea, Ukraine: this is not the first or newest
geopolitical risk we''ve had in the last year or so. </p>
<p>Cohn cited tensions between China and Japan as well as
continuing violence in the Middle East as risks that haven''t
halted a climb in global equities over the last 12 months.
Investors with a lot of cash have felt pressure to deploy it,
preventing a sustained downturn in prices, he said. </p>
<p>Anytime we get any sell-off in the market, there''s new
investors coming into the market, so we haven''t seen that
repricing, Cohn said. Investors are saying, I''ve got to put
cash to work, and maybe these situations are going to be with us
for a long time, and I can''t sit on cash at the bank earning no
return forever, he said. </p>
<p>Still, Cohn said the U.S. stock market seems fairly valued,
given low interest rates and bond yields that will probably
climb. The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index has risen 18 percent in
the last 12 months. </p>
<p>In a lot of respects, owning equities in the world today
seems like the least risky opportunity for cash out there,
Cohn said. Each of the alternatives has its own negative
potential consequences to it, and then you evaluate all the
alternatives in relationship to each other, and then you end up
in a scenario where I think equities provide the most upside
versus the downside. </p>

<p>Ghana''s cedi, the worst-performing
African currency in the first quarter, could depreciate another
20 percent this year as foreign-exchange reserves recede and
inflation (GHCPALLY) accelerates, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>Increased risk of outflows from the heavily foreign-owned local bonds, uncertainty around commodity prices and fewer
signs of a real turnaround in the country''s fiscal situation
add to the cedi''s weaker outlook, Giulia Pellegrini, sub-Saharan
Africa economist at JPMorgan, said in a report yesterday. </p>
<p>The U.S. investment bank, which cut Ghana''s gross domestic
product forecast for 2014, said lower growth will affect revenue
generation and widen the budget deficit to 10 percent of GDP
against the government''s target of 8.5 percent. Inflation
quickened to 14 percent in February, climbing for a sixth
consecutive month, as the government stopped utility subsidies
and the cedi weakened. It climbed from 13.8 percent in January,
above the central bank''s target of 9.5 percent plus or minus 2
percentage points. </p>
<p>Bank of Ghana has revised up its inflation forecasts,
Pellegrini said. It sees inflation staying above the target
band until 2015, with risks tilted to the upside on the
weakening cedi and slower-than-planned fiscal consolidation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan cut the economic growth forecast to 5.2 percent
given the West African nation''s erratic power supply and
uncertainty around commodity prices, Pellegrini said. The
government''s GDP estimate for this year is 8 percent. </p>
<p>Ghana''s gross foreign-exchange reserves dropped to $5.3
billion in January from $5.6 billion the previous month, the
central bank said March 19. </p>
<p>The currency of the world''s second-biggest cocoa producer
slumped 20 percent against the dollar last year. It is 12
percent weaker in the first quarter, the most among 24 African
currencies monitored by Bloomberg. The cedi slipped 0.1 percent
to 2.6925 per dollar by 4:40 p.m. in Accra, the capital,
declining for a second day. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is seeking to
become one of the world''s three biggest stock brokers, lifting a
division that has fallen behind its capital markets, equity
derivatives and investment banking units. </p>
<p>The largest U.S. bank is trying to boost electronic trading

London. JPMorgan is ranked first in investment banking, equities
origination, fixed income, commodities and currencies, while it

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) failed to
persuade a federal judge to again throw out a securities lawsuit
over residential mortgage-backed securities it sold in 2007
after an appeals court overturned an earlier decision. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum in Manhattan,
who had dismissed the lawsuit by the Police and Fire Retirement
System of the City of Detroit twice before, ruled yesterday that
a 2012 appellate decision overturning her findings in a related
lawsuit had significantly changed the landscape. </p>
<p>In 2012 the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York reversed
Cedarbaum''s ruling that the NECA-IBEW Health and Welfare Fund,
which had sued Goldman Sachs in 2008, had failed to claim a
sufficient loss from the investments. The appeals panel also
threw out her ruling that the fund couldn''t represent investors
in offerings of the securities it hadn''t bought itself. </p>
<p>Yesterday''s ruling follows a New York state appeals court
decision in January that Goldman Sachs must face fraud claims in
a $1 billion lawsuit filed by an Australian hedge fund, Basis
Capital Funds Management Ltd.''s Basis Yield Alpha Fund, over
collateralized debt obligations sold by the bank before the
financial crisis of 2008. In 2010, Goldman Sachs reached a $550
million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to resolve claims over the marketing of CDOs. </p>
<h2>Judge Reversed </h2>
<p>In the federal case, the Detroit pension fund filed a
separate lawsuit in 2010 on behalf of investors that bought
securities from the trust for which Cedarbaum had said NECA
couldn''t bring claims. The judge had dismissed the Detroit
fund''s lawsuit twice largely on her determination that it didn''t
adequately allege how Goldman Sachs''s purported
misrepresentations caused any loss. </p>
<p>After the higher court''s ruling, the fact that PFRS
received payments throughout the life of the certificates, and
was arguably aware of the risk that there would not be a
secondary market for its certificates, is immaterial,
Cedarbaum said in yesterday''s ruling. </p>

Sachs, declined to comment on the ruling. </p>

<p>General Growth Properties Inc. (GGP) Chief
Executive Officer Sandeep Mathrani''s compensation surged more
than fivefold to $22.1 million last year, boosted by the value
of stock-option awards. </p>
<p>About $17.3 million of the compensation for Mathrani, 51,
came in the form of options, according to a filing today with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He also received a
$3 million cash bonus after meeting goals set by the
compensation committee, including 92 percent occupancy for
General Growth''s portfolio, the Chicago-based company said. </p>
<p>The compensation committee determined that Mr. Mathrani
accomplished each of the objectives set forth, General Growth
said in the filing. </p>
<p>General Growth, the second-largest U.S.-based mall owner,
is sprucing up its retail centers to increase sales and has sold
off properties and investments that aren''t central to its

<p>Mathrani received 3.4 million stock options last year after
not receiving any in 2012, according to the filing. His total
compensation in 2012 was $4.22 million. </p>
<p>The filing was made after the close of regular U.S.

<p>Argentina''s effort to repair ties
with overseas investors is starting to yield results in the bond
market as the country tries to stem a plunge in foreign-currency
reserves. </p>
<p>Its dollar-denominated notes surged by the most of any
emerging market, adding to a 9.2 percent rally in March, after
the government said it received loan proposals from
international investment banks. The statement was in response to
a newspaper report on March 30 that said Argentina is close to
getting a two-year, $1 billion loan from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. at an interest rate of 6.5 percent, less than the nation''s
similar-maturity bonds that yield 11.28 percent. </p>
<p>The loan would provide Argentina, which hasn''t issued
overseas bonds since its $95 billion default in 2001, with a
crucial source of hard currency at a time when the reserves it
uses to pay debt are at a seven-year low. The financing would
also show President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is succeeding
in restoring investor confidence after settling creditor
disputes at the World Bank, agreeing to compensate Repsol SA for
its seizure of YPF SA and revamping its inflation index. </p>
<p>The market has been optimistic about Argentina for a
while now due to the change in attitude toward more pragmatic
and orthodox policies, Diego Ferro, the co-chief investment
officer at Greylock Capital Management LLC in New York, said by
e-mail. In that context, regaining market access would be a
logical step. </p>
<h2>Budget Deficit </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally declined to comment
on any proposals or talks with Argentina. </p>
<p>The central bank is negotiating the final details of the
loan with Goldman Sachs including guarantees, Buenos Aires-based
newspaper Pagina/12 reported, citing a government official it
didn''t identify. </p>
<p>The bond-market advance pushed down Argentina''s average
yields to 10.8 percent. As recently as Feb. 3, they were as high
as 13.61 percent, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>The Economy Ministry said in a statement on March 30 that
while the government isn''t planning any foreign currency debt
sales in the short term, it has received proposals from
investment banks it didn''t identify. </p>
<p>Different financial entities have presented proposals to
obtain foreign financing at maturities and interest rates in
line with other countries in the region, the ministry said. </p>
<h2>Subsidy Cuts </h2>
<p>Fernandez, hamstrung by a growing fiscal deficit and a
shrinking trade surplus, has authorized her economic team led by
Economy Minister Axel Kicillof to settle decade-old investment
disputes to gain access to fresh financing before the end of her
term late next year. Argentina will begin to cut gas and water
subsidies by 20 percent beginning today. Utility rates have been
largely frozen since 2003 and an increase in gas imports have
drained reserves as domestic output declines. </p>
<p>Given what they''ve been doing in recent days like changes
to subsidies, they''re cognizant of the need to maintain this
change in policy, Marco Santamaria, a money manager at
AllianceBernstein LP, which oversees $25 billion in emerging-market debt, said by phone from New York. </p>
<p>Robert Abad, who helps oversee about $53 billion of
emerging-market debt at Western Asset Management Co., said
Argentina''s legal dispute with creditors who rejected its debt
restructurings will continue to make it difficult for Argentina
to obtain the financing it needs. </p>
<h2>Holdout Litigation </h2>
<p>Creditors led by Elliott Management Corp.''s Paul Singer
have won lower court rulings to be paid in full at the same time
Argentina services its restructured debt. The effects of the
ruling are on hold pending an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
About 93 percent of creditors accepted losses of 70 percent in
the restructurings. Argentina has said paying holdouts in full
could expose it to $43 billion of claims that would lead it to
default again. </p>
<p>They have a lot more work to do, a loan here and a loan
there won''t bring liquidity relief that makes the math
sustainable, Abad said in a telephone interview from Pasadena,
California. This legal issue can create a big dent to what
happens. It''s hard to set the parameters to how much they have
to set aside. </p>
<p>The government has $5.9 billion of bonds due in October
2015. </p>
<p>Argentina obtained $938 million in financing from the
Inter-American Development Bank during meetings on March 29,
Buenos Aires-based newspaper Ambito Financiero reported
yesterday. The government is also in advanced talks with the
World Bank for $3 billion of loans, Cabinet Chief Jorge Capitanich said yesterday. </p>
<h2>High Probability'' </h2>
<p>Argentine bonds will continue to gain, according to
Barclays Plc. Average yields are still double the average in
emerging markets. </p>
<p>Valuations are still attractive, and the market will
continue to rally, Donato Guarino, a strategist at Barclays,
said in a telephone interview from New York. There''s a high
probability that they will get back on the international
market. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) will manage
funds for a Bermuda-based reinsurer that raised $1.13 billion in
capital, concentrating the investments in junk bonds. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Highbridge Principal Strategies LLC will oversee
the assets for Watford Re Ltd., the reinsurer said yesterday in
a statement. Watford said it raised $907 million in common
equity, including a $100 million investment by Arch Capital
Group Ltd., and $226 million in preferred shares. The reinsurer
is targeting an initial public offering in two to three years,
Chief Executive Officer John Rathgeber said in an interview. </p>
<p>The reinsurer''s portfolio will be comprised primarily of
non-investment grade credit assets, which it believes will
generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for its shareholders
over the long term, Watford said. </p>
<p>Money managers including Dan Loeb have started Bermuda-based reinsurers in recent years to raise funds that are less
subject to client withdrawals and can provide tax advantages.
Pine River Capital Management LP, the hedge-fund firm founded by
Brian Taylor, was seeking to raise $500 million to $750 million
for a reinsurance company, a person familiar with the matter
said in February. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, owns Highbridge
through its investment arm, JPMorgan Asset Management.
Highbridge Principal Strategies is led by Chief Executive
Officer Scott Kapnick, who came to the firm in 2007 after 21
years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., where he was global co-head
of investment banking. HPS had about $19 billion of assets under
management as of March, Watford said. </p>
<h2>Casualty Coverage </h2>
<p>Rathgeber was vice chairman of Arch Worldwide Reinsurance
Group. Jon Levy was named chief risk officer and Roderick Romeo
will be chief financial officer. Reinsurers shoulder risk for
primary carriers. </p>
<p>Management is aiming for annualized returns of about 15
percent over time, Rathgeber said. He plans to focus on casualty
lines such as automobile liability, workers'' compensation and
medical malpractice coverage while limiting risks tied to
natural disasters. </p>
<p>It wouldn''t make sense to have this kind of investment
strategy and be heavily into that kind of volatile, capital-intensive reinsurance exposure, he said. </p>
<p>Constantine Iordanou, the CEO of Bermuda-based Arch
Capital, has been diversifying risk through deals including an
agreement last year to add assets from bankrupt mortgage insurer
PMI Group Inc. </p>
<p>Arch slipped 0.8 percent to $57.07 at 10:17 a.m. in New
York, narrowing its gain to about 8.6 percent over the past
year. JPMorgan climbed 0.3 percent and is up 27 percent in the
past 12 months. </p>
<h2>Corporate Debt </h2>
<p>Junk-rated corporate debt worldwide returned 2.9 percent
since Dec. 31, beating global stocks and setting the stage for a
sixth year of gains, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch
index data. The bonds now yield 6.1 percent, compared with an
average of about 10 percent in the decade through 2007. Junk
bonds are high-yield, high-risk debt rated below BBB-by Standard
 Poor''s and lower than Baa3 by Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<p>We believe that non-investment-grade credit complements
Watford''s reinsurance strategy, Purnima Puri, HPS''s managing
director, said in the statement. </p>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan advised on the capital structuring,
and Clifford Chance LLP was Watford''s outside counsel. </p>

<p>Ed Dahlberg got 40 calls in one day when he put a Gulfstream G650 up for sale in February. That''s unusual for a private jet -- especially when the asking price tops the $64.5 million on the sticker. </p> <p>We believe this plane''s going to bring north of $75 million, said Dahlberg, president of Manassas, Virginia-based Emerald Aviation Inc. and part-owner of the G650. </p> <p>Barely 15 months after its debut, the world''s biggest and fastest business jet is a corporate status symbol, with owners as high profile as Exxon Mobil Corp., Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. The waiting list is almost four years long for a factory-fresh model, whetting appetites among tycoons and chief executive officers when a used G650 hits the market. </p> <p>It''s the must-have airplane if you''re in the top end of the spectrum, said Steve Varsano, founder of London-based Jet Business, who''s sold two pre-owned G650s since November for more than $70 million each to buyers he wouldn''t identify. </p> <p>G650s are also must-have for Gulfstream parent General Dynamics Corp., the tank and submarine maker squeezed by shrinking U.S. defense budgets. The jets helped boost 2013 aerospace revenue 17 percent to $8.12 billion, while combat systems unit revenue fell 23 percent to $6.12 billion. </p> <p>The G650 is doing exceptionally well, said Peter Arment, a Sterne, Agee  Leach Inc. analyst who has a buy rating on Falls Church, Virginia-based General Dynamics. The demand for this plane is going to remain very strong. </p> <h2>Transoceanic Routes </h2> <p>Large, luxury aircraft are the bright spot in a $21 billion private-jet market recovering unevenly from the 2008-09 financial crisis. While orders remain weak for small, personal models like the Mustang from Textron Inc.''s Cessna, corporate fleet managers and billionaires are shopping again for big planes able to make transoceanic routes. </p> <p>Qualcomm''s G650 flew round trip between California and Barcelona before February''s Mobile World Congress in the Spanish city, where then-CEO Paul Jacobs collected an industry award. That jaunt, as chronicled by airline-data tracker FlightAware, was well within the jet''s advertised range of 7,000 nautical miles (12,964 kilometers), enough to reach Beijing from New York without refueling. </p> <p>Propelled by Rolls-Royce engines tucked on either side of the rear of the fuselage, the G650 can reach 627 miles an hour at 30,000 feet (9,100 meters), about 93 percent of the speed of sound. It seats as many as 18 people. To ease jet lag, the cabin air pressure is kept higher than on typical airplanes. </p> <h2>Engine Whisper </h2> <p>On a recent flight from Phoenix on a G650 owned by Honeywell International Inc., takeoff thrust pressed passengers into soft leather seats as the engines whispered. </p> <p>Wood-veneer tables popped out at the touch of a button. Entertainment options included watching satellite television from a seat-belted sofa or gazing out the windows -- billed as the largest on a business jet and fitted with powered shades -- at the red sandstone cliffs of Sedona, Arizona. </p> <p>It''s just unbelievably capable and unbelievably reliable, Honeywell pilot Andy Eldringhoff said as he guided the plane above the Arizona desert at 16,500 feet. CEO Dave Cote is among the users of the jet, which has Honeywell avionics in the cockpit. </p> <p>With more than 50 delivered so far, the G650 has reset the market for business aircraft designed for maximum speed, comfort and distance. There won''t be a competitor in the G650''s class until 2016, when Bombardier Inc.''s Global 7000 is due for its initial handover. </p> <h2>Exclusive Aura </h2> <p>Gulfstream enhances the aura of exclusivity by refusing to let buyers leapfrog by swapping or buying delivery slots, as occurs with commercial jets. The Savannah, Georgia-based company wrote a clause that strictly prohibits contract holders from selling their spots, said Steve Cass, a spokesman. </p> <p>There is no cutting in line, Cass said. Everyone that we deal with is pretty important folks. Once you go down that, it''s a pretty slippery slope. You just don''t want to go there. </p> <p>Gulfstream started taking G650 orders in March 2008 -- six months before the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. bankruptcy triggered a global credit freeze -- and customers stampeded to put down about $3 million and sign purchase contracts, said Jet Business''s Varsano. </p> <p>While Cass said the G650 order book held up during the economic crisis, flight trials were marred by a 2011 crash in New Mexico that killed four Gulfstream employees. U.S. safety officials concluded in 2012 that company pressure to speed up testing caused the accident. Gulfstream President Larry Flynn responded that any failings by the planemaker were inadvertent. </p> <p>Most Profitable? </p> <p>The G650 may become Gulfstream''s most profitable aircraft ever, General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic told investors on Feb. 20 at a Barclays Plc conference. The jet uses 50 percent fewer parts than the smaller G550 and G450 and is assembled at a plant designed for the G650, according to Gulfstream. </p> <p>We don''t know internally how good we can get, but we know we can get a whole lot better, Novakovic said of the plane''s profitability. </p> <p>General Dynamics soared 54 percent to $108.92 in the 12 months ended yesterday, topping the 19 percent gain for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. Montreal-based Bombardier rose 2 percent in the same period. </p> <p>Buyers'' silence about the G650 contrasts with the demand. Corporate touchiness about jet ownership only intensified after U.S. automaker CEOs drew criticism for flying company aircraft to Washington in 2008 to beg Congress for an industry bailout. </p> <h2>Owners'' Silence </h2> <p>Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, confirmed that the Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer has a G650 while declining to discuss details. Emily Kilpatrick, a spokeswoman for San Diego-based Qualcomm, and Scott Silvestri, a spokesman for Irving, Texas-based Exxon, declined to comment when asked about the G650s registered to the companies at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. </p> <p>A G650 registered to Dick''s Sporting Goods Inc. was sold in February, according to FAA records that didn''t list the buyer or the terms. The Coraopolis, Pennsylvania-based company didn''t respond to messages requesting comment on the transaction. </p> <p>Gulfstream is famous for secrecy about what''s on the drawing board, and General Dynamics'' Novakovic said the next jets won''t be unveiled until they''re ready to roll out on the tarmac under their own power. </p> <p>Jefferies LLC analyst Howard Rubel said a redo of the G550, the previous flagship, may be under consideration. Jet Business''s Varsano said buyers want other the Gulfstream models to get cabins like the G650''s. Dahlberg, the Virginia broker, said the G650 itself could be modified to extend its range. </p> <p>Gulfstream really hit a home run with the product, said Josh Mesinger, vice president of Mesinger Jet Sales in Boulder, Colorado. There is no other product in the world in service that will fly 7,000 miles. </p> <p>Mesinger was the broker that offered the G650 registered to Dick''s, with an asking price of $73.5 million, according to an online posting. </p> <p>It sold the day the ad appeared. </p> <p> ', 'Exxon to Wal-Mart Flying G650 Turn Jet Into Status Symbol', 'By Thomas Black', 'Apr 01, 2014 12:01 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-01/exxon-to-wal-mart-flying-g650-turn-jet-into-status-symbol.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Microsoft Corp. renewed its push to catch up with Apple Inc. and Google Inc. in mobile devices, unveiling updated Windows Phone software with voice-search features and offering it for free for small phones and tablets. </p> <p>Microsoft, which previously required a licensing fee for Windows, will offer it without charge for handsets and tablets with screens of less than nine inches, Microsoft operating systems chief Terry Myerson said at the company''s Build conference for developers in San Francisco today. Microsoft also showed off a voice-controlled digital assistant called Cortana that is similar to Apple''s Siri, which is part of a new Windows Phone 8.1 software for mobile gadgets. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who was appointed to lead the world''s largest software maker in February, is working to remake Microsoft for an era where smartphones and tablets have become central. To do so, he must strike a balance between offering Microsoft''s software for competing platforms while still keeping the company''s Windows operating system as a core focus. Today''s event was designed to re-emphasize the importance of Windows to the Redmond, Washington-based company and to spur adoption of the software. </p> <p>Related:</p>
Apple''s Maestri Takes Top Finance Role Amid Cash Scrutiny
Atop the Electronics World, Samsung Now Chasing Innovation
<p>Reinvigorating the Windows franchise continues to be a key ingredient in Microsoft''s recipe for success as it looks to offset headwinds from the secular challenges in the PC market, Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co., wrote in a note. </p> <h2>Delicate Balance </h2> <p>Nadella''s tricky balancing act was underscored by two Microsoft events last week and this week. The CEO last week debuted Microsoft Office software for Apple''s iPads and said he''ll hold nothing back to get the company''s programs across all devices, in a clear departure from the software maker''s longtime focus on Windows. </p> <p>In contrast, this week''s Build conference puts Windows front-and-center by giving developers tools and tactics to boost Microsoft''s single-digit share in phones and tablets, as well as providing money-making opportunities in a contracting personal-computer market. </p> <p>We''re going to innovate with a challenger mindset, Nadella said at the event. </p> <p>In making Windows free for smaller phones and tablets, Microsoft is working to narrow the gap with Google, which distributes its Android mobile operating system to hardware manufacturers at no cost. Android has become the most widely used software in smartphones and tablets. </p> <h2>Start Menu </h2> <p>Myerson also said the company is restoring the Windows start menu, which will be made available to users as an update. The company yanked the feature from Windows 8, triggering customer complaints. Microsoft also showed Office applications for Windows that are redesigned for use with touch controls, one week after showing similar apps for Office for the iPad. </p> <p>Microsoft Vice President Joe Belfiore said the new Windows Phone 8.1 will have an action center, which is a pull-down menu that gives people access to basic functions regardless of whether programs are already open. The software, which will start rolling out in the next few months on existing phones and on new devices later this month and in early May, also lets users customize their phone''s lock screen and offers new choices for tweaking the start screen. </p> <h2>Cortana Speaks </h2> <p>Cortana, which fully replaces the search function on Windows Phone, according to Belfiore, is named for the artificial-intelligence character in Microsoft''s best-selling Halo Xbox video-game series. </p> <p>Developers outside Microsoft can write their own apps for Cortana, Belfiore said. With users'' permission, Cortana can learn about consumers from their searches, keep track of people they interact with and set up an inner circle of the most important people and who can contact users during the times of day they set as quiet hours. </p> <p>Belfiore demonstrated how he allowed Cortana to scan his e-mail, causing the program to ask him whether to track an Alaska Airlines flight mentioned in an e-mail itinerary. The program can be used to start a Skype call, add a TV show to the user''s Hulu queue or check a friend''s Facebook posts. </p> <p>She''s great at helping me get things done, whether its by talking or typing, Belfiore said. </p> <h2>Windows Share </h2> <p>Nokia Oyj''s handset division, which is being acquired by Microsoft in a deal set to close this month, will begin selling new phones using Windows Phone 8.1, said former Nokia CEO Stephen Elop. The 930 is a high-end device that will debut in June and feature wireless charging, while two cheaper phones designed for emerging markets will become available in May, said Elop, who will become Microsoft''s executive vice president of the devices group when the transaction with Nokia is completed. </p> <p>Windows stands to be the fastest-growing smartphone operating system over the next four years with 30 percent annual growth, according to a Feb. 26 report by researcher IDC. Even at that rate, Windows Phone would only make up 7 percent of the total market in 2018, compared with Google''s Android software at 76 percent Apple''s iOS at 14 percent. </p> <p>In tablets, Windows had 3.4 percent share in 2013, IDC said. For Microsoft''s Surface tablet, the share was 1 percent. </p> <p>Global computer shipments fell a record 10 percent last year and are forecast to continue to decline this year as tablets and smartphones lure consumers away from traditional desktop and notebook designs, according to IDC. Tablet sales volume -- dominated by Apple and Google, whose operating systems account for 95 percent of that market -- will rise an average 16 percent annually through to 2017. </p> <p>One possible boon to Windows developers: Microsoft is working on obtaining tools, via acquisition or development, to make it easier for application developers to target multiple operating systems without having to rewrite software. The company is considering an acquisition or investment in Xamarin Inc., or other companies that enable mobile apps to run on different devices, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. Microsoft may also build those capabilities itself, one of the people said. </p> <p> ', 'Microsoft Unveils Phone Software With Rival to Apple''s Siri', 'By Dina Bass and Ian King', 'Apr 02, 2014  2:48 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-04-02/microsoft-unveils-new-phone-software-with-rival-to-apple-s-siri.html') LIMIT 1;

screens of less than nine inches, in a move to spur adoption of
the software. </p>
<p>The world''s largest software company has historically made
Windows available to hardware makers for a licensing fee. That
has put Microsoft at a disadvantage to Google Inc. (GOOG)''s Android
mobile operating system, which is offered for free to device
manufacturers such as Samsung Electronics Co. and which has
become the most widely used software in smartphones and tablets. </p>
<p>Microsoft made the announcement at its Build developer
conference in San Francisco where it also showed off its new
Windows Phone 8.1 mobile software with a voice-search feature
called Cortana. </p>
<p>Windows stands to be the fastest-growing smartphone
operating system over the next four years with 30 percent annual
growth, according to a Feb. 26 report by researcher IDC. Even at
that rate, Windows Phone would only make up 7 percent of the
total market in 2018, compared with Google''s Android software at
76 percent and Apple''s iOS at 14 percent. </p>
<p>In tablets, Windows had 3.4 percent share in 2013, IDC
said. For Microsoft''s Surface tablet, the share was 1 percent. </p>

government''s tender for Adriatic Sea oil and gas exploration. </p>
<p>Enel SpA (ENEL), Hellenic Petroleum SA (ELPE), Petroceltic International
Plc (PCI), Turkish Petroleum Corp., Hunt Oil Co. and Croatia''s INA
Industrija Nafte d.d. were also present in Zagreb as tenders
went out for 29 exploration blocks of Adriatic seabed, according
to Economy Ministry spokesman Tomislav Cerovec. </p>
<p>Croatia, which is seeking new revenue to revive its
economy, will close the tenders on Nov. 3. The terms are based
on a production-sharing agreement model with a five-year
exploration phase and a 25-year production phase. </p>
<p>We have a great interest, Economy Minister Ivan Vrdoljak told reporters in Zagreb. A successful tender will
make Croatia a key gas and oil provider in this part of Europe,
and our gas will be the cheapest in the region. </p>
<p>Croatia, which joined the European Union in July, needs
investment to revive growth after five years of economic
recession. The country revised laws on hydrocarbon research in
June, easing the process for gaining permits to tap more of its
own resources and reduce dependence on Russian gas. </p>
<h2>EU Financing </h2>
<p>Croatia may also seek EU financing for a planned liquefied-natural-gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk, Vrdoljak
told Bloomberg News today. A location permit for the terminal
will probably be issued in June, he said. </p>
<p>INA is very interested in the tender, and may take part
in it alone or with a partner, Zoltan Aldott, head of the
management board at INA, told Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The blocks were drawn up after Norwegian seismic-data
company Spectrum ASA (SPU) completed the imaging of 35,000 square
kilometers (13,500 square miles) of Croatia''s seabed last year. </p>
<p>Croatia may hold as much oil and gas in the Adriatic Sea as
Italy does in the same branch of the Mediterranean,Vrdoljak
said on Oct. 29, citing initial results of the seismic mapping. </p>
<p>INA, Croatia''s largest refiner, operates offshore platforms
in the northern Adriatic with Edison SpA and Eni. Zagreb-based
INA, controlled by Hungary''s Mol Nyrt., has so far had a
monopoly on exploration in Croatia. </p>

<p>The South Asian country''s currency gained 3.1 percent to

its biggest quarterly advance since September 2012. The currency
strengthened because India raised interest rates and changed

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will move its San
Francisco offices to the city''s largest tower as it relocates to
the heart of the financial district from the technology-heavy
South of Market area. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest software maker will move in December to
Vornado Realty Trust (VNO)''s 555 California St., San Francisco''s
largest building by square footage and second-tallest, said
Peter Wootton, a spokesman for Redmond, Washington-based
Microsoft. He wouldn''t comment further on the relocation plans. </p>
<p>San Francisco is the center of the U.S. new economy
after four years of sustained rent growth, according to
property-research firm Green Street Advisors Inc. Office rents
rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier to
$57.21 a square foot on average, with vacancies little changed
at 11.3 percent, brokerage Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. (JLL) said. Asking
rents have climbed 70 percent since 2010, when rates bottomed at
$33.57 a square foot. </p>
<p>Microsoft had the ability to go anywhere in the city,
David Greenbaum, president of Vornado''s New York office
division, said today in a telephone interview. The 555
California building is incredibly iconic both in San Francisco
and the country. </p>
<p>Microsoft will occupy about 50,000 square feet (4,600
square meters) on the second and third floors, said a person
with knowledge of the plans. Rent will be about $62 a square
foot for the two floors, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. </p>
<h2>Street View </h2>
<p>Greenbaum declined to comment on financial terms. He said
the tower''s second floor has 27-foot (8-meter) ceilings,
allowing Microsoft to establish a unique presence visible from
the street. </p>
<p>Asking rates in San Francisco''s north financial district
averaged $58 a square foot in the first quarter, up 7.8 percent
from a year earlier, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Microsoft''s Yammer Inc. unit, with 76,000 square feet in Twitter
Inc.''s headquarters building in the Central Market area, won''t
be affected by the parent company''s move, the person with
knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>The 52-story tower between Montgomery and Kearny streets
has 1.5 million square feet of office space and 45,000 square
feet of retail, according to Vornado''s website. At 779 feet, the
building is surpassed in San Francisco only by the 853-foot
Transamerica Pyramid, according to property website Emporis.com. </p>
<p>The California Street high-rise, opened in 1969, is the
main building in a complex that was known as Bank of America

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the largest
U.S. lender, agreed to sell its large-market 401(k)
recordkeeping business to a division of Canadian life insurer
Great-West Lifeco (GWO) Inc. Terms of the transaction weren''t
disclosed. </p>
<p>The deal will make Great-West the second-largest
recordkeeper of 401(k)-type retirement plans by participants,
serving 6.8 million workers with a combined $387 billion in
assets, the company said today in a statement from Winnipeg,
Canada. The largest provider of retirement recordkeeping
services, which include sending out account statements and other
communications to participants, is Boston-based Fidelity
Investments. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, whose recordkeeping business lags behind those of
firms such as Fidelity, Vanguard Group Inc. and Prudential
Financial Inc., is selling its unit as recordkeeping for
workers'' retirement accounts has become less lucrative for firms
that don''t have scale. The deal will catapult Great-West from
the seventh-largest recordkeeper of 401(k)-type plans by assets
in 2012, according to research firm Cerulli Associates, allowing
it to compete with the biggest firms. </p>

market leader, said Robert Reynolds, who was named last month
as president and chief executive officer of Great-West Lifeco
U.S., which owns Great-West Financial and Putnam Investments.
You can make money in this business. </p>
<h2>Top Priorities'' </h2>
<p>The sale is a shift for New York-based JPMorgan, whose head
of retirement, Michael Falcon, said in March 2011 that getting a
bigger share of retirement assets was one of the top
priorities at the bank. JPMorgan at the time had roughly
doubled its sales force dedicated to retirement plans including
pitches for its recordkeeping services. </p>
<p>It''s not easy to see anything like this, Falcon, head
of retirement at JPMorgan''s asset-management unit, said in an
interview today. </p>
<p>JPMorgan will continue to sell investments to retirement
plans, Falcon said. </p>
<p>It''s a large and growing business on the investment
side, he said. </p>
<p>Americans held $23 trillion in retirement assets as of Dec.
31, of which $4.2 trillion was in 401(k) plans. Administrators
of 401(k)s are paid for their recordkeeping service also may
make money from investments in the plan if they are managed by
their own firm or through arrangements with other money managers
known as revenue-sharing. </p>
<h2>Cross-Selling </h2>
<p>Many recordkeepers also see the administration of 401(k)
accounts as an avenue for cross-selling other products to
workers such as individual retirement accounts when they retire
or change jobs. Those accounts usually have higher fees,
according to a 2011 report by the Government Accountability
Office. </p>
<p>The proliferation of lower-fee products and more cost-conscious employers have contributed to declining expenses for
401(k) investments over the past 15 years, data compiled by the
Washington-based Investment Company Institute show. </p>
<p>The transaction is expected to close during the third
quarter of this year pending regulatory approval. More than
1,000 employees of JPMorgan''s retirement-services unit will move
to Great-West. </p>
<p>The deal won''t have a material impact on JPMorgan Chase''s
earnings, according to the bank''s statement. The two companies
said workers with accounts administered by JPMorgan should
expect no disruption. </p>

percent from 51 percent on March 11, according to a regulatory
disclosure on the insurer''s website. The U.S. added Bank Rossiya

sanctions list on March 20 following Russia''s annexation of
Crimea. </p>

<p>Experimental breast cancer drugs from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and Eli Lilly  Co. (LLY) slowed or halted growth of advanced tumors in studies, potentially adding a new treatment option for patients and top-selling therapies for the companies. </p> <p>Pfizer''s palbociclib doubled to 20.2 months the time in which patients'' advanced breast cancer didn''t progress, the drugmaker said today. In an unrelated study, Lilly''s drug, bemaciclib, aided 61 percent of patients with metastatic, hormone-sensitive breast cancer, meaning the size of their tumors shrunk by 30 percent or didn''t increase for 24 weeks. </p> <p>Doctors and investors have been awaiting results for the medicines, part of a class called cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors. The therapies offer a new treatment avenue for about 80 percent of patients whose breast tumors are hormone receptor-positive. Palbociclib is projected to sell $3.11 billion in 2020 as it expands to fight other cancers. </p> <p>We took a new drug and asked how it works in a specific set of breast cancers based on science, said Richard Finn, an associate professor at the University of California at Los Angeles''s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, and co-principal investigator of Pfizer''s study. This is really the type of benefit we''re aiming for, and it''s the type of benefit that results from a rational development program. </p>

<p>Disney Enterprises Inc., Warner
Bros. Entertainment Inc. and four other movie studios accused
the closed file-sharing service Megaupload.com of massive theft
of intellectual property in a copyright-infringement lawsuit. </p>
<p>While billing itself as a private data storage provider,
Megaupload.com functioned as a hub for uploading and downloading
copyrighted movies and TV shows, according to the complaint
filed today in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, which
names Megaupload Ltd., the owner of the Megaupload.com website,
company founder Kim Dotcom, a second company and two other
individuals as defendants. </p>
<p>Dotcom was accused in an indictment unsealed in January
2012 of belonging to a global criminal organization prosecutors
called Mega Conspiracy that was involved in copyright
infringement and money laundering and generated more than $175
million in illicit proceeds. </p>
<p>When Megaupload.com was shut down in 2012 by U.S. law
enforcement, it was by all estimates the largest and most active
infringing website targeting creative content in the world,
Steven Fabrizio, senior executive vice president and global
general counsel of the Motion Picture Association of America,
said in today in a statement. </p>
<p>Megaupload.com had a business model designed to encourage
theft -- and make its owners very rich in the process,
Fabrizio said. </p>
<h2>Bogus'' Claims </h2>
<p>The @MPAA repeats bogus DOJ claims that we induced
copyright infringement. No. 1 reward rule published on MU site:
No copyright infringement,'' according to a post on Kim
Dotcom''s Twitter feed. </p>
<p>The studios'' lawsuit is a meritless re-hash of issues
raised in the criminal case, Ira Rothken, Dotcom''s San Rafael,
California-based attorney, said in a phone interview. We will
vigorously defend against the claims, he said. </p>
<p>Megaupload.com built up its library of illicit offerings by
encouraging users to upload movies and other entertainment
through an Uploader Rewards program. Amounts paid through
the program were based on how often pirated material was
downloaded for viewing by others, according to the studios''
complaint. </p>
<p>Megaupload.com made money by charging subscriptions
enabling faster downloads and by selling advertising on the
heavily trafficked website, the movie makers said in the filing. </p>
<h2>Rewards Program </h2>
<p>Rothken said the rewards program was limited to files that
are far too small to transmit movies. The studios'' assertion the
rewards program encouraged copyright infringement wouldn''t
pass the giggle test, he said. </p>
<p>Dotcom and two others named in the complaint, Mathias
Ortman, a German citizen, and Bram van der Kolk, a Dutch
citizen, are fighting extradition from New Zealand, according to
Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman. </p>
<p>Ortman and van der Kolk provided technological expertise to
Megaupload and are part-owners of it, according to the suit. </p>
<p>In February, a New Zealand appeals court ruled that search
warrants used in a 2012 raid on Dotcom''s home were valid,
bolstering the U.S. effort to extradite him. </p>
<p>The suit also names Vester Ltd., a Hong Kong company of
which Dotcom is the sole shareholder. Vester is majority
shareholder of Megaupload Ltd. </p>
<p>Besides the unit of Burbank, California-based Walt Disney (DIS)
Co., plaintiffs in the case include Paramount Pictures Corp.,
Universal City Studios Productions LLLP, Columbia Pictures
Industries Inc. and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. </p>
<p>The case is Twentieth Century Fox v. Megaupload.com, 14-cv-362, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Virginia
(Alexandria). </p>

<p>Greece tapped JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)

seeks a return to the capital markets, according to people with

worst jobless rate in the euro area attempts to sell bonds for
the first time since being shut out in early 2010, said the
people, who asked not to be identified, citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly. </p>
<p>Greece''s Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras suggested last
week that the government would issue notes in the first half of
2014. </p>
<p>Growing confidence among officials on the prospect of
selling debt has risen as bond yields have fallen to a four-year
low. Their optimism rests on the premise of persuading investors
that Greece will shake off a six-year recession. </p>
<p>The yield on Greek 10-year bonds has dropped below 6.2
percent from more than 30 percent in 2012. Greek securities have
returned 31 percent this year, the best performance among the 34
sovereign debt markets tracked by the Bloomberg World Bond
Indexes. </p>
<p>Germany has welcomed the planned bond sale as evidence that
confidence of the financial markets is returning to Greece,
Nadine Kalwey, a spokeswoman for Germany''s Finance Ministry,
said yesterday. </p>

budget surplus before interest costs of almost 3 billion euros

<p> JPMorgan Chase  Co. and the U.K.''s
Department for International Development will contribute a
combined $20 million to a private-equity fund investing in
startup businesses operating in East Africa. </p>
<p>DFID''s Impact Fund, which is managed by CDC Group, a
development finance institution owned by the U.K. government,
will provide $15 million to Novastar Ventures and JPMorgan the
rest, the companies said today in an e-mailed statement. The
money will finance health care, education, housing, energy and
sanitation projects that are expected to reach as many as 2
million people over the next decade, they said. </p>
<p>Private sector capital is crucial to economic growth in
East Africa, Peter Scher, head of corporate responsibility at
JPMorgan Chase, said in an e-mailed reply to questions. There
is a recognition that governmental and aid organizations cannot
do this alone. </p>
<p>Investors should accelerate investments to build
infrastructure in Africa and form public-private partnerships
that will help improve economic and social conditions, Kenyan
President Uhuru Kenyatta said on April 2. </p>
<p>It marks the first investment released from the 75 million-pound ($124 million) Impact Fund announced by the U.K. in 2012
to provide capital to companies and programs that will generate
returns in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. </p>
<h2>Social Good </h2>
<p>Novastar is focusing its investments on early-stage
businesses that offer massive social benefits to low-income
households, Managing Director Steve Beck said on April 5 by
phone from Nairobi, the Kenyan capital. </p>
<p>Novastar will accelerate the existing investment program
of SpringHill Equity Partners, an informal investor circle that
has been making venture investments in East Africa, Beck said. </p>
<p>Novastar in March made its initial investment in Bridge
International Academies, which has built more than 250 schools
in Kenya, according to the statement. The Nairobi-based chain of
nursery and primary schools charges students an average of $5 a
month, according to its website. </p>
<p>Market-based approaches, along with interested investors,
can attract the private sector capital necessary to create
change, Scher said. </p>
<p>Private equity funds invested more than three times as much
in sub-Saharan Africa last year as they did in 2012 as the
number of deals during the period rose to 84 from 58, according
to the 2014 East Africa Private Equity Confidence Survey
released by Deloitte. In East Africa, the number of deals in
Kenya last year was 12, five in Rwanda, and three each in Uganda

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) says now
may be a good time to cut holdings of Chinese high-yield bonds
after the longest winning streak in six weeks. </p>
<p>Investors should use the recent rally to reduce
overweight positions, analysts led by Hong Kong-based Kenneth Ho wrote in a note dated April 4. We believe that there will
be more headlines noises to come out of China and expect to see
further credit differentiation. </p>
<p>Dollar-denominated junk bonds from the nation gained 0.95
percent in the seven days through April 4 for the second
straight weekly advance, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes. While recent improvement in emerging-market
sentiment and China''s announcement of stimulus last week fueled
the rally, better-quality issuers remain Goldman''s preferred bet
amid continued concern about the world''s second-biggest economy,
according to the note. </p>
<p>China unveiled a package of measures to support the economy
including railway investment and tax breaks last week, as the
government seeks to bolster slowing growth. Exports (CNFREXPY) likely rose
4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, according to the
median estimate of 37 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News before
trade data this week, after the biggest drop since 2009 in
February. Manufacturing contracted a third month in March, an
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics gauge showed last week. </p>

issuer in a decade, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China Citic
Bank International Ltd. meets investors from today about a
possible offering of notes in the U.S. currency, a person
familiar with the matter said last week. </p>
<p>We expect China issuance to increase and to catch up in
the remaining quarters, especially given the improvement in
market sentiment in recent weeks, wrote Ho. Offerings from the
nation slumped to $12.7 billion in the first three months of the
year, from $15.1 billion during the same period last year,
according to Goldman data. </p>

quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated market. </p>
<p>The Markit iTraxx Australia index slipped 0.5 basis point
to 97.5 basis points as of 9:35 a.m. in Sydney, according to

<p>Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s David Kostin has some good news, and some bad news. </p> <p>First, the bad news. There''s a good chance the U.S. stock market will see a 10 percent drop sometime during the next 12 months. Well, as far as precision goes, good chance is not good enough for a quant like Kostin, so he gives an exact probability: 67 percent odds of a 10 percent retreat from a peak in the next 12 months. </p> <p>Though quant work can be complicated, his rationale is actually quite simple -- the market has gone way too long without a so-called correction, or a drop of at least 10 percent from a peak. The biggest declines from highs this year and last year were about 6 percent, and it''s been 22 months since the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) saw a 10 percent drop. Mix in a little fancy math, and Kostin ends up with 67 percent odds we''ll see a correction in the next 12 months. </p> <p>Now for the good news, if you can call it that: He still expects the market to end the year higher, though not by much. Kostin is sticking with his year-end SP 500 forecast of 1,900, according to a note to clients dated yesterday. That implies a gain of less than 2.8 percent for the year and less than 3 percent from yesterday''s close. In other words, a relatively flat market given the ferocity of the gains seen in this bull run. </p> <p>Next year will be better in Kostin''s view, with a gain of 11 percent to 2,100 from his 2014 forecast. The SP 500 will add another 4.8 percent on top of that to 2,200 in 2016, he predicts. </p> <h2>Ho Hum </h2> <p>Since the beginning of the year, Wall Street strategists have held firm to forecasts for a ho-hum market this year following last year''s 30 percent rally in the SP 500. The average projection on Jan. 3 called for a 5.8 percent gain to 1,955 in 2014, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. By April 1, the mean forecast had only moved up six points to 1,961. </p> <p>It''s important to note in here that these oracles sort of missed the boat last year. The average estimate on Jan. 2, 2013, called for a 7.6 percent gain by the end of the year, while the SP 500 ended up jumping 30 percent to 1,848.36. Citigroup Inc.''s Tobias Levkovich was closest at 1,615, still more than 200 points off. Kostin forecast a 2013 close of 1,575, almost 300 points off. </p> <p>So if Wall Street strategists were meteorologists, last year they called for a few inches of snow and the market ended up getting a blizzard. This year, they''re calling for a dusting and so far they haven''t been too far off -- no accumulation. </p> <p> ', 'Goldman Strategist Sees High Chance of 10% Market Drop', 'By Michael P.

<p>Coal producers may need to cut
exports of the steel-making variety after the lowest contract
settlement with Asian buyers in seven years made more than half
of global shipments uneconomical, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>About 157 million metric tons, or 60 percent, of exports
from countries such as Australia and the U.S. will be shipped at
a loss under the second-quarter contract agreed at $120 a ton,
Joel Crane, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in Melbourne, said in a
note today. The bank cut its 2014 and 2015 estimates for prices
of coking coal, used to make steel, and the thermal variety. </p>
<p>Asian steelmakers are paying a record low for hard coking
coal contracts on a quarterly basis while utilities in Japan
have agreed to the lowest annual supply deal in five years as a
glut crimps prices. About 13 percent of thermal exports are
uneconomic under the Japanese deal of $81.80 a ton, said Morgan
Stanley, which cut its 2014 spot forecast 9 percent to $77 a ton
and its 2015 estimate by 5 percent to $85 a ton. </p>
<p>A growing share of the seaborne supply community is
operating at negative margins to cash cost, a consequence of
committed development prior to the sustained price slump,
Crane wrote, referring to thermal coal. Recovery likely
requires a supply response. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley cut its 2014 coking coal estimate by 12
percent to $131 a ton and its 2015 projection by 4 percent to
$165 a ton. Spot prices fell 11 percent to $113 a ton in March,
data from Energy Publishing Inc. shows. </p>
<h2>Coal Contracts </h2>
<p>Metallurgical-coal suppliers traditionally held annual
talks with steelmakers to fix benchmark contracts for the 12
months from April 1, the start of the Japanese financial year.
They changed to quarterly accords in 2010. Prices were settled
at $98 a ton in 2007. </p>
<p>Thermal coal at Australia''s Newcastle port, an Asian
benchmark price, was at $73.52 a ton in the week ended April 4,
according to globalCOAL, a London-based data provider. Prices
slid 4 percent in March for a third monthly decline. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley increased its estimate of a glut in the
thermal market this year to 37 million tons, from a January
projection of 4.9 million. </p>
<p>The bank also trimmed its 2014 price forecast for uranium
by 4 percent to $38.84 a pound and its 2015 estimate by 5
percent to $45.50 a pound. The restart of reactors in Japan will
remove uncertainty surrounding a supply overhang in the nation,
Crane said. </p>

Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban''s re-election means
unpredictable policies that risk weighing on growth, as the
nation''s bonds suffer East Europe''s worst returns after Russia. </p>
<p>Government bonds lost 1.6 percent this year in dollar
terms, while the Bloomberg Emerging Market Local Sovereign Index
gained 1.6 percent. The forint weakened as much as 0.6 percent
from a two-month high and bonds dropped yesterday after Orban''s
Fidesz party won 67 percent of the seats in parliament in an
April 6 vote, according to preliminary results. </p>
<p>While Orban cut the biggest debt burden among former
communist European Union members, he roiled investor sentiment
in his last term by appropriating $13 billion of pension assets,
saddling banks with mortgage losses and driving out foreign-owned utilities. His unpredictable style of policymaking
will last as his past policies weigh on Hungary''s growth
prospects, Magdalena Polan, a London-based economist at
Goldman Sachs, said by e-mail April 6. </p>
<p>Fidesz won''t really have an incentive to change its
economic policy after this victory, Zsolt Kondrat, head of
research at MKB Bank Zrt., a unit of Bayerische Landesbank, said
by phone from Budapest yesterday. And unless it does, there
won''t be much of a sustained gain in the forint or a drop in
yields. </p>
<h2>Unambiguous'' Mandate </h2>
<p>MKB expects Hungary''s 10-year forint bond yield to rise to
6.2 percent by the end of the year from a close of 5.66 percent
yesterday and an average of 5.85 percent in the past 12 months. </p>
<p>Fidesz secured an unambiguous mandate to continue the
policy course it started four years ago, Orban said in Budapest
yesterday. The Economy Ministry declined to respond to e-mailed
questions regarding the government''s future policy. </p>
<p>Hungarian stocks underperformed peers in emerging markets
during Orban''s first term as his government changed the
constitution, levied extraordinary taxes on industries from
banks to telecommunications providers, and rejected concern over
the erosion of democracy as lobbying for foreign interests. The
BUX index tumbled 29 percent in the past four years compared
with a 3.2 percent retreat in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. </p>
<h2>Riskless Returns </h2>
<p>While gains of 39 percent on forint-denominated debt were
the best among the three major eastern European countries since
Orban took office in May 2010, those returns shrunk to a region-worst 6.6 percent when adjusted for price fluctuations,
according to the Bloomberg riskless return ranking. Polish debt
handed investors 9.4 percent and Czech securities 7.2 percent in
a risk-adjusted ranking of indexes from the European Federation
of Financial Analysts Societies in the period through the end of
last week. </p>
<p>Orban''s cabinet will continue to hold an unprecedented
degree of control over the direction of economic policies,
Goldman''s Polan wrote. The government will press on with its
plans to extend the state''s control over the economy. </p>
<p>The premier has used the proceeds from the pension takeover
and industry taxes to keep the budget deficit below the EU
ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic product since 2011. GDP
grew 1.1 percent last year after contracting in 2012. Industrial
production increased 8.1 percent in February from a year
earlier, the biggest jump in three years, statistics office data
showed today. </p>
<p>Hungary''s Eurobonds are attractive as the economy picks up
and the yields exceed peers such as Romania, Gyula Toth, who
oversees $550 million of assets as a money manager at Ithuba
Gapital AG in Vienna, said by e-mail yesterday. </p>
<h2>Extra Yield </h2>
<p>The premium investors demand to hold Hungary''s dollar bonds
over Treasuries widened two basis points to 266 today, compared
with 198 for Romania, according to indexes from JPMorgan Chase 
Co. The forint strengthened 0.3 percent to 305.7 per euro by
9:31 a.m. in Budapest while yields on the government''s 10-year
local-currency debt fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 5.61 percent. </p>
<p>Hungary''s public debt burden fell to about 78 percent of
GDP last year from 82 percent in 2010, data from the European
Commission show. The country''s current-account surplus also
reached a record 2.9 billion euros in 2013, the central bank
said March 31. </p>
<p>While Orban''s policies helped reduce Hungary''s budget gap,
domestic yields fell too low after 20 consecutive months of cuts
in the benchmark interest rate to a record 2.6 percent,
according to Lutz Roehmeyer, a money manager at Berlin-based LBB
Invest overseeing $1.1 billion of developing-nation debt. </p>
<h2>Too Low'' </h2>
<p>Interest rates in Hungary are too low and politically
influenced by the new setup of the central bank, he said by e-mail yesterday. It doesn''t pay to go into Hungarian risk,
said Roehmeyer, who has an underweight position on the country. </p>
<p>Gyorgy Matolcsy, the central bank''s president, was the
architect of much of Orban''s self-styled unorthodox policies
as the economy minister until March 2013. </p>
<p>The election gave an opposition alliance headed by the
Socialist Party 19 percent of the parliament seats, while the
Jobbik party, which wants a referendum on EU membership, secured
12 percent. Jobbik''s showing may embolden Fidesz to pursue
similar or even more drastic policies than it did in its last
term, Nora Szentivanyi, a London-based economist at JPMorgan,
said in an e-mailed report yesterday. </p>
<p>Potential for renewed confrontation with the EU and
increasingly nationalistic rhetoric are risks worth watching,
Szentivanyi wrote. </p>

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s third-largest oil company, signed an accord with Argentina''s YPF SA to
invest $1.6 billion this year in shale development and become
the country''s largest foreign producer of shale oil and natural
gas. </p>
<p>Chevron and state-run YPF plan to drill 170 wells in a
96,000-acre area this year in Argentina''s Vaca Muerta formation,
the world''s second-largest shale gas deposit and fourth-largest
shale oil reservoir, both companies said today in separate
statements. </p>
<p>Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner''s
government expropriated a 51 percent stake in YPF from Spain''s
Repsol SA (REP) in April 2012 after saying the Spanish oil company
hadn''t invested enough in exploration. Repsol''s board agreed in
February to accept $5 billion in compensation for Argentina''s
expropriation of the unit. Ending the two-year international
dispute may help attract investors to the country. </p>
<p>This is a significant step in our subsidiaries'' joint
efforts with YPF to develop one of the most exciting shale plays
in the world today, Chevron Vice Chairman George Kirkland said
in the company''s statement. Vaca Muerta could become an
important contributor to Chevron''s long-term production
growth. </p>
<h2>Pilot Investment </h2>
<p>The latest investment follows an initial $1.24 billion
pilot investment financed by Chevron and paves the way for a
total plan of $15 billion. The joint venture partners are
targeting daily output of 50,000 barrels of shale oil and 3
million cubic meters of shale gas by drilling 1,500 wells. </p>
<p>Vaca Muerta, Spanish for dead cow, may hold 23 billion
barrels of oil equivalent, according to a report by independent
auditor Ryder Scott released in February 2012 by YPF. </p>
<p>YPF''s American depositary receipts were little changed at
$30.65 at 11:52 a.m. in New York Chevron fell 1.2 percent to

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), a lightning rod
for environmental activists since the Valdez oil spill a
quarter-century ago, is appeasing some of its harshest critics
by agreeing to disclose internal risk and cost assessments. </p>
<p>Shareholders of the world''s second-largest corporation by
market value will vote on just one environmental resolution on
May 28, according to a proxy filing today. That''s after Irving,
Texas-based Exxon convinced activist investors to withdraw two
proposals dealing with greenhouse gas restrictions and hydraulic
fracturing. </p>
<p>Environmentalists and corporate-governance activists from
groups including the Sisters of St. Dominic and Arjuna Capital
have made Exxon''s annual meeting a focal point for objecting to
everything from drilling shale to producing motor fuels linked
to climate change. </p>
<p>This year, the company sought to head off criticism by
striking deals with some of its opponents after months-long
negotiations. On March 20, Exxon agreed to provide details on
oilfields and other assets whose value may be threatened by
carbon limits; two weeks later, the producer promised to
disclose risks associated with hydraulic fracturing, or
fracking. </p>
<p>In exchange, resolutions on both issues were withdrawn by
their proponents. Exxon satisfied the first agreement on March
31 by issuing a report that said its oil and natural gas
reserves won''t lose value because demand for energy will trump
efforts to curtail climate change. </p>
<h2>Binary Outlook </h2>
<p>The fracking report will be released later this year, Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, said in an April 3 interview. </p>
<p>The disclosure agreements haven''t been enough to silence
all of Exxon''s critics. Mark Lewis, an analyst at investment
bank Kepler Cheuvreux SA in Paris, said the company still hasn''t
faced up to the risk that high-cost, carbon-intensive reserves
such as the tar sands in western Canada could deter some
investors who find it socially unacceptable. </p>
<p>Exxon''s view of climate risk appears naively binary,
Lewis said in a blog post the day after Exxon issued its
reserves-threat report. The reality is much more nuanced. </p>
<p>The environmental resolutions brought before investors at
last year''s annual meeting failed to garner enough votes to
succeed. </p>
<p>A proposal calling on Exxon to disclose risks associated
with shale drilling was supported by 30 percent of shareholders,
unchanged from 2012. A separate item on greenhouse gases
gathered 27 percent of the vote, also little changed from a year
earlier. </p>
<p>In 1989, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil
into Alaska''s Prince William Sound, devastating wildlife and
local businesses. Victims of the spill sued Exxon and won a $5
billion punitive damage award in 1994 that was cut to $507.5

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) helped
regional Japanese banks sell the most dollar-denominated
convertible debt since at least 1999, as the lenders took
advantage of a stock-market rally to fund overseas expansion. </p>
<p>The world''s largest underwriter of the notes helped to
arrange three of the firms'' five U.S. currency sales in the last
12 months. It co-managed deals by Yamagata Bank Ltd., Bank of
Iwate Ltd. and Shizuoka Bank Ltd., whose convertible offering
last April was the first by a Japanese company since 2002,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Goldman had only
underwritten seven Japanese convertible-note sales in the decade
prior to 2013. </p>
<p>Convertible bonds have established themselves as one
funding tool, so all regional lenders have no choice but to
consider them to some extent, Hiroyuki Sugiura, a vice
president at Goldman''s investment banking division at the
company''s Japanese unit in Tokyo said in an April 11 interview.
They offer the regional lenders cheaper funding, he said. </p>
<p>Abe''s stimulus program to overcome 15 years of deflation
has spurred a stock market recovery that has allowed banks to
get favorable terms on their convertibles, with the three
lenders all selling zero-coupon notes. The regional institutions
will use the funds to lend to clients expanding overseas as a
shrinking domestic population curtails growth prospects at home. </p>
<h2>Quickest Proposal </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs underwrote $330 million of the $1.3 billion
of dollar convertible bonds sold by regional banks over the past
12 months, a figure exceeded only by Nomura Holdings Inc. Morgan
Stanley, the next biggest overseas manager, managed $120
million, Bloomberg-compiled data show. Nomura, Japan''s largest
brokerage, arranged $585 million in debt, including an issuance
by Yamaguchi Financial Group Inc. </p>
<p>Goldman was the quickest in bringing us a proposal,
Katsunori Nakanishi, the president of Shizuoka Bank, said
yesterday in an interview. After looking at the success of our
deal, it became easier for other regional banks to follow. </p>
<p>Sales of convertible notes, which combine a fixed-income
security with an option to buy stock, have surged since Abe''s
stimulus program sparked a 51.5 percent gain in the Topix
benchmark index last year. While the index is down 13 percent
since the start of this year, it''s still higher than at any
point from 2009 to 2012. </p>
<p>Demand for Japanese convertibles has been 10 to 15 times
more than the amount of notes on offer since the beginning of
2014, Takashi Masuda, head of equity linked products at Goldman
in Tokyo, said in the same interview. Outstanding issuances have
fallen to about 1.5 trillion yen ($14.8 billion) from about 10
trillion yen in 2000, he said. </p>
<h2>Bond Returns </h2>
<p>Japanese exchangeable-note returns fell 3.9 percent this
year, following a 35 percent gain in 2013 which was their best
performance since 1999, data from UBS AG show. While the bonds
have insulated investors somewhat from stock-market declines,
they''re underperforming the 2.4 percent gain in convertible debt
globally. </p>
<p>All Japanese companies including Joyo Bank Ltd. sold $900
million in dollar convertibles so far this year, compared with
$1 billion for all of 2013. </p>
<p>There are more than 100 companies in Yamagata with
overseas operations and we will use the money to help meet their
funding needs, said Nobuhiro Konno, the manager of the general
planning and coordination division at Yamagata Bank, based in
northern Japan. Since the sale of dollar convertibles by
Shizuoka, Iwate and Yamaguchi Financial, a lot of brokerages
came to explain the product, and that was the catalyst for our
sale. The bank sold $100 million of five-year convertible
debentures this month. </p>
<h2>Yen Convertibles </h2>
<p>Other regional banks including Nagano Bank Ltd. and Daisan
Bank Ltd. have issued yen-denominated convertibles this year,
with financial institutions accounting for the biggest amount of
sales by sector after industrials. </p>
<p>Shizuoka Bank''s dollar notes due 2018 can be exchanged for
shares at $13.46, or 18 percent above the closing stock price on
April 9 in dollar terms. The stock was at the equivalent of
$9.38 yesterday. Shares in Yamagata Bank closed at $4.01 April
14, compared with a conversion price of $5.09 on its 2019 debt. </p>
<p>It''s cheap dollars, and all the larger regional banks are
trying to increase their U.S. dollar lending as their clients
increasingly venture overseas, Graeme Knowd, an associate
managing director who overseas financial institutions at Moody''s
Investors Service in Tokyo said in a phone interview. Given
they lend to Japanese corporates, they probably need to fund as
cheaply as possible. </p>
<h2>Abe Stimulus </h2>
<p>Abe came to power in December 2012 calling for fiscal
spending, deregulation and Bank of Japan monetary easing to
raise the inflation rate to 2 percent. BOJ stimulus has helped
weaken the yen more than 14 percent against the dollar since the
end of 2012, bolstering the overseas earnings of Japanese
companies. </p>
<p>The yen traded at 101.61 per dollar as of 5:22 p.m. in
Tokyo yesterday, while the benchmark 10-year bond yield was at
0.605 percent, the world''s lowest. </p>
<p>Non-yen-denominated lending by Shizuoka Bank rose 91
percent to the equivalent of 414.4 billion yen at the end of
last year, compared with a 5.5 percent increase in total loans
to 6.98 trillion yen. The bank said yesterday it will seek to
boost lending at overseas branches to $3 billion by March 2019
from an estimated $1.72 billion for the fiscal year just ended
as part of a medium-term plan. </p>
<h2>Biggest Underwriter </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs has been the biggest manager of global
convertible bonds for the last three years, underwriting about
$14 billion in 2013 including notes sold by Yahoo Inc., Tesla
Motors Inc. and Air France-KLM, Bloomberg-compiled data show. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank hasn''t underwritten any yen-denominated convertible bonds since it helped manage Sony
Corp.''s 150 billion yen issue in November 2012. Prior to that
Goldman helped manage one convertible bond deal each in 2009,
2008 and 2007, by Japanese issuers, the data show. </p>
<p>Convertible sales this year may exceed last year, said
Goldman''s Masuda, adding the bank is looking to underwrite both
yen and dollar-denominated deals. </p>
<p>If issuance continues to climb, we''re confident of taking
market share, Masuda said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects
commodity prices to decline this year even after precious metals
and crop prices rallied on Ukraine tension and weather concerns. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index may drop 4 percent in
the next 12 months from a 4.3 percent decrease predicted in
February, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated
yesterday. Precious metals will decline 15 percent, compared
with a 14 percent retreat forecast in February, it said.
Agriculture prices will drop 10 percent, from February''s
estimate of a 9 percent loss, it said. </p>
<p>Gold rose 10 percent in 2014, rebounding from the biggest
drop since 1981, as unrest in Ukraine and concerns the global
recovery may be uneven boosted demand for a haven. Tensions in
Ukraine also contributed to corn''s 20 percent jump this year on
speculation supply may be disrupted and dry weather in the U.S.
pushed wheat 12 percent higher. The six-month rolling
correlation of commodities and equities returns has averaged 23
percent this year, the lowest since 2008, Goldman says. </p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, transient events
including cold weather, Chinese credit concerns and tensions in
Crimea have driven commodity prices, Goldman said. Although
these drivers are transient in nature, they are idiosyncratic,
which has helped to drive down the correlations not only with
other asset classes but also within the commodity space itself,
reinforcing the diversifying component of the strategic
investment case for commodities. </p>
<h2>Gold Forecast </h2>
<p>Bullion''s recent rally was spurred by poor U.S. data
probably linked to the weather and rising tension in Ukraine,
Goldman said, maintaining a year-end forecast of $1,050 an
ounce. With the tapering of the Federal Reserve''s bond-buying
program, U.S. economic releases will return as the driving force
behind lower prices, it said. </p>
<p>Corn will drop to $4 a bushel in 12 months on expectations
U.S. plantings will be higher than the U.S. Department of
Agriculture forecasts, increasing stockpiles, Goldman said.
Wheat will decline to $5.75 a bushel on production prospects in
Europe and the Black Sea, and normalization of U.S. rains, it
said. Soybeans may drop to $10.50 a bushel on record South
American output, slowing Chinese imports and as U.S. acreage
reaches an all-time high, it said. </p>
<p>Nickel may climb to as much as $20,000 a metric ton should
Indonesia''s ore export ban remain in place after its July
presidential election, according to Goldman. Prices in London
surged 28 percent this year as Indonesia, the largest miner of
nickel, curbed ore exports to spur local processing. Copper will
drop to $6,200 a ton over the next 12 months, it said. </p>
<p>Energy prices are set to decline 2.5 percent in the next 12
months, from a 3.5 percent drop forecast in February, Goldman
said today. Livestock will retreat 2 percent, from a February
forecast of unchanged prices, it said. </p>

<p>Gold will resume a decline as U.S.
economic growth accelerates, according to Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., which reiterated a forecast for the metal to end the year
at $1,050 an ounce. </p>
<p>Bullion''s rally this year was spurred by poor U.S. data
probably linked to the weather and rising tension in Ukraine,
analysts led by Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report, describing the
reasons as transient. With the tapering of the Federal Reserve''s
bond-buying program, U.S. economic releases will return as the
driving force behind lower prices, he wrote. </p>
<p>Gold''s 12-year bull run ended in 2013 as the Fed prepared
to reduce monthly bond-buying that fueled gains in asset prices
while failing to stoke inflation. Prices rose 10 percent this
year even as the Fed cut purchases, with Russia''s annexation of
Crimea and mixed U.S. economic data boosting haven demand. Last
year, Currie described gold as a slam-dunk sell for 2014. </p>
<p>It would require a significant sustained slowdown in U.S.
growth for us to revisit our expectation for lower gold prices
over the next two years, Currie wrote in the report, dated
yesterday. While further escalation in tensions could support
gold prices, we expect a sequential acceleration in both U.S.
and Chinese activity, and hence for gold prices to decline. </p>
<p>Gold for immediate delivery traded 0.3 percent higher at
$1,322.01 an ounce at 7:43 p.m. in Singapore, according to
Bloomberg generic pricing, after the United Nations Security
Council met to address the Ukraine crisis. Bullion last traded
below $1,050 an ounce in February 2010. </p>
<h2>Morgan Stanley </h2>
<p>Bullion is the least preferred commodity among metals as
prices resume a decline this year on the outlook for rising U.S.
interest rates and low inflation expectations, Morgan Stanley
said in a report on April 8. Average prices are expected to drop
for the next four quarters, it said. </p>
<p>Stronger U.S. growth this year and next will help the world
economy withstand weaker recoveries in emerging markets,
according to the International Monetary Fund. The world''s
largest economy will expand 2.8 percent this year and 3 percent
in 2015, unchanged from forecasts in January, the IMF said in
its World Economic Outlook report last week. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. is gaining
ground in the debt markets of Gulf Cooperation Council states
after the biggest U.S. bank helped manage this month''s Islamic
bond sale by Saudi Arabia''s utility. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is the biggest bond underwriter after HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA) in the six-nation GCC in 2014, its best start to a
year since 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
New York-based lender advised on six deals, including Saudi
Electricity (SECO) Co.''s $2.5 billion sukuk sale on April 1. </p>
<p>Its jump from sixth place in the rankings at the end of
2013 partly reflects the rise of Islamic finance, which will
become a $2.7 trillion market by 2017, according to
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Sukuk made up more than 70 percent of
total bond issuance this year in the GCC, which supplies one-fifth of world oil, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Islamic finance now has the biggest slice of the bond
market, Samer Mardini, a vice president of fixed income at SJS
Markets Ltd. in Dubai, said in a phone interview yesterday.
Issuers are more comfortable with big names like JPMorgan.
They can act as market-makers and bookrunners to ensure a
successful issuance. </p>
<p>JPMorgan hired former UBS AG banker Hussein Hassan last
year to head global Shariah-compliant financing. It has also
intensified its focus on corporate clients'' needs in the Gulf
region over the past few years, Hani Deaibes, head of Middle
East and North Africa debt capital markets at the bank, said in
an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. </p>
<h2>Rate Clarity </h2>
<p>This effort, combined with more market certainty, has
better positioned us to assist them in raising funding across
the international and domestic markets. </p>
<p>International bond-market conditions have become
conducive since the start of the year as the U.S. Federal
Reserve provided more clarity on interest rates, encouraging
companies to raise long-term funding, he said. </p>
<p>Saudi Electricity raised $1 billion in 30-year sukuk and
$1.5 billion in 10-year securities. HSBC and Deutsche Bank AG
also worked on the transaction. Deutsche Bank is the region''s
third-biggest underwriter this year, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. </p>
<p>The GCC has become a battleground for international banks
as other parts of the Middle East and North Africa struggle to
recover from political turmoil following a series of popular
uprisings that first erupted in 2011. </p>
<p>Economic growth in the oil-rich Gulf region is set to
accelerate to 4.4 percent this year, compared with 2.8 percent
for non-oil producers, according to HSBC forecasts released in
January. </p>
<h2>Sales Drop </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s performance has come even as bond sales dropped
almost 50 percent this year to $8 billion as some regular
issuers, such as cash-flushed banks, refrain from tapping the
market and offer cheaper loans to companies, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>New York-based JPMorgan said Hassan, previously global head
of Islamic structuring for UBS, is focusing on clients in
countries including Saudi Arabia and Malaysia, according to an
e-mailed statement at the time of his appointment in January
2013. Malaysia hosts the world''s biggest market for Islamic
bonds, or sukuk, while Saudi Arabia boasts the world''s biggest
share of Shariah-compliant assets. </p>
<p>More Saudi borrowers may still issue debt after Fitch
Ratings upgraded the kingdom one level in March to AA, the
third-highest investment grade, according to John Sfakianakis,
chief investment strategist at MASIC in Riyadh. </p>
<p>The recent sovereign upgrade should also help issuers who
are looking for more competitive pricing, he said in an e-mailed response to questions yesterday. Economic growth in Saudi
Arabia may accelerate to 4.2 percent in 2014, from 3.8 percent a
year earlier, according to economists'' estimates provided to
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has helped arrange bond sales for Saudi Arabia''s

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) was sued by Iusacell SA, Mexico''s third-biggest mobile-phone provider, for $2.5 billion in lost profits tied to a 2010
deal that failed. IBM claims the lawsuit is intended to avoid
arbitration over the contract. </p>
<p>Iusacell consulted with IBM in connection with a multiyear
plan to increase market share and revenue, the company said in a
heavily redacted complaint filed today in Manhattan federal
court. Iusacell alleged IBM made fraudulent misrepresentations
that caused it to suffer damages and lose profits. </p>
<p>IBM both knowingly misrepresented and wrongfully
concealed from Iusacell material facts both before and during
the parties'' relationship, Iusacell said in the complaint. The
public version of the filing doesn''t explain the alleged
wrongdoing. </p>
<p>IBM said today that Iusacell and IBM Mexico entered into a
long term contract under which IBM Mexico made significant
investments in Iusacell''s business operations that resulted in
major improvement to Iusacell''s information technology
infrastructure and growth in Iusacell''s revenues. </p>
<p>The matter is in arbitration, said Doug Shelton, a
spokesman for Armonk, New York-based IBM. </p>
<p>Iusacell, co-owned by billionaire Ricardo Salinas and by
Grupo Televisa SAB (TLEVICPO), the country''s largest broadcaster, has
struggled to compete with larger rivals such as America Movil
SAB (AMXL) and Telefonica SA. (TEF) The company had 8 million subscribers at
the end of 2013, or about 8 percent of the market. </p>
<p>Televisa recorded a fourth-quarter loss from joint ventures
of 4.74 billion pesos ($363 million), mostly to write down the
value of Iusacell. It acquired its 50 percent stake in the
company from Salinas for $1.6 billion in 2012 and invested an
additional 1.59 billion pesos last year. </p>
<p>Salinas is Mexico''s fourth-richest person and No. 129 on
the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a net worth of $9.1
billion. He has sued to block Mexico''s stock exchange from
removing his retail company from the benchmark index and the
government''s plans to auction off wireless airwaves. </p>
<p>Dan McCosh, a spokesman for Salinas''s group of companies,
declined to immediately comment. </p>

<p>Foreign aid has long been one of
the most unpalatable dishes on the federal plate. Why should
U.S. taxpayers give billions of dollars to ungrateful countries
that will waste it and whose people don''t like America anyway? </p>
<p>Quietly, though, the U.S. Agency for International
Development has been undergoing a market-oriented sea change
that has attracted fans such as Amy Bell, an executive director
of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), and hundreds of Wall Street veterans. </p>
<p>They''re really showcasing the power of business to do
well and do well in a prudent way, said Bell, the head of
principal investments for JPMorgan''s Social Finance unit in New
York, in a telephone interview. I think they''ve done a
remarkable job. </p>
<p>The U.S. government''s global anti-poverty agency backs a
private equity fund that Bell''s JPMorgan unit runs for African
agriculture businesses. It helped General Electric Co. (GE) secure
$10 million in local financing for small maternal-health clinics
in Kenya. It''s supported loans by Root Capital, a social-investment fund, to help coffee farmers in Latin America supply
Starbucks Inc. (SBUX) </p>
<p>It''s a sea change for an agency that for years simply gave
out money. The program, called the Development Credit Authority,
was begun in 1999 under President George W. Bush with authority
from Congress to provide loan guarantees, but in the 10 years
before 2011 it backed only $2.2 billion in credit. Since 2011,
the authority has issued $1 billion in guarantees. </p>
<h2>Shrinking Funding </h2>
<p>That''s still a fraction of the aid agency''s effort. AID has
seen its funding shrink from $22.5 billion in fiscal year 2010
to $20.4 billion in fiscal 2014, not adjusted for inflation. The
Obama administration has asked Congress for $20.1 billion in
fiscal 2015. </p>
<p>Our developmental objectives -- ending extreme poverty in
15 years, ending preventable child death, ending large-scale,
widespread child hunger -- will only be achieved if we can
effectively harness and deploy massive amounts of private
investment against those goals, said Rajiv Shah, the agency''s
administrator. </p>
<p>When Shah and Ben Hubbard, former director of the credit
authority, arrived in January 2010, they saw an underutilized
asset. </p>
<p>We don''t look at these problems and say, How do we get
the appropriations budget to solve this?'' Hubbard said in an
interview. It''s, How do I attract the private sector to get
this done, because it''s inherently more sustainable?'' Rather
than building and paying for solar power plants, we can attract
private capital to pay for them. </p>
<h2>Former Bankers </h2>
<p>The agency''s credit authority, with a few dozen private
sector, deal-oriented former bankers and financial analysts,
has brought tools from Wall Street to hone a model that Shah
said he hopes will transform not only development work, but also
the thinking in his agency. </p>
<p>Since 2011, the credit unit has leveraged private capital
to help companies expand while assisting some of the world''s
most vulnerable people. </p>
<p>The credit authority guaranteed an $8 million loan by New
York-based JPMorgan to the African Agricultural Capital Fund,
which helped attract equity investors and boost the Uganda-based
fund to $25 million. The arrangement allowed the bank to
experiment with a new market, lending to the small- and medium-sized businesses that are the engine of economic growth. </p>
<h2>Republican Applause </h2>
<p>The private-sector approach has drawn applause from critics
of foreign aid such as Republican Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, who''s praised the credit agency''s proven
track record of significantly leveraging private financing in
support of development aid, even as she''s called for cuts to
other parts of the foreign aid budget. </p>
<p>The development credit agency works in a number of ways.
Most often, it encourages banks in developing countries to loan
to smaller businesses, usually in underserved sectors such as
farming that align with U.S. development goals, by sharing the
risk if there''s a default. </p>
<p>There''s a lot of wealth in these banks, but they''re risk-averse, said Hubbard. We don''t take out all the risk, so
they have skin in the game, but we lower it. </p>
<p>When Nereus Capital LLC was struggling for funds, the
credit authority partnered with U.S.-based institutional
investors to help raise a $100 million investment in the Mumbai-based company''s fund for clean-energy projects. </p>
<h2>Deploying Wealth </h2>
<p>Learning how to deploy that wealth to tackle development
challenges, environmental challenges in India, is how we will
solve extreme poverty and its consequences of child hunger and
child death there, said Shah, 41, who earned a medical degree
from the University of Pennsylvania and previously was chief
scientist for the U.S. Agriculture Department and worked for the
Bill  Melinda Gates Foundation. </p>
<p>The credit authority''s default rate has been 1.89 percent,
with the aid agency paying out $11.6 million in claims since
1999 and collecting $14.1 million in bank fees. It also provide
credit enhancement to companies such as Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based Root Capital, which identified a gap in
financing for farmers'' cooperatives that were too large for
microcredit loans and too small for bank loans. </p>
<p>The cooperatives use the funding to help small farmers
improve their yields, reduce post-harvest losses -- enhancing
food security -- and earn more by selling collectively to
companies such as Seattle-based Starbucks, the world''s largest
operator of coffee shops. </p>
<h2>Loan Guarantees </h2>
<p>This year, the president has asked Congress to raise the
annual cap on the credit authority''s loan guarantee program to
$2 billion from $1.5 billion. It''s an idea whose time had come,
Hubbard said. </p>
<p>Still, change is sometimes difficult, Shah acknowledges.
The aid agency, created in 1961 by an executive order from
President John F. Kennedy, has 9,421 people worldwide who are
steeped in a culture of giving money away, not raising it. Now,
Hubbard said, overseas missions are being held accountable to
targets for attracting private capital to fund their programs. </p>
<p>There''s a huge amount of enthusiasm and excitement, and
also resistance in any system to doing things in new and
innovative ways, Shah said. </p>
<p>One solution has been to recruit Wall Street veterans to
the government aid agency, with almost 1,000 joining since the
end of the Bush administration, Hubbard said. </p>
<p>Reasons for signing up vary, said Hubbard, who has left the
agency to start a firm funding businesses in Africa. Some lost
their jobs because of the financial crisis and found purpose in
our mission, he said. Others could command a bigger salary
elsewhere, they just didn''t have a lot of purpose and meaning in
those positions. As a group, he adds, they''re very counter-cultural inside the agency. </p>
<h2>Cairo Reality Show </h2>
<p>These field investment officers work across the
agency''s silos, Hubbard said, bringing a financial viewpoint
to help health or agricultural specialists figure out how to
bring private capital into their programs. </p>
<p>Chris Lee, a former energy trader from Newtown,
Connecticut, now works as a field investment officer in Cairo,
where he''s developed a loan program for small- and medium-sized
businesses, helps run a local reality TV show about
entrepreneurs, and is looking at ways to support business people
in the informal economy. </p>
<p>It''s amazing how simple ideas can be effective, he
said. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) executives said
consumers who listen to ESPN radio and interact with the sports
channel''s websites spend triple the amount of time with the
company as those who just watch the TV network. </p>
<p>Fans who take part in ESPN.com''s fantasy football or use
the Watch ESPN app are with the company 17 hours a month on
average, versus five hours for people who only watch TV. The
data demonstrate that online and mobile offerings boost
engagement with ESPN, as well as the potential for ad sales,
executives told analysts today at ESPN''s offices. </p>
<p>It''s exploded the misconception that digital media would
cannibalize television, Arthur Bulgrin, ESPN''s senior vice
president of global research and analytics, said at the investor
event in Bristol, Connecticut. The overall time spent with
ESPN media more than triples and at the same time TV viewing
goes up. It''s a rising tide that floats all boats. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, is using
the event to showcase ESPN, one of the company''s most profitable
businesses, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Robert Iger
said. </p>
<p>A new studio ESPN plans to begin using next month for its
flagship SportsCenter news show is a great example of us
investing in the value of a franchise, investing not only to
continue to protect it but to continue to grow its value, Iger
said. </p>
<p>ESPN''s online offerings attract larger audiences than Yahoo
Sports, Bleacher Report and NFL.com, Bulgrin said. Mobile use by
customers also exceeds the time spent on desktop computers, he
said. Watch ESPN''s typical user is 29 years old, compared with
age 47 for the traditional TV viewer. The median income of
$74,000 is 54 percent more. </p>
<h2>Changing Habits </h2>
<p>TV networks, which accounted for more than half of Disney''s
profit, face challenges from new video options, the migration of
ad sales to online media and escalating costs for sports rights,
ESPN President John Skipper said. </p>
<p>A deal Disney signed last month that lets Dish Network
Corp. (DISH) create a Web-based service with its programming will
attract customers who don''t have pay TV now, rather than ones
who trade down from an existing service, Skipper said. He
expects more such deals. </p>
<p>Pay television is going to remain a large business,
though it will exist in a more complicated and dynamic
atmosphere, which will require some evolution of our current
business model, he said. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 1.3 percent to
$79.99 at the close in New York. The stock has gained 4.7
percent this year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) still expects to
complete the sale of a physical oil business to OAO Rosneft (ROSN) amid
U.S. sanctions of Russian leaders, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said. </p>
<p>We''re still looking at closing in the second half of this
year, and that''s of course subject to all necessary regulatory
approvals, Porat said in a telephone interview today. Of
communications with regulators, she said, We haven''t heard
anything at this point. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley agreed last year to sell a unit that stores,
trades and transports oil products to a subsidiary of Russia''s
OAO Rosneft. The firm has also said it''s exploring strategic
options for its stake in TransMontaigne Inc., the Denver-based
petroleum and chemical transportation and storage company. </p>
<p>Regulators and lawmakers have questioned banks'' involvement
in the physical commodities businesses, saying the operations
could pose catastrophic risks to the firms and potentially lead
to their collapse and public bailouts. </p>
<p>The White House has discussed including Rosneft Chief
Executive Officer Igor Sechin on an updated list of sanctioned
Russian individuals, the New York Times reported this week,
citing people familiar with the matter. Sechin, an ally of
Russian President Vladimir Putin, said last month that he didn''t
expect the existing U.S. sanctions to affect the deal. </p>
<p>Porat, 56, has said that the unit Morgan Stanley is selling
to Rosneft broke even last year on a pretax basis. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s first-quarter fixed-income and commodities
revenue climbed 9 percent to $1.65 billion, driven by strength
in commodities trading. Excluding the oil business its selling
and the TransMontaigne unit, the fixed-income division''s revenue
rose slightly versus a year earlier, Porat said on a
conference call today. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS) has offered to
raise starting pay at its Florida theme parks by 25 percent to
$10 an hour over two years, almost matching the federal minimum
wage sought by President Barack Obama. </p>
<p>Disney presented the proposal yesterday to the Service
Trades Council, a consortium of six labor groups, the company
and union representatives said. They are scheduled to resume
bargaining over a contract on May 28. </p>
<p>The unions, which represent more than 30,000 employees at
Walt Disney World near Orlando, asked for at least $10.10 an
hour, the amount congressional Democrats and Obama propose as a
new U.S. minimum. Starting pay at the Florida parks is now $8.03
an hour, according to Burbank, California-based Disney. That
would reach the rate Disney is offering by July 2016. </p>
<p>I''m very pleased, Ed Chambers, president of the
council, said in a telephone interview. We''re well on our way
to getting a deal done. </p>
<p>The contract being negotiated covers full-time hourly
employees at the world''s most-popular theme-park complex. Disney
reported record profit of $6.6 billion on revenue of $45 billion
last year from its TV networks, parks, studios and consumer
products. </p>
<p>It is more generous than they have been in the past,
said Donna-Lynne Dalton, secretary-treasurer of the council.
It comes at a cost. </p>
<p>Disney also told the unions it wants to stop offering
pensions to new hourly employees starting in 2016. </p>
<p>New hires would be offered a 3 percent company match to a
401(k)-style retirement plan, said Dalton. The company doesn''t
currently contribute to that plan, which is available to
employees from bell staff to costumed entertainers, she said. </p>
<h2>Union Opposition </h2>
<p>Chambers said the union would oppose the pension change. </p>
<p>This offer reflects our appreciation and care for our
cast members and our commitment to providing a leading
employment package, Kim Prunty, a Disney World spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement. We look forward to working with
the union and engaging in constructive negotiations to finalize
and reach a collective bargaining agreement. </p>
<p>Disney''s last contract with the council took effect in
October 2010, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The pact
included annual raises of 3 percent to 4 percent for workers who
hadn''t already reached the top of their pay scales, as well as
$650 one-time bonuses for non-tipped, full-time employees. </p>
<p>Disney''s parks and resorts business, the company''s second-largest division after television, generated operating income of
$2.22 billion last year on sales of $14.1 billion. </p>
<p>Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer,
said at the annual meeting in March the company has good
relations with its unions and doesn''t expect that to change. </p>
<p>It is our intention to behave very responsibly and fairly
with all of our cast members and compensate them in ways that
reflect the value that they create for the company and for our
customers, Iger said. </p>
<p>Disney rose 0.7 percent to $79.53 at 11:18 a.m. in New

hour, the amount congressional Democrats and Obama propose as a
new U.S. minimum. Starting pay at the Florida parks is now $8.03
an hour, according to Burbank, California-based Disney. That
would reach the rate Disney is offering by July 2016. </p>
<p>I''m very pleased, Ed Chambers, president of the
council, said in a telephone interview. We''re well on our way
to getting a deal done. </p>
<p>The contract being negotiated covers full-time hourly
employees at the world''s most-popular theme-park complex. Disney
reported record profit of $6.6 billion on revenue of $45 billion
last year from its TV networks, parks, studios and consumer
products. </p>
<p>It is more generous than they have been in the past,
said Donna-Lynne Dalton, secretary-treasurer of the council.
It comes at a cost. </p>
<p>Disney also told the unions it wants to stop offering
pensions to new hourly employees starting in 2016. </p>
<p>New hires would be offered a 3 percent company match to a
401(k)-style retirement plan, said Dalton. The company doesn''t
currently contribute to that plan, which is available to
employees from bell staff to costumed entertainers, she said. </p>
<h2>Union Opposition </h2>
<p>Chambers said the union would oppose the pension change. </p>
<p>This offer reflects our appreciation and care for our
cast members and our commitment to providing a leading
employment package, Kim Prunty, a Disney World spokeswoman,
said in an e-mailed statement. We look forward to working with
the union and engaging in constructive negotiations to finalize
and reach a collective bargaining agreement. </p>
<p>Disney''s last contract with the council took effect in
October 2010, according to the Orlando Sentinel. The pact
included annual raises of 3 percent to 4 percent for workers who
hadn''t already reached the top of their pay scales, as well as
$650 one-time bonuses for non-tipped, full-time employees. </p>
<p>Disney''s parks and resorts business, the company''s second-largest division after television, generated operating income of
$2.22 billion last year on sales of $14.1 billion. </p>
<p>Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer,
said at the annual meeting in March the company has good
relations with its unions and doesn''t expect that to change. </p>
<p>It is our intention to behave very responsibly and fairly
with all of our cast members and compensate them in ways that
reflect the value that they create for the company and for our
customers, Iger said. </p>
<p>Disney rose 1.7 percent to $78.95 at the close in New York
yesterday. The stock has gained 30 percent in the past year. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) digital chief
Gavin Michael, who joined the firm a year ago, has a certain
disdain for some competitors'' staid mobile-banking apps. </p>
<p>While functional, the apps aren''t intuitive or personalized
enough. So when it came time for the New York-based company to
update its app, with a new iPhone version available today,
Michael, 49, said he studied software produced by technology
startups. </p>
<p>How do I make this simple, human, cohesive? How do we
change the principles we''re chasing? he said in an April 15
interview. We looked at what a lot of the startups are doing,
whether it''s Seamless and the way I order takeout food, or Uber
and the way I catch a cab, or OpenTable and the way I book
restaurant reservations, or the way Apple iOS is shaped. </p>
<p>Lenders including JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by
assets, are leaning on mobile and online offerings to win
loyalty while lowering the cost of retail services. The firm''s
mobile users rose 24 percent from a year ago to 16.4 million.
Bank of America Corp., the No. 2 U.S. lender, said mobile
customers increased 19 percent to 15 million. </p>
<p>Michael, who reports to consumer-banking chief Gordon Smith, joined JPMorgan from consulting firm Accenture, where he
was head of technology innovation. He has since hired executives
from outside finance, including Tim Parsey, a former senior vice
president of design at Yahoo! Inc. and Josh Klenert, a former
designer for the Huffington Post. Both are based in San
Francisco. </p>
<p>Prior versions of the bank''s mobile app for the iPhone drew
3 1/2 out of five stars on Apple Inc.''s App Store as of late
yesterday. Bank of America''s had a similar rating. Apps from San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and New York-based Citigroup
Inc. both had three stars. </p>
<h2>New Greetings </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s redesigned app for the iPhone has a simpler
login and location-based greetings to give users a more
personalized experience, Michael said. The background photo
shown to a customer in New York may feature the Brooklyn Bridge,
for example, while a client in San Francisco sees streetcars. </p>
<p>People work on an emotional level before they go to the
rational level, Michael said. What we''re trying to do with
banking is create that emotional experience inside the way which
images are used, the way we greet and the way we understand how
customers bank with us. </p>
<p>Future versions will probably detect users'' location to
tailor their experience and ease transactions including in-store
purchases and pulling cash from automated teller machines, he
said. </p>
<h2>Cutting Branches </h2>
<p>When I''m near an ATM, how do I get the two to work so I
can preload transactions? Michael said. We want a cohesive
experience across our digital and live interactions. So things
should work together and feel like they belong together. </p>
<p>Mobile technology has helped firms including Charlotte,
North Carolina-based Bank of America reduce bank branches.
Customers effectively carry a branch in their pocket, Chief
Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, 54, said yesterday on a
conference call. </p>
<p>Still, branches will remain a key fixture for lenders,
Michael said. They are evolving into places where customers seek
financial advice, while performing routine activities like
depositing checks with mobile phones or ATMs. </p>
<p>It changes the relationship you have with the branch, as
opposed to replacing it, Michael said. </p>

<p>The largest U.S. banks can remain entangled with each other now that global regulators have loosened proposed limits on the financial web that led to investor panic in 2008 and prompted bailouts. </p> <p>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which set out a year ago to block banks from relying too heavily on each other, changed course last week, opting to let firms preserve most derivatives and repurchase agreements among themselves. The panel revised formulas for evaluating exposure and used a broader definition of capital. Those tweaks spare about $1 trillion in deals at seven of the biggest U.S. banks that would have exceeded proposed limits, according to a November study by the Clearing House, an industry group. </p> <p>The Basel panel of regulators from 27 countries has bowed to industry pressure before to weaken new rules.

The fact that the banks were so concerned with counterparty limits and fought them so hard shows how interconnected they are. That makes them too big to fail. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the world''s biggest
drugmaker, held informal, now-discontinued talks with
AstraZeneca Plc about buying the London-based maker of asthma 
and heart drugs, said two people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>The companies aren''t currently negotiating, said the
people, who asked not to be identified. One said the talks
happened several months ago and there are no plans to resume.
The discussions were first reported yesterday by London''s Sunday
Times, whose unnamed bank and industry sources said New York-based Pfizer made a tentative approach about a takeover valuing
AstraZeneca at more than 60 billion pounds ($101 billion). </p>
<p>If revived, such an acquisition would be among the largest
ever in the industry. Pfizer has reorganized its business over
the past three years, shuttering some research projects and
emphasizing others. A deal with AstraZeneca (AZN) would add early-stage drugs in a field of cancer treatments that use the body''s
own immune cells to recognize and attack cancer. </p>
<p>We don''t comment on market speculation or rumors, said
Andrew Topen, a Pfizer spokesman, in an e-mail. Esra Erkal-Paler, am AstraZeneca spokeswoman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>American depositary receipts for AstraZeneca gained 8.8
percent to $69.10 at 4 p.m. New York time. Pfizer rose 2 percent
to $30.86. The stock has increased about 37 percent in the last
two years as Pfizer benefited from the revamping that focused it
into three units: two for new drugs, and one for older products. </p>
<h2>AstraZeneca Treatments </h2>
<p>AstraZeneca in January announced an agreement with
Immunocore Limited to develop the new cancer treatments that use
the body''s own immune cells, and it also has several of its own
immune-based drugs being tested in multiple cancers. The
company''s shares in London have risen about 34 percent over two
years, even as sales have fallen from $33.6 billion in 2011 to
$25.7 billion last year, with further losses projected by some
analysts as drugs lose patent protection. </p>
<p>While a deal would be highly accretive through cost
cutting, Pfizer shareholders may have doubts about AstraZeneca''s
pipeline as well as its eroding revenue, said Mark Schoenebaum,
an analyst with ISI Group LLC. </p>
<p>The consensus AstraZeneca model is hugely dependent on
pipeline assumptions, as the base business will deteriorate
massively by 2020 as several key products go off patent, he
said in a note to clients. </p>
<h2>Mega-Mergers </h2>
<p>A merger of this reported size would top Pfizer''s 2000
purchase of Warner-Lambert Co. for $87 billion, the industry''s
largest deal, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Pfizer
has been at the center of the biggest drugmaker mega-mergers,
making up three of the 10 deals worth more than $30 billion in
the last two decades. </p>
<p>It would also provide a use for Pfizer''s cash from profits
that have been stashed overseas instead of being brought back to
the U.S., where they would be taxed at a higher rate. Pfizer had
$69 billion in untaxed cash overseas as of last month, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>A purchase of AstraZeneca could also potentially allow
Pfizer to move its tax domicile to the U.K. through a so-called
inversion transaction, a move that has allowed other U.S.
drugmakers to lower their tax bill. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca shares in London rose 0.6 percent to close at
3,781.50 pence on April 17, giving the company a market value of
47.7 billion pounds. The London stock market was closed for a
holiday April 18 and today. </p>
<h2>Merger Comments </h2>
<p>Since taking over in 2010, Pfizer Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read''s answers to whether or not he would pursue a mega-merger such as a deal with AstraZeneca have shifted. </p>
<p>On a January conference call in 2012 he said, I''m very
disinclined to be looking at any possibility of another mega-acquisition. You never say never, but we have all of the science
we need. </p>
<p>In July 2013, when Read was asked on another conference
call about the size of deals he might pursue, he replied:
We''ll look at any type of acquisition -- never say never to a
larger acquisition that made sense. </p>
<p>Schoenebaum said there were signs Pfizer could pursue a
large target. Pfizer has been signaling since last summer
that, in theory, the company would not be opposed to a larger
MA deal if the numbers made sense, Schoenebaum said. </p>

<p>Large deals make sense for Pfizer Inc.

Pfizer''s backup plan could be to acquire Dublin-based Shire Plc, Albert Fried  Co. said. </p> <p>Both companies face stalling growth over the next few years, with Pfizer needing new products to replace drugs that lost patent protection and AstraZeneca''s promising cancer treatments still years from hitting the market.

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) won investor approval
for its plan to award employees with stock, overcoming an
argument from money manager David Winters that lavish pay
packages are diminishing returns for shareholders. </p>
<p>Eighty-three percent of votes cast supported the equity
plan, according to preliminary results in an e-mailed statement
today from the company. The annual meeting was held in Atlanta,
the city where Coca-Cola is based. </p>
<p>Winters had waged a campaign since March to persuade
investors to reject the soft-drink maker''s proposal. The new
plan, in addition to ones already enacted, could transfer $29.8
billion to the managers, he said. Investors such as the Ontario
Teachers'' Pension Plan and Calvert Investments had sided with
Winters, who runs the firm Wintergreen Advisers LLC. Coca-Cola
said its board was pleased with the vote. </p>
<p>The company''s compensation programs are performance-based
and the equity plan is fair, competitive and consistent with
shareowners'' interests and our pay for performance philosophy,
according to the statement. </p>
<p>In making his case, Winters appealed directly to Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett, who
controls the biggest stake in Coca-Cola. Buffett, the world''s
third-richest person, used to be on Coca-Cola''s board, and his
son is a director. </p>
<h2>Extraneous Factors'' </h2>
<p>His fiduciary duty is to all of the Berkshire
shareholders, Winters said in an interview yesterday. Buffett
shouldn''t vote based on any other extraneous factors. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola has said that stock repurchases, including $4.8
billion of buybacks in 2013, cushion the dilution tied to
employee awards. Dilution related to equity plans has been less
than 1 percent annually over the past three years, and is
expected to be in this range going forward, the company said
in a presentation. Coca-Cola also said that the link of the pay
to performance means that all the potential awards may not be
earned. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola said a separate advisory vote on executive
compensation won 90 percent support. Investors also voted
against a measure that called for an independent board chairman. </p>

<p>Sanfer''s IPO would be the first by a Mexican pharmaceutical

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), the Wall
Street bank that once generated millions of dollars in fees from
its Global Alpha hedge fund, is turning to beta strategies for
growth. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management, which oversees $30 billion
in such products, agreed this week to buy Westpeak Global
Advisors LLC, without disclosing terms. Westpeak, which
supervises just $300 million of assets, can help spur growth in
the firm''s beta products, which are drawing more interest from
clients, Armen Avanessians, head of GSAM''s quantitative
business, said in an interview. Beta refers to how much an
asset''s price moves in relation to the broader market. </p>
<p>While many indexes are weighted based on market
capitalization, Westpeak develops so-called active beta
strategies by investing in groups of stocks using other
characteristics. The idea is to offer the low fees and liquidity
that have drawn investors to passive exchange-traded funds,
while providing more value than a proxy for the Standard 
Poor''s 500 Index. </p>
<p>Anyone who wants to be in the passive space has already
shifted into that space, and they enjoy a certain degree of
liquidity and transparency, said Avanessians, a partner and
29-year veteran of New York-based Goldman Sachs. The question
is, Can they do something more than just slavishly follow the
market cap?'' </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs, which has avoided large mergers throughout
its history, has made several purchases in the past two years to
grow an asset-management business that saw outflows in three
straight years ended in 2012. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in May that he''s devoting a very high
percentage of his attention to improving the division''s
performance. </p>
<h2>Assets Increase </h2>
<p>Last year, assets under supervision topped $1 trillion for
the first time and pretax profit climbed 20 percent to $1.11
billion. The division produced $1.57 billion of revenue in the
first quarter, a 20 percent increase from a year earlier. </p>
<p>Avanessians, 54, declined to set a growth target for the
advanced beta strategies business. He said only that it can get
much bigger and will help the bank attract a bigger slice of
clients'' portfolios. </p>
<p>We see it as being purely additive to our business, he
said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs shut Global Alpha in 2011 as clients pulled
money from what was the firm''s biggest hedge fund. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said that
the case for holding commodities remains strong, bolstering the
rationale for investments in oil and metals even as other banks
exit the market. </p>
<p>Commodities still offer a way to diversify holdings
together with equities and bonds, and are best suited as a hedge
against inflation, analysts led by Damien Courvalin and Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report dated yesterday. The appeal of holding
commodities will improve as global growth picks up in the next
few years, they wrote, without giving a forecast. </p>
<p>While returns from commodities lagged behind those from
shares and bonds over the past five years, the case for
retaining an allocation in a portfolio over the long term
remains, the Goldman analysts wrote. Barclays Plc, JPMorgan
Chase  Co. and Morgan Stanley are leaving parts of their
commodities businesses, boosting speculation that Goldman will
be able to increase its market share. </p>
<p>Having commodities will be a very useful diversifier for
most portfolios, said Jason Wang, chief executive officer at
Singapore-based Stamford Management Ltd., which had about $300
million under management at the end of 2013 after returns of
more than 20 percent from its Iridium Alpha Fund. Even within
commodities, it''s so heterogeneous that it''s possible to have

<p>The German unit of Assicurazioni
Generali SpA (G), Italy''s biggest insurer, is planning to begin
investing in high-yielding U.S. loans as it seeks to boost
returns held down by low interest rates. </p>
<p>Generali Deutschland Holding AG (GE1) will allocate as much as
400 million euros ($553 million) to leveraged loans, according
to Fabrizio Vitiello, Generali''s Milan-based head of asset
management and alternative fixed income. The Cologne-based
division also wants to invest as much as 200 million euros in
infrastructure loans and the same amount to small and medium-sized enterprises in Germany. </p>
<p>We are currently in the process of building up a number
of alternative fixed income investments such as senior secured
loans, loans to small and medium-sized corporations as well as
infrastructure and leveraged loans, Vitiello said in a
telephone interview. We invest predominantly via specialized
funds, positioning ourselves on the more senior part of the
capital structure. </p>
<p>Generali is joining German insurers including Gothaer Group
and Versicherungskammer Bayern buying into leveraged loans to
boost yields and diversify assets. The Italian firm''s life
division reported a 3.8 percent return on 282 billion euros of
investments in 2013 from 4.1 percent the year before. </p>
<p>Generali wants to team up with German banks to help it
invest in loans, according to Vitiello. Getting bank partners
is key for an investment in corporate loans, he said. </p>
<p>The insurer has selected BNP Paribas SA to work with its
French unit on a 300 million-euro fund focused on company debt. </p>
<h2>Record Issuance </h2>
<p>The U.S. junk-loan market has seen record issuance this
year with at least $85 billion raised to finance acquisitions,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. With defaults by borrowers
approaching record lows, buyout firms are also taking advantage
of the Federal Reserve''s easy-money policies to extract payouts
by piling more debt onto the companies they own. </p>
<p>Versicherungskammer Bayern, with 42.5 billion euros in
investments, and Gothaer Group, which oversees 25 billion euros,
have been buying into loans for several years. </p>
<p>We currently observe a massively growing interest in
senior secured loans, said Klaus-Michael Menz, the Cologne-based head of credit investments at Gothaer Asset Management AG,
the insurer''s asset management unit. Currently, the market is
almost priced to perfection and we have become very cautious as
it could quickly turn and lose its attractiveness. </p>
<h2>Bank Partner </h2>
<p>Gothaer achieved a return of about 13 percent on its senior
secured loans in the past two years, Menz said. The insurer is
working with IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, the Dusseldorf-based
lender, to invest as much as 150 million euros in debt to
medium-sized German companies. </p>
<p>Bayerische Versorgungskammer, Germany''s biggest public
pension fund, is also planning to start investing in loans,
Munich-based spokeswoman Kathrin Reus said. It wants to allocate
as much as 600 million euros to syndicated facilities starting
next month, according to Reus. </p>

Corp. (IBM) will add technology from its Watson supercomputer, known
for beating humans on Jeopardy!, to its federal health unit
before the Pentagon seeks bids on a $11 billion health-records
project. </p>
<p>The world''s biggest computer services provider also is
hiring Keith Salzman, a former chief medical information officer
at the Army hospital in Tacoma, Washington, where the Pentagon
plans to test the new health records project, for its U.S.
federal team. Salzman will become the division''s chief medical
officer, IBM said in a news release today. </p>
<p>IBM, whose U.S. agency contracts have slipped over the past
two years, is making the changes as companies prepare to compete
to deliver a new electronic medical-records system for the
Defense Department. The lifecycle cost of the project may be as
much as $11 billion, Jonathan Woodson, assistant secretary of
defense for health affairs, said in testimony before a U.S.
House appropriations subcommittee this month. </p>
<p>You have to bring a lot to the table in federal health
care, Andrew Maner, IBM''s managing partner for its U.S.
federal division, said in a telephone interview. Watson is not
going to implement an electronic medical-records solution, but
it can be used to make clinicians better or more efficient. </p>
<p>The Armonk, New York-based company, which had $1.2 billion
in U.S. agency contracts during the fiscal year that ended Sept.
30, was the government''s No. 51 supplier, according to a
Bloomberg Government ranking of the top 200 vendors released
April 22. It slipped six spots from the prior year, when it had
about $1.5 billion in U.S. contracts. </p>
<h2>Jeopardy'' Success </h2>
<p>IBM will offer technology from its Watson Group to
aggregate and study clinical information for U.S. health
agencies, according to the press release. Watson, an artificial-intelligence system best known for its success on the
Jeopardy! television quiz show, can analyze large amounts of
data. That may help cut costs, speed medical research and
improve care, the company said in its release. </p>
<p>Maner declined to comment on whether IBM would compete for
the records project or include Watson technology in a potential
bid. It wants to see the government''s solicitation for the work
first, he said. </p>
<p>If IBM does bid, you need to show up with everything,
Maner said. That includes the right commercial and federal
experience, the best bidding partners, as well as innovative
technology, such as Watson, he said. </p>
<p>Information technology services companies such as Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), based in Palo Alto, California; Leidos Holdings
Inc. (LDOS), based in Reston, Virginia; and IBM are likely to bid on
the Pentagon health records work, said Brian Friel, a Bloomberg

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is rushing to fix a
security flaw in its Internet Explorer browser that is already
being used in limited, targeted attacks, as antivirus firms
and the U.S. government advise switching to alternate products. </p>
<p>To take over a user''s personal computer through the
browser''s vulnerability, a hacker would have to persuade that
person to click on a link to view a malicious website, Microsoft
said in an advisory. </p>
<p>The Explorer security concerns come just weeks after the
public discovery of Heartbleed, a flaw in the design of an
encryption tool that runs on as many as two-thirds of all active
websites. Some edition of Internet Explorer runs on 58 percent
of all desktop PCs, according NetMarketShare, compared with 18
percent for Google Inc.''s Chrome, the No. 2 browser. </p>
<p>An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
could gain the same user rights as the current user, Microsoft
said in the advisory, issued on April 26. On completion of
this investigation, Microsoft will take the appropriate action
to protect our customers, which may include providing a solution
through our monthly security update release process, or an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs. </p>
<h2>Windows XP </h2>
<p>The flaw exists in Internet Explorer versions 6 through 11,
which means it will affect users of Windows XP, the operating
system that Microsoft stopped supporting with security updates
earlier this month. </p>
<p>Symantec Corp., the biggest maker of PC-security software,
advised customers to switch to another browser until Microsoft
releases a software patch to fix the vulnerability and to use a
security mitigation tool kit that Microsoft recommended and that
will work with Windows XP. The U.S. Department of Homeland
Security''s Computer Emergency Readiness Team issued similar
advice today. </p>
<p>The vulnerability was found on April 26 by researchers at
security firm FireEye Inc. (FEYE), who also discovered the related
attacks and named the campaign Operation Clandestine Fox.
FireEye, in a statement on its blog, declined to provide details
of the campaign except to say that it was targeted at Internet
Explorer versions 9 through 11, which account for about a
quarter of the total browser market. </p>

<p>This type of security flaw is known as a zero-day threat
because there is no time between the discovery of the weakness
and attacks attempting to exploit it. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, researchers disclosed discovery of the
Heartbleed bug, a flaw in OpenSSL encryption software.
Researchers pushed out a fix for the vulnerability, which could
have enabled hackers to gain access to user names, passwords and
other sensitive information, and users were urged to change
their website passwords. Companies such as BlackBerry Ltd.,
Cisco Systems Inc. and Yahoo! Inc. were affected by the bug. </p>

previously created by over-reliance on clearing-bank credit,
Michael Albanese, head of JPMorgan''s U.S. tri-party repo
clearing and collateral management, said in the statement. </p>
<p>BNY Mellon, the industry leader, and JPMorgan act as
middlemen to process repo transactions and keep charge of
collateral. The role required the two New York-based banks to
temporarily extend hundreds of billions of dollars in credit for
several hours during the day, which puts their safety at risk if
the market breaks down before the deals are unwound. </p>
<h2>Curbing Risk </h2>
<p>The Fed''s goal was to curb the need for the lenders to
finance the deals, people familiar with the plans have said. The
market is the biggest source of financing for primary dealers,
the 22 firms that act as counterparties for the central bank. </p>
<p>BNY Mellon is fully on track for practically eliminating
intraday credit risk this year and enabling market participants
to continue to efficiently and effectively fund their
operations, Kevin Heine, a spokesman for the company, said in
an e-mailed statement. The lender, which handles about 80
percent of the transactions, expects to have the final pieces of
its upgrade in place by the end of this year, according to the
firm''s website. </p>
<p>Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed''s chairman during 2008, told the
Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission that a breakdown of the tri-party market in 2008 almost created a black hole as
financial firms lost access to cash for daily operations. The
commission in a report cited structural flaws in the market as
one of the biggest causes of the crisis. </p>

<p>The love fest between little girls
and the film Frozen helped Walt Disney Co. (DIS) maintain its
domination of the U.S. licensed toy industry last quarter. </p>
<p>Elsa dolls and other Frozen merchandise sold better
than any other licensed toys in the first three months of the
year, according to NPD Group Inc. The animated movie, released
in November, has generated more than $1.1 billion in ticket
sales, according to Box Office Mojo. That''s made it the highest-grossing animated film of all time. </p>
<p>For Disney, the Frozen surge is helping continue its
winning streak in toy licensing. The company had four of the top
five toy franchises in the first quarter, including Disney
Princess, Mickey  Friends and Star Wars. The lone non-Disney
franchise was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, owned by Viacom Inc. </p>
<p>Cars, another Disney property, led the list last year,
when retail sales of from licensed toys climbed to $5.3 billion,
according to Port Washington, New York-based NPD. The toy
industry is increasingly relying on entertainment franchises to
spur sales. While total U.S. toy sales declined 1 percent last
year, revenue from licenses rose 3 percent. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, also dominated the
list of fastest-growing licenses last quarter with three titles:
Frozen, Planes and Sofia the First. The top spot
went to toys based on Despicable Me, owned by Comcast
Corp.''s Universal Pictures. </p>

<p>The U.S. Supreme Court ended a
lawsuit that accused Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) of illegally protecting its
Windows computer operating system from competition 20 years ago
by undercutting a rival word-processing program. </p>
<p>Declining to take up a lingering antitrust case stemming
from Microsoft''s software dominance in the 1990s, the justices
today rejected without comment an appeal by Novell Inc., which
once made the WordPerfect application. </p>
<p>Novell was looking to revive a lawsuit that accused
Microsoft of anticompetitive conduct during development of its
Windows 95 operating system in 1994. Novell said that, late in
the rollout process, Microsoft withheld software components
known as namespace extensions so competing developers would have
trouble making their programs run smoothly on Windows. </p>
<p>Novell said the move slowed the development of WordPerfect,
a word-processing program that posed a threat to Microsoft''s
Word. </p>
<p>In throwing out the lawsuit, a Denver-based federal appeals
court said antitrust laws rarely impose on firms -- even
dominant firms -- a duty to deal with their rivals. The ruling
upheld a federal trial judge''s opinion. </p>
<p>Novell, now part of privately held Wizard Parent LLC,
argued in its appeal that Microsoft made its own operating
system less attractive to consumers in order to crush
competition and protect its operating system monopoly. </p>
<p>The case bore some similarities to the 1998 Justice
Department lawsuit that at one point produced a court order that
would have split Microsoft into two companies. An appeals court
overturned that order, and the company later settled the case by
agreeing to let computer makers promote rival software products. </p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts didn''t take part in the Supreme
Court action. He was involved as a lawyer in the Justice
Department''s antitrust case against Microsoft. </p>
<p>The case is Novell v. Microsoft, 13-1042. </p>

<p>The Swiss units of Goldman Sachs
Group (GS) Inc. and Morgan Stanley (MS) are among 106 banks seeking U.S.
non-prosecution agreements after saying they had reason to
believe they helped Americans violate tax laws, according to
three people familiar with the banks'' actions. </p>
<p>Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley applied to a Justice
Department program that requires banks to disclose how they
helped Americans hide assets, hand over data on undeclared
accounts and pay penalties, according to the people who asked
not to be identified because they weren''t authorized to discuss
the matter publicly. </p>
<p>To gain non-prosecution deals, banks must pay 20 percent of
the value of accounts not disclosed to the Internal Revenue
Service on Aug. 1, 2008, 30 percent for such accounts opened
between then and February 2009 and 50 percent for accounts
opened afterward. Banks submitted letters of intent by Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Andrea Raphael, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs, and Wesley
McDade, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The voluntary disclosure program, offered last year to more
than 300 Swiss banks, is part of the U.S. crackdown on offshore
tax evasion. It wasn''t open to 14 institutions already under
criminal investigation, including Credit Suisse Group AG, the
second-biggest Swiss bank; the Swiss unit of HSBC Holdings Plc;
Julius Baer Group Ltd., Switzerland''s third-largest wealth
manager; and Zuercher Kantonalbank, the largest state-owned
regional bank. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is considering strategic options for its
Swiss private bank, including a sale or wind-down, a person
briefed on the discussions said last month. </p>
<h2>Undeclared Accounts </h2>
<p>Those under criminal investigation are known as Category 1
banks, while those seeking non-prosecution agreements are called
Category 2. If no undeclared U.S. accounts are found, banks can
apply as Category 3. Category 4 banks are those with mainly
local clients. </p>
<p>Banks seeking non-prosecution agreements must disclose the
total number of U.S. accounts since 2008, their highest dollar
value, and the employees who managed them. The banks also must
use independent examiners to certify findings. </p>
<p>Assistant Attorney General Kathryn Keneally said in January
that the department is reviewing the letters of intent to see if
applicants qualify as Swiss banks. Some banks are still
reviewing records, and some may withdraw, she said. </p>
<p>At least 33 banks announced that they will join the program
in Category 2, including Cie. Lombard, Odier SCA, Geneva''s
oldest bank, and BSI Group, the Swiss private bank owned by
Italy''s Assicurazioni Generali SpA. </p>
<p>Banks that said they will participate include: Union
Bancaire Privee, the Geneva-based bank founded by Edgar de
Picciotto in 1969; Edmond de Rothschild Group, owned by Baron
Benjamin de Rothschild; and EFG International AG, controlled by
Greek billionaire Spiro Latsis and his family. Another 15 banks,
mainly regional lenders, declared they will opt for Category 3
or 4. </p>
<p>Category 3 banks seek Justice Department letters saying
they''re not a target of a criminal probe. In return, an
independent examiner must confirm the bank broke no laws. </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal earlier reported about the banks''
participation in the U.S. program. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) posted higher-than-expected profit as international sanctions against Russian
interests clouded the U.S. oil explorer''s efforts to tap some of
the world''s biggest crude reserves. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income was $9.1 billion, or $2.10 a
share, compared with $9.5 billion, or $2.12, a year earlier, the
Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Per-share

survey and surpassed the average by 22 cents. </p>
<p>Russia''s oil and gas riches are key to Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Rex Tillerson''splans for reviving output at
the world''s biggest energy explorer by market value. Exxon''s
global production has fallen in 10 of the past 11 quarters and
net income is in the midst of the longest slide since the
worldwide financial crisis of 2008-2009. </p>
<p>Tillerson, 62, slashed spending on drilling and
acquisitions outside the U.S. by 41 percent to $5.2 billion and
almost tripled asset sales to amass cash. The balance-sheet
measures helped offset a larger-than-expected 5.6 percent drop
in oil and natural gas production exacerbated by lower crude
prices. </p>
<p>Cash flow looks good and their projects are proceeding on
schedule, so all in all it was a good quarter, Brian
Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Sons in St. Louis, said
in a telephone interview today. Cost-containment and the absence
of major deals akin to last year''s $3.1 billion Celtic
Exploration Ltd. purchase in Canada were a boon, he said. </p>

<p>Pfizer (PFE) Inc.''s $106 billion bid for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) faces increased resistance as the unwilling
target''s chairman listed the reasons the offer was rejected and
British lawmakers began efforts to block the buyout attempt. </p>
<p>The offer significantly undervalued AstraZeneca,
Chairman Leif Johansson said today in a video posted to the
company website. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the biggest U.S. drugmaker, offered 46.61 pounds a
share in cash and stock in January, and London-based AstraZeneca
declined to pursue negotiations. On April 28, Pfizer made the
offer public and said it wanted to restart discussions.
AstraZeneca was also concerned that the offer was too heavily
weighted in stock, and about the proposed tax structure of the
new entity, Johansson said in the four-minute video. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca has a clear innovation-based strategy,
focused on achieving scientific leadership and returning to
growth, he said. The board is also confident in our ability
to successfully execute that strategy as an independent
company. </p>
<p>The deal may run into barriers set by U.K. officials
worried about the loss of jobs and research investment. </p>
<p>Pfizer executives likely will be summoned before
parliament''s Business Committee to explain their intentions,
Adrian Bailey, the committee''s chairman, said April 29.
Yesterday, Julian Huppert, a Liberal Democrat member of
parliament, submitted a motion calling for ministers to act as
necessary to protect employment and skills in the U.K. </p>
<h2>Largest Takeover </h2>
<p>There is a great deal at stake here, Huppert said in a
statement. This would be the largest takeover of a British
firm. I want to make sure AstraZeneca retains its position in
the U.K. It is extremely important for those people employed by
the company and our economy generally. </p>
<p>Under the terms of Pfizer''s offer, a deal would create a
company incorporated in the U.K. for tax purposes and run out of
New York, where Pfizer is based. The U.S. company has until May
26 to make an offer for AstraZeneca, or say that it won''t bid,
under U.K. takeover rules. </p>
<p>On a conference call with reporters, Pfizer Chief Executive
Officer Ian Read said he wouldn''t commit to preserving British
jobs, although he added the U.K. was an attractive jurisdiction
in which to do business. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca shares have climbed 32 percent since Jan. 1.
That growth shows that shareholders have endorsed the company''s
strategy, Johansson said. </p>
<p>The stock rose 1.1 percent to 4,715.50 pence at 11:37 a.m.
in London. </p>
<h2>Pfizer Meeting </h2>
<p>Read met with U.K. government ministers April 29 to discuss
a potential takeover, according to a person familiar with the
meetings. Read emphasized the American company''s plans to carry
out research, development and manufacturing in the U.K. as well
as the appeal of the British tax system, the person said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s reputation in Parliament isn''t helped by its 2011
decision to close a research hub in the coastal town of
Sandwich, southeast England, with the loss of 2,000 jobs.
AstraZeneca is moving to a new global headquarters and research
center in Cambridge, which is represented by Huppert. </p>
<p>Bailey''s committee will discuss on May 6 whether to hold
hearings with executives. </p>
<p>I view it with great concern, Bailey, who is a Labour
lawmaker, told reporters. We have a company which closed its
operations in Sandwich for tax purposes and now says it''s buying
a British company for tax purposes. </p>
<p>If the bid goes ahead and is subject to a European
Commission investigation, the U.K. may ask for it to be referred
back on public interest grounds, at which point ministers could
block it. Or the government could try to amend the Enterprise
Act, which allows ministers to intervene to protect national
security, media plurality and the stability of the financial
system. </p>
<p>Jean-Christophe Gray, spokesman for Prime Minister David
Cameron, called AstraZeneca''s research center in Cambridge a
significant part of the U.K.''s developing science skill base. </p>
<p>Would you expect senior figures in government to take
close interest? Of course, Gray said in London today. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world''s
biggest investment bank by revenue, said Wall Street''s trading
slump has deepened and could last through the second quarter. </p>
<p>Fixed-income and equities trading revenue will drop about
20 percent from a year earlier at the New York-based company
amid a continued challenging environment and lower client
activity levels, JPMorgan said yesterday in its quarterly
regulatory filing. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 58, was the first head
of a major U.S. bank to warn investors this year that trading
was down, saying in February that revenue had fallen 15 percent.
Continued weakness has spurred analysts including Chris Mutascio
of Stifel Financial Corp.''s KBW unit to ponder whether the drop
in fixed-income trading might persist through 2014 and beyond. </p>
<p>It''s an industry phenomenon, and other banks allow
JPMorgan to grease the skids for them so there can be a gentle
letdown process, said Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales
Partners LLC. </p>
<p>A 20 percent revenue slide from the $5.37 billion JPMorgan
posted in last year''s second quarter would mean results of $4.3
billion this period. That figure, along with the first quarter''s
$5.06 billion, would mark the bank''s worst first half in trading
since the financial crisis. </p>

Pfizer-AstraZeneca Deal Threatens Spending on New Drugs
U.K. Signals It Won''t Block Pfizer''s Bid for AstraZeneca
Pfizer Planning to Raise AstraZeneca Bid Above $106 Billion
<p>AstraZeneca may not get much help from the government of U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron in fending off Pfizer. The government today signaled it wouldn''t interfere, rebuffing calls from members of other political parties to step in to protect jobs in the country''s science base. </p> <p>AstraZeneca declined less than 1 percent to 48.08 pounds in London. Pfizer fell 1.3 percent to $30.75 in New York. </p> <h2>CEO Meetings </h2> <p>Pfizer raised its bid after Chief Executive Officer Ian Read met with AstraZeneca shareholders and government officials in the U.K. In a letter to Cameron, New York-based Pfizer pledged to follow through on AstraZeneca''s plan to build a substantial campus in Cambridge, England, and to keep key scientific management at the site. </p> <p>This is ultimately a decision for AstraZeneca shareholders, said Universities and Science Minister David Willetts in an interview. </p> <p>The U.K. government has been in talks with Pfizer about preserving jobs, particularly in research and manufacturing, in the country, Willetts said. </p> <p>I think those messages are getting home to Pfizer, but there''s a lot more hard-headed negotiation to come, Willetts said. </p> <p>Cameron spoke with Johansson today about the deal, said Jean-Christophe Gray, Cameron''s spokesman. </p> <p>AstraZeneca has a fantastic role in the British economy, Cameron told reporters today in Newcastle-Under-Lyme, England. Action on any merger is a decision for both companies. We''ve sought and received robust assurances from Pfizer should the deal go ahead. </p> <h2>Tax Rate </h2> <p>Buying AstraZeneca would give Pfizer a lower tax rate because the combined company would be a corporate resident of England. The company, which would maintain its head office in New York, also would gain a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs from the purchase. </p> <p>AstraZeneca in its April 28 statement rejecting the initial offer said Pfizer''s decision to move its tax domicile to the U.K. may be problematic. The U.K. company highlighted that issue again in today''s statement. </p> <p>Pfizer''s earlier offer, made in January, valued AstraZeneca at 58.8 billion pounds. The acquisition would be the largest ever of a U.K. company, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and would create the world''s biggest drugmaker by sales. </p> <p>The consistent message from leading shareholders reinforces our belief that there is a highly compelling strategic, business and financial rationale for combining our businesses, with significant benefits for all our stakeholders, Read said in a letter to Johansson. We believe our revised terms will be viewed by the market as a basis for engagement. </p> <h2>Cash Mix </h2> <p>Stockholders would get 15.98 pounds in cash and 1.845 shares of the combined company for each share in AstraZeneca, Pfizer said. The new bid was 7.3 percent above the previous proposal and 39 percent above the closing price Jan. 3, before AstraZeneca made its initial offer. </p> <p>The new proposal consists of about 32 percent cash and 68 percent stock, versus about 30 percent cash and 70 percent stock in the original offer. AstraZeneca said April 28 the initial bid very significantly undervalued the company, and said it was concerned that too much of the payment was in stock rather than cash. </p> <h2>Limited Commitment </h2> <p>Pfizer, in the letter to Cameron, pledged to keep at least 20 percent of the combined company''s research and development workforce in the U.K., retain substantial manufacturing facilities at AstraZeneca''s site in Macclesfield, England, and invite at least two AstraZeneca directors to join Pfizer''s board. </p> <p>The U.S. company is committing to the steps for at least five years, though it could adjust these obligations should circumstances significantly change, according to the Pfizer statement. </p> <p>AstraZeneca employs almost 2,000 people in Macclesfield, and the company is in the process of moving its corporate headquarters from London to Cambridge. </p> <p> ', 'AstraZeneca Snubs Pfizer Approach That U.K. Won''t Block', 'By Oliver Staley and Robert Hutton', 'May 02, 2014  4:29 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-02/pfizer-raises-astrazeneca-offer-to-106-5-billion.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer John Watson''s goal of breaking a production
record three years from now just got harder to reach. </p>
<p>After spending more than $100 million a day on average
during the first three months of the year on new oil wells and
other projects, Chevron posted its lowest first-quarter crude
and natural gas output since 2006 today. The company pumped the
equivalent of 2.59 million barrels a day during the period, 1
percent below the average estimate of three analysts in a
Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The output disappointment comes less than two months after
Watson scaled back his 2017 output target to 3.1 million barrels
a day from 3.3 million amid low gas prices that stalled some
drilling and scant new discoveries. For Chevron, the world''s
third-largest energy company by market value, production in the
era after its 2001 takeover of Texaco Inc. peaked at 2.78
million a day in 2010. </p>
<p>They are having to battle quite hard to get bottom-line
production growing, Stephen Clark, who helps manage $305
billion, including Chevron shares, at Standard Life Investments
in Boston, said in a telephone interview today. The sheer size
of some of the projects is an issue. </p>
<p>Watson cited winter weather in Kazakhstan, the source of
one in every eight barrels Chevron pumps worldwide, and a storm
in Thailand for the production decline. We continue to advance
our key development projects that will begin boosting output
next year, he said in a statement today. </p>
<h2>Still Viable </h2>
<p>The Chevron-operated $10 billion Angola LNG complex in
Africa that chills gas for shipment to overseas markets has been
shut since a pipe failure in mid-April, Chief Financial Officer
Pat Yarrington said during a conference call today. </p>
<p>An internal investigation into the incident should be
concluded in a matter of days, she said. Yarrington didn''t
provide an expected restart date, though she said the outage
will have a negative impact on Chevron''s overall production. </p>
<p>Watson''s 2017 goal still seems viable because they have a
lot of big projects coming on, said Stewart Glickman, an
equity analyst at SP Capital IQ in New York who rates Chevron a
buy and doesn''t own any shares. New contributions to output will
include fields beneath the Gulf of Mexico and off the Australian
coast, he said in an interview today. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income was $4.51 billion, or $2.36 a
share, compared with $6.18 billion, or $3.18, a year earlier,
San Ramon, California-based Chevron said in the statement. Sales
fell 6.1 percent to $50.98 billion. The company increased
capital spending 5.6 percent to $9.4 billion during the quarter. </p>
<h2>Russia Pipeline </h2>
<p>Chevron is among international energy explorers caught in
the middle of an intensifying row between the U.S. and its
European allies on one side, and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the other. Putin put foreign oil companies on the spot
on April 29 when he said they may be shut out of his country if
their governments continue to ratchet up sanctions against
Russian nationals and institutions. </p>
<p>Chevron and its partners are in the midst of a $5.4 billion
expansion of a pipeline that carries oil across Russia''s
Caucasus region from fields in neighboring Kazakhstan that
account for 12 percent of the company''s global supplies. </p>
<h2>Spending, Selling </h2>
<p>Watson is spending almost $40 billion this year to drill
for new discoveries and transport oil, gas and fuels such as
diesel to markets. In tandem with exploration forays that span
the globe from Argentina to China, Watson is overseeing $10
billion in asset sales to narrow the company''s focus on its
highest-profit projects. </p>
<p>Brent crude futures, the benchmark for more than half the
world''s oil, declined by 4.2 percent to an average of $107.92 a
barrel during the quarter, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. U.S. gas prices climbed 35 percent to average $4.712
per million British thermal units during that period. </p>
<p>Chevron dropped 0.2 percent to $124.72 at the close in New
York. </p>

market value, followed by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSA) Plc. </p>

firm that specializes in private equity, sold $550 million of
bonds overseas yesterday. The sale was the seventh first-time

used to finance construction of a pipeline, according to
Perarnaud. It bought the 86 percent stake in Fermaca from
Ospraie Management in February. </p>
<p>The agreement with CFE will last throughout the life of the
bonds, giving investors comfort that they will get paid, said
Ray Zucaro, who manages $390 million at SW Asset Management LLC. </p>
<p>That kind of long-term contract with government agencies
beyond the life of the bond where effectively you neutralize
that counterparty risk -- those are the kind of bonds that will
let you sleep at night, he said in a telephone interview from
Newport Beach, California. </p>
<h2>CFE Plan </h2>
<p>CFE, as the company is known, plans to take advantage of
legal changes to the energy industry to sell natural gas, Chief
Executive Officer Enrique Ochoa said March 20. After allowing
foreign investors to drill for oil for the first time since
1938, Mexico is looking to increase natural-gas supply, reduce
its dependence on U.S. imports and lower the cost of electricity
generation. </p>
<p>That push will increase demand for Fermaca''s gas pipelines,
said Partners Group''s Perarnaud. The company is also bidding on
multiple pipeline contracts being auctioned by CFE, he said. </p>
<p>We found Fermaca was the perfect asset, Perarnaud said.
It would be an upside if the oil and gas exploration happen in
Mexico because our pipelines are actually located in one of the
prospective areas for shale gas in Mexico. When you combine
everything together, you end up with a good story. </p>
<p>While Fermaca is taking advantage of the investor demand
for Mexican assets after the country passed constitutional
changes in December, the company is not dependent on those
measures to prosper in Mexico, he said. </p>
<h2>Secondary Laws </h2>
<p>After pushing through sweeping changes in his first year in
office that earned Mexico its highest-ever credit rating, Pena
Nieto has struggled to overcome opposition to pass the secondary
laws needed to implement the new oil legislation, damping demand
for Mexican assets. He submitted his proposals on April 30, the
last day of the congressional session. Lawmakers plan to vote on
the bills during special sessions in June after Congress missed
a mid-April deadline to pass the rules. </p>
<p>The delays helped spark a 0.14 percent loss in Mexican
government debt in April, trailing the emerging-market average
for the first time since January, according to Bank of America
Corp. indexes. </p>
<h2>Right Place'' </h2>
<p>Fermaca is also the first debut issuer from Mexico since
Oceanografia SA de CV defaulted on $495 million in February,
when the government seized the oil services provider following
allegations it took out a $400 million loan from Citigroup Inc.
under fraudulent circumstances. Citigroup determined that
Oceanografia, which provides oil services to state-run producer
Petroleos Mexicanos, overstated the collateral from its billings
to the company that were used to back the loans. </p>
<p>Unlike Oceanografia''s agreement with Pemex, Fermaca''s
contract with CFE doesn''t involve a third party and is
transparent, Perarnaud said. </p>
<p>Fermaca''s in the right place at the right time,Rafael Elias, a New York-based analyst at Credit Agricole SA, said in
an April 22 note to clients. These bonds should do well. </p>

<p>General Motors Co. (GM) is recalling 51,640
sport-utility vehicles to fix software that may not register
correct fuel levels, the latest in a series of safety actions
this year involving about 7 million vehicles. </p>
<p>A flawed engine-control module in some 2014 Buick Enclave,
Chevrolet Traverse and GMC Acadia SUVs may result in empty tanks
or stalled engines that could lead to crashes, according to a
notice posted today on the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration''s website. The company will recalibrate the fuel
system free of charge. </p>
<p>The planned fix follows other GM recalls including that of
2.59 million small cars for faulty ignition switches that
allowed keys to slip out of their on positions, cutting
engine power and disabling air bags. GM took a $1.3 billion
charge in the quarter ended March 31 to cover recall costs. </p>
<p>Federal safety regulators, Congress and the Justice
Department are investigating why it took the company more than a
decade to recall some of the vehicles linked to 13 deaths in
accidents. In contrast, it took GM eight days after being
notified of the fuel-gauge software flaw on April 14 to decide
on a recall, according to NHTSA documents. </p>
<p>Last July, NHTSA''s head of defects investigations
complained to GM that the company was slow to communicate,
slow to act on recall investigations. </p>
<h2>Compensation Talks </h2>
<p>In 2005, GM shrugged off complaints about faulty ignition
switches, saying the loss of power steering wasn''t a genuine
safety risk. In 2010, it recalled thousands of cars to address
just that symptom. </p>
<p>In 2011, Mary Barra, who became the automaker''s chief
executive officer in January, was told that regulators were
investigating steering problems with the Saturn Ion. GM didn''t
recall the Ions until March 2014, a day before Barra testified
to the House Energy and Commerce Committee about the unrelated
faulty ignition switches. </p>
<p>Yesterday, GM adviser Kenneth Feinberg began preliminary
talks with a lawyer for accident victims over claims stemming
from the ignition switches. Bob Hilliard, a Texas attorney,
described the conversation as a settlement meeting to
discuss compensation for about 300 victims. </p>
<p>GM lawyers also appeared in a Manhattan bankruptcy court to
fight lawsuits seeking compensation for economic losses, saying
the automaker''s government-led bankruptcy in 2009 absolved it of
such responsibility. GM has agreed to address death and injury
claims and hired Feinberg, who ran compensation funds for
victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the 2010 BP oil
spill, to advise it on a resolution. </p>
<p>Claims for economic loss can eclipse the cost of
compensating dead or injured car owners. Hilliard, who has
brought a lawsuit seeking economic damages, wants as much as $10
billion so his clients can buy new vehicles. </p>

<p>Since Ian Read became Pfizer Inc.''s
leader, he''s shed two non-drug businesses, reorganized the
company into three separate units and pursued the largest merger
in the history of the pharmaceutical industry. </p>
<p>Now, even with AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) in his sights as a takeover
target, Read said he could theoretically see a time in the
future when Pfizer splits into two parts to boost investor
value, potentially making a proposed mega-company short lived. </p>
<p>We''re not talking about a three or four-way split, we''re
talking about two major segments, said Read, 60, a native of
Scotland who started his career at Pfizer as an accountant and
became chief executive officer in 2010, </p>
<p>Pfizer never really thought of itself as three businesses,
Read said on a conference call with investors and analysts
today. It''s a shift from last year, when the company began
dividing the company into three units, each with its own leader.
Read emphasized he''s made no decision about a breakup. </p>
<p>Pfizer shares fell 2.6 percent to $29.96 at the close in
New York. The stock had gained 3.5 percent in the last 12
months, the worst performance of any major brand drugmaker on
the Standard  Poor''s 500 Pharmaceutical Index of 13 companies. </p>
<p>Pfizer last week offered about $106 billion to buy
AstraZeneca Plc, a bid that was promptly dismissed by the
London-based company. Along with the lower tax rate linked to
AstraZeneca''s U.K. base, Read has said the acquisition would
give New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of
experimental cancer drugs that use the body''s own immune system
to attack the disease. </p>
<h2>Seeking Efficiency </h2>
<p>Being bigger would also help Pfizer be more efficient,
strengthen it in key drug development areas, and give the
company more leverage against the governments and insurers
buying its products, he said during the call. </p>
<p>Immune-oncology is exciting, it''s something to hang your
hat on. But the tax stuff and the synergies are really where
this lies, said Judson Clark, an analyst with Edward Jones 
Co.  based in Des Peres, Missouri. </p>
<p>The deal to buy AstraZeneca is being looked at closely by
the U.K. government, over concerns it could reduce British
pharmaceutical industry jobs. </p>
<p>So far, it hasn''t attracted nearly the same level of
scrutiny in the U.S., where Read has said Pfizer will largely
keep its operating headquarters even as it moves its legal
residence to the U.K. for the lower tax rate. We clearly will
stay with a massive presence in the U.S. with a combined
company, he said. </p>
<p>Read declined to say when or if Pfizer might take its case
directly to AstraZeneca shareholders in a hostile takeover
attempt, though he hinted they might. </p>
<h2>Considering Options'' </h2>
<p>We are very disappointed with their unwillingness to
engage in conversations and believe it is in the best interests
of both companies and AstraZeneca and Pfizer shareholders that
we pursue a friendly negotiated transaction, Read said. We
are considering our options on how we progress these
discussions. </p>
<p>Two units inside Pfizer makes more sense than three, with
half the company focused on brand-name drugs while the other
part focuses on older products, Clark said. </p>
<p>It calls in the question why restructure into three unit
instead of two in the first place, Clark said by telephone.
They''re tacking a bit more toward the center if they do
acquire AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>Read''s comment followed a first-quarter report in which the
company''s profit beat analysts estimates while revenue fell
short of analyst expectations. </p>
<h2>Estimates Beat </h2>
<p>Earnings excluding one-time items were 57 cents a share, 2
cents above the average of 12 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue fell 9 percent to $11.4 billion as foreign exchange
rates reduced sales by 3 percent, the company said in a
statement today. Analysts expected $12.1 billion. </p>
<p>Overall, a weak quarter with disappointing revenues,
said Timothy Anderson, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein 
Co., who called it a low-quality beat of earnings estimates. </p>
<p>First-quarter net income fell 15 percent to $2.33 billion,
or 36 cents, from $2.75 billion, or 38 cents, the company said.
Pfizer said it would change its full-year earnings outlook,
though wasn''t permitted to do so now because of rules
surrounding its offer to buy the U.K. drugmaker. </p>
<p>Pfizer for the first time broke out separate financial
results for the three units. Total first-quarter drug sales fell
9 percent to $10.5 billion from a year earlier. Sales of
Prevnar, Pfizer''s pneumonia vaccine, were little changed at $927
million. Viagra, a pill for erectile dysfunction, had sales that
dropped 19 percent to $374 million. </p>
<p>The quarter''s results were helped by a 11 percent reduction
in cost of sales, which fell to $2.05 billion. Administrative
expenses declined 6 percent to $3.04 billion, and research-and-development spending decreased 5 percent to $1.62 billion. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co., the biggest U.S.
bank by assets, sees no signs of a bubble in emerging-market
corporate debt, challenging the International Monetary Fund''s
warning on rising risks in the bond market. </p>
<p>Bonds sold by developing-country companies account for just
3 percent of gross domestic product in these economies, compared
with 35 percent in the U.S., according to Joyce Chang, global
head of research at the New York-based bank. Most of the lenders
selling debt are rated investment grade or backed by their
governments while maturities have been extended, she said in a
May 2 interview. </p>
<p>The IMF warned last month that some emerging-market
companies are vulnerable to capital flight if global borrowing
costs rise further as the Federal Reserve gradually withdraws
its expansionary monetary polices. Corporate debt for developing
countries tracked by Bank of America Corp. surged to $1.1
trillion from $411 billion at the end of 2009 as companies took
advantage of low interest rates to raise cash. </p>
<p>I would reallychallenge some of the views fromofficial
creditors that emerging-market corporate debt isthe next asset
bubble, Chang, who was promoted from head of fixed-income
research last month amid a leadership reshuffle in the global
banking division, said in New York. Thecreditquality of
emerging-marketissuancehas been prettygood. </p>
<p>Olga Stankova, a spokeswoman for the IMF, didn''t respond to
a phone call and an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<h2>Crisis Catalyst </h2>
<p>Growth of emerging-market bonds is mostly driven by supply-demand imbalances rather than speculation, Chang said. </p>
<p>The rise of developing-country debt has happened after the
supply of fixed-income products from mature markets shrank
following the 2008 global financial crisis, according to Chang. </p>
<p>At the same time, banks, pension funds and insurance
companies are required to hold more bonds in their investment
portfolio as part of tighter financial regulation, boosting the
demand for emerging-market securities, she said. </p>
<p>You have a structural shift in the market with a supply
and demand imbalance and emerging marketshave benefited from
the lack of alternative investment opportunities, Chang said.
Theincrease in issuance is obviously something to flag, but
then you have to look at whetherthe issuance isshort-term debt
for refinancing.EM issuance is the longest duration within
fixed income and EM is not facing a wall of maturities. </p>
<p>The IMF said on April 9 in a report that corporate bonds of
developing nations are vulnerable in an environment of rising
global interest rates and slower growth prospects. About $740
billion, or 35 percent of emerging-market outstanding debt, may
be at risk of default in a scenario involving a 25 percent
increase in borrowing costs and a 25 percent drop in corporate
earnings, according to the Washington-based fund. </p>

<p>Even after the longest run of gains in
16 months for Poland''s zloty bonds, BNP Paribas SA and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. say there''s still reason to be bullish. </p>
<p>Government debt returned 1 percent in April and 3.6 percent
during the past three months, the longest stretch since December
2012, the Bloomberg Poland Local Sovereign Index shows. Yields
on five-year notes reached 3.53 percent, 58 basis points less
than this year''s high and 302 basis points over similar German
securities, compared with 272 on Dec. 31. </p>
<p>Policy maker Adam Glapinski told PAP newswire April 28 that
the National Bank of Poland may be free to keep its benchmark
rate at a record-low 2.50 percent until the middle of 2015 amid
consumer-price growth 2.1 percentage points below its five-year
average. BNP Paribas advises buying five-year zloty notes given
persistently low inflation and prospects of quantitative
easing by the European Central Bank, emerging-market strategists
Piotr Chwiejczak and Dina Ahmad wrote in an April 29 report. </p>
<p>Poland is one foot in the euro area and will offer a
positive real interest rate of about 2 percent in the next two
years, while Europe will show negative real rates, Chwiejczak
said by phone from London on May 2. </p>
<p>The central bank pledged in March to keep rates on hold at
least until the end of the third quarter as growth in the
European Union''s largest eastern economy accelerates without
stoking price growth. Inflation stayed unchanged at 0.7 percent
in March, leaving the real interest rate at 1.8 percent. </p>
<h2>ECB Outlook </h2>
<p>The ECB will probably keep its benchmark rate at an all-time low of 0.25 percent at the next meeting on May 8, according
to the median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey.
Policy makers will take some sort of action within two months
against the threat of low prices, which rose a less-than-forecast 0.7 percent in April, another survey showed last month. </p>
<p>Given the outlook for price growth across Europe, analysts
will probably push back forecasts for Polish rate increases,
creating scope for further bond gains, Andrew Matheny, an
analyst at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note on April 22. </p>
<p>Poland is seen raising rates by 50 basis points to 3
percent in the first three months of next year and to 3.25
percent by the end of the first half, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>More Dovish'' </h2>
<p>Our views are significantly more dovish than market
pricing in Poland on a 12-18 month horizon, which translates
into a constructive outlook on Polish bonds, Matheny wrote
in the report. He predicted a 25 basis-point increase by the end
of June 2015. The view was still valid on May 2, the bank''s
Frankfurt-based spokeswoman Katharina Jung said by e-mail. </p>
<p>Traders have scaled back bets for higher rates in Poland,
now predicting less than a quarter-point increase over the next
year, according to forward-rate agreements on May 2. That
compares with expectations for a full 25 basis-point jump in the
12 months from April 23 and more than a half-point increase in
the year from Jan. 31, the data show. </p>
<p>The zloty slipped less than 0.1 percent to 4.2077 against
the euro at 12:49 p.m. in Warsaw, taking its 2014 drop to 1.3
percent. The additional yield on Poland''s dollar bonds over
Treasuries was unchanged at 119 basis points, JPMorgan Chase 
Co. indexes show. That compares with this year''s low of 103
basis points on April 17. </p>
<p>Poland may decide to start raising rates in the fourth
quarter as the economy accelerates, Andrzej Rzonca, a member of
the central bank''s Monetary Policy Council, said in an interview
for newspaper Parkiet on May 2. </p>
<p>The sooner we raise rates, the more gradual the increases
will be and their total scale will be more limited, he said. </p>
<h2>Zloty Weakens </h2>
<p>Inflation will probably accelerate to 1.3 percent this year
from 0.9 percent in 2013, as the economy expands 3.2 percent,
double last year''s pace, according Bloomberg surveys of
economists. The central bank is targeting price growth of 2.5
percent. </p>
<p>An escalating crisis may damp economic expansion, shaving
off about 0.6 percentage point from growth in the worst-case
scenario, according to BNP''s Chwiejczak. </p>
<p>Violence increased in Ukraine''s easternmost regions as the
government pursued its offensive to dislodge rebels and the
conflict spread to the south. The easternmost area is
essentially at war, the head of the country''s anti-terrorist
agency said May 3. </p>
<p>The geopolitical situation works toward lower inflation
in Poland, further supporting zloty bonds, Chwiejczak said. </p>

<p>U.K. lawmakers decided to call
executives from Pfizer Inc. (PFE) to testify on the proposed takeover
of AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), as London Mayor Boris Johnson added his
voice to those urging caution on the deal. </p>
<p>Representatives of London-based AstraZeneca will also be
asked to appear before the House of Commons Business Committee,
the panel said in an e-mailed statement after meeting in London
today. Business SecretaryVince Cable, answering lawmakers''
concerns in the House of Commons today, said the government is
approaching the Pfizer bid from a position of neutrality. </p>
<p>Lawmakers from across Britain''s political parties have
raised questions about the offer of more than $100 billion and
are pressing for assurances that New York-based Pfizer honors
its pledge, made in a letter to Prime Minister David Cameron
last week, that it will protect jobs and investment in
pharmaceutical research and development in the U.K. </p>
<p>It would be very important to establish that Pfizer is
genuinely committed to RD in this country, Johnson, a member
of Cameron''s Conservative Party, told LBC Radio today. I
believe in principle that we should have an open system of
markets in this country, but when I look at something like
AstraZeneca and I look at an organization of that scale, of its
relative importance to the U.K. economy, the sheer percentage of
its money that goes into RD, I think it is of great importance
to Britain. </p>
<h2>Union Demand </h2>
<p>Labor unions Unite and the GMB asked for a meeting with
Cable, a member of Cameron''s Liberal Democrat coalition
partners, to urge him to impose a national interest test on
the deal. They accused Cameron and Tory Chancellor of the
Exchequer George Osborne of being supportive of the Pfizer bid
while AstraZeneca workers have not been consulted. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca is a key player in the U.K.''s advanced
manufacturing sector and as such is strategically important to
the U.K., yet David Cameron and George Osborne seem comfortable
waving the deal through, leaving any manufacturing strategy in
tatters, Unite Assistant General Secretary Tony Burke said in
an e-mailed statement. The workforce and the unions have acted
in a responsible manner and shown remarkable patience, but that
is now wearing thin. </p>
<p>Cable, who said he would be happy to meet with the unions,
insisted the government is working hard within the constraints
we have to secure a positive outcome for British jobs and
science. He said European Union rules restrict the amount that
government can intervene and British law only allows
intervention on issues of national security, media plurality and
banking. </p>
<h2>Even-Handed Neutrality'' </h2>
<p>The government must and will approach this from a
position of even-handed neutrality, Cable said in Parliament.
I''m not ruling out intervention, we have to look at all the
options open to us. </p>
<p>Cameron''s spokesman, Jean-Christophe Gray, defended the
prime minister''s involvement and repeated the government''s view
that the final decision should rest with the companies''
shareholders. </p>
<p>The government''s position is one of active engagement
with both companies in terms of assessing the link to jobs and
skills, Gray told reporters in London today. The sole basis
on which the government is engaging is with regard to
underlining the importance we attach to continuing to expand the
life-science sector in the U.K. </p>
<h2>AstraZeneca Defense </h2>
<p>AstraZeneca, which last week rejected Pfizer''s 62.6
billion-pound ($106 billion) bid, said today that its plan for
growth is working and it is aiming for annual revenues of more
than $45 billion by 2023. The company highlighted drugs it has
developed, including Brilinta and Farxiga, which it said will be
the drivers of growth. </p>
<p>The increasingly visible success of our independent
strategy highlights the future prospects for our shareholders,
Chairman Leif Johansson said in a statement. These are
benefits that should fully accrue to AstraZeneca''s
shareholders. </p>
<p>Cable praised AstraZeneca''s plans and the company''s
investment in research and development of new drugs. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca do have an ambitious and attractive long-term
investment plan which we encouraged as part of the industrial
strategy, he said. We want to see it fulfilled. </p>
<p>Science Minister David Willetts will also testify to the
House of Commons Science and Technology Committee about the
government''s involvement in the deal. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) was fined $5 million by
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for sales practices
involving initial public offerings to individual investors,
including that of Facebook Inc. (FB) </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage, the world''s largest by number
of advisers, didn''t distinguish in its policy between a client''s
indication of interest in an IPO and a conditional request to
buy, the industry-funded watchdog group said today in a
statement. The New York-based firm also failed to monitor
compliance with the policy, Finra said. </p>
<p>The fine highlights the potential pitfalls as Morgan
Stanley uses the size of its retail brokerage, with more than
$1.9 trillion in client assets, to boost its equity-underwriting
business. It was the top issuer of global IPOs from February
2012 to May 2013, the time period the fine covers. </p>
<p>Customers must understand when they are entering a
contract to buy shares in an IPO, Brad Bennett, Finra''s chief
of enforcement, said in the statement. There must not be
ambiguity regarding the customer''s obligations given the
significant legal differences between an indication of interest
and a conditional offer to buy. </p>
<p>Brokers often gauge clients'' interest in IPOs before the
offering''s registration. Indications of interest have to be
reconfirmed before becoming binding orders, while conditional
orders can be filled if they aren''t canceled. </p>
<h2>Yelp IPO </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s unclear policy and lack of training may
have resulted in the firm''s staff and customers being unsure
about the type of commitments made in 83 IPOs over the 15
months, according to Finra. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley Wealth Management is committed to offering
our clients participation in initial public offerings in
accordance with applicable Finra rules and we have enhanced our
practices on this point, Jim Wiggins, a bank spokesman, said

<p>Facebook became the largest technology IPO when it raised
$16 billion in May 2012. The underwriters split about $176
million in fees, and Morgan Stanley handled about 39 percent of
the shares. Today''s fine also covered Yelp Inc. (YELP)''s March 2012
IPO, which raised $107.3 million. </p>

second-quarter net income of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share,
beating the average of analysts'' estimates. Sales grew to $11.6
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement, exceeding
projections of $11.2 billion. </p>
<p>Frozen is working magic for Disney in home video, after
scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney''s other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. </p>
<p>The whole thing is doing well, said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital

where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding

<p>Concern that regulatory scrutiny will
curb the market for collateralized loan obligations may have
been overblown. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley raised its forecast for new CLOs in the U.S.
this year to as much as $85 billion, at least the third bank
since April to boost projections for the biggest buyers of junk
loans. JPMorgan Chase  Co. boosted its projection to as much as
$100 billion on May 2, while Wells Fargo  (WFC) Co. lifted it to as
high as $90 billion last month. </p>
<p>CLO issuance is accelerating after concern regulatory
attention would damp new formation of the funds, which provide
financing to speculative-grade companies. The Volcker Rule,
adopted in December as part of the financial overhaul mandated
by the Dodd-Frank Act, prohibits banks from investing in a CLO
that owns bonds. </p>
<p>The new issue market has shrugged off this year''s slow
start, as well as the potential regulatory headwinds from the
Volcker rule, Morgan Stanley analysts Vishwanath Tirupattur
and Mia Qian wrote in a research note today. </p>
<p>A total $12.3 billion of broadly syndicated U.S. CLOs were
formed last month, the highest monthly volume since the
financial crisis, bringing total issuance this year through
April to $31.7 billion as the investor base expanded, according
to the report. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo raised its forecast to what would potentially
be the most in seven years, according to an April 1 research
note. JPMorgan increased its projections to $90 billion to $100
billion from $60 billion to $70 billion, according to a May 2
research note. </p>
<h2>Resurging Issuance  </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) revised its forecast to $75 billion to $85
billion of CLOs, from previous projections for $55 billion to
$65 billion, according to the research note. </p>
<p>Issuance of CLOs collapsed to $20.6 billion in 2008, the
year Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. failed, from a record $104.7
billion in 2007, according to Wells Fargo. Last year''s issuance
totaled $82.6 billion. </p>
<p>CLOs were the biggest buyers of new high-yield loans last
quarter, with about 55 percent of the primary market, according
to Standard  Poor''s Capital IQ Leveraged Commentary  Data. </p>
<p>Companies have raised $223 billion of U.S. loans this year
from institutional investors such as CLOs and mutual funds,
after a record $686 billion in 2013, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Junk loans are rated below Baa3 by Moody''s Investors
Service and below BBB- at SP. </p>
<p>Prices of the debt have climbed this week to 98.47 cents on
the dollar yesterday, the highest level since February,
according to the SP/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index. </p>

<p>British and French politicians have
traditionally had diametrically opposed attitudes to takeovers
of their corporate crown jewels by foreigners. In Pfizer Inc.''s (PFE)
bid for AstraZeneca Plc (AZN), the difference is a lot smaller. </p>
<p>The offer worth more than $106 billion, the largest ever
for a U.K. company, prompted demands for guarantees on jobs,
facilities, and retaining research work from Prime Minister
David Cameron''s Conservative-led coalition. Opposition Labour
Party leader Ed Miliband called for a public-interest test
on major deals by foreign acquirers and Liberal Democrat
Business Secretary Vince Cable said he might support one. </p>
<p>With U.K. national elections a year away today, British
leaders are sounding more like their counterparts in France,
where lawmakers can intervene to stop companies deemed
strategic from being bought, and the state rarely hesitates
to get involved. President Francois Hollande said yesterday that
General Electric Co.''s proposed $17 billion acquisition of most
of Alstom SA (ALO) was not acceptable in its current form because
of its impact on employment. Cameron said today he''s not
satisfied with the Pfizer offer so far. </p>
<h2>Clear Message'' </h2>
<p>The U.K. government is reacting more strongly now to
Pfizer''s intention to take over AstraZeneca because they need to
start sending a clear message to citizens that they are
concerned about them as the next general election gets closer,
said Daniel Lacalle, a senior fund manager at Ecofin Ltd. in
London. </p>
<p>U.K. politicians'' attitudes reflect the anxieties of a
country that''s seen high-profile companies from carmakers to
confectioners absorbed by foreign buyers. </p>
<p>Unlike in the U.S., Canada, France and Australia, British
officials have no direct legal mechanism to halt foreign
acquisitions -- an absence illustrated by Kraft Foods Inc.''s
successful takeover of chocolate-maker Cadbury Plc in 2010 over
the objections of lawmakers, with the subsequent closing of a
factory in southwest England. </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne was probably too
enthusiastic in quickly hailing the Pfizer bid, which would see
the American company move its legal domicile to the U.K., as
positive for the country and an endorsement of its corporate-tax
regime, according to two government officials with knowledge of
the discussions. </p>
<h2>Legal Constraints'' </h2>
<p>Cameron''s government is now trying to show it is neutral by
stressing that it''s talking to both Pfizer and AstraZeneca, the
people said on condition of anonymity because the talks are
private. Cable told lawmakers yesterday the government is
operating within serious European legal constraints. </p>
<p>Today, the prime minister told Parliament at his weekly
question-and-answer session that evaluating the bid would
include examining its impact on jobs and science in the U.K. </p>
<p>The commitments that have been made so far are
encouraging, Cameron said. I''m not satisfied. I want more. </p>
<p>The chief executive officers of both companies will testify
before the House of Commons Business and Science Committees over
two days next week, the panels said today. </p>
<p>Cameron, Cable and Osborne have Paris to look to for a
recent example of navigating an unexpected offer from an
American company. After Bloomberg News reported GE''s Alstom bid
on April 23, French officials led by Economy Minister Arnaud Montebourg began a last-ditch effort to encourage a counterbid
from Siemens AG. Even after securing guarantees on jobs and
keeping French sites from GE CEO Jeffrey Immelt, Montebourg and
Hollande said this week the American company''s offer still isn''t
sufficient. </p>
<h2>Outside Buyers </h2>
<p>The U.K.''s generally hands-off approach to deal making has
helped make it more attractive than its neighbors to foreign
acquirers. Buyers from outside Europe have spent about $358
billion on deals in the U.K. over the last five years, not
including AstraZeneca, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That
compares with just $86 billion in France and $114 billion in
Germany. </p>
<p>A takeover of AstraZeneca would be the biggest-ever
acquisition of a U.K. company by value -- about five times
bigger than the largest transaction of the past half-decade,
Liberty Global Plc (LBTYA)''s $22 billion deal for U.K. broadband
provider Virgin Media last year. </p>
<p>A deal would also mean ceding control of a large part of
the country''s pharmaceutical infrastructure. The London-based
company has about 7,000 domestic staff, a major RD facility in
Cambridge, eastern England, and a 2,900-employee global hub for
cancer research outside Manchester in the north. </p>
<p>Pfizer, based in New York, is very unlikely to proceed with
a bid for AstraZeneca if it can''t win the blessing of Cameron''s
government, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<h2>More Difficult </h2>
<p>Even in the absence of a direct mechanism to block the
deal, the U.K. could make doing business much more difficult for
Pfizer if it chose to, especially in an industry as heavily
regulated as pharmaceuticals, the person said, asking not to be
identified discussing private deliberations. </p>
<p>According to one Cameron aide, there are many more
political risks for the government if the takeover goes ahead
than if it collapses. As with previous deals in which the
government has been involved, such as Lloyds TSB Group Plc''s
2008 rescue of HBOS Plc, ministers risk being criticized if job
losses follow or the deal is seen as a failure. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca Chairman Leif Johansson told Cameron in a May 2
phone call that even by engaging with Pfizer, the government
risked being seen as supporting the takeover, according to a
person familiar with the call. </p>
<h2>Mayor''s Concern </h2>
<p>Along with Cameron, London Mayor Boris Johnson, a possible
candidate to succeed Cameron as Tory leader, has said he''s
concerned about AstraZeneca being in foreign hands. </p>
<p>After meetings with U.K. officials, Pfizer has pledged to
keep about 20 percent of the combined group''s research staff in
the U.K. for five years. That promise comes with a caveat,
though: that Pfizer may have to adjust these obligations
should circumstances significantly change, the company said. </p>
<p>Both Cable and Miliband have said they''re worried about
Pfizer''s commitment to those promises. </p>
<p>Britain''s government is almost alone among major economies
in having never in recent years scuttled a major foreign
takeover. German Chancellor Angela Merkel''s government torpedoed
the proposed merger of BAE Systems Plc (BA/) and what''s now Airbus
Group NV (AIR) in 2012, citing concerns over the loss of German
control and jobs. </p>
<p>In recent years Canada has blocked deals by BHP Billiton (BHP)
Ltd. and Petroliam Nasional Bhd., although the latter was
eventually approved. Australia intervened last year to stop the
$2.9 billion acquisition of GrainCorp Ltd. by Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. </p>
<h2>Special Case </h2>
<p>While British politicians are clearly concerned about the
Pfizer deal, its size and relevance to high-tech research make
it a special case, said Stephen Blackshaw, a partner in London
at law firm Sidley Austin LLP. For that reason the country isn''t
likely to go down the road to a more formalized test for
foreign deals, as in Canada and Australia, he said. </p>
<p>Pfizer''s case isn''t being helped by concerns it''s moved to
shut down research after past acquisitions, and by its decision
in 2011 to close a lab in Sandwich in southeast England that
cost about 2,000 jobs. Since it bought rival Wyeth in 2009, it''s
cut $4.6 billion in research spending and narrowed its
scientific focus to six areas of medicine. Pfizer''s plan to be
domiciled in the U.K. for tax purposes would also give it a
lower tax rate. </p>
<p>I''m sure these companies are motivated by hard-headed
commercial considerations, and we should be motivated by hard-headed considerations of national interest, Cable told
lawmakers yesterday. We see the future of the U.K. as a
knowledge economy, not a tax haven. </p>

<p>Frozen continues to sizzle for
Walt Disney Co. (DIS), where quarterly profit rose 27 percent as kids
snapped up DVDs and merchandise tied to the animated mega-hit. </p>
<p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, reported
second-quarter net income of $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share,
beating the average of analysts'' estimates. Sales grew to $11.6
billion, the company said yesterday in a statement, exceeding
projections of $11.2 billion. </p>
<p>Frozen is working magic for Disney in home video, after
scoring a record $1.17 billion in worldwide ticket sales, the
most for an animated feature. The film was also the top-selling
DVD six weeks after its release, according to Rentrak Corp.
Meanwhile, Disney''s other businesses, led by TV networks such as
ESPN and its namesake theme parks, also delivered higher sales
and profit. </p>
<p>The whole thing is doing well, said Frank Beck,
president and chief investment adviser at Beck Capital
Management LLC in Austin, Texas, which holds more than 45,000
Disney shares. You talk about hitting on every cylinder. </p>
<p>Disney fell 0.9 percent to $80.29 at the close in New York.
The stock has advanced 5.1 percent this year. </p>
<p>The company generated profit growth of 15 percent or more
from its four largest divisions, including the film studio,
where earnings rose fourfold. Excluding some items, profit
totaled $1.11 a share in the quarter ended March 29, exceeding
the 96-cent average of analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Earnings at the Disney studios soared to $475 million,
reflecting home-video sales of Frozen and Thor: The Dark
World, according to the company. Revenue grew 35 percent to
$1.8 billion, Disney said. </p>
<h2>Frozen'' Assets </h2>
<p>Frozen came out in home video during the period and has
become the company''s biggest digital and Blu-ray release ever,
Robert Iger, Disney''s chairman and chief executive officer, said
yesterday on a conference call. The company is working on
related theme-park attractions and a Broadway show, with Iger
predicting revenue could last for five years. </p>
<p>Given the passion for this film and these characters is
so extraordinary, so well beyond what we ever even imagined, it
would be hard to believe that it wouldn''t sustain itself over a
fairly long period of  time, he said. </p>
<p>With help from Marvel pictures and the resurgent Disney
animation unit, film studio profit for the year may top $1

<p>If you''ve followed analyst Natalia Corfield during her stints at two of Wall Street''s biggest
banks, you know one call has been constant: her recommendation
to buy Banco BMG SA''s bonds. You also know that she''s been
right. </p>
<p>Corfield, now at JPMorgan Chase  Co., began recommending
the notes in July 2012 when she was at Deutsche Bank AG. In that
span, BMG''s $250 million of bonds due in 2020 have returned 46
percent -- more than four times the average gain for emerging-market corporate debt. </p>
<p>BMG''s decision to form a joint venture with Itau Unibanco
Holding SA, Latin America''s biggest bank, 22 months ago has
propelled its $1.1 billion of notes and prompted Corfield to
stick with her view. The bank, based in the Brazilian Corfield''s
home state of Minas Gerais before moving to Sao Paulo this year,
said April 29 it will boost its stake in the venture to 40
percent from 30 percent, adding to bond gains. The unit has
allowed BMG to obtain cheaper funding and stem losses after
Banco Cruzeiro do Sul SA''s collapse dried up funding for midsize
banks. </p>
<p>Everyone was afraid because of what happened to Cruzeiro,
but I knew BMG, Corfield, who reiterated a buy on the BMG
notes after the April 29 announcement, said by phone from New
York. It''s a very good story. The cost of funding surged after
Cruzeiro, and it decreased with the joint venture, and it will
likely drop more now. </p>
<h2>Drastically'' Reduced </h2>
<p>Yields on BMG''s bonds soared to a record 18.51 percent in
June 2012 after Cruzeiro defaulted on $1.6 billion of notes and
was seized by Brazilian regulators. A month later, BMG announced
the joint venture with Itau, which agreed to provide as much as
300 million reais ($134.6 million) per month for five years to
finance BMG''s payroll loans. The 2020 securities now yield 7.94
percent. </p>
<p>The deal has drastically reduced BMG''s funding costs as
the market prices in improvements in the bank''s performance and
margins, according to investor relations manager Danilo
Herculano Andrade Silva. BMG''s increased stake in the venture
will be reflected in the bank''s fourth-quarter earnings, he
said. </p>
<p>The lender''s net income totaled 428.5 million reais last
year, reversing a loss of 580 million reais in 2012. Net
interest margin reached 9.3 percent in 2013, 5.1 percentage
points higher than the previous year. </p>
<p>The joint venture is exceeding all our estimates, BMG''s
Silva said in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo. The
performance of the bonds shows that investors see the deal was a
success. I think we''ll still see an improvement in the market''s
perception of BMG. </p>
<h2>Huge Success'' </h2>
<p>The bank has no plans to buy back bonds and is unlikely to
increase the stake in the venture further, Silva said. </p>
<p>Marcelo Kopel, Itau''s head of investor relations, said on a
conference call with reporters April 29 that he expects Banco
Itau BMG Consignado''s loan portfolio to reach 20 billion reais
by the end of this year from about 12 billion reais now. </p>
<p>An Itau official who asked not to be named in accordance
with company policy declined to comment further on the venture
or on BMG''s bond performance when contacted by Bloomberg News. </p>
<p>The partnership has been a huge success, with the obvious
benefit being the decreased cost of funding, Jim Harper, the
head of research at BCP Securities LLC in Greenwich,
Connecticut, said in a telephone interview. The BMG bonds will
react favorably to anything that represents a move towards
integration. </p>
<h2>Yield Gap </h2>
<p>Carlos Gribel, vice president for emerging markets at INTL
FCStone Securities, said that while BMG''s notes may continue to
climb as the partnership grows, they will still trade at a
premium to Itau''s bonds. </p>
<p>Itau''s $1 billion of subordinated debt due in 2020 yields
4.38 percent, or 3.56 percentage points less than BMG''s notes. </p>
<p>BMG''s curve has climbed a lot, but the yield will not
reach Itau''s, Gribel said in a telephone interview from Miami.
It will be somewhere between mid-sized banks and Itau, because
at the end of the day, Itau doesn''t guarantee the bonds. There''s
an extra risk, and there''s a premium for that. </p>
<p>BMG''s 2020 bonds have gained 5.8 cents to 104.5 cents on
the dollar, the highest since 2011, since the bank said it will
boost its stake in the joint venture, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. While the rally will continue, further gains will
be more gradual, Corfield said. </p>
<p>This will free up capital and decrease their funding
costs even more, she said. Bondholders are seeing the
venture is working well. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which
shifted its real estate focus to lending from buying properties
after the financial crisis, completed fundraising for its second
real estate credit pool at $4.2 billion. </p>
<p>The New York-based firm raised $1.8 billion in equity
pledges from institutions and wealthy individuals, supplemented
by the same amount in borrowings and $600 million of the firm''s
own money, said Alan Kava, co-head of the real estate investing
group in Goldman''s merchant banking division. About 60 percent
of the capital pledged came from U.S. investors and most of the
rest was from Europe, with a small amount from Asian investors. </p>
<p>Goldman is competing with other private debt funds,
mortgage-oriented real estate investment trusts and banks in
offering ways to earn higher yields at a time of low interest
rates. The new vehicle will invest in Europe and the U.S.,
expanding on Goldman''s first real estate credit fund, which made
about $3.5 billion of loans, according to a marketing document. </p>
<p>We will be opportunistic in terms of where we see
value, Kava said in a telephone interview. The first fund
was U.S. only. We''re hopeful we will end up with about 50-50
between the U.S. and Europe. </p>
<p>The new Broad Street Real Estate Credit Partners II plans
to make senior loans and mezzanine loans backed by high-quality
commercial real estate, to fund acquisitions, refinancings and
recapitalizations, according to the document. It intends to
generate returns in the mid-teens by charging interest rates
of 7 percent to 10 percent and leveraging the equity. </p>
<h2>Current Yield </h2>
<p>The new fund will make and hold the loans, distributing the
interest income it receives to investors quarterly, said Peter
Weidman, the managing director who oversees the new fund. </p>
<p>What our investors like about this is it''s a current
yield so we''re not just making one-time distributions by
securitizing, Weidman said in a phone interview. </p>
<p>The new fund has invested about $500 million already, in
five deals, according to the marketing document. They include a
mezzanine loan to help finance the purchase of a group of
Southern California office buildings, and a senior loan, or
first mortgage, on a New York City rental apartment building
that''s being converted to for-sale condominiums. Higher-yielding
mezzanine loans are used to fill the gap between first mortgages
and equity. </p>
<p>Goldman''s first real estate credit fund, known as Real
Estate Mezzanine Partners, made 28 investments, about two-thirds
of which were senior mortgages and one-third mezzanine loans,
according to the marketing document. </p>
<p>We have a competitive advantage by focusing on larger
deals and being able to provide the entire loan to our
borrowers, Weidman said. We see less competition in the
larger loan space. </p>
<p>The new fund has an investment period of three years, with
possible extensions, according to the marketing document. </p>

<p>A potential raised bid for AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN) means that Pfizer Inc. (PFE) would have to generate more than $2
billion in annual savings from the deal, and that job cuts are

<p>AstraZeneca, the U.K.''s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
Pfizer''s offer last week of more than $106 billion, about 50
pounds a share, some 32 percent of which is in cash. At that
price, Pfizer would have to save at least $2 billion for the bid

<p>That amount would rise to at least $3 billion if the New
York-based company raised its bid to 55 pounds a share, and
Pfizer may need to increase the cash portion to 40 percent,

to the current cash offer, the savings may have to exceed $3.5
billion, approaching a prohibitive level in terms of U.K.
job reductions, he wrote. </p>

<h2>Swedish Workers </h2>
<p>Pfizer''s global RD workforce totals about 10,880 and
AstraZeneca''s about 9,000, according to estimates by Bloomberg
Industries. With fewer than 20 percent of those jobs in the
U.K., job cuts may occur outside Britain, said Asthika Goonewardene, a London-based analyst at Bloomberg Industries. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca employs about 5,900 people in Sweden, home of
predecessor company Astra AB. Sweden, unlike the U.K., hasn''t
received any promises on jobs from Pfizer. </p>
<p>Pfizer may be more likely to cut its own RD operations
than eliminate jobs in the U.K. because of tax benefits, said
Fabian Wenner, an analyst at Kepler Cheuvreux in Zurich. Keeping
research operations in Britain enables Pfizer to say that
products were invented in the U.K., and use the country''s lower
tax rate, Wenner said. Pfizer''s tax rate is 27.4 percent, while
AstraZeneca''s is 21.3 percent, according to Fazeli. </p>
<h2>Lower Taxes </h2>
<p>They want to lower the tax rate for the overall group by
implementing transfer pricing, which you can only get when you
have sufficient RD in the lower tax regime, Wenner said. It
would make more sense to save 15 to 20 percent of Pfizer RD. It
would make sense from a both a political point of view and a tax
point of view. </p>
<p>Manufacturing jobs in Britain could also be preserved in
this way, Wenner said. The most probable positions to be
eliminated would be in sales and administration, he said. </p>
<p>Typically, a merger results in cost reductions equivalent
to about 10 percent of the target''s global sales, Wenner said.
In this case, Pfizer may cut $3.3 billion in costs, which
include a 10 percent decrease in cost of goods sold, 20 percent
of sales and administrative costs and 20 percent of research and
development costs. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which wagered more than $300 billion last year on things like yen rates and bond spreads, just laid down a bet that guys like Nelson Johnny Aguilar can stay out of jail. </p> <p>Aguilar was at a Dunkin'' Donuts near Boston on a Sunday night in March when a shooting outside left a 21-year-old man with a bullet wound to the gut, police said. They arrested Aguilar, a 19-year-old gang member with a criminal record and a tattoo that says Life''s a Gamble. </p> <p>Such crime-blotter moments are Goldman''s concern thanks to a financial product called a social-impact bond. Goldman is anchoring a $21 million plan to help a Boston-area nonprofit called Roca expand its efforts to steer young men like Aguilar away from dealing drugs, stealing cars or committing assaults and murders. </p> <p>Under the deal, if men targeted by Roca spend 22 percent fewer days in jails and prisons than their peers, Massachusetts would save enough to repay Goldman''s $9 million loan. An even bigger drop in recidivism would hand Goldman as much as $1 million in profit. If Roca fails and too many men end up behind bars, Goldman will lose almost everything it ventured. </p> <p>It''s not that different than if you were looking at any company to invest in, said Andrea Phillips, vice president of Goldman''s Urban Investment Group, who leads the bank''s social-impact bond transactions. You''re relying on a management team. You''re relying on their human capital, their folks who work at the plant and deliver and do what they''re supposed to do. </p> <h2>Bottom Line </h2> <p>Young men like Aguilar are part of the bottom line: Each participant Roca keeps out of jail for a year saves Massachusetts $12,400, the state calculated. If it can close a 300-person facility and keep from expanding jail space, it could save $47,500 per person per year. </p>

<p>Todd Vitale, a personal trainer who opened his own gym last year, said he was having difficulty getting a mortgage of more than $700,000 to buy a home in Greenwich, Connecticut, because his new business was untested. </p> <p>Vitale then tried Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC), the biggest U.S. home lender, where he kept most of his savings in an account he opened more than a decade ago, he said. He worked with the bank''s private mortgage unit, whose clients are entitled to loans of up to $6 million and personalized service, and had the opportunity to explain that he had already run a similar business and could make the gym succeed. Wells Fargo approved his 30-year fixed-rate mortgage of more than $700,000, he said. </p> <p>I don''t think I would have gotten a loan unless Wells Fargo private mortgage gave me a shot, said Vitale, 38, who moved in to his new 3,000 square-foot home in February. I would have had to walk away from the home. </p> <p>Jumbos, or loans of at least $417,000 in most areas, are one of the few thriving pieces of an otherwise shrinking mortgage market. The biggest banks, including San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Bank of America Corp., are ratcheting up efforts to win wealthier borrowers while keeping credit tight for almost everyone else. Lenders are allowing assets in accounts to serve as collateral in lieu of down payments, cutting rates if customers have or set up investment accounts, rolling out new adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages, and accepting lower down payments. </p> <h2>Applications Increase </h2> <p>Jumbos are growing while almost everything else is dead, said Paul Miller, a banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. based in Arlington, Virginia. Big banks need loan growth. If they were getting decent commercial loan growth, they wouldn''t be so aggressive on competing for jumbos. </p> <p>Applications for jumbo mortgages of at least $729,000 increased 4.9 percent in March from a year earlier, while requests for loans of less than $150,000 fell by 21 percent, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average purchase application loan amount reached $280,500 in the week ended April 18, the highest since the survey started in January 1990, the MBA said. </p> <p>Jumbos, also called non-conforming loans because they exceed the limit for government-backed Fannie Mae (FMCC) and Freddie Mac to guarantee, are loans of more than $625,500 in pricier markets such as Manhattan and Los Angeles. They''re generally made to the most creditworthy borrowers with FICO scores of 760 on average and held by banks instead of being packaged into securities and sold to investors. </p> <h2>Job Cuts </h2> <p>Plunging mortgage lending at Wells Fargo and JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. mortgage lender, dragged down their first-quarter earnings. Both banks are paring staff, with New York-based JPMorgan reducing the number of jobs at its mortgage unit by 30 percent, or 14,000 positions, since the start of last year. Wells Fargo got rid of 1,100 jobs in its residential mortgage business in the first quarter to keep expenses in line with demand for loans. Bank of America, the fourth-largest mortgage lender, swung to a surprise loss in the first quarter on costs tied to mortgage disputes. </p> <p>Refinancing, which drove lenders'' profits last year, fell in the week ended April 25 to the lowest level since 2008, according to the MBA, after increases in borrowing rates. While the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage declined to 4.21 percent this week, it''s still up almost a full percentage point from a near-record low last May, data from Freddie Mac show. </p> <h2>Lower Rates </h2> <p>That level of drop sends everyone everywhere looking for business, said Joel Kan, director of economic forecasting at Washington-based MBA. </p> <p>Lenders are also vying for jumbos since they don''t have to pay higher guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to insure the bonds, as they do with conforming loans, said Richard Lepre, an Alamo, California-based loan officer with RPM Mortgage. That means they can charge lower rates on jumbos, making them more attractive than traditional loans. </p> <p>The rate at Wells Fargo for a 30-year fixed jumbo mortgage was 4.13 percent as of yesterday, compared with 4.25 percent for a conventional 30-year fixed loan. </p> <p>JPMorgan modified its guidelines in the third quarter for making jumbo loans to take into account a client''s total assets at the bank. The bank made the change after seeing that customers who had long-term relationships with JPMorgan were less likely to default on their loans. </p> <h2>Leverage Relationships </h2> <p>The lender created a separate process last year to review all declined loans to ensure those decisions made sense. It also set up a group that works with wealthy clients who have more complex financial situations, such as self-employed borrowers. </p> <p>We leverage relationships to let the customers know we really want to do business with them, said Lesley Corydon, a senior vice president in the private client mortgage group at JPMorgan. </p> <p>JPMorgan''s jumbo mortgage originations represented 21 percent of its total originations in the first quarter of 2014 compared with 10 percent a year earlier, according to the bank. </p> <p>Customers of Chase Private Client, who have assets ranging from about $500,000 to $5 million in total wealth, increasingly are opting to use their deposits and investments as collateral when borrowing. Some clients use the credit as bridge loans or to make larger down payments. </p> <p>Vitale, the trainer who works with high school and college athletes at his Division 1 Prep gym, said he considered going to a non-bank, such as a hedge fund, for his home loan. He said he was dissuaded by the high rates and hoops he would have had to jump through to get the loan, compared with getting his Wells Fargo mortgage. </p> <h2>100% Financing </h2> <p>We are pleased to know that Mr. Vitale received assistance with his home lending needs, said Emmanuel Vuillequez, product manager for non-conforming mortgages at Wells Fargo. </p> <p>Last year, Wells Fargo created a team of 400 underwriters spread across six U.S. locations who just focus on jumbo loans. The bank is trying to win more jumbo business through better execution, deploying specially trained underwriters who can handle complicated deals and complete them by the closing date, Vuillequez said. </p> <p>Jumbo lenders are looking for ways to distinguish themselves from other jumbo lenders, said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication in Bethesda, Maryland. Jumbo lending was the bright star of the mortgage market last year, so everyone is looking to ride that momentum into 2014. </p> <p>At Bank of New York Mellon Corp., where the average size of a mortgage is $1 million, clients can get 100 percent financing. They don''t have to put any money down and can instead pledge assets in investment accounts as collateral, said Bill Sappington, head of private banking at the New York-based firm. </p> <h2>Smaller Deposits </h2> <p>BNY Mellon earlier this year started offering customers the option to lock in mortgage rates for 90 days, instead of the typical 30-day term. The additional days give them more time to close knowing the rate is secure. </p> <p>Bank of America in October reduced the down payment to 15 percent from 20 percent for most jumbos of less than $1 million. Existing customers at the bank may receive discounts on their mortgages based on their level of business with the firm, said Susan Atran, a Bank of America spokeswoman. </p> <p>At the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank, nonconforming mortgage originations were 37 percent of overall loans made during the first quarter compared with 22 percent a year earlier, according to the firm. </p> <p>RPM Mortgage this year began offering new jumbo adjustable-rate mortgages with initial low rates. One of their loan products provides a fixed rate for five years at a maximum of 2.63 percent, and then resets once during the next five years to no more than 4.63 percent, Lepre said. </p> <h2>Jumbo Defaults </h2> <p>Jumbo originations are still lower than they were before the financial crisis. A decade ago, jumbo ARMs helped fuel the housing bubble by letting buyers qualify for homes they could only afford at the low rates before they reset. </p> <p>When home prices stopped climbing in mid-2006, both jumbo and conventional ARM borrowers began defaulting in higher numbers, contributing to the collapse of the mortgage market that in turn led to the most severe financial crisis in decades. </p> <p>Today, demand for jumbos is growing as borrowers resume buying second homes or investment properties, according to Chase''s Corydon. Banks are often fighting for loans in the $1 million to $2 million range, said Mike McPartland, head of lending for Citigroup Inc.''s (C) private bank in North America. </p> <p>If in the past, I was competing with two private banks, now it feels like I''m competing with two private banks and two regional lenders for that $2 million mortgage, said McPartland, whose clients generally have at least $25 million in net worth. The benefit to working with a bank that knows you is we don''t treat a mortgage like an isolated financial transaction. </p> <p> ', 'JPMorgan Joins Wells Fargo in Rolling Out Jumbo Offerings', 'By Alexis Leondis', 'May 09, 2014 11:14 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-09/jpmorgan-joins-wells-fargo-in-rolling-out-jumbo-offerings.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>AstraZeneca rejected the bid of about $106 billion from
Pfizer earlier this month. Buying the company would give Pfizer
a lower tax rate and a portfolio of experimental cancer drugs.

testify to U.K. lawmakers next week amid political tension over
public-interest issues related to the takeover. </p>
<p>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said on BBC
Radio 4 today that the government wants to clarify what a deal
would mean for British scientific research and jobs. Lawmakers
are prepared to negotiate hard as they engage both companies, he
said. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca shareholders will get an immediate benefit
from the cash that we would pay them, Pfizer''s Read said. It
allows them to participate in a very strong combined company
with great cash flows and a great portfolio, and it allows a
very efficient allocation of capital. </p>
<p>Improving the efficiency of the organization and the
ability to liberate the balance sheet and tax of the combined

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read faces heightened public scrutiny of his bid for
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) this week when he''ll be questioned by lawmakers
on his commitment to the U.K. in hearings broadcast live. </p>
<p>Read has been summoned by separate parliamentary committees
to testify on the U.S. company''s offer of about $106 billion for
London-based AstraZeneca, the biggest takeover bid in U.K.
history. He and AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot are scheduled to
appear before the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee
tomorrow and the Science and Technology Committee on May 14. </p>
<p>The hearings in London provide a first opportunity for
lawmakers to question the pharmaceutical executives amid growing
public and political concern that a takeover would mean job
losses and cuts to research. As executives from Rupert Murdoch
to Robert Diamond have learned, lawmakers acting in the name of
British taxpayers can force company changes to assuage public
concerns. </p>
<p>The entire political class and media will be spending a
couple of hours listening to Pfizer''s business and intellectual
case for the takeover, said Richard Berry, managing director
of Democratic Audit, a charity that has studied the work of
parliamentary committees. Sessions where people get a grilling
get a lot of attention and I''m sure the media will highlight the
most aggressive part. </p>
<h2>Video Appearances </h2>
<p>Read may have pre-empted some of the questions he is likely
to face with videos posted on Pfizer''s website over the weekend
in which he outlined the case for the bid, stressing his
company''s commitment to research and explaining its decision to
shutter a plant in Sandwich, England, in 2011. Pfizer''s
commitment to the new AstraZeneca headquarters being built in
Cambridge, eastern England, fits the company''s record of
bringing together scientists at its research hub in the U.S.,
Read said. </p>
<p>In the U.K. I see great similarities with Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where you have this hub of innovation, this hub
of young scientists, he said. The strategy to build a center
in Cambridge in fact is in line with our strategy as we''ve shown
by what we''ve done in Massachusetts. </p>
<p>When Read first approached ministers after announcing the
bid, Conservatives including Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne welcomed it as a vote of confidence in the U.K. Since
then, ministers have grown more cautious, demanding assurances
about jobs and research spending. According to one person
familiar with the company''s plans, Pfizer won''t proceed with the
bid if the U.K. government is hostile. </p>
<h2>Bitter Experience'' </h2>
<p>Bitter experience in other contexts has taught us about
the importance of really pinning these commitments down and not
just allowing them to rest as aspirations but to make sure they
are exacting, binding commitments, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said in an interview with Sky News broadcast yesterday.
There are various ways that they could be made more solid and
that''s exactly the kind of thing we''re discussing with Pfizer. </p>
<p>The most hostile questioning may come from members of the
opposition Labour Party, whose leader Ed Miliband has accused
Prime Minister David Cameron of being a cheerleader for the
takeover. Conservatives will also want to be seen to be asking
tough questions to demonstrate they are pursuing due diligence. </p>
<p>Frankly, we have not seen any guarantees from Pfizer that
they have an investment plan that is equal to what AstraZeneca
are putting into the science base over the next 10 years,
William Bain, a Labour lawmaker on the Business Committee, said
in an interview. Pfizer does have a record of launching
takeovers for other pharmaceutical companies and then seeing a
reduction in investment in research and development. </p>
<h2>Executive Roll-call </h2>
<p>Tomorrow''s session will begin at 9:30 a.m. in London with
evidence from union officials. At 10 a.m., Read will be joined
by Frank D''Amelio, the company''s chief financial officer, and
Jonathan Emms, its U.K. managing director. Their testimony is
scheduled to end at 11:15 a.m., when Soriot, flanked by Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca''s executive vice president, and Ian Brimicombe, vice president in charge of corporate finance, will
make the case against the takeover. </p>
<p>The main issue is to understand what Pfizer''s commitments
to the U.K. are and how binding they are, Julian Huppert, a
lawmaker who represents Cambridge, said in an interview. The
deal is driven by their desire to avoid paying tax in the U.S. </p>
<p>The British government''s patent box allows companies to
pay reduced tax on products spun out of research done in the
U.K. For Huppert, it makes Pfizer''s attachment to Britain shaky. </p>
<h2>U.S. Pressure </h2>
<p>Pfizer is also facing political pressure in the U.S., where
the New York-based company has said it plans to keep its
operating headquarters even as it moves its legal address to the
U.K. for a lower tax rate. </p>
<p>In the videos at the weekend, Read sought to shift the
emphasis away from tax and onto the business case for the
takeover, which AstraZeneca''s board has rejected. </p>
<p>We liked where their science is being done, which is in
the U.K. We liked the complementary nature of the portfolio,
he said. The approach was, he said, a win-win for society, a
win-win for shareholders, and a win-win for stakeholders. </p>
<p>British parliamentary committees, originally introduced to
scrutinize the work of government, have become increasingly
willing to intervene in matters of more general interest. </p>
<p>In 2012, the Treasury Committee summoned Diamond, then CEO
of Barclays Plc, to explain the Libor-rigging scandal. He
resigned before he got there, despite investor support, after
politicians on all sides made him a target. </p>
<h2>Foam Pie </h2>
<p>Murdoch, chairman of News Corp., made it through three
hours of testimony to parliament''s culture committee on the
phone-hacking scandal in 2011. He emerged unscathed barring a
foam-pie assault by a member of the public after telling members
that his appearance was the most humble day of my life. His
son James wasn''t so lucky, with his account of events disputed
by two former executives. </p>
<p>The first sign of whether the U.K. government''s view on
Pfizer and AstraZeneca has shifted as a result of the testimony
will come at 1 p.m. tomorrow, when Business Secretary Vince Cable responds. </p>
<p>Cable has been examining how Pfizer''s proposed takeover
could be blocked on public-interest grounds, including the
possibility of referring the case to the European Commission or
proposing a change to the Enterprise Act that would widen the
public-interest test for takeovers, a person familiar with
discussions in government said on May 9. </p>
<p>I will do whatever is right for Britain, I will always
stand up for British jobs, British interests, British science,
British RD, Cameron said when asked on BBC TV yesterday about
toughening up the law on takeovers. But when we think of that,
it is important to make the point that Britain benefits

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE), the U.S. drugmaker
seeking to acquire AstraZeneca (AZN) Plc, sold $4.5 billion of bonds
to repay securities that mature within a year. </p>
<p>The offering, which was increased from $4.25 billion,
included $1.5 billion of 2.1 percent, five-year notes that
yielded 48 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Proceeds of the issue will be used to repay 900 million
euros ($1.2 billion) of 4.75 percent notes due in December, and
a portion of the company''s $3 billion of 5.35 percent notes due
March 2015, according to a regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>The bond sale comes as the biggest U.S. drugmaker is
offering about $106 billion for London-based AstraZeneca. Along

New York-based Pfizer a promising new generation of experimental
cancer drugs that use the body''s own immune system to attack the

entail borrowing more than $30 billion, Carol Levenson, a
New York-based analyst at Gimme Credit LLC, wrote in a report

<p>Chevron Corp., the world''s third-largest energy company by market value, became the first major
international oil producer to reveal partnership plans with
state-run Petroleos Mexicanos since Mexico signed landmark
legislation to reopen its doors to foreign producers. </p>
<p>Chevron, (CVX) which operates several rigs on the U.S. side of
the Gulf of Mexico, is in talks with Mexico City-based Pemex for
exploration opportunities in deepwater, shallow water or shale,
Ali Moshiri, Chevron''s president of Latin America and Africa,
said today during a conference in Mexico City. Chevron produces
more crude in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico than anyone
except Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc, according to the U.S.
Interior Department. </p>
<p>We are not here to replace Pemex, said Moshiri, who
oversees exploration and production projects from Argentina to
Angola. We are not here to change their strategy. We are here
to complement what they are doing. </p>
<p>Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is waiting for the
passage of Mexico''s secondary energy legislation before deciding
the sites of the first partnerships in Mexico. The legislation,
which will determine Pemex''s participation in new projects and
the tax structure for private companies joining the newly opened
energy market, could be approved as soon as June, according to
Mexico''s two largest political parties. </p>
<h2>Investment Options </h2>
<p>Mexico passed an energy law last year that ended Pemex''s
75-year production monopoly to allow for private firms to tap
the country''s 13.44 billion barrels of proven oil reserves.
Private investment is anticipated to generate an additional $30
billion annually and create as many as 2 million jobs, Mexico''s
energy ministry has said. </p>
<p>We look for the opportunity that brings the most value to
the Mexican government, the Mexican people, and our
shareholders, Moshiri said. We are a huge company. We can
invest money in conventional, deepwater, or shallow water. What
drives our decision is really to see what is the best for
everybody. </p>
<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc are the world''s
first- and second-biggest energy companies by market value.
Pemex and Exxon signed a technical collaboration agreement last
year before the energy law was approved by President Enrique
Pena Nieto in December. </p>
<p>We are going to align our strategic direction in Mexico
with Pemex, Moshiri said. Our future in Mexico is based on
building this exisiting partnership. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO) will become Keurig
Green Mountain Inc. (GMCR)''s largest shareholder after raising its
stake to 16 percent, doubling down on the maker of Keurig coffee
brewers at a time when consumers are increasingly shunning
sugary sodas. </p>
<p>Keurig jumped 7.6 percent to $119.07 after Coca-Cola
announced the plan in a filing today. The soft-drink company
will own about 26 million shares within nine months after it
exercises an option to add additional stock. It had bought an
initial stake of 10 percent in February. </p>
<p>The investment fits into Coca-Cola''s strategy of taking
equity stakes in promising new brands and technologies as
healthier habits hits its main revenue growth. The companies are
working together on the Keurig Cold single-cup beverage system
that will be sold in Keurig''s fiscal 2015, starting later this
year. The coffee maker will also produce and sell Coca-Cola-branded pods to go with the machine. </p>

<h2>SodaStream Competition </h2>
<p>Under today''s agreement, Coca-Cola owns about 19.5 million
shares and has the right to buy as much as 6.5 million more. The
company signed a pact with Credit Suisse Group AG to purchase
the balance of the stake by Feb. 13, 2015. The bank will set the

<p>International Business Machines (IBM) Corp.
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty will face a skeptical
audience when she speaks to Wall Street analysts tomorrow. </p>
<p>As she''s worked to revamp the company in a shifting
technology industry, Rometty has kept herself bound to IBM''s
target of at least $18 a share in adjusted earnings this year --
a number that 60 percent of analysts anticipate the company will
miss. After eight consecutive quarters of revenue declines, she
must start increasing sales or reduce expenses further to avoid
missing the profit goals. </p>
<p>At a daylong conference in New York, Rometty, 56, will
probably lay out her plan to use newer technology, such as data
analytics and cloud computing, to mount a strong comeback in the
coming quarters. The question is whether those lines of business
can expand quickly enough to make up for falling sales in IBM''s
hardware unit and in emerging markets like China. </p>
<p>There has to be intense pressure on her to carry out the
execution of the plan, Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones
 Co., said in an interview from St. Louis. The concern is
largely about the way to get there. He advises buying the
shares and estimates IBM will hit the $18 target. </p>
<p>Mike Fay, an IBM spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<p>We''re transitioning to key growth areas and transforming
parts of the business, Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said on a conference call last month. We''re
continuing to make investments in key growth areas such as
mobility, security and cloud, and these initiatives are gaining
traction but are not yet at scale. </p>
<p>Abandon Roadmap? </p>
<p>Those changes need to happen more quickly, and Rometty
should consider dropping her earnings targets so she can focus
on the transition, said Ben Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Plc. </p>
<p>Given the deterioration in earnings quality and revenue
challenges, we believe it makes sense for IBM to abandon its
roadmap and change its business model, he said in a research
note. The company needs to more aggressively shift to providing
technology as a service rather than a product, he said. He has
the equivalent of a neutral rating and estimates IBM will report
adjusted earnings of $17.80 this year, short of its target. </p>
<p>IBM shares are up 2.5 percent this year, in line with the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. They fell less than 1 percent to
$192.19 at the close today in New York. Eight analysts advise
buying the stock, while 24 say to hold and three recommend
selling. </p>
<p>After a 30-year career at IBM, Rometty stepped into the
role of CEO in 2012 amid sweeping changes in the industry. Her
company is still adjusting to the upheaval in the technology
world. </p>
<p>Technology customers are increasingly storing data and
software on cloud-computing networks, rather than on site,
limiting their need for servers and mainframes and the IBM
consultants needed to install and maintain them. While the
company has shifted its focus to cloud services and data
analytics to keep up, the effort has not been enough to
reinvigorate sales growth. </p>
<h2>Hardware Slump </h2>
<p>Lagging demand for IBM''s hardware division continues to
drag down revenue, with the unit''s sales falling 23 percent to
$2.4 billion in the first quarter. Revenue in developing
countries slid 11 percent, or 5 percent when adjusting for
currency fluctuations. Revenue from China fell 20 percent. </p>
<p>Tomorrow''s meeting with analysts gives Rometty and her
executive team a chance to show how their more recent
investments will produce more revenue. </p>
<p>IBM has implemented significant actions as it shifts
toward a higher valued-added mix; by no means is the company
standing still, Jim Kelleher, an analyst at Argus Research in
New York, said in a note. IBM has also shown an ability to
align costs in periods of challenging revenue growth. He has a
hold rating on the shares and estimates IBM will fall short of
its target with earnings of $17.96 a share this year. </p>
<h2>New Products </h2>
<p>The company will probably highlight newer products tomorrow
like the cloud offerings from SoftLayer Technologies Inc., which
it acquired last year, or the Watson cognitive-computing tool,
said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.
In a note to investors, he questioned whether those initiatives
are incremental for the company or can actually help boost sales
growth. He has the equivalent of a hold rating on the shares and
estimates IBM will hit its $18 target. </p>
<h2>Cloud Promise </h2>
<p>IBM has held up cloud computing as one of its biggest
opportunities for growth. Cloud revenue grew more than 50
percent last quarter, and cloud offerings delivered as a service
are now on pace to generate about $2.3 billion a year. That''s
still a fraction of IBM''s total $100 billion in annual sales. </p>
<p>While it searches for growth, IBM is also cutting expenses
and shedding less profitable businesses. Earlier this year,
China''s Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) agreed to buy IBM''s low-end server
business for $2.3 billion. The deal is awaiting government
review before closing, and the companies must convince U.S.
officials that the transaction won''t give China back-door access
to secrets and infrastructure. </p>
<h2>Job Cuts </h2>
<p>Lower tax rates have also helped profits continue to grow,
and a surge in buybacks has helped IBM hit its targets for
earnings per share. It also took an $870 million charge last
quarter to cut jobs, and has changed the information it provides
in U.S. severance packages in a way that may help reduce age-discrimination lawsuits, according to lawyers and labor law
experts. IBM said the changes were made to protect worker
privacy. </p>
<p>The company''s cost-cutting moves helped lift adjusted
profit to $16.28 a share last year, up 40 percent from 2010. </p>
<p>For this year, the average estimate of 25 analysts is for
$17.88 a share in adjusted earnings, less than the company''s $18
target. Next year''s average analyst estimate of $19.79 a share
also falls short of a $20 goal. </p>
<p>IBM has said it can meet its forecasts, even as costs mount
in its pursuit of the goals. IBM''s debt has climbed, and its
cash balance has dropped, partly because of spending on stock
repurchases -- spending that could have gone to acquisitions or
other investments. </p>
<p>Some Wall Street analysts, such as Morningstar Inc.''s Peter Wahlstrom, argue that Rometty shouldn''t be trying to hit the
targets. Yardsticks like revenue and free cash flow are more
important than earnings per share anyway, Wahlstrom said. He has
a hold rating and estimates IBM''s adjusted earnings will fall
short of the target at $17.47 a share this year. </p>
<p>Those are things that can be kind of managed, he said
of earnings per share. You don''t really give a company credit
for that. </p>
<p>Numbers to watch include: </p>
<p>*Free cash flow: CFO Schroeter said last month that the company
expects at least $16 billion for the year, up from $15 billion
in 2013. </p>
<p>Given that non-operating forces have a limited impact on
FCF vs. EPS (buybacks, tax rate, one-time gains, etc), we expect
investors to remain focused on this metric and to look for both
upside and downside risk at the analyst day, Bernstein''s
Sacconaghi said in a note. </p>
<p>*Acquisitions: IBM said in 2010 it planned to spend $20 billion
on acquisitions through 2015. With revenue declining, some
analysts say a large acquisition could be warranted. </p>
<p>Given the ongoing challenges with weak organic revenue
(especially in hardware), IBM may need to do a large deal to
help stabilize the revenue, Reitzes of Barclays said in a
note. </p>

<p>Anthony Noto, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc.''s head banker on Twitter Inc.''s initial public offering
last year, is leaving to join hedge-fund firm Coatue Management
LLC. </p>
<p>Dan Dees, who became co-head of technology, media and
telecommunications banking with Noto earlier this year, will
become sole leader of the group, according to an internal memo.
David Wells, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed
the contents of the memo. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was the top-ranked adviser on mergers and
acquisitions involving technology, media and telecommunications
companies last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Noto, 46, rejoined the firm in 2010 after leaving in 2008 to
become chief financial officer of the National Football League. </p>
<p>Coatue, which manages about $9.2 billion, was founded in
1999 by Philippe Laffont, who worked for Julian Robertson at
Tiger Management LLC, according to a regulatory filing last
month. Coatue managed the 20th-most-profitable hedge fund in the
world last year, according to Bloomberg Rankings. The New York-based firm has made investments in technology companies such as
Snapchat Inc. and Flipboard Inc. </p>
<p>Anthony is a key addition to our private investing
effort, helping us build on the momentum we have established,
Laffont said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Noto''s move was reported earlier today by website Re/Code. </p>
<h2>Big Personalities'' </h2>
<p>Simon Holden, Nick Giovanni and Michael Ronen will become
co-chief operating officers of the group at Goldman Sachs,
according to the memo. Holden runs the telecommunications sector
and leads the TMT group in Europe. Giovanni is head of the
Internet sector, while Ronen leads the media and
telecommunications MA business in the Americas. </p>
<p>Dees was co-head of the investment-banking division for
Asia Pacific ex-Japan before moving back to the U.S. to take the
TMT job. George Lee and Gene Sykes will remain co-chairmen of
the TMT group, according to a memo sent by investment banking
co-heads Richard Gnodde, David Solomon and John Weinberg. </p>
<p>Deals in technology, media and telecom are really
interesting to the world, they involve really big
personalities, Lee said in a March interview. It''s a big
revenue and profit contributor, and it''s so high-profile that
our success there has an overweight impact on the way people
perceive our overall franchise. </p>
<h2>West Point </h2>
<p>Noto, a football player at the U.S. Military Academy at
West Point, New York, trained to be a member of the Army Rangers
and spent time in the Middle East while serving as a signal
officer in the infantry. He was a research analyst covering
Internet companies in his first stint at Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>Since returning to the firm, Noto has competed with Morgan
Stanley (MS) for the lead spot on a string of high-profile IPOs.
Goldman Sachs led the offerings for Yelp Inc. and Twitter, while
Morgan Stanley won the prime spot on LinkedIn Corp. and Facebook
Inc. </p>
<p>My last four years at Goldman Sachs have been as equally
rewarding as the first nine years, Noto said in an e-mailed
statement. The TMT franchise has never been stronger and I
look forward to seeing the continued success of such a fantastic
team and to working with the firm as a client. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) introduced a lower-priced option for its Xbox One, seeking to take back the lead in
video-game console sales from Sony Corp. (6758) </p>
<p>The new version, which will cost $399 and won''t include the
Kinect motion-sensing camera, will be available on June 9 in all
markets where Xbox One is available, the Redmond, Washington-based company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>The move reverses a controversial decision by Microsoft to
bundle Xbox One with Kinect, increasing the price of the console
to $499, or $100 more than Sony''s PlayStation 4. Although
Microsoft had insisted it needed Kinect to convince game
developers to write software for the motion sensor, Sony''s big
lead is prompting Microsoft to change its strategy. The
PlayStation 4 outsold Xbox One consoles in the U.S. in March,
holding the lead for a third month. </p>
<p>The vision we have had for Xbox One continues, and that
is that the premium experience is with Kinect, Yusuf Mehdi,
Xbox vice president for strategy and marketing, said in an
interview. We did get a lot of customer feedback since launch
from people saying I''d like more choices,'' and for some people
$399 is an important price point, </p>
<p>Microsoft will also start giving users more access to
entertainment applications such as YouTube, Netflix and HBO GO,
changing another policy that annoyed customers. The company had
required users to pay for an Xbox Live Gold subscription to use
such apps. Starting in June, anyone with an Xbox One and Xbox
360 can use those apps. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is betting the
world''s biggest bond gains are far from over. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank bought $3.25 billion of Argentine
bonds from Repsol SA (REP) as a wager the notes will rally and hasn''t
hedged them, according to a person with direct knowledge of the
bank''s strategy. It paid $2.8 billion for the 10-year debt, or
about 86.6 cents on the dollar, and will keep some of the bonds
longer-term, said the person, who asked not to be identified
because he wasn''t authorized to speak publicly about the matter. </p>
<p>Argentina''s bonds, rated seven levels below investment
grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most among
emerging-market government debt, as the country repairs ties
with the International Monetary Fund and seeks to stem a drop in
the foreign reserves it uses to pay debt. The government gave
the Bonar notes due in 2024 to Madrid-based Repsol as
compensation after seizing 51 percent of YPF SA two years ago,
as part of a package with a total face value of $5.32 billion. </p>
<p>People were aching to be a part of the Argentine story,
Patrick Esteruelas, senior sovereign analyst at Emso Partners
Ltd., which oversees about $2 billion, said in an interview in
New York. It''s a junk credit, but it''s a credit that people
are evaluating as part of a broad convergence play. </p>
<h2>Repsol Deal </h2>
<p>JPMorgan sold some of the notes and will keep some with the
intent to sell at a profit, the person said, without giving
amounts. Veronica Espinosa, a spokeswoman for the bank, declined
to comment on the deal. </p>
<p>Repsol sold the 2024 bonds to JPMorgan and agreed not to
sell the remaining notes for seven days after the transaction
closes, according to a May 9 regulatory filing. </p>
<p>JPMorgan sold some of the 2024 securities for about 86.75
cents on the dollar to at least two investment firms, according
to two people familiar with the transactions. The 8.75 percent
notes were trading late yesterday at 88.35 cents on the dollar,
with a yield of 10.7 percent. </p>
<p>Given prices on other Argentine government bonds, the 2024
notes should be about 8 cents higher at 96.5 cents on the dollar
with a yield of 9.4 percent, according to a May 12 report by
Citigroup Inc. strategists Jeff Williams and Guillermo Mondino. </p>
<p>Argentina''s notes due in 2017 traded at 92.4 cents on the
dollar with a 10.3 percent yield. </p>
<h2>Steady Increase'' </h2>
<p>JPMorgan, which opened its first office in Buenos Aires in
1978, sold about half of the bonds, according to Michael Roche,
a strategist at Seaport Global Holdings LLC, citing trades he''s
observed. The country hasn''t issued international bonds since it
defaulted on $95 billion of debt in 2001. It restructured 93
percent of the debt in swaps in 2005 and 2010. </p>
<p>They''ve demonstrated that they''re able to access
international capital markets, Roche said in a telephone
interview from New York. We''re continuing to see a steady
increase in the breadth of investors interested in getting
exposure to Argentina. </p>
<p>Joshua Rosner, managing director and bank analyst at Graham
Fisher  Co., said JPMorgan is making a risky bet. </p>
<p>They may be betting that the government will ultimately
act rationally, he said in a telephone interview from New
York. If they didn''t hedge it, and are holding this for their
own portfolios, it''s a wildly risky thing to do especially given
the statements and actions of the government. </p>
<h2>Regime Change </h2>
<p>Since taking office in 2007, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has also seized $24 billion of private pension funds
and flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas SA. The country still
hasn''t settled claims with defaulted-debt creditors demanding
full payment. </p>
<p>Fernandez''s efforts to mend ties with overseas creditors
and the prospect of a new government after elections next year
will spark further bond gains, Seaport Global''s Roche said. </p>
<p>Argentina revamped its economic data indexes earlier this
year at the behest of the IMF, which had censured the country
for inaccurate inflation and growth figures in 2013. It has also
settled with five companies in the World Bank''s arbitration arm
and is in negotiations with the Paris Club of creditors. </p>
<p>Investors are pretty convinced that a new political force
at the new elections will continue to normalize the country''s
relations with international investors, Roche said. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) Chief Executive Officer
Ian Read told the governors of Maryland and Delaware it''s too
soon to determine what effect the company''s bid for AstraZeneca
Plc (AZN) will have on jobs and manufacturing in their states. </p>
<p>AstraZeneca, the U.K.''s second-biggest drugmaker, rejected
an offer of about $106 billion from Pfizer earlier this month,
saying the New York-based pharmaceutical company wasn''t offering
enough. Pfizer is planning to increase its bid, said people with
knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because
the information is private. </p>
<p>Pfizer, the biggest U.S.-based drugmaker, said it would
shift its legal address to the U.K. to reap tax benefits if the
deal goes through. Maryland Governor Martin O''Malley and
Delaware Governor Jack Markell wrote Read last week asking what
assurances he could give them for the 5,700 AstraZeneca workers
in their states. Pfizer already has pledged to keep at least
one-fifth of the companies'' research units and a substantial
manufacturing presence in the U.K. for at least five years. </p>
<p>Because we are in the very early stages of our proposal
and are not in direct discussions, it is premature to speculate
on any specific impact this would have on jobs and facilities in
any given state, Read said in letters dated yesterday to the
two Democratic governors. I can tell you that Pfizer will
continue to perform operational, research and manufacturing
activity and will continue to have a significant number of
employees in the U.S. </p>
<p>Maryland''s U.S. congressional delegation sent its own
letter to Read yesterday expressing concern that there may be
job losses among AstraZeneca''s 3,000-plus employees in the
state. </p>
<h2>Similar Assurances'' </h2>
<p>As you evaluate your next steps, we ask you to extend
similar assurances to those you gave in the U.K. to the research
and development workforce in Maryland, wrote U.S. Senators
Barbara Mikulski and Benjamin Cardin and Representatives C.A. Dutch'' Ruppersberger, Chris Van Hollen, John Sarbanes and John Delaney. AstraZeneca and its MedImmune subsidiary have strong
presences in the state, and their workforces are highly skilled
and extremely effective. </p>
<p>Pfizer hasn''t had access to any proprietary information
from London-based AstraZeneca and the company still needs to
collect additional details on its business and prospects, Read
wrote to the two governors. He said Ken Cole, Pfizer''s senior
vice president of government relations, would schedule a meeting
to give them an update on the status of the discussions. </p>
<p>Markell said last week that updates on the status of the
discussions wouldn''t be enough to assuage his concerns. </p>
<p>Keeping us informed is very different from the kind of
jobs they have committed to in the U.K., Markell said. </p>

<p>AstraZeneca Plc (AZN) Chief Executive
Officer Pascal Soriot said a sale of the U.K. drugmaker is not
inevitable, increasing pressure on Pfizer Inc. to raise its
60.4 billion-pound ($101 billion) offer to kick-start talks. </p>
<p>The price is really far from what we think the value of
the company is, Soriot said today in a telephone interview.
Because Pfizer is offering stock as part of the deal,
AstraZeneca would also need assurances about the future of the
new company before agreeing to negotiate, he said. </p>
<p>Soriot''s comments may increase speculation that New York-based Pfizer will take its offer directly to AstraZeneca
shareholders. The proposed takeover is facing skepticism from
U.K. lawmakers concerned about possible job cuts and Pfizer (PFE)''s
unwillingness to commit to preserving the workforce of the
country''s second-biggest drugmaker. Pfizer CEO Ian Read said it
was difficult to make more specific guarantees because
AstraZeneca hasn''t engaged in talks. </p>
<p>Read and Soriot both appeared before parliamentary
committees yesterday and today to answer questions about
consequences of the acquisition. With their testimony behind
them, the focus is shifting to Pfizer''s next move. Pfizer plans
to raise its offer, people with knowledge of the matter said. </p>
<p>A takeover could distract London-based AstraZeneca from
advancing its pipeline of experimental drugs, and even more so
were Pfizer to make a hostile bid, Soriot said. </p>
<h2>Drug Pipeline </h2>
<p>The risks are exacerbated in a hostile situation, he
said in the interview. Any merger of this magnitude is
disruptive and that''s why we would want to discuss strategy, the
operating model and how we would go about merging these
companies, if we ever get to this. </p>
<p>Pfizer would try to protect AstraZeneca''s most valuable
products in a takeover and wouldn''t jeopardize the pipeline,
Read said to the Science and Technology committee today. </p>
<p>There''s no truth that products of a critical nature would
be delayed getting to patients, Read said. If anything, we
would accelerate those products. </p>
<p>Pfizer urged AstraZeneca to engage in talks so that the two
companies could reach an agreement. </p>
<p>Pfizer contacted AstraZeneca last year to discuss a
purchase, and Chairman Leif Johansson and Soriot flew to New
York to meet with Pfizer, which made the initial bid of about
46.61 pounds a share, Soriot said. </p>
<h2>Lower Offer </h2>
<p>The subsequent cash-and-stock offer initially valued the
company at about 50 pounds a share and now has a value of 47.83
pounds a share. AstraZeneca rose 0.3 percent to 46.54 pounds at
the close of trading in London. </p>
<p>The offer today is 48 pounds, Soriot said. The offer
is hardly different from the January price, but in the meantime,
our pipeline has progressed quite a lot. I don''t see why we
would accept today what we didn''t think was the right price in
January. </p>
<p>None of AstraZeneca''s shareholders have pressed him to
accept the current offer, said Soriot, who is on the company''s
board of directors. </p>
<p>Of course, shareholders will tell us, but they don''t even
need to tell us, that if the appropriate offer was made, we
should consider the offer, he said. But we know this and we
certainly agree. </p>

<p>Three oil fields operated by Exxon
Mobil (XOM) Corp. in the Norwegian North Sea could be shut by a strike
if mediation with a union over pensions fails, cutting about
50,000 barrels of crude output a day. </p>
<p>The Safe union will order as many as 154 offshore-platform
workers to walk out if the talks fail, paralyzing production at
the Ringhorne, Jotun and Balder fields, the group''s leader
Hilde-Marit Rysst said by phone. Though the date for a possible
walkout has been set at June 16, a strike could start earlier or
later, depending on the date of the mediation, which has yet to
be scheduled, she said. </p>
<p>We expect Exxon to take the hint, Rysst said. We
expect this to be dealt with either before or during the
mediation. </p>
<p>Safe and another oil-worker union broke off talks over
pensions last week, raising the risk of a strike two years after
the same issue triggered the longest ever labor action by
platform employees and reduced output by western Europe''s
biggest oil and gas producer. The government used its power to
stop the strike as a lockout by oil companies threatened to shut
production entirely. </p>
<p>The three Exxon fields, including satellite Ringhorne East,
produced about 50,000 barrels of oil a day in 2013, according to
figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. </p>
<p>Exxon has a 100 percent stake in the Balder and Ringhorne

tied in to the Balder and Jotun installations. Exxon holds 45
percent in Jotun, where other partners include Dana Petroleum
Plc with 45 percent. </p>
<p>Safe is targeting Exxon specifically because the company
has yet to implement an early-pension plan for 31 employees that
are members of the union, it said in a statement. </p>
<p>The pension plan isn''t an issue that should be discussed in
wage talks, Exxon spokesman Knut Riple said by phone, echoing
the position held by the organization representing employers,
the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association. Exxon declined to say

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) agreed to buy
Argentine government bonds from oil producer Repsol SA (REP) for $2
billion, bringing its purchases of the Latin American country''s
securities to almost $5 billion in the past week. </p>
<p>The bank will buy Argentine bonds due in 2015, 2017 and
2033, Madrid-based Repsol said yesterday in a regulatory filing.
The oil company agreed last week to sell new Argentine bonds due
in 2024 to JPMorgan for $2.8 billion. Those bonds have since
rallied 1.7 cents on the dollar. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. bank is facilitating Repsol''s efforts to
reduce ties with the Argentine government, which nationalized
its 51 percent stake in local oil producer YPF SA in April 2012.
Under an agreement reached with the government earlier this
year, Repsol received bonds last week with a face value of $5.32
billion as compensation. </p>
<p>JPMorgan has now bought almost all of that. The New York-based bank, which has already sold some of the Argentine bonds
received from the first purchase, is wagering that the remaining
holdings will gain in value, a person with direct knowledge of
the bank''s strategy said earlier this week. </p>
<p>Veronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>Argentina''s bonds, rated seven levels below investment
grade, have soared 46 percent in the past year, the most in
emerging markets, as the country took steps to repair ties with
international investors, including Repsol and the International
Monetary Fund. </p>
<h2>Riskiest Debt </h2>
<p>The country''s debt is still considered risky, with the cost
of five-year protection in the credit-default swaps market at
1,567 basis points, according to CMA, the highest in the world.
The country hasn''t sold bonds directly to international markets
since a $95 billion default in 2001, and it''s locked in a
dispute with some creditors in a case now before the U.S.
Supreme Court. </p>
<p>The transaction disclosed yesterday is expected to be
completed by May 16, according to the filing. </p>
<p>The sale included all of Repsol''s Argentine securities due
in 2017 and 2033 and all except $117 million of those due in
2015, known as Bodens, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Boden bonds maturing 2015 gained 0.20 cent to 97.65 cents
on the dollar at 9:31 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Repsol previously said it had $500 million of the 2017
securities, $1.25 billion of the 2033 bonds and $317 million of
the 2015 debt. All the securities are governed by Argentine law. </p>

<p>After a rough ride in front of the
U.K. Parliament''s Business Committee yesterday, Pfizer Inc. (PFE)
Chief Executive Officer Ian Read got gentler treatment from its
science and technology panel today over his plan to take over
AstraZeneca Plc. (AZN) </p>
<p>There was a smaller audience for the hearing in London,
with empty seats compared with the standing-room-only session
the previous day. It was still a larger one than the committee
chairman, Andrew Miller, was used to. A lot of people are
interested, he commented, looking around. </p>
<p>Much of the questioning focused on how a merged company
would look. Read said it would enable us to be competitive.
Testifying separately later for AstraZeneca, CEO Pascal Soriot
argued it was a little bit more complicated than putting two
pieces of paper together. </p>
<p>While neither committee has any formal influence over a
possible takeover, both show how much Pfizer is operating in an
atmosphere of anxiety about its offer of more than $100 billion,
which AstraZeneca has rebuffed. With European and local
elections next week, the bid has been pushed to the center of
British political debate and dominated Prime Minister David Cameron''s questions session in the House of Commons today for
the second week running. </p>
<p>There was little fresh argument today from either side.
Read said there was no truth in yesterday''s suggestion from
AstraZeneca that a merger would delay the development of life-saving drugs. Such work would be ring-fenced, he said. </p>
<h2>Lose Momentum'' </h2>
<p>Soriot replied that mergers cause anxiety, with scientists
not sure if their job will exist tomorrow. In such a
situation, he said, you can quickly lose momentum. </p>
<p>Jim Dowd, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party,
which has opposed the takeover, again raised Pfizer''s record in
Sweden, where it closed a research center after a takeover.
Why do people say your word''s not to be trusted? he asked. </p>
<p>People who talk to me don''t say my word''s not to be
trusted, Read replied. I''d like people to tell me a
commitment Pfizer hasn''t met. </p>
<p>Soriot was questioned by Miller about why a merger would be
more disruptive than his own plan to move research from
Manchester, in England''s northwest, to Cambridge in the east.
Mene Pangalos, AstraZeneca''s vice president in charge of
development and a former Pfizer executive, said the two
companies had entirely different research structures. </p>
<p>Soriot declined to say whether the government should
intervene to block the takeover. I''m a biologist, I just try
to do my job, he said. I''m not a policy maker. </p>
<p>Last to appear before the panel was Science Minister David Willetts, who insisted he was optimistic about the future,
whatever the outcome. </p>
<h2>Sandwich Success </h2>
<p>Asked about Pfizer''s 2011 decision to close its Sandwich
plant in southeast England, he said it had worked out well
thanks to government intervention. </p>
<p>There was a nightmare scenario where that would end up as
an empty building, with a padlock swinging in the wind, he
said. We''ve ended up instead with a discovery park with 40
tenants. </p>
<p>Willetts argued that while the government was pressing
very hard for Pfizer commitments, there was no need for
national pessimism because Britain was known as a great
place for science. </p>
<p>You''d be idiotic if you weren''t doing research and
development in the U.K. -- it''s a great place, Willetts told
the committee. </p>
<p>We''re all proud, Tory lawmaker Sarah Newton replied. </p>

billion) offer, and said yesterday that the disruption of a
buyout could jeopardize its pipeline of experimental drugs. </p>

lawmakers concerned by possible job cuts and the company''s
unwillingness to commit to preserving AstraZeneca''s workforce.
Pfizer said it would maintain 20 percent of its global research
and development employees in the U.K. for five years, without
specifying the number of jobs. Read said the merger would result
in job cuts and a reduction in total RD spending. </p>
<p>I suspect the combined research budget will go down,
Read said. I suspect there will be less scientists than the
natural arithmetic combination of the two. </p>
<p>The combined company would be more efficient and more
productive, and reflects the changing shape of the industry as
governments pressure drug companies to reduce costs, he said. </p>

<p>Commodities as an asset class remain
appealing as the global economic recovery extends into 2015,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The bank raised its 12-month allocation for commodities to
neutral from underweight, analysts led by Jeffrey Currie and
Damien Courvalin wrote in a report dated yesterday. They
increased their three and six-month price forecasts for nickel
and rolled the 12-month predictions for aluminum and zinc
forward to higher levels. </p>
<p>Raw materials as measured by total returns on the Standard
 Poor''s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index added 4.2 percent this
year as global equities increased 2.3 percent and the Bloomberg
U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose 2.7 percent. Citigroup Inc. said
last month it was time to take commodities seriously again to
diversify investment portfolios after they beat equities and
bonds in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Commodities have been caught in a tug of war, the
Goldman Sachs analysts wrote. As the global business cycle
shifts into an expansion phase over the next few years we expect
commodity performance to improve. </p>
<p>Total returns for the enhanced index may be zero percent
over the next three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
months, according to the bank. It expected the gauge to drop 4
percent over 12 months in an April 13 note. </p>
<h2>Asset Market </h2>
<p>We continue to believe the commodity super cycle is
over, Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president
in New York, said in a telephone interview on March 28. That
doesn''t mean that there is going to be an absence of seasonality
and cyclical turns in the asset market. </p>
<p>A Barclays survey published in an April 4 report showed 54
percent of investors planned to boost their stake in commodities
in the next 12 months versus 27 percent who did in the preceding
year, according to analysts led by Kevin Norrish. </p>
<p>There has been little clear directionality in commodity
markets over the past month, the Goldman analysts said. Tension
in Ukraine has supported corn and wheat even as global
agriculture stockpiles remain elevated, while weakness in the
Chinese property sector weighed on copper amid a seasonal pick-up in demand, they said. </p>
<p>As growth accelerates, supply and demand fundamentals in
base metals are expected to tighten by the middle of next year,
the bank said. It raised its six-month forecast for nickel to
$22,000 a metric ton from $20,000 amid supply disruptions at
Vale SA''s New Caledonia plant, Indonesia''s ban on ore exports
and tension between Russia and Ukraine. </p>
<p>Goldman kept its 12-month nickel target at $16,000 as
Chinese producers will probably increase blast furnace nickel
pig iron capacity in Indonesia over the next one to two years.
Nickel for three-month delivery on the London Metal Exchange has
climbed 49 percent this year to $20,728 by 4:33 p.m. in
Singapore today. </p>

<p>Banks are issuing lower-ranked bonds
and preferred securities in the U.S. at the fastest pace since
the financial crisis, capitalizing on yield-starved investors to
satisfy regulatory requirements. </p>
<p>Financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) and
Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) are meeting demands to raise more capital by
selling $31.8 billion of subordinated debt and preferred shares
this year, with $22.7 billion in March and April alone,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The pace of issuance is
the fastest since 2008. </p>
<p>Lenders need to sell the notes in part because new
regulations designed to make banks safer have rendered a
previously popular form -- called trust-preferred securities --
useless for capital purposes, ruling it must be replaced by
2016. Now that banks'' creditworthiness has improved, investors
are snapping up the offerings because they can pay more than one
percentage point of extra interest over senior bonds that rank
higher for repayment in a bankruptcy. </p>
<p>From an investor perspective, it is incremental yield in
a historically low-rate environment, Pri de Silva, an analyst
at New York-based CreditSights Inc., said in a May 6 telephone
interview. The credit profiles of banks are a lot better now
than they were in the pre-crisis days. </p>
<h2>Losing Funding </h2>
<p>Wells Fargo in April sold $2 billion of 5.9 percent
perpetual securities after initially marketing the debt with a
higher coupon of as much as 6.125 percent, Bloomberg data show.
The notes offered interest payments of more than two percentage
points above the 3 percent senior notes due in 2021 that the San
Francisco-based bank sold in January. </p>
<p>Subordinated debt and preferred shares are replacing trust-preferred securities, known as TruPS, which were popular before
the crisis in part because interest payments were tax-deductible. About $149 billion were outstanding at the end of
2008, according to Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia data. </p>
<p>Banks could also count TruPS as Tier 1 capital because they
allowed issuers to stop paying interest and were supposed to act
as a buffer against potential losses. Lenders proved reluctant
to suspend payments during the crisis because those that did
risked losing other funding on concerns about their solvency. </p>
<h2>New Regulations </h2>
<p>U.S. regulators, implementing the international Basel III
accord and U.S. Dodd-Frank Act, have ruled that banks with
assets of more than $15 billion can''t count TruPS as Tier 1
capital anymore. They have until 2016 to replace the securities,
and common equity and preferred shares are the main types that
count as Tier 1 capital. Subordinated debt counts as Tier 2
capital, which banks are also required to maintain. </p>
<p>Attention in Europe has focused on additional Tier 1 notes,
a similar-level as preferred shares in the U.S., where issuance
has soared this year to $25.7 billion, Bloomberg data show. A
total of $36.5 billion of the debt is outstanding. </p>
<p>Under the new rules, there is a space in the capital
structure that could be filled with subordinated debt, common
equity or preferred equity, de Silva said. The latter two
are generally more expensive, so in order to meet that capital
need cost-effectively, they have been issuing subordinated
debt. </p>
<h2>Bank Safety </h2>
<p>The issuance comes as confidence in bank creditworthiness
improves. The average cost to protect against defaults by the
six-largest U.S. banks fell this week to the lowest level since
the end of 2007, according to credit-default swaps prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts, a gauge of the banks''
risk, are used to hedge against losses or to speculate on the
ability of companies to meet their obligations. </p>
<p>Without question, the banks are more stable, said
Arthur Tetyevsky, a credit strategist at Imperial Capital LLC.
Even under the most extreme economic scenarios, banks should
have enough capital to withstand a shock, so investors are more
comfortable. </p>
<p>While subordinated debtholders may not be bailed out in
another crisis, people are not particularly worried about that
right now, said Kathleen Shanley, a New York-based analyst at
Gimme Credit LLC. </p>
<p>Emboldened by improving bank creditworthiness, investors
are eager to buy their higher-yielding debt after more than five
years of near-zero interest rates from the Fed. </p>
<p>JPMorgan is this year''s biggest bank issuer of the
securities, selling $3.9 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
The New York-based lender sold $1 billion of perpetual
securities on March 5 that pay interest of 6.125 percent for a
decade and then switch to a floating-rate coupon. The notes were
initially marketed with a coupon of as much as 6.25 percent,

<p>New Jersey awarded JPMorgan Chase (JPM) 
Co. and RBC Capital Markets $300 million of tax credits over 10
years after the companies pledged to create 1,900 new jobs in
Jersey City, across the Hudson River from Manhattan. </p>
<p>The Economic Development Authority approved annual grants
of $22.5 million for JPMorgan and $7.9 million for RBC at a
meeting today in Trenton. JPMorgan''s project would add 1,000
jobs and retain 2,612, while RBC''s would add 900 positions,
according to their applications. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, in its application, said it has been evaluating
the location of its expanding regional technology and operations
hub. Its options included consolidating multiple New Jersey
facilities into one in Jersey City or relocating most of those
operations to lower-cost locations in Delaware and Ohio. </p>
<p>RBC leases space in five locations in Manhattan with about
2,700 employees. With leases expiring at One Liberty Plaza and
the World Financial Center, it began evaluating options,
including renovating and expanding space in Jersey City and in
Minnesota. While the one-time cost of expanding would be greater
in Minnesota, annual operating costs would be higher in New
Jersey, according to its application. </p>
<p>Financial services up in the Jersey City and Hoboken area
has always been a sweet spot for us, Lieutenant Governor Kim Guadagno, the state''s top economic-development official, said in
an interview. It''s a perfect story: As New York''s financial-services sector looks for other places to go, they want to look
some place convenient to New York. </p>
<h2>High Earners </h2>
<p>The median salary of $120,000 for the covered positions at
JPMorgan, listed on its application, is more than triple New
Jersey''s median of $35,928, according to the Census Bureau. RBC
listed the median salary at $126,000. </p>
<p>Financial positions have become increasingly coveted as
states look to poach jobs from neighbors and even far-away
locales. Texas Governor Rick Perry, a Republican, today said his
state is actively recruiting New York companies to move there. </p>
<p>This would not impact the location of our U.S.
headquarters, which remains in lower Manhattan and will continue
to house the majority of our employees, RBC spokeswoman Elisa
Barsotti said in a statement. We are exploring an upgraded
location to relocate our data center from our ancillary location
at One Liberty Plaza and support function positions. </p>
<h2>Two Centuries </h2>
<p>The JPMorgan project is expected to bring a net benefit to
the state of $1.1 billion over the life of the package and will
enlarge the company''s space in Jersey City to more than 1
million square feet, officials said. </p>
<p>We''ve invested in this community for nearly two
centuries, and this agreement only deepens that commitment for
the long term, JPMorgan Chief Operating Officer Matt Zames
said in a statement. </p>
<p>Guadagno, a Republican who serves as the state''s economic
development chief, said New Jersey has aggressively courted
financial-services jobs with a message to decision makers to
keep their New York address and move support jobs to New Jersey. </p>
<p>Jersey City, a community of 254,000 one stop from Manhattan
by train, has worked in the past decade to re-craft itself as
Wall Street West. Mayor Steven Fulop, 37, worked at Citigroup
Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., leaving after the 2001 World
Trade Center attacks to join the U.S. Marine Corps and serve in
Iraq. </p>
<h2>Lifting State </h2>
<p>Jersey City is leading the state economy in terms of job
creation and is the driving force in lifting New Jersey out of
the recession, he said in a statement. </p>
<p>New Jersey has struggled to shake off the lingering effects
of the U.S. recession that ended in 2009. Governor Chris Christie''s administration said yesterday that the jobless rate
slid to 6.9 percent in April, the first time it has dipped under
7 percent since November 2008. The national level was 6.3
percent. </p>
<p>The state has regained 125,700 jobs, or about half of those
lost during the slump. Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers
Economic Advisory Service, said this month that the state isn''t
expected to recover all of them until 2018. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) has expanded
its workforce outside New York and San Francisco mainly to cut
costs. Its office in Irving, Texas, also aims to boost revenue. </p>
<p>The office, among the firm''s largest in the nation with
about 650 employees, hosted the investment bank''s annual
shareholders meeting today with Texas Governor Rick Perry giving
a speech. In addition to typical back-office functions such as
accounting and information security, the location houses a
commercial real estate lending group and is the headquarters for
the realty-management division. </p>
<p>That group is the descendant of a joint venture named
Archon that Goldman Sachs set up in 1991 with J.E. Robert Cos.
to buy distressed assets from the Resolution Trust Corp. after
the savings and loan crisis. The division, led by partner Tom Dowling, now sources deals and manages real estate investments
for the bank''s special-situations group and property funds. </p>
<p>While the division doesn''t have its own balance sheet, and
instead aids deals by the firm''s revenue-producing units, it
deployed about $7 billion in loans and investments last year,
according to a person with knowledge of its operations. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs acquired all of Archon in 2000, and the
business operated as an independent subsidiary for years. It
purchased more than $1 billion of property in the U.S. in some
years, mostly for the bank''s Whitehall real estate funds,
according to a former employee. That activity dropped as the
U.S. property market plunged, and the last Whitehall fund was
raised in 2008. </p>
<h2>Dallas, Bangalore </h2>
<p>Irving, in Dallas''s shadow with a population of about
225,500, is home to businesses including Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the
world''s second most valuable company, and CEC Entertainment
Inc., owner of the Chuck E. Cheese pizza chain. Goldman Sachs
also has an office in Dallas with several private wealth
management advisers and one investment banker, managing director
Peter Brundage. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein, 59, said in
November that a quarter of the firm''s employees were located
near Dallas, Salt Lake City, Singapore and Bangalore, India.
That''s increased from 10 percent in 2007 as the bank looks to
cut expenses, he said. The firm hosted its annual meeting in
Salt Lake City last year. </p>
<h2>Pay Approved </h2>
<p>Shareholders elected all of the firm''s nominees for the
board of directors, General Counsel Greg Palm said today,
announcing a preliminary count of the votes. About 83 percent of
votes approved the bank''s executive pay plan, he said. </p>
<p>Like Morgan Stanley''s annual meeting earlier this week,
today''s gathering featured no questions from shareholders and
lasted fewer than 40 minutes. About half the meeting was taken
up by Perry''s speech, which extolled the benefits of companies
moving to Texas. </p>
<p>Blankfein thanked Perry for his support of Goldman Sachs''s
businesses in the state. The CEO didn''t accept a shareholder''s
invitation to move the firm''s headquarters to Texas. </p>
<p>I think there''s a lot of compelling reasons to move to
Texas and a lot of compelling reasons to stay where we are,
including Newton''s first law of inertia, Blankfein said in an
interview after the meeting. </p>
<p>Beyond the meeting, Goldman Sachs is trying to cement ties
to the area. Dina H. Powell, a partner who leads the firm''s
charitable efforts, announced this week the start of the bank''s
10,000 Small Businesses education and funding program in Dallas. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank is unlikely
to begin large-scale asset purchases to stimulate inflation and
such a plan would have limited effect as nations'' borrowing

<p>We doubt that a large-scale asset-purchase program would

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) sold 150 billion yen
($1.5 billion) of Samurai bonds in its first offering of the
yen-denominated notes since the financial crisis. </p>
<p>The New York-based bank issued 122.5 billion yen of four-year fixed-rate debt at a yield of 0.557 percent as part of a
three-tranche offering today. It was the biggest sale since
Rabobank Groep sold 161.8 billion yen of similar notes in
October 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s offering was in excess of a 130 billion
yen cap on the deal that was set as late as yesterday, two
people familiar with the matter said. The last time the bank
sold Samurai bonds was in January 2008, as the subprime mortgage
crisis in the U.S. intensified and led Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. to collapse later that year. </p>
<p>Demand for Samurai bonds among investors is strong,
said Ryosuke Kaneko, a credit analyst in Tokyo at Mizuho
Securities Co., a unit of Japan''s third-largest bank by market
value. The fact that Morgan Stanley hasn''t sold for a while
was a big factor. </p>
<p>The number of U.S. Samurai issuers has also declined in
favor of European names in recent years, and that may have
supported demand for Morgan Stanley''s sale too, Kaneko said. </p>
<p>Japan''s Samurai market is recovering from just 60 billion
yen of sales in the first quarter of last year, which dragged
full-year issuance down to its least in four years.
Unprecedented stimulus by the Bank of Japan pushed the average
yields on yen notes offered by overseas borrowers to 0.599
percent on April 15, the lowest on record in data going back to
October 2000, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. </p>
<h2>Credit Rating </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s notes are expected to be rated A- by
Standard  Poor''s, the fourth-lowest investment grade, and A by
Japan''s Rating  Investment Information Inc., one level higher,
according to a statement from sale co-manager Mitsubishi UFJ
Morgan Stanley Securities Co. That''s in line with Morgan
Stanley''s corporate ratings. </p>
<p>Utrecht, Netherlands-based Rabobank sold 100.3 billion yen
of Samurai bonds this week in its first such offering of the
year. Nordea Bank AB, based in Stockholm, plans to issue Samurai
bonds next week, two people familiar said today. </p>

year, a more than 15-fold increase over the same period a year
ago, according to Bloomberg data. </p>

<p>And then there were three: Goldman
Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Macquarie Group Ltd.
are sticking to bets the Reserve Bank of Australia will resume
lowering interest rates as others ditch their rate-cut calls. </p>
<p>Westpac Banking Corp., National Australia Bank Ltd. and
Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists -- with a century in
combined experience -- now expect the RBA will maintain the
record-low 2.5 percent cash rate. While keeping expectations for
sub-par growth, they''ve bowed to Governor Glenn Stevens''s
insistence borrowing costs are on hold for some time yet. </p>
<p>Goldman''s Tim Toohey, JPMorgan''s Stephen Walters and
Macquarie''s Richard Gibbs think Stevens is wrong, with subdued
prices, a forecast rise in unemployment, an elevated currency
and government budget cuts seen forcing further reductions. </p>
<p>You''ve got fiscal tightening being accelerated, so
there''s absolutely no scope for the Reserve Bank to be
considering hiking rates, Sydney-based Gibbs said in a May 19
interview. On the same day, Walters said he sees unemployment
rising, the currency too high and the budget weighing on growth,
while recognizing  something will have to change to prompt
the RBA to overcome its reluctance to lower rates again. </p>
<p>Australia''s treasurer last week announced cuts to spending
on welfare and the public service and a new tax on the highest
paid, adding fiscal consolidation to a slump in mining
investment as brakes on growth. At stake: the survival of a
domestic demand revival that''s seen the jobless rate drop, house
prices surge, and most economists and financial markets abandon
any expectation of further monetary policy easing. </p>
<h2>Fiscal Grind </h2>
<p>Consumer sentiment plunged 6.8 percent to 92.9 in May from
a month earlier, an index from Westpac and the Melbourne
Institute showed today. That''s the lowest level since August
2011, prior to the central bank''s most recent easing cycle. </p>
<p>In an environment where domestic demand is already
fragile and significant risks remain in the handover from mining
led economic growth, this budget does pose a risk to the near
term outlook, Goldman''s Melbourne-based Chief Australia
Economist Toohey wrote in a note to clients dated May 14. A
return to the grind of fiscal repair looms large. </p>
<p>Walters and Gibbs say the budget cuts and resulting hit to
consumer confidence from the measures, a stubbornly high
currency, rising unemployment as growth remains below trend and
incomplete transition from mining investment will prompt another
move. </p>
<p>Gee, that''s positive for the Aussie dollar, Gibbs cited
foreign investors as saying after the budget release forecast
narrowing deficits, meaning the elevated Aussie will remain a
drag on growth. It''s the tightening of conditions leading to
probably another round of job losses and pressure on domestic
demand that will drive the RBA to cut again, he said. </p>
<h2>Aussie Dollar </h2>
<p>The Australian dollar has firmed since Stevens switched to
a neutral bias in February, curbing exporters'' competitiveness.
It traded at 92.38 U.S. cents at 12:16 p.m. in Sydney. Swaps
traders see the cash rate moving 3 basis points higher in a
year, according to a Credit Suisse Group AG index, down from 8
points yesterday and from 3 points in cuts on March 3. </p>
<p>Even those economists who have abandoned rate-cut calls
recently and now see the central bank remaining on hold for an
extended period don''t necessarily believe it should be. </p>
<p>It doesn''t reflect any change of view on our part about
the outlook, said Merrill Lynch''s Chief Australia Economist
Saul Eslake, who on May 16 switched his rate call to on hold.
Dropping it doesn''t mean we''ve become a lot more optimistic or
less pessimistic about the economy, just that we now accept the
Reserve Bank is reading things differently from us and it''s
their view that counts, not ours. </p>
<h2>Sharp Fall'' </h2>
<p>Westpac''s Bill Evans, who called the most recent easing
cycle, abandoned his prediction of further rate cuts in March
after stronger-than-expected jobs data and said the central bank
was indicating a high hurdle for easier policy. </p>
<p>The sharp fall in the index is clearly indicating an
unfavorable response to the recent federal budget, Evans said
today of the sentiment slump. Respondents were particularly
concerned about the impact of the budget on their own
finances. </p>
<p>NAB''s Alan Oster announced he had dropped his reduction
call on May 12. </p>
<p>Low rates have spurred property prices. House and apartment
prices in the largest cities climbed 11.5 percent in April from
a year earlier, led by a 16.7 percent increase in Sydney. </p>
<h2>Export Boom </h2>
<p>Government data released this month showed Australia''s
exports to China, its biggest trading partner, climbed to a
record A$9.5 billion ($8.8 billion) in March, even as the trade
surplus narrowed to A$731 million for the month. </p>
<p>The RBA maintained its steady view in minutes of the May 6
meeting released yesterday in Sydney. Overall growth in coming
quarters was likely to be below trend given expected slower
growth in exports, the decline in mining investment and the
planned fiscal consolidation, it said. The current
accommodative stance of policy was likely to be appropriate for
some time yet. </p>
<p>The nation''s Secretary to the Treasury Martin Parkinson, in
his traditional speech after the budget, said non-mining
industries need to grow more rapidly to keep unemployment low. </p>
<p>We are seeing some positive signs, particularly in the
household sector, he said in Sydney yesterday. But with
businesses in the non-resources sectors continuing to exercise
caution in their investment and hiring decisions, the forward
indicators suggest that it will be at least another year or two
before strong broad-based growth takes hold. </p>
<p>Evans, when he made his call for the RBA to cut rates in
July 2011, was Australia''s loneliest forecaster at the time. Yet
within a few weeks markets swung to his view. In 2009,
JPMorgan''s Walters was alone in picking Stevens''s decision to
become the first Group of 20 policy maker to boost rates after
the height of the global recession. </p>
<p>Our job is to forecast what the Reserve Bank will do, not
preach as to what they should do, Eslake said. </p>

<p>Jay Rasulo, seen as one of two
possible successors to Walt Disney (DIS) Co. Chief Executive Officer
Robert Iger, invokes his company''s well-known characters when
discussing his role as chief financial officer. </p>
<p>I gotta have a big heart, I gotta love everybody, I''ve
gotta reach out to the world as Woody does in our stories,
Rasulo said today at the Bloomberg CFO Conference when asked why
he sometimes compares himself to the Toy Story hero. But
on the other hand I''m still counting the money like Scrooge
McDuck. </p>
<p>Rasulo said Disney often faces decisions that cost in the
short run and yet build stronger ties with consumers, such as
policing foreign makers of licensed goods. He became finance
chief in 2009, after leading Disney''s parks for about seven
years, when Iger asked him and then-CFO Tom Staggs to switch
jobs. Both men are seen as possible successors when Iger steps
down in 2016. Rasulo didn''t address that issue today. </p>
<p>It has been an incredible learning and broadening
experience, certainly for me, I''m sure on both sides of it,
said Rasulo, 58. In this role you get to experience the
breadth of the Walt Disney Co. </p>
<p>Rasulo, a Columbia University economics graduate who
started out with the company in strategic planning in 1986, said
part of Disney''s success lies in how it deploys capital. </p>
<p>About 65 percent is reinvested in the businesses, such as
theme-park rides, movies or sports rights for the ESPN network,
among the largest contributors to Disney profit, he said. The
company also pays dividends, buys back stock, and seeks
acquisitions that add to its character library or provide new
distribution outlets. </p>
<h2>Cost-Cutting </h2>
<p>Last year, Rasulo, who also has master''s degrees from the
University of Chicago, supervised a company-wide cost-cutting
initiative, designed to make sure the company was adapting to
technological changes in its businesses. That led to hundreds
firings across several divisions. </p>
<p>In March, Rasulo''s boss appointed him to oversee Disney''s
$500 million acquisition of Maker Studios, the money-losing
provider of online short-form videos. </p>
<p>Rasulo often speaks to Disney employees about career
planning, including his own. </p>
<p>I advise people, just do what''s right in front of you and
good things happen rather than trying to be Machiavellian in
planning the next five steps of your career, Rasulo said. It
will never turn out the way you think. </p>
<p>Rasulo sits about 40 feet from Iger and the two chat all
the time, along with communicating by e-mail, and when traveling
together, he said. </p>
<p>There''s not a lot of formality to Bob, Rasulo said.
He''s a very free and easy, casual interactor. </p>
<h2>28 Years </h2>
<p>When Rasulo joined Disney 28 years ago, the company had
about $2 billion in annual sales and earned most of its profit
from theme parks. The studio, established by Walt Disney in
1923, was struggling, the Disney Channel had fewer than 3
million subscribers, and Rasulo described the consumer products
business as fledgling. </p>
<p>We used to get this check from Europe, we never knew what
it was for, Rasulo recalled. Presumably it was from people
selling consumer products. We never audited anybody. </p>
<p>Today, Disney is the world''s largest entertainment company,
with more than $45 billion in sales. More than half its profit
comes from television, including ESPN, the Disney channels and
the ABC television network. </p>
<p>In his free time, Rasulo said he likes to fly fish, a hobby
that provides lessons for life. </p>
<p>The reason I love fly fishing is because you focus right
on the here and now, and put away all other distractions,

<p>Investors should reduce holdings of
riskier municipal-bond holdings after the strongest rally for
speculative debt since 2009, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Slowing bond issuance and demand for tax-free securities
have pushed investors in the $3.7 trillion market toward higher-yielding assets as benchmark interest rates are close to 11-month lows. Junk-rated local debt has gained about 9 percent in
2014, the strongest start to a year since a 15.7 percent return
in the same period of 2009, Barclays Plc data show. The broader
market has rallied 5.7 percent this year. </p>
<p>The potential is diminishing for speculative-grade bonds to
keep beating the market, said Michael Zezas, chief muni
strategist at Morgan Stanley in New York. High-yield debt will
probably suffer more when demand slows and municipalities ramp
up bond sales, he said. </p>
<p>For some of these riskier trades that have done well,
there are only marginal benefits going forward, Zezas said in
an interview. </p>
<p>Investors holding high-yield munis should move from
overweight to neutral relative to their benchmarks, Zezas said
in a report released yesterday. </p>

Service or lower than BBB- by Standard  Poor''s and Fitch

suffered its worst losses since 2008 last year, and Zezas in
December forecast a second year of declines. He said in March
that returns were poised to cool off. </p>

<p>Depending on whether you listen to
Morgan Stanley or JPMorgan Chase  Co., the imposition of
martial law in Thailand will either send the baht tumbling to
levels last seen in 2006 or put an end to its losses. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley yesterday reiterated its prediction that the
baht will weaken 12 percent by year-end to 37 per dollar as the
political crisis pushes the country toward a recession. JPMorgan
was more optimistic, confirming an overweight recommendation on
the currency, amid bets the army''s move will help end months of
street protests. </p>
<p>The disparity of opinion on the outlook for the currency
mirrors the mixed signals coming from Thailand''s economy. While
an official report this week showed gross domestic product
shrank in the first quarter, the nation has the biggest
cumulative trade surplus for more than three years, and exports
are rising. </p>
<p>The market tends to be complacent about Thai politics,
it''s not the first coup, Paul McNamara, a London-based
investment director at GAM U.K. Ltd., which manages $129 billion
in assets, said yesterday by e-mail. It''s not just noise, the
chances of something terrible happening are rising. But until we
see convincing spill-over to the real economy, I think the
fallout will be limited. </p>
<h2>Paring Decline </h2>
<p>The baht is the only one of 12 Asian currencies tracked by
Bloomberg to drop versus the dollar this month, slipping 0.4
percent. It has retreated 4.3 percent since the anti-government
protests started at the end of October, the worst performance in
the region. </p>
<p>The currency fell as much as 0.6 percent yesterday to
32.660 per dollar, before paring its retreat amid speculation of
intervention by the central bank. It climbed 0.1 percent today
to 32.493 as of 1:06 p.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Our target of 37 is very achievable, Geoffrey Kendrick,
Morgan Stanley''s head of Asia currency and interest-rate
strategy in Hong Kong, said yesterday in a phone interview.
The economy is in a massive hole. Thailand is certainly going
to have a technical recession in the first half. </p>
<p>Thailand''s army chief declared martial law yesterday,
telling local television that the move wasn''t a coup and would
help end the street protests that led to Yingluck Shinawatra''s
removal as prime minister this month. </p>
<p>The violence has driven away tourists and hurt the economy,
with a May 19 report showing GDP shrank 2.1 percent in the first
quarter, after growing a revised 0.1 percent in the previous
three-month period. </p>
<h2>Airport Shutdown </h2>
<p>Thailand''s last quarter-on-quarter recession was in 2009,
when anti-government protesters shut down Bangkok''s main
international airport for more than a week at the height of the
global financial meltdown. The baht tumbled 17 percent against
the dollar in the five quarters ending March 2009, the sharpest
decline since the Asian crisis of the late 1990s. </p>
<p>Money poured out of the country yesterday. Overseas
investors sold $256 million more Thai shares than they bought,
the heaviest net sales since November, and pulled $61 million
from bonds, exchange data show. Global funds have withdrawn
about $1 billion from local debt and equities in May, snapping
two months of inflows. </p>
<p>Others are optimistic about the baht''s prospects. </p>
<p>I''m not worried about the baht, I''m looking for levels to
buy, Rajeev De Mello, who manages $10 billion as the head of
Asian fixed income at Schroder Investment Management Ltd., said
by phone yesterday from Singapore. The main support of the
baht in the past has really been the trade side. On the investor
side, the people who wanted to get out of Thailand have already
gotten out. </p>
<h2>Baht Appreciation'' </h2>
<p>Westpac Banking Corp., Australia''s second-biggest lender by
market value, expects the baht to strengthen about 3 percent by
year-end to 31.4 per dollar. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 24 strategists is for a decline to 33. </p>
<p>Foreigners are excessively underweight baht assets, and
covering this positioning on any reduction of political risk
would trigger baht appreciation, Daniel Hui, the head of
emerging-Asia currency strategy at JPMorgan in Singapore, wrote
yesterday in a report. </p>
<p>Yesterday marked the army''s most direct involvement in
Thailand''s politics since 2006, when then-premier Thaksin
Shinawatra, Yingluck''s brother, was removed in a coup. </p>
<h2>Surviving Coups </h2>
<p>Thailand has had 11 coups since direct rule by kings ended
in 1932, and the currency has ridden out most of them. Martial
law was last invoked in April 2010, and a month later the baht
had risen 0.3 percent against the dollar, the best performance
in Asia. It was little changed in September 2006, when Thaksin
was ousted. </p>
<p>The country has been without a fully functioning government
since December, when Yingluck called snap elections in a bid to
ease the unrest. To Australia  New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.,
that will lead to a drop in the baht of about 4 percent this
year to 34 per dollar. </p>
<p>Politics definitely is the biggest risk at present, and
there are negative effects on the economy, Khoon Goh, a
Singapore-based senior strategist at ANZ, said in a May 19 phone
interview. We''ve already seen portfolio outflows. The risk is
that foreign-direct investment slows down sharply if investor
concern over the political situation intensifies. </p>

<p>The global seaborne iron ore glut
will probably be 21 percent bigger than forecast next year as
steel production slows in China, the world''s largest consumer,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The surplus will reach 175 million metric tons in 2015,
compared with a prior prediction of 145 million tons, Goldman
Sachs said in a report dated yesterday. The bank estimates that
output will exceed demand by 72 million tons and prices will
average $109 a ton in 2014, before dropping to $80 next year. </p>
<p>Iron ore has slumped 27 percent this year as economic
growth in China slowed and mining companies from BHP Billiton
Ltd. to Rio Tinto Group in Australia boosted output, shifting
the global seaborne market into a glut. Banks from Standard
Chartered Plc to Credit Suisse Group AG say more Chinese steel
mills will go bankrupt and hurt consumption. </p>
<p>The market is no longer in balance but in the early stage
of a structural surplus, analysts including Christian Lelong
wrote in the report. China will not act as the safety valve in
an oversupplied market for much longer. </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent iron content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin fell 1 percent to $97.50 a dry ton yesterday,
the lowest level since September 2012, according to data from
The Steel Index Ltd. The decline in iron ore, Australia''s
biggest export earner, pulled the country''s dollar today to the
weakest level since May 2. </p>
<h2>Record Stockpiles </h2>
<p>While the last decline below $100 in 2012 spurred buyers to
rebuild inventories, boosting prices to about $159 in four
months, this time around expectations of ample supply will
encourage users to keep reserves at a minimum, said Goldman. </p>
<p>We believe the current downturn could trigger another
destocking cycle of similar scale, Lelong, Daniel Quigley and
Amber Cai wrote. But the eventual rebound will be far less
robust than previously. </p>
<p>Reduced Chinese imports will also offset any impact of
expected supply disruptions in India and a possible strike at
Australia''s Port Hedland, the world''s largest bulk-export
terminal, the bank said. Maritime Union of Australia, which
represents tugboat deckhands at the port, approved unlimited
work stoppages of 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days on May 12. </p>
<p>BHP, the third-largest exporter, won''t be able to make up
shipments lost during a strike, the company''s iron ore president
Jimmy Wilson said in a statement today. The union said May 12 it
hadn''t decided whether to take action. </p>
<h2>Port Strike </h2>
<p>Disruption in Port Hedland would be costly for the
producers affected and would drive a temporary price rally, but
it would ultimately be washed out by global market
fundamentals, Goldman said. </p>
<p>China''s inventory at ports rose 1.8 percent to a record
112.55 million tons in the week to May 16 from a week earlier,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co. As
much as 40 percent of inventory at ports may be tied up in
financing purposes, according to Daiwa Securities Group Inc. </p>
<p>A meaningful amount of iron ore stockpiles in China is
tied to financing, which means an unwinding can be excessive,
said Doug King, the London-based chief investment officer of the
Merchant Commodity Fund, which returned 15.4 percent from
January to April partly from iron ore. Real demand will be
dampened when those stockpiles are sold into the market. </p>
<p>China''s economy that creates demand for 69 percent of the
world''s seaborne ore will grow by 7.3 percent this year, the
lowest since 1990, according to a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The Australian dollar touched 92.16 U.S. cents today. It
dropped 0.9 percent yesterday, the biggest loss since March 19. </p>
<p>Changes in spot iron ore prices affect the currency far
more quickly these days, Gareth Berry, a foreign-exchange
strategist at UBS AG, wrote in a client note dated yesterday.
That''s largely due to the demise of annual fixed price iron
ore contracts, and the subsequent shift to quarterly, then to
monthly, then to spot pricing. </p>
<p>Shares of BHP fell 0.8 percent to A$37.17 ($34.32) at the
close in Sydney today and Rio, the second-biggest exporter,
declined 1.1 percent to A$59.40. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) plan to
keep operating in Russia after President Vladimir Putin''s
government backed away from punishing the payments firms in
response to U.S. sanctions. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard executives met with senior officials
including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov and came
away very positive about finding a solution, Visa''s country
chief, Andrew Torre, said at the St. Petersburg International
Economic Forum yesterday. </p>
<p>Russia will consider easing new measures requiring the two
U.S. companies to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to
continue operating, MasterCard Russia chief Ilya Riaby said. At
stake is an estimated $403 million in combined annual revenue
for the two payments networks as well as their foothold in a
market that''s shifting from cash to electronic payments. </p>
<p>After Visa and MasterCard stopped processing payments at
four Russian banks in response to U.S. sanctions over the crisis
in Ukraine, Russia passed a law creating its own national
payments system and imposing rules for foreign firms that
include fines for denying services and a mandatory security
deposit starting in July. </p>
<p>The government is committed to working with Visa and
MasterCard, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said in an
interview with Bloomberg TV. </p>
<p>Moiseev said the U.S. companies agreed to create a
nationally important operator within 18 months. Under the
new law, such operators are exempt from having to post
collateral with the central bank, he said. </p>
<h2>More Talks </h2>
<p>The companies have not yet reached a formal agreement and
look forward to continuing the dialog, Paul Cohen, a
spokesman for Visa, said in a statement. MasterCard''s
suggestions on changes to the new law were regarded
favorably and the company expects a response soon, according
to Seth Eisen, a spokesman. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard have said they get about 2 percent of
their annual revenue from Russia, or about $167 million last
year for MasterCard and $236 million for Visa. The two control
about 95 percent of the payments market in Russia, according to
Morgan Stanley. Visa is based in Foster City, California, and
runs the world''s biggest payments network. MasterCard is based
in Purchase, New York. </p>
<p>The bigger concern may not be the loss of revenue, but
the risk of losing the opportunity for domestic processing in
Russia, Darrin Peller, an analyst at Barclays Plc, said in a
research note, adding that 80 percent of transactions in Russia
are done using cash. There will likely be a middle ground
reached. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) extended its
partnership with Russia''s state-controlled oil company even as
U.S. and European nations threaten additional sanctions to
punish Vladimir Putin''s regime for its actions in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Exxon signed the agreement with OAO Rosneft (ROSN) Chief Executive
Officer Igor Sechin at a forum in St. Petersburg today,
extending a pact that involves drilling for crude in the Arctic
and Siberia and liquefying natural gas for export in Russia''s
Far East, according to a statement on Moscow-based Rosneft''s
website. Exxon didn''t immediately return a phone message seeking
comment. </p>
<p>Exxon is among American oil producers that rebuffed U.S.
State Department pressure to skip the International Economic
Forum this week in Putin''s hometown. With at least $30 billion
already invested in Russia''s oil and gas sector, U.S. and
European explorers are betting the Ukraine crisis won''t derail
their aspirations to capture some of Russia''s 75 billion barrels
of reserves. </p>
<p>Among U.S. companies, Irving, Texas-based Exxon is the
biggest player in Russia, where it has a series of joint
ventures with Rosneft. (ROSN) It already produces oil in Russia''s Far
East with Rosneft and the two companies plan to start drilling
an exploration well in the Kara Sea this year. Together they
hold licenses to explore huge swathes of the Arctic Ocean. </p>
<h2>Stronger Action </h2>
<p>While sanctions against Russia have targeted individuals --
including Sechin -- and avoided industrywide measures, the U.S.
has threatened stronger action if Putin''s government obstructs
the Ukraine presidential election scheduled for May 25.
Producers still plan to invest more in Russia, pursuing
exploration in the Arctic Ocean and drilling shale oil fields in
Siberia. </p>
<p>Foreign companies are expected to invest billions of
dollars in Russian projects, said Timur Salikhov, an oil and
gas analyst at BCS Financial Group. I don''t think many of them
will do so until there is resolution to the ongoing standoff
with Ukraine. </p>
<p>U.S. and European energy producers hold equity partnerships
in Russian oil and gas worth at least $30 billion, according to
Alexander Nazarov, an analyst at OAO Gazprombank in Moscow. The
investments are led by BP Plc (BP/)''s almost 20 percent stake in
Rosneft, Total SA (FP)''s stake in gas producer OAO Novatek (NVTK) and a gas
project operated by Royal Dutch Shell Plc. (RDSA) </p>
<p>Some oil-industry leaders declined to attend this week''s
forum after U.S. officials called for a boycott. Others came
anyway. </p>
<p>Christophe de Margerie, CEO of France''s Total, was at the
forum, where he signed an agreement with OAO Lukoil to seek
shale oil in Western Siberia. BP CEO Bob Dudley attended the
meeting and said he had no plans to exit Russia. </p>
<p>Neil Duffin, president of Exxon''s development unit, signed
the agreement today at the forum, according to Rosneft. Exxon
has declined to say whether CEO Rex Tillerson will make an
appearance. </p>

those that are far away from sanctions can come back to the

pretty positively. It''s a question of how we move out of

<p>Russian capital outflows rose to $50.6 billion in the first
quarter as President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and as
tensions with the U.S. and European Union rose before the May 25

construction and banking. </p>

companies'' credit ratings and has an impact on investment

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), operator of a $19
billion liquefied natural gas project in Papua New Guinea, is
talking to customers in Asia about selling cargoes on the spot
market as demand traditionally rises over summer. </p>
<p>Exxon expects an LNG cargo from the project every four to
six days, Decie Autin, Exxon''s project executive in Papua New
Guinea, said today in a a phone interview. The next shipment
will go to CPC Corp. of Taiwan, she said. The first one has left
the country headed to Tokyo Electric Power Co. in Japan, Exxon
said earlier today in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>There are a few other customers we''re talking to, and
Asia is clearly the focus, she said. We''ll sell on the spot
market until we''re comfortable we''ve got reliable, sustainable
sales. We''re not seeing any issues with placing our cargoes. </p>
<p>Spot LNG prices in northeast Asia fell to $13.50 a million
British thermal units, their lowest since October 2012, in the
week to May 19, according to World Gas Intelligence assessments
of cargoes for delivery in four to eight weeks published May 21.
They reached $19.70 in February. </p>
<p>Exxon and its partners, including Oil Search Ltd. (OSH) and
Santos Ltd. (STO), are considering expansion of the development to tap
Asian demand. Exxon is focused on exploration to underpin an
expansion rather than trying to obtain gas from InterOil Corp.''s
Elk and Antelope gas discoveries, Autin said. </p>
<p>Santos rose 1.1 percent to close at A$14.36 in Sydney
trading, while Oil Search climbed 1.1 percent to A$9.40. </p>
<h2>Second Development </h2>
<p>Total SA and InterOil want to build a second export
development in Papua New Guinea based on gas from the Elk and
Antelope fields. Oil Search also agreed earlier this year to
acquire part of those fields. </p>
<p>It looks like they have a deal, it looks like they''re
building a greenfield facility, and to my knowledge, that''s a
go, and something that''s happening, Autin said. I don''t know
of a lot of opportunity there for Exxon, she said. </p>
<p>Oil Search has contested Total''s agreement to buy part of
InterOil''s project, saying the deal breached its pre-emptive
rights. The possibility of Oil Search blocking Total sparked
speculation Exxon could enter the Elk and Antelope license. </p>
<p>The LNG market will remain tight until at least 2015,
according to the International Energy Agency. Spot and short-term LNG trade increased to 27.4 percent of the total last year
from 25 percent in 2012, according to the International Group of
Liquefied Natural Gas Importers. </p>
<p>Importers typically purchase more spot shipments in June
through September to meet increased power needs amid hotter
weather during summer. </p>
<p>The Exxon project is expected to reach full capacity in
four to six weeks, Autin said. The development has long-term
contracts with four major customers, Tokyo Electric Power, CPC,
Osaka Gas Co. and China Petroleum  Chemical Corp. </p>

<p>The biggest proposed deal in drug

pressure to deliver on its promises of a productive roster of
experimental medicines. </p>

months, Erik Hultgard, an analyst with Nordea Bank AB in

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the world''s
biggest investment bank by revenue, said a pair of wrong-way
bets made by clients at the start of the year is partly to blame
for Wall Street''s trading slowdown. </p>
<p>Some of the biggest wagers included shorting Japan''s
currency and betting that U.S. interest rates would rise more
steeply than those in Europe, according to Daniel Pinto, head of
the New York-based firm''s corporate and investment bank. </p>
<p>Neither of those trades paid, Pinto, 51, said today at
an investor conference in New York. Essentially you start the
year with the wrong momentum, where you lose money at the very
beginning, and you ended up with probably a lower risk appetite
than you would have otherwise. </p>
<p>JPMorgan warned investors earlier this month that second-quarter markets revenue will probably drop about 20 percent from
a year earlier, after a 21 percent tumble in fixed-income,
currencies and commodities trading in the first quarter. That
would amount to JPMorgan''s worst first half for trading since
the financial crisis. </p>
<p>Another reason for the lackluster results is reduced
volatility, which has dropped to the lowest in 10 to 15 years
for rates, currencies and credit trading, Pinto said. </p>
<p>When the market doesn''t move, it''s really difficult to
monetize your flows, Pinto said. It makes the market more
competitive and margins really tighten because it costs you very
little to provide liquidity, so you provide a lot. </p>
<h2>Episodic Trades </h2>
<p>Clients appear to be hesitating in placing the larger
hedges that typically happen earlier in the year, he said. </p>
<p>You have episodic trades, big hedges, big corporate
trades, that happen along the year, Pinto said. Particularly
in the first and part of the second, the amount of those trades,
even though the pipeline is very healthy, they haven''t happened.
It looks like they are going to happen later in the year, and
that is a big swing factor. </p>

<p>Here''s the problem facing hedge funds investing in the stock market this year, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. chief equity strategist David Kostin: the sand box they like to play in has gotten a lot smaller. </p> <p>For example, equity hedge fund managers tend to have about a quarter of their investments in consumer-discretionary stocks, Kostin told Erik Schatzker and Stephanie Ruhle on Bloomberg Television''s Market Makers program today. The dispersion of returns within that group is too small for managers on the prowl for stocks to buy or short, Kostin said. </p> <p>The opportunity set, the sand box, the swimming pool is very, very small, Kostin said. It''s been a very difficult year from a stock-selection perspective. </p> <p>The biggest gain among consumer-discretionary stocks over the past three months has been a 10 percent advance in Nordstrom Inc. and the biggest loss has been a 17 percent drop in International Game Technology.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) President
Gary Cohn said low volatility and interest rates that are
holding in tight ranges have resulted in an abnormal trading
market. </p>
<p>The environment for all the firms is quite difficult
right now, Cohn, 53, said today at an investor conference in
New York. What drives activity in our business is volatility.
If markets never move or don''t move, our clients really don''t
need to transact. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C) Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach, 60,
said yesterday that second-quarter trading revenue could fall as
much as 25 percent from year-earlier levels, and JPMorgan Chase
 Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent drop earlier this month. Cohn
stopped short of forecasting the decline for New York-based
Goldman Sachs. </p>
<p>We think, at the end of the day, it''s economic in
nature, Cohn said of the cause of lower client volume. We
don''t have clear vision of economic growth or lack of growth. </p>
<p>Cohn said while his firm has been gaining market share
among clients in the trading business, the lack of activity has
kept that from translating into higher revenue. </p>
<p>Low interest rates and the Federal Reserve''s program of
quantitative easing have resulted in reduced volatility, Cohn
said. He pointed to the Chicago Board Options Exchange
Volatility Index, a gauge of U.S. stock volatility known as the
VIX, which is trading 40 percent below its historical average.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury note traded over the past
three months in its narrowest band in the 35 years, Cohn said. </p>

<p>Brazil''s top economic forecaster is
challenging calls from banks such as JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
Deutsche Bank that policy makers will end the world''s longest
tightening cycle, saying faster inflation will motivate them to
boost interest rates for a 10th straight meeting. </p>
<p>Fernando Fix, chief economist at Votorantim Asset
Management in Sao Paulo, estimates central bankers will raise
interest rates by a quarter point to 11.25 percent when the two-day meeting ends today after 6 p.m. local time. That puts him at
odds with the median estimate of 53 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg and traders, who say there''s an 80 percent chance the
central bank will hold the benchmark Selic at 11 percent. </p>
<p>Consumer prices in the world''s second-largest emerging
market have accelerated in the past four months as service costs
push annual inflation to the highest level in 10 months. Policy
makers will continue to raise the benchmark Selic rate today as
faster inflation threatens investment and confidence levels in
Brazil, Fix said. </p>
<p>The central bank recognizes problems related to the
persistence of inflation, he said by telephone. It''s
becoming clearer that high inflation is counterproductive for
growth. </p>
<p>The central bank''s press office declined to comment on
market expectations when contacted by phone. </p>
<h2>Biggest Increase </h2>
<p>Policy makers have raised the Selic by 3.75 percentage
points since April 2013 to fight inflation that Fix said is
still being fanned by falling unemployment rates and rising
wages. That''s the biggest increase of benchmark borrowing costs
in the past year after Turkey and the longest cycle of monetary
policy tightening in the world. </p>
<p>Annual inflation accelerated to 6.31 percent in mid-May
from 6.19 percent the prior month as education, health care and
housing prices increased. The central bank targets 4.5 percent
inflation, plus or minus two percentage points. </p>
<p>The jobless rate fell to 4.9 percent last month, the lowest
since January, while average real income grew from last year. </p>
<p>Industrial production has been weaker, contracting twice in
the first quarter, as economists surveyed by Bloomberg forecast
economic growth will slow this year to 1.8 percent from 2.3
percent last year. Consumer confidence as measured by the
Getulio Vargas Foundation in May fell to the lowest level in
more than five years. </p>
<h2>Disappointing'' </h2>
<p>Gross domestic product expanded 0.2 percent in the first
quarter, down from 0.7 percent in the previous three months,
according to analysts polled by Bloomberg. The statistics agency
is scheduled to publish GDP data May 30. </p>
<p>The disappointing expansion in some wealthier nations
is helping reduce inflationary pressures, according to Fabio Akira, chief economist for JPMorgan in Brazil. Policy makers
also are aware that boosting the Selic more will hinder Brazil''s
economic expansion, he said. </p>
<p>Activity numbers are weakening, said Akira. We are
going to see data that will worsen further. </p>
<p>Akira is the best forecaster of Brazil''s economic data
after Fix, according to information compiled by Bloomberg. The
ranking is based on the accuracy of estimates for key economic
indicators over the past two years. </p>
<p>The local currency appreciation also will help relieve
inflationary pressures, Akira said. The real has strengthened
5.6 percent against the dollar this year, the best performance
among 24 emerging market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It
depreciated 0.6 percent yesterday to 2.2377 per U.S. dollar. </p>
<h2>Pared Bets </h2>
<p>Traders have pared bets for further tightening as policy
makers such as central bank President Alexandre Tombini and the
institution''s international affairs director, Luiz Awazu Pereira, said at separate events this month that monetary policy
has a delayed impact on consumer prices. </p>
<p>Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015 have
declined 21 basis points, or 0.21 percentage point, to 10.91
percent since the central bank''s last meeting. The breakeven
rate, based on the difference in yields of inflation-linked
bonds and interest-rate swaps due in 2015, dropped 58 basis
points over the same period. </p>
<p>Jose Carlos de Faria, chief Brazil economist for Deutsche
Bank, agrees with the central bank''s assessment. </p>
<p>It''s clear that we still haven''t seen the full effect
of rate increases, said Faria. The central bank has provided
signs that it will pause. </p>
<p>For Votorantim Asset Management''s Fix, policy makers will
need to increase the Selic by 100 basis points next year to
prevent consumer price increases from breaching the ceiling of
the target range. </p>
<p>Inflation is still worrisome, he said. </p>
<p>(The headline of an earlier version of this story was
corrected to show JPMorgan forecasts no change in the Selic.) </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Chief Executive
Officer Satya Nadella said he will seek to focus on businesses
where the company can lead, rather than harp on missed
opportunities in areas like tablet computers and hardware. </p>
<p>The question is, what is the next thing that is going to
make us better? Nadella said in a keynote interview yesterday
at Re/code''s Code conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, California.
It''s the hunt for what is it that is the inflection point that
matters more than what caused us to miss. </p>
<p>In Nadella''s first public interview since replacing Steve Ballmer as CEO in February, he also said he doesn''t plan to
change Microsoft''s plans for Xbox or sell off the Bing search
engine. The company will continue to span both enterprise and
consumer markets, he said. He highlighted Microsoft''s focus on
products that run on any device, as well as the areas of Web-based cloud computing, mobile and business software. </p>
<p>As part of that effort, the Redmond, Washington-based
company also used the conference to unveil a new Skype product
that translates Web-conference conversations in real time. Set
for a test release later this year, the Skype translator was
demonstrated in a conversation between Gurdeep Singh Pall, who
oversees Skype, and a German speaker. The product provides both
a spoken and text translation and will initially be available as
a stand-alone offering before being combined into the Skype
application. </p>
<h2>Global Product'' </h2>
<p>Skype is a very global product -- it''s all about
connecting people that are separated by distance, Pall said in
an interview. One of the biggest barriers that still remains
is really the language barrier. </p>
<p>Microsoft isn''t sure how many languages will be included
initially, Pall said. The company will release new languages as
they meet the bar for translation quality. </p>
<p>The software relies on work by Microsoft''s research arm, as
well as the Bing search unit, which has its own translation
product for Web pages and Internet content, he said. The Skype
service needs to use speech recognition to understand the
speaker, machine learning for the translation, and text-to-speech technology to send the translation to the listener. </p>
<p>Since taking over, Nadella has sought to focus the world''s
largest software maker on mobile and cloud products. He has
signaled a desire to shift attention to producing software for
rival operating systems like Apple Inc.''s iOS and Google Inc.''s
Android and has shuffled management in areas like marketing,
business development and the Xbox game console. </p>
<h2>Tablet Event </h2>
<p>A company event earlier this month to release a new Surface
tablet was noteworthy for what the CEO chose not to unveil.
While Microsoft showed a larger model of its Surface Pro, a
planned smaller tablet failed to meet with the approval of
Nadella and his executives and was pulled from the event, people
familiar with the matter said last week. </p>
<p>At the session in New York, Nadella didn''t discuss the
missing device and noted that Microsoft won''t seek to develop
hardware to compete with its partners and will instead focus on
areas where it can develop something unique. His comments
suggest a more selective approach to building devices rather
than going for the largest number of offerings. </p>
<p>In Nadella''s first quarter as CEO, Microsoft posted better-than-projected profit as cloud initiatives and cost controls
begun under Ballmer boosted results. </p>

available for Microsoft''s Windows and Windows Phone operating
systems, and will work with Office 365 online productivity

<p>The agreement marks a shift in what has sometimes been a
fractious relationship. In 2010, Microsoft sued Salesforce for
patent infringement, setting off a countersuit before the
companies settled later that year. Microsoft in 2005 also

their money with a competing product and in 2010 ran an anti-Salesforce ad campaign with the tagline Don''t Get Forced. </p>

makers are looking for more ways to let applications, even from

at Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach,
California, is betting five-year Treasuries, which are more
sensitive to changes in the central bank rate than longer-dated
bonds, will do well because markets overestimate how much the
Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. Bond managers at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and JPMorgan Chase 
Co. (JPM) say he''s wrong and the intermediate bonds he holds will
suffer when the Fed lifts borrowing costs. </p>
<p>Once they see the whites of the eyes of full employment,
they will want to normalize rates at a faster clip, Jonathan Beinner, co-head of global fixed income at Goldman Sachs Asset
Management, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<p>Gross, 70, is betting on an economic view he calls the
new neutral, which argues that the top speeds of the biggest
economies and their equilibrium interest rates have declined and
won''t return to levels seen before the financial crisis. While
most bond managers agree rates will be lower, with the federal
funds target ranging somewhere between 3 percent and 4 percent
by 2018, Gross sees it at just 2 percent, making bonds
attractive to Pimco that BlackRock and Goldman Sachs won''t
touch. </p>

<p>The city of Los Angeles accused
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) of targeting minority borrowers with
predatory loans in a lawsuit filed two days after Wells Fargo 
Co. (WFC) lost a court bid to dismiss a similar case. </p>
<p>The second-largest U.S. city sued Wells Fargo, Citigroup
Inc. and Bank of America Corp. last year, saying the lenders
engaged in biased practices since at least 2004 by placing
minority borrowers in mortgages they couldn''t afford and driving
up the number of foreclosures in their neighborhoods. </p>
<p>L.A. continues to suffer from the foreclosure crisis,
from blight in our neighborhoods to diminished revenue for basic
city services, City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement.
We''re fighting to hold those we allege are responsible to
account. </p>
<p>The claim against New York-based JPMorgan is the most
recent in a series of lawsuits by municipalities across the U.S.
to hold mortgage lenders responsible for fallout from the
collapse of the housing market. Yesterday, Providence, Rhode
Island, sued Banco Santander SA (SAN)''s U.S. unit, alleging
discriminatory lending in the years after the recession. </p>
<p>In today''s suit and earlier ones by Los Angeles, the city
accuses the banks of historically red-lining black and
Hispanic areas as no-loan zones. Starting in the late 1990s, the
banks engaged in reverse red-lining by flooding the areas
with subprime mortgages even when minorities qualified for
better terms, according to the complaint filed today in federal
court in Los Angeles. </p>
<h2>Fair Terms'' </h2>
<p>In addition, JPMorgan has since 2009 declined to offer
refinancing or loan modification to minority customers on fair
terms, according to the complaint. </p>
<p>We are disappointed the L.A. city attorney is pursuing an
adversarial approach to address city finances impacted by the
recent economic downturn, JPMorgan spokeswoman Suzanne Ryan
said in an e-mailed statement. The downturn was beyond our
control. </p>
<p>Counties encompassing Chicago and parts of Atlanta have
made similar claims in lawsuits against units of Bank of America
and HSBC Holdings Plc. (HSBA) The banks deny the claims, which allege
violations of the Fair Housing Act of 1968. </p>

<p>Nortel Networks Corp. (NRTLQ)''s defunct units in the U.K. and
Europe deserve part of the bankrupt telecom company''s $7.3
billion cash hoard because of their technology researchers'' past
work, an investment banker said. </p>
<p>Paul Huffard, a senior managing director at Blackstone
Group LP called to testify by the European units, argued May 28
in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware, that the best way to
split the cash is based on the research and development by
Nortel''s regional units. </p>
<p>Using that method, disputed by Nortel''s defunct U.S. and
Canadian components, the U.K. and European units deserve about
18 percent of the cash, Huffard said. </p>
<p>The contingents are in the third week of a six-week trial
over how to divide money raised in auctions after what was once
North America''s largest telephone-equipment maker went bankrupt
in 2009. The money includes proceeds of a patent sale that
raised $4.5 billion. </p>
<p>The units are arguing on behalf of creditors including

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE) agreed to pay $325
million to settle a lawsuit brought by health-care benefit
providers who claimed the drugmaker marketed the epilepsy drug
Neurontin for unapproved uses. </p>
<p>The settlement, which needs approval from a federal judge
in Boston, would end a case over claims that the company''s
Parke-Davis unit schemed to market the drug for unapproved
conditions as early as 1994. </p>
<p>The accord was disclosed in court papers filed May 30 in
Boston federal court, about six weeks after New York-based
Pfizer agreed to a $190 million settlement over Neurontin in a
separate case. </p>
<p>The Boston accord will resolve all third-party payer
claims regarding off-label promotion and state antitrust
claims over Neurontin sales, Steve Danehy, a company spokesman,
said in a statement. Pfizer didn''t admit wrongdoing, he said. </p>
<p>After more than ten years of hard-fought litigation, the
parties have reached a settlement that will bring this
litigation to a close, lawyers for the benefit firms said in a
memorandum filed May 30. </p>
<p>The companies alleged that Parke-Davis, part of Warner-Lambert Co., paid kickbacks to doctors to encourage them to
prescribe the anti-seizure drug for unapproved uses such as
bipolar and panic disorders. </p>
<p>Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert in 2000 and deliberately
expanded the promotion of off-label uses, lawyers for the
benefits firms said in an amended complaint filed in 2011. </p>
<h2>Unapproved Uses </h2>
<p>Companies including Louisiana Blue Cross/Blue Shield sought
to recover billions of dollars they paid as a result of a
scheme to market and sell Neurontin for a variety of uses for
which it is not approved or medically efficacious, according
to the complaint. </p>
<p>The drug is approved for the treatment of epilepsy and pain
from shingles or herpes zoster. </p>
<p>In the other settlement, disclosed in April, Pfizer agreed
to pay $190 million to end a suit over claims it violated U.S.
antitrust law by delaying generic versions of Neurontin. </p>
<p>The drugmaker delayed competition by improperly listing
certain patents with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration,

<p>The bidding war for Hillshire Brands
Co. (HSH) is proving costly for the Brazilian bankers at JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM) and Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>After firing Morgan Stanley from a bond sale, Sao Paulo-based JBS SA (JBSS3) pulled JPMorgan from a stock offering because the
two banks are helping Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) counter its bid for
Hillshire, two people familiar with the situation said, asking
not to be identified as the matter is private. </p>
<p>The two investment banks are advising Springdale, Arkansas-based Tyson in a $6.2 billion offer for the maker of Jimmy Dean
sausages that trumped a $5.6 billion proposal from JBS, the
world''s largest meat producer. The Brazilian company''s firing of
JPMorgan follows at least a dozen bond sales that the bank
helped manage for JBS since 2006 and a $6.3 billion takeover of
Bertin SA in 2009 where it acted as one of JBS''s advisers. </p>
<p>Tyson, the world''s No.2 meat producer, announced its bid
and said it hired the two New York-based banks two days after
JBS''s May 27 offer, saying JPMorgan is also likely to join
Morgan Stanley (MS) in providing bridge financing for the deal. </p>
<p>Jeremiah O''Callaghan, investor relations director for JBS,
declined to comment, as did Mary Claire Delaney, a spokeswoman
for Morgan Stanley, andVeronica Navarro Espinosa, a spokeswoman
for JPMorgan. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is the No. 2 global deals adviser this year,
handling $394 billion of announced mergers and acquisitions and
trailing only Goldman Sachs Group Inc., according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. JPMorgan is fifth. </p>
<p>JPMorgan ranks second among underwriters of Latin American
dollar- and euro-denominated bonds in 2014, while Morgan Stanley
is 10th, the data show. </p>
<h2>First IPO </h2>
<p>JBS is seeking regulatory approval to sell shares of its
JBS Foods SA unit in what would be Brazil''s first initial public
offering this year. Voting shares of the unit holding JBS''s
Brazilian pork, poultry and food-processing operations will be
listed in Brazil''s Novo Mercado subject to regulatory approval
and market conditions, it said in a May 20 filing. </p>
<p>The unit was formed after JBS agreed to buy Seara food-processing assets from Marfrig Global Foods SA for 5.85 billion
reais ($2.6 billion) in June 2013. JBS hired units of JPMorgan
and Banco Bradesco for a 3 billion-real IPO of the unit, two
people with direct knowledge of the matter said in April. JBS
also hired Banco Itau BBA SA, Banco Santander SA, Grupo BTG
Pactual and Banco do Brasil SA to underwrite the share offering. </p>
<p>Wells Fargo  Co. was helping manage JBS''s planned $750
million bond sale, which the meatpacker has temporarily
withdrawn as it seeks a new leading coordinator, according to a
May 29 statement. </p>
<h2>Reviewing Options </h2>
<p>Shares of JBS rose 0.8 percent today to 7.56 reais as of
11:22 a.m. in Sao Paulo. </p>
<p>JBS has spent $17 billion on acquisitions in the past
decade to overtake Tyson in the meat industry. JBS''s Pilgrim''s
Pride Corp. unit offered $45 a share for Hillshire, compared
with Tyson''s $50 offer. </p>
<p>Following Tyson''s May 29 bid, Pilgrim''s is reviewing its
options, according to a person familiar with the matter. It''s
too early to say whether the company will raise its offer, said
the person, who asked not to be identified because the
deliberations are private. </p>
<p>The acquisition of Hillshire, potentially JBS''s largest
takeover since the acquisition of Bertin in 2009, would boost
the company''s debt levels to at least the highest in four years. </p>

<p>Ecuador, one of only eight countries
to adopt the U.S. dollar as its official currency, swapped gold
with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for liquid assets in a sign the
nation is short on cash, according to Loomis Sayles  Co. </p>
<p>It does raise a red flag, Bianca Taylor, a sovereign
analyst who helps oversee $210 billion at Loomis Sayles, said
yesterday in a phone interview from Boston. Whenever a country
needs to sell or monetize its gold reserves, it''s definitely a
signal that the sovereign is strapped for cash. </p>
<p>President Rafael Correa is stepping up his search for
financing at home and abroad after borrowing more than $11
billion from China since defaulting on $3.2 billion of foreign
debt five years ago. Ecuador''s use of the dollar means it can''t
finance deficits by printing money like other countries. Correa,
a self-described revolutionary socialist, is now planning to
raise about $700 million in an overseas bond sale this year and
agreed to allow the International Monetary Fund to perform an
economic review for the first time since 2008. </p>
<p>Ecuador''s central bank, stripped of its autonomy in a
constitutional referendum a year after Correa took power in
2007, says it invested the gold with Goldman Sachs in return
for assets that can be liquidated within seven days. The country
will get the same quantity of gold back three years from now and
expects to earn a profit of $16 million to $20 million from the
deal, it said. </p>
<h2>Productive Asset </h2>
<p>The operation didn''t imply any payment of financing costs
by the central bank to Goldman Sachs, the bank said today in an
e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. The central
bank said it also doesn''t need the liquidity to finance
spending. </p>
<p>Gold that was not generating any returns in vaults,
causing storage costs, now becomes a productive asset that will
generate profits, the central bank said in the statement on
its website disclosing the operation. These interventions in
the gold market represent the beginning of a new and permanent
strategy of active participation by the bank, through purchases,
sales and financial operations, that will contribute to the
creation of new financial investment opportunities. </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said yesterday the deal wasn''t a sale
and was a normal operation of investing reserves for profit. </p>
<p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman
Sachs, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Puzzling Transaction'' </h2>
<p>The transaction covers 466,000 ounces of gold, according to
the central bank. That''s 1,165 gold bars, worth about $580
million at yesterday''s prices. </p>
<p>A clue to the operation came last week, when the central
bank reported a $605 million drop in its gold reserves to $493
million during the week ending May 23. Net currency reserves
rose by $434 million. At the time the central bank didn''t
explain the change. </p>
<p>It''s not clear what Goldman Sachs plans to do with the
bullion, said George Gero, a vice president and precious-metals
strategist in New York at RBC Capital Markets. </p>
<p>It''s really a puzzling transaction, Gero said yesterday
in a telephone interview. The idea that there was a large sale
and you don''t know when it will come out into the market is
probably pressuring prices. </p>
<h2>Venezuela Proposal </h2>
<p>Spot gold prices had fallen for five straight days before

of $1,900.20 an ounce in September 2011. Prices have gained 3.6
percent so far this year and will fall to $1,240 by the end of
the year, according to the median estimate of 34 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. </p>

higher gold prices, by 24 percent in the week ended May 27,

holdings, or bets on a gold-price decrease, surged 72 percent,
the most in six months, the data show. </p>
<p>Last year, Goldman Sachs proposed a swap with Venezuela to
provide $1.68 billion in cash to be backed by $1.85 billion of
gold, documents obtained by Bloomberg News showed. </p>
<p>The deal, which wasn''t completed, would have carried an
interest rate of 7.5 percent plus the three-month London
interbank offered rate. Venezuela would have kept its exposure
to gold, with the nation posting the precious metal or cash to a
margin account if the price fell and Goldman Sachs posting U.S.
dollars if it rose, the documents show. </p>
<p>Ecuador''s transaction with Goldman Sachs has nothing to
do with the proposed Venezuelan deal, the central bank said in
its e-mail today. </p>
<h2>Financing Options </h2>
<p>Ecuador will probably use the transaction proceeds to
finance public spending, said Martin Castellano, a senior
economist for Latin America at the Institute of International
Finance, a trade association of banks and money managers
including Goldman Sachs. Given the country''s use of the
greenback as its official currency, the government needs to
ensure it has enough liquidity to avoid balance-of-payment
problems, he said. </p>
<p>The measure reflects the government''s willingness to
pursue whichever financing option is at hand in order to avoid a
fiscal adjustment, Castellano said yesterday in a telephone
interview from Washington. </p>

Byron H. Pollitt Jr., who joined the biggest bank-card network

<p>Google Inc. (GOOG)''s leadership in mobile
search is under pressure as cell phone and tablet users look for
information from applications rather than from their browser
query bar. </p>
<p>By 2016, Google''s share of the U.S. market should fall to
64 percent in 2016 from 83 percent in 2012, according a new
report by EMarketer Inc. Meanwhile, Yelp Inc. (YELP), whose popular
application helps users find ratings and information on local
restaurants and dry cleaners, will grow to 1.9 percent from 0.5
percent. </p>
<p>Google became the most valuable Internet company in the
world based on its desktop-based query engine. While its revenue
tied to smartphones and tablets is growing, the Mountain View,
California-based company is grappling with rising competition to
its search product on mobile devices. Spending on mobile search
is set to make up 86 percent of the U.S. digital search market
by 2018, up from 13 percent in 2012, according to EMarketer. </p>
<p>Even though browser-based search is a common behavior
among mobile owners, search engines are not necessarily the
first place smartphone and tablet users turn, Cathy Boyle, an
an analyst at EMarketer, said in the report. The explosion of
mobile app development and usage means mobile users have more --
and more specialized -- alternatives for finding information. </p>
<h2>Growing Rivals </h2>
<p>Other search products are growing as well. A category
including direct Google rivals such as Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)''s Bing,
as well as applications tailored to more specific industries,
such as e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc., travel-focused Kayak
and job-hunting service Indeed Inc., will have 30 percent of the
market by 2016, up from 5.4 percent, according to the report. </p>
<p>While Google has its own phone- and tablet-based search
application, it gets much of its traffic through small query
boxes that appear at the top of browsers as users surf the Web.
The company has the default search engine on Apple Inc.''s iPhone
and on many devices made by partners, including Samsung
Electronics Co., that use Google''s Android operating system. </p>
<p>Google is providing a new feature on its search ads that
brings consumers directly to an application from a mobile query-results page -- instead of staying within a Web browser. So, a
user looking for a hotel in San Francisco, for example, could go
immediately to the specific page inside the installed
HotelTonight Inc. application. </p>

reorganize and will seek final approval July 15 to exit
bankruptcy. </p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robert Grossman yesterday approved
MModal''s disclosure statement, which explains how much creditors
will get. The reorganized company is projected to earn $57
million before taxes and other items this year and $71 million a
year by 2017, enough to support its new debt load of about $320
million in secured debt, according to court papers. </p>
<p>The disclosure statement complies with the requirements
of the bankruptcy code and has enough information to allow
creditors to vote on the plan, Grossman wrote in an order in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan. </p>
<p>MModal, acquired by New York-based JPMorgan''s One Equity
Partners in a $1.14 billion leveraged buyout in August 2012,
filed for bankruptcy on March 20. The Franklin, Tennessee-based
company listed assets of $626.8 million and liabilities totaling
$876.3 million. </p>
<p>MModal struggled to make payments on the debt as software

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM)
won a contract with China''s state-owned Shanghai Airport
Authority to use cloud computing to help move traffic more
efficiently. </p>
<p>The IBM system, the first phase of which was completed in
March, helps the airport manage everything from airplane taxi
times to passengers waiting on a concourse, the Armonk, New
York-based company said in a statement today. The system
dramatically improved the punctuality of flight departures,
according to the statement, which didn''t provide specific
figures. </p>
<p>The contract gives IBM a boost as it seeks to reverse
declining sales in China, where revenue fell 20 percent last
quarter, dragged down by declining hardware spending. U.S.
companies have also been grappling with tensions over
cybersecurity in China after U.S. prosecutors last month charged
five Chinese military officers with allegedly hacking into
computers of American companies. </p>
<p>China is reviewing whether domestic banks'' reliance on
IBM''s high-end servers compromises the nation''s financial
security, Bloomberg News reported May 27 citing people familiar
with the matter. IBM said last month it wasn''t aware of any
government policy against use of its servers. The company''s
Shanghai-based spokesman Anthony Guerrieri said today''s
announcement is unrelated to any government reviews. </p>
<h2>Shanghai Airport </h2>
<p>We are proud to be selected by Shanghai Hongqiao
International Airport as its trusted partner, Ernie Hu, IBM''s
vice president for its software group in China, said in the
statement. IBM has a long history of innovation in

company''s challenges in China are related to the normal cycle of
upgrades for hardware such as servers. While IBM doesn''t break

came from the Asia-Pacific region excluding Japan, according to

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) eliminated fixed-income trading jobs in London, New York and Toronto this week
because of tough market conditions, people with knowledge of the
plan said. </p>
<p>The dismissals focused on traders in foreign exchange and
interest rates, the people said, asking not to be identified as
the details are private. The cuts were made starting June 3, two
of the people said. Hugh Fraser, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley
in London, declined to comment. </p>
<p>The biggest trading banks have warned investors about a
slump in fixed-income trading activity this quarter amid low
volatility. That threatens Morgan Stanley''s quest to boost the
return on equity of its fixed-income business to 10 percent. </p>
<p>The cuts included closing the interest-rates trading desk
in Toronto, according to three of the people. The desk consisted
of four employees, said one of the people. The Toronto desk was
started in 2012, when the rates business was run by Glenn Hadden, a Canadian who left the bank earlier this year. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s fixed-income business, which is run by
Robert Rooney and Michael Heaney and overseen by Colm Kelleher,
earned at least a 10 percent ROE in three of its five units last
year, with interest rates and commodities as the laggards,
according to the bank. The firm agreed to sell part of its
commodities business to Russian company OAO Rosneft (ROSN) to boost
returns. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which generates more revenue from equities
trading than fixed income, was alone among major U.S. banks in
registering a trading increase during the first three months of
2014, though Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said in April
that she saw weakness ahead. </p>
<h2>Lower Activity'' </h2>
<p>The volumes that we talked a lot about during the first
quarter -- lower activity -- we''re continuing to see that really
does persist into the second quarter, Porat said at the time. </p>
<p>Investment-banking revenue at five of the top securities
firms may drop 7 percent on average in the second quarter as
clients cut back on fixed-income trading and margins narrow,
JPMorgan Cazenove analysts said in a note to clients on May 29. </p>
<p>Average sales from fixed-income, currencies and commodities
trading may fall about 10 percent, while revenue from advising
on deals and underwriting securities will probably rise about 1
percent, the analysts wrote. </p>

market and regulators investigate non-bank servicers. The two
largest non-bank operators, Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN) and Nationstar
Mortgage Holdings Inc. (NSM), both lost market share in the first
quarter, while Walter Investment enlarged its loan holdings to
$234 billion, according to company filings. </p>
<p>The huge shift in servicing from banks to non-banks has
created a landscape that''s rapidly changing, said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of research firm Federal Financial
Analytics Inc. in Washington. No one can know who the winners
and the losers will be until the dust settles. </p>
<p>Walter Investment had a 2.4 percent share of the servicing
market in the first quarter compared with Ocwen''s 4.5 percent
and Nationstar''s 3.9 percent, according to Bloomberg data. Wells
Fargo  Co. led with 18 percent. </p>
<p>Walter Investment''s stock price gained 13 percent to $28.99
from the beginning of May through June 4, exceeding the 11
percent advance by Lewisville, Texas-based Nationstar, which is
majority owned by Fortress Investment Group LLC. (FIG) Atlanta-based
Ocwen, which is controlled by billionaire founderWilliam Erbey,
gained 3.1 percent in the period. </p>
<h2>Lawsky Probes </h2>
<p>The New York Department of Financial Services is
investigating both Ocwen and Nationstar. The companies about
doubled their holdings of mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs, in
2013, according to company reports. </p>
<p>Ocwen said on Feb. 6 that the department had blocked its
deal to buy $39 billion of servicing rights from Wells Fargo. </p>
<p>It is appropriate for regulators, where warranted, to
halt the explosive growth in the nonbank mortgage servicing
industry to protect homeowners, Benjamin Lawsky, the
department''s head, said a week later in a speech in New York. </p>
<p>Lawsky also sent a letter in February to Ocwen citing his
concerns about potential conflicts of interest among four
companies headed by Erbey that provide mortgage-related services
to each other. </p>
<p>In a letter to Nationstar in March, the regulator said it
was probing the impact of the firm''s rapid growth on homeowners
and asked for data about its servicing. </p>
<h2>Ocwen Shrinks </h2>
<p>Both companies have disputed Lawsky''s comments, saying they
have better performance records than the nation''s biggest banks.
The companies are cooperating with the probes. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Ocwen and Nationstar declined to comment for
this story. </p>
<p>Ocwen''s loan portfolio dropped 3.2 percent to $440.7
billion in the first quarter, and Nationstar''s portfolio fell
7.5 percent to $384 billion. PHH, which also manages car and
truck fleets, declined 1 percent to $225.7 billion, putting it
in fourth place. </p>
<p>Walter is buying loans, and in the last few months we''ve
seen a slowdown in the acquisitions by Ocwen and Nationstar,
said Douglas Harter, a director and servicing analyst at Credit
Suisse Group in New York. Ocwen and Nationstar will have to
adjust to a different environment where deal sizes are smaller
and there is more focus on integration. That''s going to slow
them down. </p>
<p>Two years ago, Walter Investment and other non-banks held
MSRs on less than 2 percent of U.S. home loans. Banks have been
selling these rights since the Federal Reserve began drafting
new rules in 2012 to implement an international banking
agreement known as Basel III aimed at preventing the type of
financial shock seen in 2008. </p>
<h2>New Rules </h2>
<p>The agreement increases the amount of capital banks are
required to have to hold MSRs on their books. Non-banks such as
Walter Investment are not bound by the new rules. </p>
<p>Today, non-banks control a total of about 14 percent of the
market, according to Bloomberg data. In the next two years,
banks probably will sell another $1 trillion in MSRs, according
to Harter. That would push the non-bank share to 24 percent,
according to Bloomberg data. </p>
<p>Walter Investment is also under scrutiny. In February, the
company disclosed in a filing that the Federal Trade Commission
and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau informed it of a
possible enforcement action. The details have not been made
public. </p>
<h2>Mortgage Settlement </h2>
<p>We''re currently in discussions, said Denmar Dixon,
Walter Investment''s chief investment officer. We''d like to
find a resolution to that in the near term. Right now, we can''t
predict when that will come. </p>
<p>Joseph Smith, who oversees a $25 billion mortgage
settlement between state and federal agencies and five banks,
said in May that Green Tree Servicing LLC, a unit of Walter
Investment, didn''t use proper procedures in servicing loans it
bought last year from Residential Capital LLC, a company covered
by the agreement. The former ResCap loans make up about 14
percent of Walter''s portfolio. </p>
<p>This was our first time through the testing, said
Dixon. We are a pretty compliant shop, and highly rated. This
was layered on top of that. We will be tested again on the
metrics, and expect to pass, he said. </p>
<h2>Green Tree </h2>
<p>Compass Point Research  Trading LLC in March ranked Walter
Investment as the top performer among all loan servicers, based
on customer-complaint data from CFPB. Walter had a 0.8 percent
complaint ratio when measured against the amount of delinquent
loans in its portfolio, followed by Nationstar at 1.3 percent
and Ocwen at 2 percent. The average rate for servicers, most of
them banks, was 4.3 percent. </p>
<p>Mark O''Brien, CEO of Walter Investment, has his roots in
the homebuilding industry. He was CEO of PulteGroup Inc. in
2001, when it was known as Pulte Homes, and oversaw the $1.8
billion purchase of Del Webb that created what was then the
nation''s largest residential builder. </p>
<p>O''Brien left Pulte in 2003, saying he was retiring. In
2005, he joined Walter Industries Inc. as a director and in 2009
became head of Walter Investment when it was spun off. </p>
<p>Walter Investment has more than tripled its holdings of
MSRs under O''Brien''s leadership. Last year, the company acquired
servicing rights on more than $125 billion of mortgages from
companies including Bank of America Corp., according to Walter
regulatory filings. </p>
<p>O''Brien comes from a homebuilder background that includes
financing those home purchases and really knowing those
customers, said Credit Suisse''s Harter. It''s a good platform
for building a large-scale servicer. </p>

Energy Partners LP for $200 million as part of the bank''s effort
to reduce capital used by the commodities business. </p>
<p>NGL, a Tulsa, Oklahoma-based propane company, will also buy
physical inventory from Morgan Stanley for as much as $550
million depending on prevailing commodity prices, a person
briefed on the terms of the agreement said today, asking not to
be named because some details aren''t public. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is divesting physical oil businesses to 
improve returns in fixed-income trading and avoid increased 
regulatory scrutiny on banks'' ownership of those units. The 
New York-based firm agreed to sell its oil-merchanting business 
to Moscow-based OAO Rosneft in December. </p>
<p>Following this transaction, Morgan Stanley''s leading
commodities division will be leaner, more client-focused and
better aligned with the rest of the firm''s businesses, Colm Kelleher, head of the investment-banking and trading division,
said in the statement. The bank will continue to service the
supply and risk-management needs of our clients across the oil,
power and gas, and metals sectors. </p>
<p>The sale, expected to be completed in the third quarter,
will generate a gain that''s not material, Morgan Stanley said in

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer services provider, and Epic
Systems Corp. will team up to compete for an $11 billion project
to manage U.S. troops'' electronic health records. </p>
<p>IBM announced its plans to bid today, even before the
Defense Department formally starts the competition for the
information-technology system. Rival bids may come from
Accenture Plc (ACN) and Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) </p>
<p>The winner gets one of the biggest opportunities in federal
information technology, where new projects are under scrutiny
after the flawed rollout of the Obamacare website. A better
Pentagon system is needed so troops'' health records can be
shared quickly with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is
struggling to reduce backlogs in disability claims. </p>
<p>I hope people expect results, because this is where we
show up, Andy Maner, managing partner for IBM''s U.S. federal
division, said in a phone interview. We don''t bid on
everything, but when we do, we want to change the world. </p>
<p>The Pentagon''s solicitation for the contract, possibly with
a 10-year duration, may be posted as early as next month, Maner
said. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, already has more than 100
employees working to develop a proposal, he said. </p>
<p>This has been a thing we''ve had circled for more than
three years, Maner said. </p>
<h2>Website Fixes </h2>
<p>The contract may attract bids from companies such as
Dublin-based Accenture and Falls Church, Virginia-based
Northrop, according to Brian Friel, a Bloomberg Industries
analyst. </p>
<p>The U.S. government this year turned to Accenture for help
fixing healthcare.gov, the enrollment website for the federal
health-care overhaul. The company succeeds Montreal-based CGI
Group Inc. (GIB/A), criticized for the website''s early troubles. </p>
<p>Other competitors for the Pentagon program might include
Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) and Reston,
Virginia-based Leidos Holdings Inc. (LDOS), Friel said. </p>
<p>Northrop built the original system, which is now being
maintained by Leidos, he said. </p>
<p>The planned system, which will replace the older one, will
track U.S. forces'' health records no matter where they receive
care, whether on base, on a ship, in a military hospital or
close to combat. It will handle the health records of 9.7
million beneficiaries, including active-duty military, retirees
and their dependents. </p>
<h2>Epic''s Software </h2>
<p>Service members, their families and health-care providers
who care for them deserve the best health care our country can
provide, Carl Dvorak, president of Verona, Wisconsin-based
Epic, said in a statement. They would benefit from an
integrated system that leverages best practices from other large
and successful health-care organizations. </p>
<p>Epic''s enterprise software is widely used in the health-care industry, including by Johns Hopkins Medicine, Kaiser
Permanente and the Cleveland Clinic. </p>
<p>IBM and Epic have worked together on other health-care
projects, including for Kaiser. </p>
<p>IBM was the 51st biggest federal contractor in the fiscal
year that ended Sept. 30, receiving $1.2 billion in prime, or
direct, awards, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
company ranked 45th in 2012, when it had $1.5 billion in U.S.
contracts. </p>
<p>The IBM-Epic collaboration will be led by Keith Salzman, a
former Army hospital chief medical information officer who is
now IBM''s chief medical information officer, and use technology
from its Watson supercomputer, best known for beating human
contestants on the Jeopardy! TV game show. </p>
<h2>Claims Backlog </h2>
<p>The Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs have
been pressured by lawmakers, White House officials and veterans
to help fix the VA''s backlog in processing disability claims.
The military has contributed to that bottleneck, some lawmakers
and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have said. </p>
<p>The Pentagon announced in May 2013 that it would build its
own electronic health-records system. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to work with the VA to develop a seamless
system. </p>
<p>The military''s plan raised concerns among lawmakers and
veterans'' organizations that had pushed the two agencies to
build a single system for current and former troops'' health
records. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) will boost
profitability as it pays brokers a smaller cut of revenue and
the firm''s commodities business earns better returns following
sales of two units, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said. </p>
<p>The company, which earned a return on equity of about 5
percent each of the past two years, has a plan to in 2015 and
beyond, sustainably drive ROE at 10 percent or higher, Gorman
said today at his bank''s investor conference in New York. He
didn''t provide a return target for this year. Last year, he said
the firm could post a 10 percent ROE by 2014 if regulators
allowed it to return a reasonable amount of capital to
shareholders through dividends and buybacks. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s shares jumped 64 percent last year as the
company increased brokerage margins and equity-trading revenue.
Gorman today laid out the potential drivers of further growth in
revenue and profitability, including additional lending, lower
cost ratios and greater payouts of capital. </p>
<p>The bank will seek to lower the compensation-to-revenue
ratio in its wealth-management unit to 55 percent or less from
58 percent in 2013, Gorman said. He also set targets of a 40
percent ratio for the New York-based firm''s investment bank and
asset-management divisions. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s commodities division eventually can more
than double its return on equity from less than 5 percent in
2012 following sales of two oil businesses, he said. ROE is a
measure of how well a firm reinvested profit to generate
additional earnings. </p>
<p>The bank announced this week an agreement to sell its stake
in oil-transportation company TransMontaigne Inc. to NGL Energy
Partners LP (NGL) for $200 million. Morgan Stanley agreed in December
to sell its oil-merchanting business to Moscow-based OAO
Rosneft. (ROSN) </p>
<p>Gorman said today he expects the Rosneft deal to be
completed in the third quarter. Bloomberg News reported in April
that the two companies probably would wait to seek regulatory
approval until political tensions cooled after the U.S.
sanctioned Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, an ally of Russian President
Vladimir Putin, over the turmoil in Ukraine. </p>

<p>Foreign banks are projected by
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to lend less money against commodity
inventories in China amid a probe into metals stockpiles in the
biggest consumer of raw materials. </p>
<p>Claims that single batches of copper and aluminum at
Qingdao Port were pledged as collateral for multiple loans risks
undermining a broader practice in which traders use everything
from iron ore to rubber to get funding. The investigation is
already weighing down copper prices and may curb foreign
exchange inflows to China, according to a report by Goldman. </p>
<p>The probe may affect metals stockpiles at the northeastern
port held by Citic Resources Holdings Ltd., the trader
controlled by China''s largest state-owned company said today.
Standard Chartered Plc said last week it was reviewing financing
to some companies in China and Standard Bank Group started
looking at potential irregularities with metals at Qingdao.
Citigroup Inc. said it would work closely with authorities and
warehousing companies to resolve any problems for clients. </p>
<p>The developments in Qingdao are likely to continue the
significant scaling back of FX inflows from foreign banks into
China via commodity financing business, analysts at New York-based Goldman said in the report dated yesterday. As foreign
banks reduce their exposure to Chinese commodity financing
deals, the profitability of these could be reduced
meaningfully. </p>
<h2>Price Drop </h2>
<p>Copper in London may fall to $6,200 a metric ton before the
end of this year, analysts including Roger Yuan and Max Layton
said in a report. Benchmark three-month futures on the London
Metal Exchange slumped 9.7 percent this year and traded at
$6,645 at 5:45 p.m. Shanghai time, putting them on course for
the lowest closing price since May 1. </p>
<p>Currency flows may be affected because Chinese borrowers
often use commodities as collateral to get low interest loans
from overseas lenders in dollars. They then bring the money
onshore to invest in the nation''s higher interest rate
environment before later repaying the sum. </p>
<p>Qingdao Port said in a June 6 statement that public
security authorities were probing alleged fraud involving
material held in its Dagang bonded storage area. </p>
<p>Public security authorities in Qingdao have not responded
to calls by Bloomberg News seeking comment. </p>
<p>The authenticity of warehouse receipts is critical to the
practice of inventory financing in bonded warehouses, Barclays
Plc analyst Sijin Cheng wrote in a report last week. Feedback
from trading house contacts suggests that this investigation has
cast a pall on the financing trade as a whole. </p>
<h2>Port Shares </h2>
<p>Shares (6198) of Qingdao Port International Co., which listed on
the stock exchange in Hong Kong on June 5, have fallen 3.5
percent from their offer price to $HK3.63 today. </p>
<p>The investigation is into the owner of some metals and a
third party storing them in the Dagang area and not Qingdao Port
itself, according to the June 6 statement. </p>
<p>The company continues to provide regular port services to
other clients and for all metal ore products, including aluminum
and copper products, it said. </p>
<p>Separately, some Chinese banks have raised margins for
letters of credit for iron ore financing to as much as 50
percent from as much as 30 percent previously, said two people
with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Others reduced overall credit available for iron ore
financing and set a cap on credit used in some locations
including Rizhao, a port located about 100 kilometers (65 miles)
southeast of Qingdao, according to the people, who asked not to
be identified because they aren''t authorized to speak publicly. </p>
<h2>Locked Gates </h2>
<p>The Dagang area has been sealed and gates to the area are
chained and padlocked, Reuters reported. The amount of metal
involved in the probe was about 20,000 tons of copper, almost
100,000 tons of aluminum ingots and about 200,000 tons of
alumina, Reuters said, citing a source it didn''t name. </p>
<p>Jiangxi Copper Co., China''s biggest smelter of the metal,
said the problems at Qingdao don''t represent a systemic risk and
won''t hurt demand or production of industrial metals. </p>
<p>As well as industrial metals, Qingdao port also handles
iron ore and agricultural commodities including cotton and
rubber. </p>
<p>Shanghai is China''s biggest port and storage center for
industrial metals. Copper inventories in bonded zones in
Shanghai were estimated to be about 815,000 tons in April by
CRU, a London-based consultant. Citrine Capital Management LLC
said in June that stockpiles in bonded warehouses across China
may be about 900,000 tons. </p>
<p>The probe will make China''s banks extremely cautious
about financing deals, though lenders will continue to help fund
shipments to end-users, Colin Hamilton, Macquarie Group Ltd.''s
head of commodities research, said June 4. </p>
<p>Some copper may be moved from China to LME warehouses in
South Korea, and possibly Singapore and Malaysia, Jeremy Goldwyn, head of business development in Asia for Sucden
Financial Ltd., said June 5. </p>

a U.K. regulatory period ends in six months, D''Amelio said he
couldn''t comment about whether it will do so. </p>
<p>D''Amelio also said Pfizer''s attempt at a mega-merger
doesn''t rule out the possibility the company will instead break
up into smaller parts. AstraZeneca last month rejected a
takeover offer valued at 55 pounds a share. </p>
<p>In a word it was price, that kept the two companies
from sealing a deal, D''Amelio said. Any other issues that were
raised during negotiations and conversations I think we were
able to adequately, effectively address those. </p>
<p>New York-based Pfizer was seeking to lower its tax rate
through the deal by moving its official headquarters to London.
The company also sought to gain from AstraZeneca''s experimental
immune therapy cancer drugs, a new class of treatments that
would have filled a hole in Pfizer''s product portfolio.
AstraZeneca has predicted those products may help raise its
annual sales by 75 percent to $45 billion by 2023. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), the world''s biggest computer-services provider, has joined with Epic Systems Corp. to compete for an $11 billion project to manage U.S. troops'' electronic health records. </p> <p>IBM announced its plans to bid yesterday, before the Pentagon''s official start of the competition. Rival bids for the information-technology contract may come from Accenture Plc (ACN), Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) and Leidos Holdings Inc. (LDOS), which said today it is interested in the work. </p> <p>The winner will get one of the biggest opportunities in federal information technology, where new projects are under more scrutiny after the flawed rollout of the Obamacare website. An improved military system is needed so troops'' health records can be shared faster with the Department of Veterans Affairs, which is struggling to reduce backlogs in disability claims. </p> <p>I hope people expect results, because this is where we show up, said Andy Maner, managing partner for IBM''s U.S. federal division. We don''t bid on everything, but when we do, we want to change the world. </p> <p>The Pentagon''s solicitation for the contract, possibly with a 10-year duration, may be posted as early as next month, Maner said. IBM, based in Armonk, New York, already has more than 100 employees working to develop a proposal, he said. </p> <p>This has been a thing we''ve had circled for more than three years, Maner said. </p> <h2>Website Fixes </h2> <p>Leidos, based in Reston, Virginia, has unmatched depth and breadth of experience in commercial and government electronic health-record systems, Melissa Koskovich, a Leidos spokeswoman, said in an e-mail today when asked about the prospect of seeking the contract. </p> <p>We look forward to the opportunity to respond to the needs of this important program, she said. </p> <p>The contract might also attract bids from companies such as Dublin-based Accenture, Falls Church, Virginia-based Northrop, and Palo Alto, California-based Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), according to Brian Friel, a Bloomberg Industries analyst. </p> <p>The U.S. government this year turned to Accenture for help fixing healthcare.gov, the enrollment website for the federal health-insurance overhaul. The company succeeded Montreal-based CGI Group Inc. (GIB/A), criticized for the website''s early troubles. </p> <h2>U.S. Troops </h2> <p>Northrop built the original Pentagon health-records system, which is now being maintained by Leidos, Friel said. </p> <p>The system planned to replace the older one will track U.S. forces'' health records no matter where they receive care, whether on base, on a ship, in a military hospital or close to combat. It will handle the records of 9.7 million beneficiaries, including active-duty military, retirees and their dependents. </p> <p>Service members, their families and health-care providers who care for them deserve the best health care our country can provide, Carl Dvorak, president of Verona, Wisconsin-based Epic, said in a statement. They would benefit from an integrated system that leverages best practices from other large and successful health-care organizations. </p> <p>Epic''s enterprise software is widely used in the health-care industry, including by Johns Hopkins Medicine, Kaiser Permanente and the Cleveland Clinic. </p> <p>IBM and Epic have worked together on other health-care projects, including for Kaiser. </p> <p>IBM was the 51st biggest federal contractor in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, receiving $1.2 billion in prime -- or direct -- awards, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <h2>Watson Supercomputer </h2> <p>The IBM-Epic collaboration will be led by Keith Salzman, a former Army hospital chief medical information officer who is IBM''s chief medical information officer. It will use technology from its Watson supercomputer, best known for beating human contestants on the Jeopardy! television game show. </p> <p>The Pentagon and the Department of Veterans Affairs have been pressured by lawmakers, White House officials and veterans to help fix the VA''s backlog in processing disability claims. The military has contributed to that bottleneck, some lawmakers and the Veterans of Foreign Wars have said. </p> <p>The Pentagon said in May 2013 that it would build its own electronic health-records system. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel promised to work with the VA to develop a seamless system. </p> <p>The military''s plan raised concerns among lawmakers and veterans'' organizations that had pushed the two agencies to build a single system for current and former troops'' health records. </p> <p> ', 'IBM-Epic Team Vies for $11 Billion Pentagon IT System', 'By Jonathan D.

<p>A safety escort ahead of the over-size truck that struck and collapsed a bridge over Interstate 5
north of Seattle last year was on the phone and didn''t radio a
warning about the structure''s height, a U.S. report shows. </p>
<p>The woman at the wheel of the pilot car told
investigators she was speaking on a mobile-phone call May 23,
2013, as the truck behind her hit a steal beam that sent the
structure plummeting into the Skagit River, according to records
released today by the National Transportation Safety Board. </p>
<p>She was watching the accident truck cross the bridge in
her rear-view and side mirrors and saw dust and the bridge
collapse, the NTSB said in a summary of an interview with the
pilot-car driver. </p>
<p>The bridge failure severed the major transportation artery
between Canada and the U.S. West Coast and sent three people
into the river, causing minor injuries. </p>
<p>The NTSB released dozens of reports, interview transcripts,
photos and other documents. The agency is planning to issue a
cause for the accident later this year. The NTSB is looking at
how the bridge height was marked, how previous bridge collisions
were investigated by state authorities and the actions of the
drivers involved, according to the records. </p>
<p>The bridge gave way about 7 p.m. after the impact fractured
a steel support beam. </p>
<h2>Bridge Repaired </h2>
<p>The structure was built using a now out-of-date design that
is vulnerable to failure if only one of its steel support
members is damaged. Current bridges are built with redundant
structures so that damage to any individual component won''t
cause a complete breakdown. </p>
<p>The driver of the truck that hit the bridge told
investigators he had to swerve to the right, where the structure
of the bridge was lower, to avoid another truck passing him,
according to the NTSB. </p>
<p>The pilot car ahead of the truck was carrying a pole about
the same height as the truck''s load so that it would serve as a
warning in case the bridge was too low. The pilot-car driver
said her pole never hit the bridge, so she didn''t warn the truck
driver, according to the NTSB. </p>

repair was installed in September. </p>

<p>A four-decade-old U.S. ban on crude
exports should remain until a saturation point when domestic
refining capacity can''t absorb increased oil production,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) </p>
<p>Maintaining the statutory curb on shipments overseas will
deliver the highest value to the U.S. economy, the bank said
in an e-mailed report today. At current extraction costs, the
export ban may start to weigh on U.S. output growth in coming
years, it predicted. </p>
<p>The Goldman view is very credible, said Sarah Emerson,
managing principal of ESAI Energy Inc. in Wakefield,
Massachusetts. Refiners are processing increasing output here
and that''s a greater benefit to the economy. </p>
<p>Rising production from shale formations has allowed the
U.S., the world''s biggest oil consumer, to import less crude,
fueling speculation that the curb on exports could be lifted. A
1975 federal law bans most shipments overseas, with only
deliveries of refined products including gasoline and diesel
allowed. Supporters of the ban say keeping U.S.-produced oil at
home helps reduce fuel prices for industry and consumers. </p>
<h2>Optimal Decision'' </h2>
<p>Keeping the ban in place would be the optimal decision
until saturation is reached to maximize the contribution of the
refining sector, said Damien Courvalin, a Goldman analyst in
New York. Once saturation is reached, it would then be optimal
to lift the ban as value added from higher production
outperforms value added from the refining sectors. </p>
<p>Uncertainty over the future of the ban is probably delaying
investment in U.S. refining capacity, according to Goldman. Oil
companies are seeking ways around it by using simple, one-step
plants capable of turning crude into products for exports. BP
Plc signed on to take at least 80 percent of the capacity of a
new $360 million mini-refinery in Houston that will process just
enough to escape the restrictions. </p>
<p>IHS Inc. last month said the ban should be lifted because
the U.S. will benefit from higher oil production and reduced
gasoline prices. The nation may save an average of $67 billion a
year from its import bill in 2016 and add 964,000 jobs by 2018,
according to the Colorado-based consultant. </p>
<h2>Premature'' Urgency </h2>
<p>The urgency of the debate has been premature, Emerson
said. We aren''t at the saturation point and won''t be for a
long time because there are a bunch of ways refiners are able to
transform these molecules and make products for export. </p>
<p>U.S. crude production rose 77,000 barrels a day to 8.46
million last week, the Energy Information Administration said
today. Output reached 8.47 million barrels a day in the week
ended May 23, the most since October 1986, according to the EIA,
the Energy Department''s statistical arm. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) will boost
profitability as it pays brokers a smaller cut of revenue and
the firm''s commodities business earns better returns following
sales of two units, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said. </p>
<p>The company, which earned a return on equity of about 5
percent each of the past two years, has a plan to in 2015 and
beyond, sustainably drive ROE at 10 percent or higher, Gorman
said yesterday at his bank''s investor conference in New York. He
didn''t provide a return target for this year. Last year, he said
the firm could post a 10 percent ROE by 2014 if regulators
allowed it to return a reasonable amount of capital to
shareholders through dividends and buybacks. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s shares jumped 64 percent last year as the
company increased brokerage margins and equity-trading revenue.
Gorman yesterday laid out the potential drivers of further
growth in revenue and profitability, including additional
lending, lower cost ratios and greater payouts of capital. </p>
<p>The bank will seek to lower the compensation-to-revenue
ratio in its wealth-management unit to 55 percent or less from
58 percent in 2013, Gorman said. He also set targets of a 40
percent ratio for the New York-based firm''s investment bank and
asset-management divisions. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s commodities division eventually can more
than double its return on equity from less than 5 percent in
2012 following sales of two oil businesses, he said. ROE is a
measure of how well a firm reinvested profit to generate
additional earnings. </p>
<p>The bank announced this week an agreement to sell its stake
in oil-transportation company TransMontaigne Inc. to NGL Energy
Partners LP (NGL) for $200 million. Morgan Stanley agreed in December
to sell its oil-merchanting business to Moscow-based OAO
Rosneft. (ROSN) </p>
<p>Gorman said yesterday he expects the Rosneft deal to be
completed in the third quarter. Bloomberg News reported in April
that the two companies probably would wait to seek regulatory
approval until political tensions cooled after the U.S.
sanctioned Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, an ally of Russian President
Vladimir Putin, over the turmoil in Ukraine. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley is breaking from the
pack, becoming the first forecaster to predict Australia''s
dollar will regain parity with its U.S. counterpart. </p>
<p>Demand from Japanese investors for the world''s highest-yielding top-rated debt will help push the Aussie to $1 this
year for the first time since May 2013, Morgan Stanley
estimates, extending the 5.3 percent advance that has made it
2014''s second-best performer among Group of 10 currencies. The
median of 51 estimates in a Bloomberg strategist survey still
calls for a 5 percent drop to 89 U.S. cents by year-end. </p>
<p>The tide has turned for Aussie now that the Japanese have
come back to the market, Geoffrey Kendrick, Morgan Stanley''s
head of Asian currency and interest-rate strategy in Hong Kong,
said by phone on June 10. Their switch back into Aussie bonds
signals a turn in global long-term investor sentiment. More will
follow. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley regards Japanese investors, the biggest
holders of Australia''s long-term debt after U.S. and U.K. funds
last year, as a bellwether for the Aussie. Drawn by the Reserve
Bank of Australia''s decision to stop lowering interest rates,
Japan''s money managers have been net buyers every month this
year through April, purchasing a total of 356.4 billion yen
($3.5 billion) of the country''s sovereign debt. </p>
<h2>Opportunity Seen </h2>
<p>Compared with other developed nations, there''s still
yield to be had in Australia, Shinji Kunibe, the head of
foreign-bond management at Daiwa SB Investments Ltd. in Tokyo,
said by phone on June 10. Japanese tend to see any yen
strength as an opportunity to buy Australian assets. </p>
<p>At 3.82 percent for 10 years, Australia''s debt has the
highest yield of bonds holding top credit grades from the three
main rating companies. That''s 1.22 percentage points more than
the next-highest yield, Norway''s, and 2.43 more than German
bunds. (GACGB10) The extra returns on offer helped push foreign holdings
of Australian government debt to an all-time high of A$226
billion ($212 billion) in the first quarter. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s view on Australia''s currency carries
weight. A year ago, the U.S. investment bank had the most
bearish call in a Bloomberg survey of more than 50 strategists,
predicting a drop to 88 cents by the end of 2013, compared with
a median estimate of 97. The Aussie ended the year at 89.17. </p>
<h2>Too Strong </h2>
<p>Australia''s dollar started tumbling in April 2013 as a
slump in commodities prices hurt the economy. It has been
appreciating since reaching a 3 1/2-year low of 86.60 U.S. cents
on Jan. 24, and touched 94.14 today, its highest level in two
months. The Aussie traded at 94.23 as of 9:52 a.m. in New York,
after rising every day this week. </p>
<p>The rally saw the RBA complain last month that the currency
was high by historical standards, even as its shift to a neutral
interest-rate policy was one of the main reasons for the
Aussie''s gains. </p>
<p>With the economy improving, the central bank signaled in
February an end to two years of rate cuts that brought the
benchmark to a record 2.5 percent. A Credit Suisse Group AG
swaps index has started to indicate a small boost to borrowing
costs over the next 12 months, after signaling no increase as
recently as last week. </p>
<h2>China Threat </h2>
<p>A spike in Aussie approaching parity cannot be ruled
out, Todd Elmer, a Singapore-based strategist at Citigroup
Inc., the world''s largest currency trader, said by phone on June
10. There''s a greater risk we''ll see rate hikes sooner than
the market is pricing in, and that''s supported by stronger
economic data. </p>
<p>Citigroup sees the Aussie rising to 95 cents this year. </p>
<p>Australia''s economy grew 1.1 percent in the first quarter,
the fastest pace in two years, while the unemployment rate held
at a six-month low of 5.8 percent in May. </p>
<p>The prospect of a downturn in China, Australia''s biggest
export market, remains a threat to the Aussie, according to
Barclays Plc, which predicts a decline to 87 cents by year-end. </p>
<p>China''s economy grew 7.4 percent in the first quarter,
matching the slowest pace since 2009, while Australia''s largest
export, iron ore, fell below $100 per metric ton last month for
the first time since 2012. </p>
<p>Our view on the Australian dollar is bearish primarily
because of what we''re seeing in China, and the weakness we''re
seeing in commodity prices as a result of that, Hamish Pepper,
a Singapore-based strategist at Barclays, said by phone on June
10. Aussie at parity this year doesn''t look likely. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s Kendrick said he''s very comfortable
with his forecast for the Aussie to match the greenback''s value. </p>
<p>The probability of hitting parity this year is more than
50 percent, which is why I''m going for it, Kendrick said. If
the RBA hiked rates this year -- or even early next year -- then
my parity call would probably look too tame. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) won
dismissal of a suit over $450 million in residential mortgage-backed securities, with a New York judge saying that the firms
that bought the bonds should have done more research beforehand. </p>
<p>State Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos dismissed the
claims against Goldman Sachs today, saying the investors only
reviewed data presented in offering documents for the securities
and never asked to review files for the underlying loans. </p>
<p>The true nature of the risk being assumed could,
admittedly, have been ascertained from reviewing these loan
files and plaintiffs never asked for them, Ramos wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs was among financial firms including Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. sued over more than $1.8
billion in mortgage-backed securities in 2012 by Phoenix Light
SF Ltd., a company based in Dublin that inherited claims from
six legal entities that collapsed or nearly collapsed,
according to court filings. </p>
<p>The entities include WestLB, the 180-year-old German state-owned lender, based in Dusseldorf, that ceased operations in
2012 as part of European Union conditions tied to a 17 billion-euro ($23 billion) bailout after the 2008 financial crisis,
according to a complaint. </p>
<p>Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
worst recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the market for the securities evaporated. </p>
<h2>No Request </h2>
<p>The plaintiffs said Goldman Sachs didn''t share the files
for the loans underlying the securities. Ramos said there were
no allegations that that they asked for them and Goldman Sachs
denied access. </p>
<p>It does not matter if the failure to seek this
information was because of blind faith in the process of
origination and/or securitization, or if it was attributable to
the desire to quickly get on board of what the investors thought
was a profitable bandwagon, the judge wrote. The obligation
of a sophisticated investor to inquire cannot be merely
excused. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) is introducing a new
Internet-based service that helps companies use data analysis to
predict behavior, in a bid to gain more customers in the fast-growing field of machine learning. </p>
<p>The service lets users more easily build algorithms to
predict purchasing patterns, electricity usage and more. The
work and results can be hosted on the Web through Microsoft''s
Azure cloud offering. The new product, dubbed Azure Machine
Learning, has been in a trial period for about a year and now
has about 100 customers testing it, said General Manager Eron
Kelly. </p>
<p>Microsoft, under new Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella,
is trying to boost its focus on cloud software as more companies
gravitate to hosting data and other operations on the Web.
Nadella ran the cloud business before becoming CEO in February.
The Redmond, Washington-based software maker wants to bolster
usage of Azure as it tries to narrow the gap with market leader
Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)''s Web Services business. </p>
<p>Machine learning, which is an artificial intelligence field
that involves constructing systems that automatically analyze
and learn from data, has been on the rise. Even as companies
collect more information, the challenge has been how to extract
value from it. As a result, the market for analysis software is
growing about 18 percent a year and will reach $6.5 billion by
2019, according to Transparency Market Research. </p>
<h2>Data Scientists </h2>
<p>One of the challenges is as you create more data -- data
in and itself isn''t all that valuable, Kelly said. It''s the
insights you can create from it, and as the datasets get larger,
it becomes harder to analyze. </p>
<p>Microsoft said its new product can be used by full-fledged
data scientists to speed up their work, as well as by analysts
who aren''t trained in the mathematical underpinnings of the
field. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s own retail stores are using the software to
predict fraud, while another unnamed retailer is analyzing past
customer purchases to decide future inventory, said Kelly.
Carnegie Mellon University is tracking weather patterns and
electricity usage in its buildings and has told Microsoft the
system will enable them to save 30 percent on energy, he said. </p>

was code-named Project Passau, in July. It''s the product of work
from the company''s research unit and its data platform team,

Microsoft hired from Amazon in July 2013. </p>
<p>Soon machine learning will help to drastically reduce
wait times in emergency rooms, predict disease outbreaks and
predict and prevent crime, Sirosh wrote in a blog post. To

support of their demand to more than double basic monthly pay to
12,500 rand ($1,165). The producers'' latest offer includes wage
increases of as much as 1,000 rand. </p>
<p>AMCU members have raised conditions on issues including the
length of the agreement, back pay, increases in living-out
allowances and the reinstatement of jobs, union President Joseph Mathunjwa said at rallies last week. </p>
<h2>Slightly Improved'' </h2>
<p>We believe the deal is only slightly improved for workers
compared to the offer which was proposed within a month of the
strike, and was accepted by the union because of pressure from
members, Eugene King, a Goldman Sachs analyst, wrote in in the
note. Mines will be damaged as panels will have collapsed,
while organizing and retraining workers will take time. </p>

inventory can be converted to cash quickly and the mining
restart will see concentrate coming through in the next two
months, King wrote. Impala will be confronted by delays to new
shafts following the strike, he said. </p>

<p>The big trend among the young and
restless in New York this summer is to bash Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. interns on Yik Yak, an anonymous social-media app. The big
trend for analysts covering Goldman is to bash the stock. </p>
<p>The average rating on Goldman Sachs shares has fallen to
3.21, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that assigns a
score of 5 to ratings of buy or the equivalent, 3 to holds and 1
to sells. Apart from some similar scores earlier this year,
Goldman''s rating has never been lower in data starting in 2006. </p>
<p>Here''s a sample of the ribbing the summer associates are
taking on Yik Yak: GS interns clap when the plane lands.
Here''s a sample of what analysts are saying about Goldman Sachs:
Trading revenue from fixed income, commodities and currencies
will drop 16 percent this quarter, according to Sanford C.
Bernstein  Co.''s Brad Hintz, who on June 5 cut his second-quarter earnings estimates by 8 percent to $3.35 a share. </p>
<p>The slump in Goldman''s ratings, not to mention the 6
percent drop in its stock this year, is a casualty of the
pervasive calm that has overtaken financial markets and sent
measures of volatility in various asset classes to multi-year,
if not record, lows. Citigroup Inc. has warned of a drop of as
much as 25 percent in second-quarter trading revenue and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) estimated a 20 percent decline. </p>
<h2>Never Move'' </h2>
<p>As Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn said at an investor
conference last month: What drives activity in our business is
volatility. If markets never move or don''t move, our clients
really don''t need to transact. </p>
<p>Analysts on average predict Goldman''s earnings per share
before unusual items will slide 16 percent this quarter, 2
percent next quarter and 9 percent in the final three months of
the year before rebounding 8 percent in all of 2015. </p>
<p>Goldman''s 3.21 analyst rating ranks the stock 68th among 83
financial stocks in the SP 500 and 14 percent below the average
3.72. Banks less reliant on trading revenue are faring better.
JPMorgan Chase ranks 11th among financials with a 4.3 rating;
Citigroup''s is 4.1; Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo  Co. are
each at about 3.9. </p>
<p>For the entire SP 500, Goldman''s consensus rating ranks it
440th and 16 percent below the average of 3.84. </p>
<p>While Goldman''s shares outperformed the benchmark stock
index by more than 9 percentage points in 2013 and 28 percentage
points in 2012, its 139 percent return including dividends is
far behind the SP 500''s 220 percent return and an almost 300
percent jump for financial shares since the start of the bull
market in 2009. </p>
<p>You can''t blame the summer interns for that. Even if,
according to Yik Yak, they all wait for the light to change
before crossing the street. </p>

<p>Toontown Online, loosely based on the 1988 Walt Disney Co. (DIS) film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, was a multiplayer Internet game for kids and families that drew more than 1 million users after it was introduced in 2003. </p> <p>Disney shut it down last year amid a shift away from subscription-based games. Now, it''s getting a second life thanks to fans who have created a knockoff version without the company''s permission. </p> <p>In the original game, animal characters called Toons tried to prevent the takeover of their town by corporate robots called Cogs. After Disney closed Toontown Online in September to focus on other projects, about two dozen developers, many in high school or college, created Toontown Rewritten. The site is flourishing: traffic has grown so fast that users have to wait in line to play, according to the 16-year-old project leader. </p> <p>We''re all just a bunch of nostalgic players who think that the game deserves to live a little longer, said the teenager, Joey Ziolkowski, in a telephone interview from his parents'' home in Princess Anne, Maryland. </p> <p>Whether to allow Toontown Rewritten to continue is a tricky decision for Disney. If the company lets Ziolkowski and his collaborators keep going, it builds goodwill with fans. On the other hand, Disney may want to sell the content in the future, and the company could suffer reputational damage if something bad happens to players online, according to Scott Landsbaum, a copyright attorney in Los Angeles. </p>

<p>Jan Hatzius, chief economist at
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said Federal Reserve meeting
participants could increase their forecasts for interest rates
for 2015 and 2016 from their view in March. </p>
<p>There is an economic argument for the dots to move up
slightly, Hatzius said in a Bloomberg Television interview.
The inflation numbers have been a little firmer, and the labor
market numbers have generally been good. So you could see a
slight move upward. </p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee, which releases its
policy statement as well as forecasts at 2 p.m. today, has
scaled back its monthly asset purchases in $10 billion
increments at four consecutive meetings since December. </p>
<p>Chair Janet Yellen, who holds a press conference today, has
said the FOMC will look at a wide range of data in determining
when to raise its benchmark interest rate from zero. At a press
conference in March, she warned against paying too much
attention to the forecasts, which are depicted as dots on a
chart. </p>
<p>A change in the composition of the FOMC might argue for
more stability and the discussion around the long-term neutral
rate is probably also a reason to expect if at all only a very
small upward move in the 2015 and 2016 dots, Hatzius said. </p>
<p>Pacific Investment Management Co. has argued central banks
will keep interest rates at a new neutral rate because of
slower global growth, with more stable top speeds. Fed officials
have lowered their long-run estimate for U.S. growth to 2.2
percent to 2.3 percent in March from 2.5 percent to 2.8 percent
in January 2010. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management Ltd. and
PineBridge Investments said South Korean global corporate debt
is still attractive, even as Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
recommended shunning yield premiums near a seven-year low. </p>
<p>Borrowers have sold $20.5 billion of international bonds
this year, shy of the record $21 billion in the first half of
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Korea Gas Corp.,
Kookmin Bank and Korea National Oil Corp. are holding investor
meetings this week for possible dollar- or euro-denominated note
offerings, people familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>South Korea''s sovereign default risk fell to a lowest since
2008 this month and the won reached the strongest in almost six
years as investors show confidence in Asia''s fourth-largest
economy, which the central bank forecasts will grow at its
fastest pace in five years in 2015. A global hunt for yield has
driven profound outperformance of Korea credit, making other
Asian bonds seem better value, Goldman Sachs wrote in a report
this month. </p>
<p>We are active participants in Korean paper, Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income in Hong Kong at JPMorgan Asset
said on June 12. Korean credit spread levels are still
attractive versus U.S. investment grade, he said, adding that
decisions on whether to buy new issues depend on valuations. </p>
<h2>Goldman Warning </h2>
<p>South Korean investment-grade notes yield 2.13 percent on
average, according to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index.
That compares with 1.49 percent for corporate bonds from
developed markets, a Merrill Lynch and Pacific Investment
Management Co. measure shows. </p>
<p>The average premium for dollar bonds sold by Korean issuers
over U.S. Treasuries has contracted 37 basis points this year to
124 on June 17. It touched 121 on April 25, the least since July
2007, JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes show. </p>
<p>The outperformance of Korea has been profound, Goldman
Sachs analysts led by Kenneth Ho wrote in a June 12 report. We
retain our negative view, because we see better value elsewhere
in Asia investment grade, even though we believe that search for
yield motives will likely keep Korea spreads tight, Ho said. </p>
<p>Investors have been seeking extra yield after rates sunk
globally as the world''s major central banks held key lending
rates near zero and enacted unprecedented monetary easing. </p>
<h2>High Quality </h2>
<p>While credit spreads of Korean bonds may look tight, the
volatility of them is also very low, Arthur Lau, head of Asia
ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge in Kong Kong, which oversees
about $71 billion, said in June 13 interview. The high credit
quality nature of Korean bonds also appeals to many long-term
investors who are looking for stable and predictable returns. </p>
<p>The 90-day historical volatility of Korean sovereign dollar
debt maturing in April 2019 has fallen to 2.82 percent from as
high as 14.46 percent in 2009. </p>
<p>Global investors are seeking higher yields in longer-maturity bonds. The extra yield investors demand to hold 10-year
U.S. Treasuries over five-year securities contracted 38 basis
points to 91 this year, Bloomberg-compiled data show. </p>
<p>Now seems like a good time to sell long-dated dollar
bonds, Lee Sang Wook, a spokesperson for Korea Gas based in
Seongnam near Seoul, said by phone on June 17. We are
considering sales for refinancing maturing debt and possible
overseas use. </p>
<h2>Korea Oil, Kookmin </h2>
<p>Korea National Oil is mulling offshore issuance to
refinance debt, Choi Hong Seok, a spokesperson for the Anyang,
South Korea-based company, said by phone on yesterday. Kookmin
Bank declined to comment. </p>
<p>The won touched 1,015.25 per dollar, the strongest level
since August 2008, on June 10. Its 2.67 percent advance this
year is the second biggest among emerging-market currencies.
Ten-year won-denominated government bond yields have fallen 21
basis points since March 31 to 3.305 percent yesterday. </p>
<p>Credit-default swaps insuring South Korea''s sovereign debt
against non-payment for five years fell to 49.5 basis points on
June 6, the lowest close since January 2008, according to data
provider CMA. That compared with 68.5 basis points for China,
whose sovereign debt is rated Aa3 by Moody''s Investors Service,
the same as South Korea. </p>
<p>Foreign-currency corporate bond sales rose 52 percent this
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Demand has been driven by
onshore and offshore investors and a drop in net issuance,
Goldman Sachs said. Borrowers face more than $47 billion of
maturing offshore bonds this year, almost double the $26.7
billion in 2013, according to Bloomberg-compiled data. </p>
<p>Investors in the north-east Asian country increased
holdings of Korean paper to $20.5 billion as of end-March,
compared with $11.95 billion at the end of 2010, according to a
May statement from the Bank of Korea. </p>
<p>Supply of Korean bonds is expected to be limited this
year, PineBridge''s Lau said. There may be room for spreads
to tighten further. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley''s proposed sale of
its oil merchanting business to Russia''s OAO Rosneft won
antitrust approval in the U.S., regulators said. </p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission announced the approval on its
website in a notice dated yesterday. The transaction still needs
approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.,
an inter-agency panel that examines acquisitions of companies by
foreign investors for national security concerns. </p>
<p>The two companies probably will wait until political
tensions between Russia and the U.S. cool before seeking
approval from CFIUS, a person familiar with the matter said in
April. Reviews by CFIUS can last up to 75 days. The U.S.
government imposed sanctions in April on Rosneft''s chief
executive officer, Igor Sechin. </p>
<p>The lack of hard assets such as pipelines should smooth the
approval process if the political situation eases, said the
person, who asked not to be identified because the process isn''t
public. Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman said last week that he
expects the deal to be completed in the third quarter. </p>
<p>Mark Lake, a spokesman for New York-based Morgan Stanley,
declined to comment on whether the firm had submitted the deal
for CFIUS approval, as did a press official for Rosneft who
asked not be identified. Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. Treasury Department, also declined to comment. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which agreed in December to sell the unit
to Moscow-based Rosneft, is divesting physical oil businesses to
boost returns in its trading unit and avoid increased regulatory
scrutiny. The firm also agreed earlier this month to sell its
stake in TransMontaigne Inc., an oil-transportation company, to
NGL Energy Partners LP. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s asset-management unit bought a San Francisco property from Jamestown
LP in a $415 million deal that includes offices, a hotel and a

<p>The purchase of 22 Fourth St. near Union Square closed

feet (40,000 square meters) in two buildings known as Pacific

<p>It''s a very strong market, with tons of tenant activity
driving investment activity, Grant Lammersen, a sales broker
at Cushman  Wakefield Inc. with a waterfront office listing at
188 Embarcadero, said in a telephone interview. </p>
<h2>Salesforce Tower </h2>
<p>Salesforce.com Inc. in April agreed to lease 714,000 square
feet in a skyscraper being built by Boston Properties Inc. that
will be the city''s tallest and named for San Francisco-based
Salesforce, the biggest maker of customer-management software. A
unit of Shenzhen, China-based developer Genzon Property Group
Co. last month bought a majority stake in 225 Bush St. offices
in the financial district, in a deal valued at $350 million. </p>
<p>Pacific Place, two blocks from Union Square''s cluster of
upscale shops and theaters, has 202,000 square feet of offices
fully leased to Mountain View, California-based Intuit''s
Demandforce unit and 200 feet (61 meters) of retail frontage on
Market Street, Jamestown said. The area is the main transit
corridor for city buses and Bay Area Rapid Transit, or BART, the
regional subway and rail system. </p>
<p>The addition of a signature tenant like Intuit and its
long-term lease created an attractive investment for a buyer,
Jamestown Chief Operating Officer Michael Phillips said in the

properties. </p>

<p>After helping Mexico sell 100-year
bonds overseas for the first time in 2010, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. is seeking to do the same for Colombia. </p>
<p>The Andean nation may issue the notes later this year after
the New York-based bank offered to arrange the sale, Finance
Minister Mauricio Cardenas said June 11. Goldman Sachs helped
underwrite Mexico''s offering of dollar bonds due 2110 as well as
its pound-denominated century bonds in March. </p>
<p>Colombia is seeking to exploit soaring demand for its
longer-maturity debt as its economy grows twice as fast as the
regional average and the Federal Reserve reiterates that
interest rates will stay low for a considerable time after
it stops buying bonds. Yields on Colombia''s $2 billion of bonds
due in 2044, its longest-term notes, have plunged 0.67
percentage point to 4.98 percent since they were issued Jan. 21.
That''s more than the average 0.48 percentage point decline in
long-dated bonds with the same rating. </p>
<p>Colombia shines in the midst of underperforming economies
in emerging markets, and investors are noticing, Mario Castro,
a strategist at Nomura Holdings Inc, said by phone from New
York. There''s no doubt there''s appetite for Colombia risk, and
Colombia would be getting long-term financing at still very low
yields. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs didn''t answer calls and messages seeking
comment. </p>
<h2>General Receptiveness'' </h2>
<p>Colombia would use funds from a sale to cover its 2015
financing needs, Cardenas told investors at the June 11
presentation. Goldman Sachs proposed a reference yield of around
5.7 percent for a Colombian 100-year debt offering, he said. </p>
<p>Yields on Mexico''s $2.68 billion of bonds due 2110 have
fallen 0.67 percentage point this year to 5.55 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Mexico, whose BBB+ rating from Standard  Poor''s is one
level higher than Colombia''s, is the only nation to have issued
100-year notes in both dollars and pounds. China and the central
bank of the Philippines sold $100 million of century bonds in
1996 and 1997, respectively. </p>
<p>There has been a general receptiveness to longer
maturities recently, Michael Roche, an emerging-market
strategist at Seaport Group LLC, said by telephone from New
York. Institutional investors, particularly pension funds and
insurance companies, generally have a need for longer
duration. </p>
<h2>Growth Outlook </h2>
<p>Colombia''s economy will grow 4.5 percent this year,
compared with an average expansion of 2.7 percent in Latin
America, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.
The economy expanded 6.4 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier, the national statistics agency said today, higher
than the 5.2 percent median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<p>The peso advanced 0.4 percent to 1,882.50 per dollar at the
close today in Bogota. </p>
<p>The country''s sale of 30-year bonds in January attracted
$4.2 billion in bids, according to the government. </p>
<p>The government plans $3 billion in overseas debt offerings
next year. </p>
<p>Appetite for Colombia''s last bond sale was huge, and that
shows there definitely is willingness to invest in the
country, said Nomura''s Castro. Selling a century bond would be
another step in positioning Colombia in the international
capital market. It''s an exclusive club. </p>

<p>Russian stocks have been so volatile
amid the turmoil in Ukraine that it took a bull market to
convince JPMorgan Chase  Co. that it''s time to buy. </p>
<p>The bank''s upgrade from sell yesterday follows a 21 percent
advance in the benchmark Micex Index (INDEXCF) from its bear-market low in
March. Stocks are rallying as President Vladimir Putin signals
that he''s willing to work with Ukraine''s new leader, reducing
concern that Russia will face more sanctions. Bank of America
Corp., which has had a buy rating on Russian stocks since
September, reiterated its bullish view on June 17. Deutsche Bank

began the annexation of Crimea. The Micex entered a bull market
on June 6. The gauge''s 30-day historical volatility, a measure
of price swings, reached a five-year high of 46.2 percent on
April 11. </p>
<h2>Ukraine Conflict </h2>
<p>Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko yesterday reiterated a
plan to end fighting in the country''s southeast region after
talks with Putin. The Micex gained for the second day, rising
0.7 percent to 1,504.23 by 8:20 a.m. in New York. The Bloomberg
Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded Russian companies in
the U.S. jumped 1.9 percent yesterday. </p>
<p>Russia still provides better value than other emerging
markets, David Hauner, a strategist at Bank of America, said
in a telephone interview from London yesterday. The risk
reward is not as high as it was a couple of months ago, but our
view on global equities is positive and Russia will outperform
the market. </p>
<p>Smith, the Deutsche Bank strategist who predicted Russia''s
1998 stock-market crash and had been bearish on the country for
more than three years, said in May that investors were
overreacting to the conflict in Ukraine. </p>
<p>Russia''s second-biggest oil producer OAO Lukoil (LUKOY), eastern
Europe''s biggest lender OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) and Russia''s second-biggest
mobile phone company OAO Megafon (MFON) are among JPMorgan''s top
emerging-market stock picks, according to the note. </p>
<p>Aserkoff in London and Kantarovich in Moscow weren''t
available for comment on the timing of their overweight
recommendation when contacted by phone and e-mail outside
regular business hours yesterday. </p>
<h2>Pretty Negative'' </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley raised Russian stocks to overweight on May 8
before Ukraine elected Poroshenko. Citigroup Inc. has an
overweight recommendation on Russia in its global emerging
markets portfolio, according to a report this month. </p>
<p>Capital Economics Ltd., in an e-mailed research note
yesterday, said it is relatively downbeat on the outlook for
Russian equities and expects stocks and the ruble to fall. </p>
<p>Our view on the Russian market is pretty negative, Liza Ermolenko, a London-based emerging-market economist at Capital
Economics, said by phone yesterday. While the economy is
slowing, no one really knows what is next in the Ukraine crisis
and whether further sanctions against Russia will be approved.
The Russian market is very sensitive to the Ukraine crises, and
there is no quick solution. </p>
<h2>International Sanctions </h2>
<p>Ukraine will call a unilateral cease-fire to help end three
months of fighting with pro-Russian separatists, Poroshenko said
in Kiev yesterday. Insurgents will be given a limited window to
lay down their arms, with those who haven''t committed any
serious crimes to be offered an amnesty and safe passage out of
the country, he said. </p>
<p>The U.S. and European Union have imposed sanctions
including travel bans and asset freezes on Putin allies in
Russia and Ukraine to punish the country for its standoff with
Ukraine. Russia''s gross domestic product grew 0.9 percent in the
first quarter from the same period in 2013, the slowest pace in
a year, the Federal State Statistics Service said on May 15. </p>
<p>While the $2 trillion economy was stalling before the
sanctions, the U.S. and EU have warned the nation faces further
penalties if fails to de-escalate the conflict. Ukraine and
Russia are also in conflict over gas, with Russia cutting off
supplies on June 16 because of unpaid bills. The International
Monetary Fund said April 30 that Russia is already in recession. </p>
<p>The Micex trades at 5.4 times estimated 12-month earnings,
compared with a ratio of 15.5 for India''s SP BSE Sensex Index,
10.7 for Brazil''s Ibovespa and 7.6 for the Shanghai Composite. </p>
<p>The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
the index futures, was little changed today, while RTS stock-index futures increased 1.6 percent to 132,920 yesterday. The
Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S.-traded exchange-traded fund that holds Russian shares, rose 2.6 percent to
$26.88. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and Chevron Corp. (CVX)
were among oil companies accused by Pennsylvania of polluting
groundwater with a gasoline additive in lawsuits similar to ones
brought by New York City, New Hampshire and Vermont. </p>
<p>BP Plc (BP/) and Citgo, the Houston-based unit of Venezuela''s
state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela SA, also were named in two
complaints made public today in state court that seek damages
for costs to clean up groundwater tainted by Methyl Tertiary
Butyl Ether, or MTBE. Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane and Governor Tom Corbett''s office of general counsel filed
the complaints. </p>
<p>MTBE-related spills over the past 20 years have cost
Pennsylvania hundreds of millions of dollars, James Schultz,
the governor''s general counsel, said yesterday in a statement.
We cannot take the health of Pennsylvania''s waters for granted
and their protection must remain our utmost priority. </p>
<p>The Pennsylvania lawsuits follow scores of claims filed by
cities, states and individuals around the U.S. against oil
refiners, retailers and distributors over MTBE. Exxon Mobil,
Chevron and BP were among two dozen U.S. refiners sued this
month by Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell. </p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court in April upheld a jury''s $104.7
million damage award against Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil for
contaminating New York City wells with the additive. </p>
<h2>Clean Air </h2>
<p>The city sued oil companies in 2003, alleging they knew the
additive would pollute groundwater. Exxon Mobil argued that
state laws were pre-empted by the federal Clean Air Act, which
required oil companies to reformulate gasoline to reduce air
pollution from vehicle emissions. Oil companies added MTBE to
make the fuel burn more efficiently. </p>
<p>Reasonable alternatives to MTBE were available at the time
oil companies jointly promoted gasoline with the additive,
Pennsylvania claims in its lawsuit. </p>
<p>Braden Reddall, a spokesman for San Ramon, California-based
Chevron, said the company hadn''t yet seen the suit and couldn''t
comment. </p>
<p>BP acted at all times in good faith, said Scott Dean, a
spokesman in Houston for the London-based company. BP plans to
defend itself against the allegations. </p>
<p>Todd Spitler, an Exxon Mobil spokesman, said the company is
reviewing the claims, although such litigation is flawed in
that energy companies are being held liable not for spilling
gasoline, but for simply including oxygenates in gasoline as
required.'''' </p>
<h2>Second-Guessing </h2>
<p>If a company spills gasoline in Pennsylvania, it is
required to clean it up, as should be the case,'''' Spitler said.
These cases are about second-guessing decisions made by state
and federal regulators to rely on MTBE-blended gasoline to
reduce air pollution. We take very seriously our responsibility
to operate in an environmentally sound manner.'''' </p>
<p>Fernando Garay, a Citgo spokesman, didn''t immediately
return an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Pennsylvania wants the companies held liable for
manufacturing a defective product, creating public nuisances and
negligence. The complaint also seeks punitive damages for
wanton, malicious, oppressive and fraudulent conduct,''''
according to the filing. </p>
<p>The case is Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Exxon Mobil
Corp., 140602881, Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County
(Philadelphia). </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) is planning a
sale of U.S. home-loan bonds without government backing, adding
to evidence that the market for the securities is beginning to
pick up steam. </p>
<p>The deal will be tied to $303.7 million of prime 15-year
mortgages, according to a person with knowledge of the
transaction who asked not to be identified without authorization
to speak publicly. While most of the loans had original balances
larger than the current threshold for jumbo mortgages, the
market''s focus since its revival, 14.5 percent of the debt is
smaller than $400,000, the person said. </p>
<p>Premium Point Investments LP''s WinWater Home Mortgage LLC
yesterday completed its first non-agency bond transaction, a
deal tied to about $250 million of jumbo loans, and Citigroup
Inc. (C) is planning a similar $219 million offering. After reviving
from the paralysis caused by the 2008 financial crisis the debt
helped spark, issuance of non-agency securities had slowed after
the middle of last year as banks seek jumbo loans to hold as
investments and bond buyers pay less for the debt. </p>
<p>We''re seeing repeat and new issuers attempt to bring the
market back,Michele Patterson, a senior director at Kroll
Bond Rating Agency, said in a telephone interview. We are not
at last year''s levels, and we don''t anticipate getting to last
year''s levels. I think the second half will probably be about
the same as the first half of the year in terms of sales. </p>
<h2>September Collapse </h2>
<p>Justin Perras, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment. </p>
<p>While total issuance of non-agency securities tied to new
loans jumped to $13.4 billion last year from $3.5 billion in
2012, sales collapsed after September, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance totals about $1.8 billion this
year. Sales peaked at $1.2 trillion in both 2005 and 2006. </p>
<p>Jumbo mortgages are those larger than allowed in
government-supported programs. Limits now range from $417,000 to
$625,500 for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans with the lowest
costs for borrowers using 20 percent down payments. </p>
<p>The average age of the loans in the JPMorgan transaction is
about one year, with 5.2 percent of the mortgages older than 30
months, the person said. First Republic Bank originated 55
percent of the mortgages, while JPMorgan''s bank made 38 percent,
the person said. </p>
<h2>Loss Protection </h2>
<p>The amount of loss protection for investors known as credit
enhancement, totaling 5.5 percent for part of the AAA portion of
the transaction, is the lowest yet seen by Kroll, which was
founded after the crisis and has been hired to grade the deal,
Patterson said. The inclusion of only mortgages with terms of 15
years or less, a first since the credit seizure, improves the
quality of the transaction because the loans typically perform
better than 30-year debt, she said. </p>
<p>Some other AAA portions of the deal have 10 percent
enhancement, the person said. Most of WinWater''s top-rated bonds
carried 15 percent of credit enhancement, with a smaller amount
offering a buffer of 8.25 percent. The safety margin is provided
by features such as some bonds losing principal amid losses on
the underlying loans before others. </p>

<p>Spain set new rates for electricity
suppliers that use renewable sources, waste and co-generation
based on a reasonable return, formally ending a subsidy
system dating to the 1990s that had spun out of control. </p>
<p>The Industry Ministry today published the new formulas and
tables to be used for generators ranging from wind turbines to
solar collectors and waste incinerators in a 1,761-page
regulation that takes effect tomorrow. The new return is based
on a host of factors, including the cost of investment and the
10-year Spanish government bond yield in the secondary market. </p>
<p>Spain became a world leader in clean-energy, spurring
projects by awarding more than 50 billion euros ($68 billion) in
subsidies in the last 25 years. At the same time it failed to
secure all the money needed to fund the incentives, which
accelerated and in 2013 totaled about 9 billion euros. </p>
<p>The system, modeled on Germany''s in the 1990s and paid for
mostly by consumers, was increasingly attacked as an
unacceptable burden by traditional utilities, some consumer
groups and the government. A series of new laws dismantled much
of it, aiming to achieve an economic and financial stability
of the electric system and avoid the incorporation of new
costs, the government said in today''s regulation. </p>
<p>While incentives were guaranteed to plant owners for 20
years or longer, the system failed to ensure the government
would set prices, or tariffs, paid by consumers at high enough
levels to fund the subsidies. That created a soaring tariff
deficit -- a debt carried temporarily by traditional power
distributors and securitized in chunks to private investors. </p>
<p>One legacy is that Spain, like almost no other country, can
supply more than half of electricity demand from clean sources
during stretches of the day that are sunny and windy. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is set to
get bonds with more than double the interest rate local Japanese
banks will receive on loans when Aiful Corp. (8515) refinances. </p>
<p>The consumer lender, which postponed repayments to avoid
bankruptcy in 2009, said June 13 it will exchange part of 161.7
billion yen ($1.6 billion) of debt for notes bearing an 8
percent coupon. While that''s in line with U.S. notes with
similar credit scores, it''s among the highest for Japanese bonds
in the past 15 years, data compiled by Bloomberg and Bank of
America Merrill Lynch show. Domestic banks will extend new loans
at about 3 percent, a person familiar with the matter said. </p>
<p>Local banks are accepting lower interest because they have
collateral on loans to Aiful, while the debentures won''t be
secured. The consumer lender is seeking to refinance for a
second time in five years as Bank of Japan stimulus lowers
funding costs and the burden of refunding customers for excess
interest-rate charges declines. </p>
<p>A coupon of 8 percent looks very attractive, said
Taketoshi Tsuchiya, a senior executive at Mizuho Securities Co.
who heads a team dealing with distressed fixed income. We''ve
had a number of requests from overseas hedge funds saying they''d
like to buy the bonds if they come on the market. </p>
<h2>Informal Agreement </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs and Aiful have reached an informal agreement
that the U.S. bank will apply to swap loans for notes, according
to two people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be
identified because the details are private. Aiful triggered
Japan''s first auction to determine the payout of credit-default
swaps when it obtained lender approval to postpone repayment on
280 billion yen in 2009. </p>
<p>Japanese banks may be avoiding the risk of default by
extending loans with collateral, according to Junichi Shimizu, a
Tokyo-based credit analyst at Deutsche Bank AG. </p>
<p>While the principal on loans gradually decreases as
payments are made, corporate bonds are repaid at one go, so
there''s the risk of a default depending on the business
environment, Shimizu said. </p>
<p>Only one yen bond offered by bankrupt Takefuji Corp. had a
higher coupon in the past 15 years than the Aiful notes to be
issued to Goldman, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Takefuji''s securities issued overseas in 2009 paid 10 percent. </p>
<h2>Debt Repayment </h2>
<p>Aiful will obtain a loan from Japanese banks of a little
under 80 billion yen with which it will repay part of its
outstanding debts, according to a person familiar with the
matter. Foreign creditors including Goldman Sachs will exchange
more than 30 billion yen in liabilities for the new bonds due at
the end of April 2020, according to the person. </p>
<p>Aiful will also postpone repayment of 52.7 billion yen of
existing loans, it said in a statement on June 13. </p>
<p>In difficult negotiations, we were compelled to accept
tough terms on the bonds, said Kenichi Hashimoto, an Aiful
spokesman. Realistically, there''s not such a big difference
between the rate and that being charged in secondary markets. </p>
<p>The extra yield on Aiful''s 1.99 percent bonds due in
October 2015 was 7.4 percentage points over sovereign notes,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Tokyo-based lender
is graded CCC+ by Japan''s Rating  Investment Information Inc.,
or the equivalent of seven steps below investment level. </p>
<p>U.S. corporate bonds with CCC or lower ratings had an
average yield of 8.8 percent, while it was 9.2 percent for
global notes with such scores, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch data. </p>
<h2>BOJ Stimulus </h2>
<p>Borrowing costs have fallen in Japan as the BOJ buys about
7 trillion yen of sovereign bonds a month to spur inflation. The
benchmark 10-year debt yield has dropped 15 1/2 basis points, or
0.155 percentage point, to 0.58 percent this year. The yen has
gained 3.3 percent in 2014 to 101.93 per dollar as of 5:06 p.m.
in Tokyo, after tumbling 18 percent last year. </p>
<p>An investment unit of Goldman Sachs held 14.5 billion yen
of Aiful''s debt, while a unit of Barclays Plc (BARC) had 9.4 billion
yen at the end of March, according to material provided by Aiful
to shareholders. The company''s single largest creditor was the
banking unit of Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc., the
documentation showed. </p>
<p>Hiroko Matsumoto, a spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs in Tokyo,
declined to comment on the plan, as did Kyota Narimatsu, a
spokesman at Barclays in Japan, and Hiroshi Kashimoto at
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust. </p>
<h2>Credit Event </h2>
<p>Aiful''s December 2009 agreement with creditors to delay
debt repayment resulted in a dispute over whether the action had
caused a so-called restructuring credit event. Buyers of Aiful
credit-default swaps, which insure bondholders against
nonpayment, had to wait three months for the International Swaps
 Derivatives Association to rule that the plan had triggered
payouts. </p>
<p>Sellers of credit-default protection agreed in 2010 to pay
holders 66.125 yen for each 100 yen of insured debt, in Japan''s
first credit default auction, according to bid administrators at
the time. </p>
<p>Aiful racked up 636.1 billion yen in net losses in the
eight years ended March 31 as a crackdown on coercive lending
practices and court rulings forced Japan''s consumer lenders to
repay billions of dollars in overcharged interest. </p>
<p>That regulatory action led to the bankruptcy of Takefuji
with 433.6 billion yen of liabilities. </p>
<p>Aiful recorded a profit of 30.5 billion yen in the 12
months ended March 31, its biggest in eight years and the third
in succession. Interest repayments fell for a fourth year last
fiscal year, dropping 57 percent to 33.1 billion yen from three
years earlier. </p>
<p>As the business environment is improving, banks can
increase their recovery rate by continuing to support Aiful and
its turnaround, said Shintaro Niimura, a credit analyst at
Nomura Securities Co., Japan''s largest brokerage. For
investors rationally seeking a profit, they''re emphasizing
better repayment terms. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Asset Management and
Invesco Asset Management say China''s cooling property market is
an opportunity to boost dollar bond holdings as the government''s
targeted stimulus benefits the largest developers. </p>
<p>Chinese real-estate companies accounted for six of the 10
best-performing Asian notes in the past three months, according
to a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index. The yield on 2018 debt
of China Overseas Land  Investments Ltd., the nation''s largest
developer by market value, dropped to 3.35 percent last week,
from a record 4.31 percent on Feb. 5, while that on similar-maturity bonds of China Vanke Co. fell to 3.95 percent, from an
all-time high of 5.07 percent on March 20. </p>
<p>We will pick the winners from these trends, said
Stephen Chang, head of Asian fixed income at JPMorgan Asset,
which oversees $39 billion in emerging-market debt. Although
sales and prices are falling along with margins, we have
identified the larger developers are gaining market share and
executing well. </p>
<p>Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to safeguard this year''s
growth target of 7.5 percent, fueling bets the government will
encourage increased lending to selected projects and relax
restrictions in the real-estate market. Larger developers may
benefit from industry consolidation as smaller builders face a
funding squeeze with a record amount of property trusts maturing
next year and prices falling in the most cities in two years. </p>
<h2>Softening Prices </h2>
<p>Home prices declined in 35 of China''s 70 cities last month
from April, the most since May 2012, official data showed June
18. In the financial center of Shanghai, prices decreased 0.3
percent, the first drop in two years, while they fell 0.2
percent in the southern business hub of Shenzhen. </p>
<p>Softening prices are good because they imply there isn''t
a bubble anymore, said Ken Hu, Hong Kong-based chief
investment officer of fixed income for Asia Pacific at Invesco,
which manages $787 billion globally. We pick developers with
high turnover and those who tend to build smaller-sized flats.
Profit margin isn''t that key to bondholders like us. Our
approach is to buy on dips. </p>
<p>Developers including Vanke that cut prices by 10 percent to
15 percent achieved good sales volume, Deutsche Bank AG analysts
led by Hong Kong-based Tony Tsang wrote in a June 13 report.
Vanke, headquartered in Shenzhen, recorded a 16.2 percent
increase in sales value in the first five months of 2014 from a
year earlier, it said in a June 3 statement to the Shenzhen
stock exchange. </p>
<h2>Taking Advantage </h2>
<p>Larger industry players are able to tap overseas capital
markets for funds. Sales of dollar bonds by Chinese companies
totaled $91 billion in 2014, compared with $89 billion in the
previous year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Smaller builders, which rely on property trusts for
financing, have to repay 203.5 billion yuan ($32.7 billion) in
2015, according to research firm Use Trust. That''s almost double
the 109 billion yuan due this year. China''s banking regulator
said on June 6 it will monitor developer finances, a sign of
concern defaults may spread after the March collapse of Zhejiang
Xingrun Real Estate Co., a builder south of Shanghai. </p>
<p>It won''t be surprising to have a few defaults in the
sector in an economic slowdown, given you have thousands of
developers and many of them are small ones, BOCI''s Wang said.
The bigger ones, especially those listed, can take advantage
to lower their funding costs as the industry consolidates. </p>
<p>China South City Holdings Ltd. (1668), which runs logistics parks
for industrial materials, sold 1 billion yuan of five-year bonds
at a coupon of 7.5 percent in the interbank market on May 9. It
plans to use the proceeds to repay short-term bank loans.
Greenland Holding Group has hired banks to arrange investor
meetings from today for a potential dollar bond offering,
according to a person familiar with the matter. </p>
<h2>Borrowing Costs </h2>
<p>Vanke''s bond borrowing costs dropped to 3.45 percent on a
weighted average last week, compared with 5.5 percent in the
first quarter of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It also managed to extend the average maturity of its notes to
3.95 years, from 2.43 years in 2011. </p>
<p>Slowing growth is causing declines in the yuan and onshore
interest rates. The Chinese currency has fallen 2.8 percent
against the dollar this year, the worst performance in Asia. The
yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond has dropped 52
basis points to 4.04 percent in the same period as investors
sought safe havens. Gross domestic product will probably expand
7.3 percent this year, the slowest pace since 1990, according to
a Bloomberg survey. </p>
<h2>Prolonged Downturn </h2>
<p>The downturn in the property market will be more prolonged
this time than in previous corrections, Tom Byrne, senior vice
president at Moody''s, said at a June 19 conference in Shanghai.
Broad price cuts are likely to come in late August or in
September when more new projects are set to be introduced, UBS
AG Hong Kong-based analyst Eva Lee wrote in a report last week. </p>
<p>Moody''s revised its credit outlook for Chinese developers
to negative from stable on May 21. The Shanghai Stock Exchange
Property Index, which tracks 24 real-estate companies listed in
the city, has slumped 6.3 percent this year, exceeding the 4.2
percent decline for the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index. </p>
<p>Overall, the housing market is cooling in some parts,
like in third- or fourth-tier cities, said Chang at JPMorgan
Asset. But we do see a silver lining. There''s actually a
healthy pickup in transactions at specific locations after some
discounting. </p>
<h2>''Minor Stimulus'' </h2>
<p>The nation has introduced measures to help the real-estate
industry, which JPMorgan Chase  Co. says poses the biggest
near-term risk to growth in the world''s second-largest economy.
The People''s Bank of China told 15 banks in May to improve
efficiency of service, give timely approval and distribution of
mortgages to qualified buyers. The southeastern city of Fuzhou
has removed home-purchase limits for buyers who make one-time
payments, the Securities Times reported on June 18, citing sales
people from two developers. </p>
<p>The government may announce additional minor stimulus
measures after Premier Li said in London last week that the
nation will maintain a minimum growth rate of 7.5 percent,
according to a China Securities Journal commentary on June 20.
The PBOC may release more targeted steps to prevent expansion
from falling short of the goal, it added. </p>
<p>Policy makers are actually putting out more measures to
support this sector, said Arthur Lau, Hong Kong-based head of
Asia ex-Japan fixed income at PineBridge Investments, which
oversees about $71 billion. I think, volume-wise, it could
catch up a little bit in the second half, especially those who
are not aggressively buying land. There is still a wide
selection, even within this sector. </p>

Safe union that would affect three Exxon platforms is legal,
clearing the way for a walkout, according to the group''s leader,
Hilde-Marit Rysst. While the union is yet to decide on a public
mediator''s proposal that seeks to bridge differences with
employers, it will do so by the June 27 midday deadline, she
said by phone today. </p>
<p>Everything is set for a strike, Rysst said. The
mediator''s proposal, endorsed by the Norwegian Oil and Gas
Association, which represents employers in wage negotiations,
is not good enough, she said. </p>
<p>A strike would set Safe apart from two other unions that
reached wage agreements in talks that covered 7,615 offshore
oil-platform workers. In 2012, workers from all three unions
walked out in their longest action, disrupting oil and gas
production until the government intervened to stop companies
imposing a full lockout that would have halted output from
western Europe''s largest producer. </p>
<p>The conflict centers on pension terms for 31 Safe-affiliated workers at Exxon, the world''s largest oil company by
market value. While the Norwegian Oil and Gas Association argued
that the issue isn''t relevant for industry-wide wage talks, the
Oslo court ruled Safe''s strike notice is legal. </p>
<h2>Union Threat </h2>
<p>The Norwegian Oil and Gas Association could meet with Safe
again this week after last week''s state-backed mediation, though
there are no talks planned yet, the oil-industry lobby group''s
spokeswoman Eli Ane Nedreskaar said by phone. Exxon declined to
comment on talks with the union as it''s represented by the
Norwegian Oil and Gas Association, spokesman Knut Riple said. </p>
<p>Safe has threatened to take out 154 of its members from
Exxon''s Balder, Ringhorne and Jotun platforms, shutting down
production that reached 61,000 barrels of oil in April,
according to figures from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate. A
strike would also halt production at Det Norske Oljeselskap
ASA''s Jette field, which goes through Jotun and amounted to
2,000 barrels of crude a day in April. </p>

<p>Commodities are poised to decline
5.5 percent over the next 12 months after climbing amid tensions
in Iraq, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said. </p>
<p>Energy prices will be 5 percent lower a year from now,
precious metals will drop 15 percent and agricultural products
will retreat 10 percent, the bank said in an asset-allocation
report dated yesterday. Commodities will decline 4 percent in
the next three months, according to the report. </p>
<p>Despite the negative return we forecast after the recent
rally driven by events in Iraq, we stay neutral commodities due
to the hedging benefits they offer against these risks,
Goldman analyst Jeffrey Currie in New York said in the report. </p>
<p>Brent crude reached a nine-month high in London on June 19
after Iraqi insurgents captured the northern city of Mosul and
advanced to towns just north of Baghdad, sparking concern oil
output might be interrupted in OPEC''s second-largest producer.
Gold futures touched the highest price since April 15 today in
New York trading. </p>
<p>Today Brent fell as much as 0.5 percent after Iraqi forces
regained control of the Baiji refinery in the north from
Islamist militants, and fighting has yet to spread to the south,
home to more than three-quarters of the country''s crude output.
Saudi Arabia was the only producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries that pumped more oil than Iraq
last month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Larger Stockpiles </h2>
<p>Still, risks in energy are skewed to the upside in an
environment of heightened geopolitical risks and very limited
OPEC spare capacity, the Goldman analyst wrote. Precious
metals will drop amid rising real interest rates, while
agriculture prices are set to decline as inventories increase,
according to the bank. </p>
<p>Commodity prices as measured by the Standard  Poor''s GSCI
Enhanced Commodity Index rose 3.4 percent so far this month and
are up 7.1 percent in 2014. </p>
<p>Goldman forecast May 14 the enhanced index might have zero
total return in three months and decline 2.2 percent over 12
months. The bank projected a 4 percent drop over 12 months in an
April 13 note. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) sold bonds tied
to about $304 million of U.S. home loans without government
backing, adding to signs of life in the market. </p>
<p>The transaction included $171 million of top-rated
securities paying a 3 percent coupon, which were sold at 102.2

authorization to speak publicly. That''s about 1.5 cents on the
dollar less than comparable benchmark Fannie Mae-guaranteed

<p>The notes are unlike other recent deals because they''re
backed almost entirely by 15-year mortgages, which are often
taken by more financially secure borrowers relative to more
common 30-year loans, according to a presale report by Standard
 Poor''s. The average size of the mortgages, at about $558,000,
was also smaller than the $850,000 in previous JPMorgan deals
since the 2008 financial crisis, SP said. They were mainly
jumbo loans, it said. </p>
<p>The transaction''s contracts included an untested and
rigid process for forcing JPMorgan or other originators of the
underlying loans to buy back misrepresented debt, SP said.
Seeing that the framework is more restrictive than those in
other recent prime transactions, we imposed additional loss

<p>General Mills Inc. (GIS) reported fiscal
fourth-quarter earnings that trailed analysts'' estimates and
said it began a review of its North American manufacturing and
distribution network as part of a wider effort to reduce costs. </p>
<p>The maker of Cheerios cereal said the cost-cutting plan is
expected to generate pretax savings of $40 million in fiscal
2015, and will have additional savings in 2016, according to a
statement today. </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Ken Powell said sales and operating
profit were disappointing in the last fiscal year as
promotional spending in developed markets was less effective
than planned. Revenue in the quarter ended May 25 dropped 2.9
percent to $4.28 billion. </p>
<p>General Mills fell 3.6 percent to $51.76 at the close in
New York, the biggest decline since Feb. 17, 2012. The stock has
gained 3.7 percent this year. </p>
<p>The cost savings at General Mills will likely go into
product development and market support, Erin Lash, an analyst at
Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, said today in a phone interview.
The question is whether General Mills will lower prices to drive
sales volume or if it will bring in higher cost products popular
with consumers, she said. </p>
<p>By taking costs out of the business -- we''re not
expecting that to drive material margin improvement, said
Lash, who has a hold rating on the shares. We''re expecting
them to reinvest that back into the brand. </p>
<h2>Earnings Miss </h2>
<p>Adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were 67 cents,
the Minneapolis-based company said. Analysts projected 72 cents,
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The results came in slightly less than expectations, but
from our view the shares are more or less valued at the current
price, Lash said. </p>
<p>Earlier this year Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/B)
said he''s looking for elephants or large acquisitions.
General Mills may fit the bill. After Berkshire''s purchase of
H.J. Heinz Co. last year, a shareholder said General Mills could
be a possibility because both brands are recognizable and sell
their products in similar stores. </p>
<p>General Mills makes a lot of sense, Jeff Matthews, the
author of Warren Buffett''s Successor: Who It Is and Why It
Matters, said in a phone interview in February. It''s another
kind of sleepy, Heinz-type business that has a lot of potential.

<p>Richard Gonzalez, AbbVie''s chief executive officer,
yesterday made clear that a hostile bid is an option for his
company, a move Pfizer ruled out. AbbVie''s effort also differs
in that it''s appealing directly to Shire shareholders early,
offering what it calls a significant premium to win their
support to pressure its board or prepare the ground for a
hostile offer, according to people familiar with the matter. </p>
<p>This year''s boom in health-care takeovers is giving
companies and their banks, lawyers, and public-relations firms
plenty of real-life experience to draw upon. AbbVie is being
advised on its $46.5 billion bid by JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) as well
as PR firm Brunswick Group, both of which also worked with
Pfizer on AstraZeneca. </p>
<p>They don''t want to back themselves into a corner, Navid Malik, an analyst at Cenkos Securities Plc in London, said of
AbbVie. </p>
<p>Gonzalez''s team is trying to keep debate focused on the
strategic logic of a deal, rather than on using Shire''s Irish
legal domicile to escape U.S. taxes -- a topic that came to
dominate the Pfizer-AstraZeneca transaction, said one of the
people, who asked not to be identified because talks are
private. </p>
<p>However, they''re also stressing that tax benefits could
enable bigger payouts to investors in the future. The pitch:
that a combination would enrich Shire shareholders beyond what
the company could achieve alone. </p>
<p>Shire, for its part, has said the bid undervalues the
company, and that it has strong prospects on its own. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for AbbVie and a spokesman for Brunswick
didn''t immediately return calls seeking comment. A JPMorgan
spokeswoman declined to comment. </p>
<p>North Chicago, Illinois-based AbbVie heads into possible
negotiations with advantages Pfizer lacked. Unlike AstraZeneca,
Shire doesn''t have a large workforce or substantial research
base in the U.K. that politicians will fight to keep under local
control, as they did in AstraZeneca''s case. </p>
<h2>No History </h2>
<p>And AbbVie, spun off from Abbott Laboratories (ABT) last year,
has no history of past acquisitions to defend. Pfizer''s record
of presiding over large-scale layoffs after buying companies
including Wyeth and Pharmacia Corp. helped rally British
politicians and unions to AstraZeneca''s side. </p>
<p>Shire, domiciled in Dublin for tax purposes and with
management offices in Basingstoke, England, has rejected three
takeover offers from AbbVie. The companies are at odds over how
to benchmark Shire''s shares, with AbbVie arguing Shire''s share
price has been inflated since the AstraZeneca deal highlighted
the attractiveness of U.K. and Irish-domiciled health-care
companies. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. (C), Deutsche Bank AG, Evercore Partners Inc. (EVR),
Morgan Stanley (MS) and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) are advising Shire. </p>
<h2>Final Offer </h2>
<p>AbbVie CEO Gonzalez''s statement yesterday that he would
keep a hostile bid on the table contrasted with Pfizer''s
approach. </p>
<p>Pfizer on May 18 said its latest $117 billion proposal for
AstraZeneca was final and that it wouldn''t try to woo
shareholders directly. Under U.K. takeover rules, deeming an
offer final makes it nearly impossible for it to be further
increased. That''s another pitfall AbbVie is keen to avoid, two
of the people said. </p>
<p>Those pledges marked the end -- at least for now -- of what
would have been the industry''s biggest-ever acquisition, raising
questions about Pfizer''s tactics. </p>
<h2>Parliament''s Reaction </h2>
<p>Separately, AbbVie is trying to head off concerns that set
off a heated public debate over AstraZeneca, one of the people
familiar with the situation said. </p>
<p>Members of Parliament in the U.K. expressed reservations
over Pfizer''s history of large transactions followed by firings
and the shutdown of research facilities. </p>
<p>In response, Pfizer promised to locate 20 percent of its
global research workforce in Britain. That in turn fuelled
concern from public officials in the U.S. and Sweden, where
AstraZeneca also has significant operations, and exacerbated
animosity between the two companies. </p>
<p>Shire employs fewer than 500 people in the U.K. and only
about 100 in Ireland. CEO Flemming Ornskov and Phil Vickers,
Shire''s research head, work in the U.S., and other top managers
are joining them there. </p>
<p>In a message to its employees yesterday, AbbVie said no
jobs would be lost in the Chicago area in a Shire deal, and the
combined company would be managed from there. AbbVie is also
arguing that a deal would strengthen Shire''s research and
development capacity and give it global scale. </p>
<h2>Political Scrutiny </h2>
<p>Buying Shire would give AbbVie a growing stable of
treatments for rare diseases. The U.S. company is dependent on
the rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira for about 60 percent of
sales. </p>
<p>Gonzalez yesterday stressed the strategic advantages he
believes a transaction would bring to both companies in areas
such as rare diseases, neurosciences and ophthalmology. He also
pointed to the common ground between AbbVie and Shire. </p>
<p>Both strategically and culturally, there is great
alignment between our companies, he said. They are both
specialty-focused biopharmaceutical companies, pursuing similar
strategies, targeting diseases of high unmet medical need. </p>
<p>While AbbVie has said the proposed deal would cut its tax
rate by almost 10 percentage points, in its 39-page slide deck
presentation to Shire investors the word tax surfaces only
on page 20. </p>

<p>Since Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
bought a stake in Dong Energy A/S last year, the utility''s
hybrid debt has soared to a record, boosting investor returns as
the Danish firm uses the cash to rebuild its business. </p>
<p>Investors holding Dong''s 4.875 percent bond due 3013 have
enjoyed a 14 percent return since the debt was issued in July
last year and a 5.5 percent note maturing in 3005 gained 4.6
percent. Creditors holding Vattenfall AB''s 5.25 percent
perpetual note received 4.3 percent in Sweden''s biggest utility
over the same period. </p>
<p>Bringing in Goldman was a good idea, Finance Minister
Bjarne Corydon said in an interview at Denmark''s parliament in
Copenhagen. </p>
<p>Half a year after Goldman''s purchase of a stake in state-held Dong split the minority coalition of Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt, investors are benefiting from the transaction.
The Wall Street bank''s $1.5 billion purchase of an 18 percent
stake was part of a deal, made together with pension funds ATP
and PFA, that helped cauterize losses after Dong failed to turn
a profit on natural gas projects. </p>
<h2>Put Option </h2>
<p>Goldman, which bought the stake through its European
merchant banking unit in a company named New Energy Investment
S.a.r.l., has already seen the value of its stake grow. </p>
<p>Horsens, Denmark-based utility Insero this month exercised
a put option to sell a 1.8 percent stake in Dong to Denmark for
942 million kroner. That price values all of Dong at more than
50 billion kroner. </p>
<p>Dong was valued at 31.5 billion kroner ahead of Denmark
selling shares worth 13.1 billion kroner to Goldman, pension
funds ATP and PFA and a group of shareholders in February. </p>
<p>Insero''s price was based on a 2005-2006 valuation with
added interests minus dividends, Peter Brixen, the head of the
unit that manages the ministry''s stake, said in an e-mailed
reply to questions. Other minority holders, such as SEAS-NVE and
Syd Energi A/S, which control more than 10 percent, were also
able to sell shares at the same terms at Insero. </p>
<p>The yield on Dong''s 3013 hybrid bond eased to about 2.8
percent this week, compared with 5.238 when it was issued in
July last year. Its spread to the government yield curve has
narrowed to about 264 basis points from a high of 355 basis
points in January, a month after the government split. </p>
<h2>Popular Protest </h2>
<p>Goldman became the target of a popular protest in Denmark
after it emerged in December that the investment bank will
receive some veto rights over how Dong is managed in exchange
for its capital injection. Goldman has said it plans to follow
the current management''s strategy. </p>
<p>Dong explores for oil and natural gas in the North Sea and
is the world''s biggest builder of offshore wind turbine parks.
The company said yesterday net losses are narrowing and debt
shrinking after it completed a program of cuts and asset sales. </p>
<p>According to Jakob Magnussen, an analyst at Danske Bank
A/S, Dong''s hybrid bonds have also benefited from a general
appetite from investors for yields and risk-taking. </p>
<p>He recommends investors to buy into Dong''s two most recent
hybrid bonds with call options in 2018 and 2022, respectively,
as the bonds carry a limited risk to get extended. </p>
<p>Dong has very solid financial metrics, Magnussen said.
They''re actually much better than the company''s long-term
targets, so we''re expecting them to increase their leverage in
the coming quarters. They want to lower their funds from
operations to net debt margin to 30 percent from 55 percent
currently after they received new equity from Goldman and the
other shareholders. </p>

<p>U.S. approval for exporting some of
its ultra-light crude after minimal processing only broadens the
definition of refined products and won''t mean a sudden jump in
overseas shipments, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>While some producers are interested in exports, the ruling
to allow Pioneer Natural Resources Ltd. and Enterprise Products
Partners LP to ship condensates that have been run through a
distillation tower won''t significantly increase U.S. shipments
or limit supplies, Adam Longson, a New York-based analyst at the
bank, said in an e-mailed report today. </p>
<p>Anadarko Petroleum Corp. (APC), Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO) and Devon
Energy Corp. (DVN) also have access to similar technology and are
looking at the opportunity, Longson said, citing discussions
with the companies. </p>
<p>Our conversations don''t suggest a significant amount of
underutilized distillation capacity is available to drive up
exports anywhere near some of the estimates we have seen in the
press, he said. We are skeptical about reports of 500,000 to
1 million barrels a day of potential exports by year end. </p>
<p>Shipments could be challenged by limited infrastructure,
unattractive economics and uncertainty about the quality of
processed condensates, Longson said. </p>
<p>Limited pipeline connections and port capacity may restrict
volumes, and refining and exporting condensates may cost at
least $4 to $5 a barrel, leaving domestic use as the best
option, Longson said. Processing will affect the quality as
propane, butane and other light hydrocarbons, which are key
parts of traditional condensates, will be missing, he said in
the report. </p>
<h2>Distillation Tower </h2>
<p>Crude that has been processed through a distillation tower
to make petroleum products is no longer raw oil and can be
exported without a license, Jim Hock, a U.S. Commerce Department
spokesman, said June 24 in a written statement. The U.S.
prohibits most exports of unprocessed crude. </p>
<p>A distillation tower is traditionally used to heat crude or
condensate to remove fuels as they boil off at different
temperatures. It can also be used for condensates to remove
volatile hydrocarbons for safer storage and transport. </p>
<p>U.S crude production has boomed in recent years, spurred by
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in shale fields.
Output has risen 46 percent since the start of 2012 to almost
8.5 million barrels a day. Inventories reached 399.4 million
barrels in April, the highest since the Energy Information
Administration began publishing weekly data in 1982. </p>
<p>U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude has this year
traded at an average discount of $8.11 a barrel to Brent in
London, the international marker. Even with large scale
exports from the U.S., WTI will still trade at a discount of $5
to $8 a barrel to Brent, Longson said. </p>

<p>Venezuelan bonds are posting the
world''s best returns after a surge in the price of oil, the
country''s biggest export. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan
Stanley say buyers are unwise to bet $115-a-barrel crude can fix
a broken economy. </p>
<p>The government''s dollar-denominated notes have gained 5.9
percent since rebels took over swaths of northern Iraq on June
11, stoking concern that crude production will be hurt and
pushing Brent oil prices over $115 for the first time since
September. While the return was more than 14 times the average
for emerging-market debt, the extra yield of 8.63 percentage
points that investors demand to own Venezuela''s bonds instead of
U.S. Treasuries is still the highest in the world. </p>
<p>Any extra cash generated by the OPEC member''s oil exports
is likely to be siphoned off to pay for imports of consumer
goods amid shortages of drinking water, toilet paper and
medicine that have sparked anti-government protests, according
to Daniel Volberg, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York.
After currency devaluations and energy output declines,
President Nicolas Maduro is struggling to prop up an economy
posting the world''s fastest inflation and facing the worst
growth prospects outside Equatorial Guinea, according to the
International Monetary Fund. </p>
<p>The level of macroeconomic dysfunction is so deep that
the story really isn''t about oil prices anymore, said Alberto Ramos, the chief Latin American economist at Goldman Sachs in
New York. Unless policies change dramatically, I''d be
concerned even with the oil price at $150. </p>
<h2>Currency Controls </h2>
<p>Since Maduro succeeded his mentor, the late Hugo Chavez, in
March 2013, the economy''s stagnation has deepened as currency
controls impeded imports and factories shut down. The number of
cars built in Venezuela fell 77 percent in the first five months
of this year as automakers including Ford Motor Co. and Toyota
Motor Corp. froze production while American Airlines Inc. (AAL) and
Air Canada have cut back flights to the country because of
difficulty getting money out. </p>
<p>Still, the nation has kept paying its debt. </p>
<p>Venezuelan dollar bonds have returned 19 percent this year,
the best performance among developing countries, as suppressed
interest rates in the U.S. and Europe boosted demand for higher-yielding assets. The average yield on Venezuela''s dollar debt is
the highest in the world at 11.16 percent, 0.8 percentage point
more than lower-rated Argentina, which faces default as soon as
July 30. </p>
<h2>Bank Meetings </h2>
<p>Venezuela will continue to meet its obligations, Rafael
Ramirez, the economy vice president, said June 27. Officials are
meeting representatives of Bank of America Corp. Citigroup Inc.,
Credit Suisse AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs in Caracas
to discuss debt, Ramirez said. </p>
<p>Venezuela''s Finance Ministry didn''t respond to e-mail
messages sent yesterday seeking comment on the government''s
debt-payment policies. </p>
<p>Drew Benson, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in New York
declined to comment, as did Kerrie McHugh, a spokeswoman for
Deutsche Bank in New York. Press officers at Bank of America,
Citigroup and Goldman Sachs didn''t respond to requests for
comment. </p>
<h2>Economic Fundamentals </h2>
<p>This year''s rally in the bonds doesn''t make sense given
the direction fundamentals are going in Venezuela, Volberg
said. </p>
<p>The country''s international reserves fell 18 percent in the
last 12 months to $21 billion on June 27. Arrears to importers
and their banks may be worth as much as half the central bank''s
reported reserves, Volberg said. </p>
<p>Annual inflation reached 61 percent in May after the
government carried out its biggest devaluation since the
introduction of currency controls in 2003. The economy will
probably contract this year and next by as much as 1 percent,
according to the IMF. </p>
<p>While higher oil provides some benefits, signs that Maduro
is turning toward more pragmatic policies after four months of
unrest across the country may be more encouraging to investors,
according to Bank of America. </p>
<p>Last month Maduro fired Planning Minister Jorge Giordani, a
long-term advocate of currency controls who taught Chavez
economics in jail in the early 1990s. The country plans to merge
its three official foreign exchange rates, Ramirez told
investors in London in June. </p>
<h2>Exchange Rate </h2>
<p>The rates range from 6.3 bolivars per dollar to 50 bolivars
per dollar. On the black market, the bolivar trades at 72.18 per
dollar. The government is likely to unify exchange rates at
about 25 per dollar, according to Bank of America. </p>
<p>The cost to the government of exchanging its oil dollars
for bolivars at the official rate is the equivalent of 10
percent of gross domestic product, and authorities make that up
by printing money, according to Francisco Rodriguez, an
economist at Bank of America in New York. </p>
<p>Venezuela has a source of revenue it can use and with
unification it would pretty much solve its fiscal problem,
Rodriguez said by phone yesterday. </p>
<p>The country''s oil exports are falling as production wanes
at state-run Petroleos de Venezuela SA. Oil sales declined 8.4
percent last year to $114 billion, the company said June 27.
Output sank about 11,000 barrels a day in 2013 to a total of 2.9
million. </p>
<p>Technical indicators based on historical prices also
indicate the Venezuelan bonds may have risen too far, too fast.
The 14-day relative strength index on dollar bonds has been
above 70 since June 19, indicating they''re the most overbought
in two months. </p>
<p>The question is how long the markets are willing to give
Venezuela a free pass and how long this process can go on before
you have a more disorderly adjustment, Volberg said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) was accused by two former employees seeking to expand their lawsuit of discriminating against women while male colleagues engaged in binge drinking and took clients to strip clubs. </p> <p>The women asked a federal judge in Manhattan yesterday to let them sue on behalf of current and former female associates and vice presidents. Support for their claims includes statements of former Goldman Sachs employees, expert statistical analyses and evidence on earnings and promotions from the firm''s own records, they said in a court filing. </p> <p>Women report a boy''s club'' atmosphere, where binge drinking is common and women are either sexualized or ignored, according to the filing. </p> <p>The two women, H. Cristina Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, sued in 2010 and are seeking to broaden the case to include more than a decade of claimed discrimination at Goldman Sachs. A decision by U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to allow the women to sue as a class would increase the risk to the New York-based company. </p> <p>In the lawsuit, filed in 2010, the women seek unspecified damages and an order requiring Goldman Sachs to fix the alleged gender bias at the firm. </p> <h2>Salaries, Promotions </h2> <p>Female vice presidents earned 21 percent less than men and female associates made 8 percent less, the former employees claimed. About 23 percent fewer female vice presidents were promoted to managing director of the bank relative to their male counterparts, they said. </p> <p>Those statistics are attributed to an analysis of Goldman Sachs pay data by Henry S. Farber, a Princeton University economist. His samples included all associates and vice presidents in the firm''s New York class from 2003 to 2011 and throughout the U.S. from 2005 to 2011, according to a court filing yesterday. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs has denied the women''s claims and is fighting the case. The bank believes the statistical arguments are misleading and don''t compare similar employees to one another, said a person briefed on its legal strategy who requested anonymity because the firm hasn''t responded to the data in court. </p> <p>This is a normal and anticipated procedural step for any proposed class action lawsuit and does not change the case''s lack of merit, David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mailed statement. </p> <h2>Strip Clubs </h2> <p>Chen-Oster and Orlich are seeking to persuade Torres that their claims are sufficiently similar to those of other women at Goldman Sachs so they can represent them in a single case. </p> <p>They''re asking Torres to certify a class of female associates and vice presidents who worked for the company in the U.S. in its investment banking, investment management and securities divisions beginning Sept. 10, 2004. The start date for employees who worked in New York City would be July 7, 2002. </p> <p>Denise Shelley, a vice president who left the firm in 2009, said in a court filing that men at Goldman Sachs repeatedly called women bimbos, mocked a new hire who had won a beauty pageant and took clients to strip clubs. Shelley said in the filing that she sat on the steering committee of the firm''s network for women and, after joining colleagues at a bar, was called a party girl by a managing director. </p> <p>The case is Chen-Oster v.

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world''s
biggest energy company by market value, will invest $1 billion
to increase diesel production at its Antwerp refinery . </p>
<p>The company will add a delayed coker unit at the 320,000
barrel-a-day refinery in Belgium that will convert high-sulfur
oil to diesel for use in trucks and ships, the Irving, Texas-based company said in a statement today. Exxon has spent $2
billion in the past decade on expansions in the refinery
including a 130 megawatt power plant and hydrotreater unit that
reduces sulfur from fuels, the company said. </p>
<p>The investment addresses an industry shortfall in
capability to convert fuel oil to products such as diesel,
Exxon said in the statement. The expansion is the first of
several being evaluated to further strengthen strategic
refineries in Europe to more successfully face the challenging
industry environment. </p>

<p>Wage talks to end a four-day strike
by more than 220,000 metalworkers in South Africa failed
yesterday as protests turned violent and General Motors Co. (GM) and
Bayerische Motoren Werke AG halted production. </p>
<p>The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa rejected
an improved offer from the Steel and Engineering Industries
Federation of Southern Africa, the employer group said in an e-mailed statement today. The strike that began on July 1 has been
marred by violence and prompted Moody''s Investors Service to
warn yesterday that the country''s credit rating may be at risk. </p>
<p>Seifsa, as the employers'' group is known, said its offer to
raise wages for the lowest-paid workers by 10 percent this year
was the best it could make. No further talks are planned with
Numsa, which is demanding a 12 percent pay increase and a ban on
labor brokers. </p>
<p>General Motors shut its plant in the eastern coastal city
of Port Elizabeth as the strike in the metal and engineering
sector has impacted upon supply of components to our production
line, Gishma Johnson, the company''s spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>GM, which has a target to build 50,000 vehicles a year in
South Africa, said its assembly of light commercial autos such
as Isuzu trucks and Chevrolet utility vehicles is affected by
the stoppage. </p>
<h2>Vehicle Loss </h2>
<p>BMW brought forward a week of planned maintenance at its
plant outside Pretoria, halting production on July 1, spokesman
Guy Kilfoil said by phone today. The factory will reopen on July
8 with two shifts instead of the normal three if the strike
continues, he said. That may result in the loss of 120 vehicles
a day, he said. </p>
<p>If the strike goes beyond two weeks, the risks to vehicle
manufacturers and production plants will increase
substantially, Nico Vermeulen, director of the National
Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa, said by
phone from Pretoria. </p>
<p>A Numsa strike over pay at carmakers between August and
October last year cost the industry at least 20 billion rand
($1.8 billion) in revenue, according to Naamsa. </p>
<p>The current stoppage follows a five-month strike by more
than 70,000 platinum miners that caused South Africa''s economy
to contract in the first quarter of the year. Finance Minister
Nhlanhla Nene said this week the government''s economic growth
target of 2.7 percent this year will probably be missed. </p>
<h2>Labor Talks </h2>
<p>Labor Minister Mildred Oliphant is meeting with employers
to seek a resolution to the strike and will hold talks with
union leaders later, Mokgadi Pela, her spokesman, said by phone. </p>
<p>Police arrested 26 people today after several incidents of
violence by striking workers at factories around Johannesburg.
In Benoni, east of Johannesburg, more than 2,000 workers forced
their way onto business premises, damaging equipment and
computers, police said in an e-mailed statement. Protesters were
shot with rubber bullets after stoning police and breaking
through a factory gate in Elandsfontein. </p>
<p>Companies including Bell Equipment Ltd. (BEL) and Evraz Highveld
Steel  Vanadium Ltd. as well as units of Murray  Roberts
Holdings Ltd. and Aveng Ltd. (AEG) are affected by the stoppage. </p>
<p>The strike is also harming construction at Eskom Holdings
SOC Ltd.''s Medupi and Kusile power plants. Police used rubber
bullets to disperse 400 to 500 protesting workers at the Medupi
site in Limpopo province yesterday. There were no reported
incidents today, Eskom spokesman Andrew Etzinger said by phone. </p>
<p>Numsa yesterday denied allegations that its members were
involved in violence, saying in a statement that the reports are
part of a cheap ploy by the employers to undermine the
integrity of our struggle for a living wage and improved
conditions of employment. </p>
<p>Castro Ngobese, the union''s spokesman, wasn''t immediately
available when contacted by phone today. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), the world''s biggest
software maker, is among companies embroiled in a European Union
inquiry into Luxembourg''s tax treatment of multinational firms,
according to three people familiar with the EU''s review. </p>
<p>The European Commission has quizzed Luxembourg about how it
taxes Microsoft''s intellectual property, said one of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.
Competition regulators also asked questions about McDonald''s
Corp. (MCD)''s taxes in Luxembourg, two of the people said. Amazon.com
Inc.''s tax affairs there are also being looked at, the Financial
Times reported yesterday, citing an EU official. </p>
<p>Amid a global crackdown on tax avoidance, EU competition
regulators last month opened a probe into suspected tax breaks
for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in Ireland, Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) in the Netherlands
and Fiat Finance  Trade SA in Luxembourg, the bloc''s richest
country in per capita terms. </p>
<p>We are in constant contact with the European Commission
on all these tax issues and Luxembourg is pretty confident in
the way it handles its taxation issues and so we''re going to
monitor the information with the commission and hand over the
information that is requested, Pierre Gramegna, Luxembourg
Finance Minister, said today on CNBC. </p>
<p>The scrutiny of Luxembourg is also a potential
embarrassment for Jean-Claude Juncker, who is primed to become
the next president of the commission -- the EU''s executive arm
in charge of the investigation. Juncker, who led Luxembourg
until last year, helped the country win a reputation as an
attractive location for international companies. </p>
<h2>Member States </h2>
<p>The commission continues to gather information about
certain tax practices in several member states, Antoine Colombani, spokesman for Competition Commissioner Joaquin Almunia, said. However we will not make any comment on whether
specific companies may or may not be covered by this information
gathering exercise. </p>
<p>Sabina Gockel, a spokeswoman for Microsoft in Brussels,
declined to comment. Joanna Kwiatkowska, a spokeswoman for
McDonald''s in the U.K., didn''t immediately respond to calls and
an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Natasha Bertaud, a spokeswoman for Juncker at the
commission, said the former Luxembourg premier also has no
comment. Lawmakers at the European Parliament are scheduled to
vote on his appointment later this month. </p>
<p>Lucien Michels, a spokesman for Luxembourg''s finance
ministry, declined to comment on Amazon''s possible involvement
in the tax inquiry. He didn''t immediately respond to e-mailed
questions concerning other companies. </p>
<h2>French Unit </h2>
<p>McDonald''s denied earlier this year a magazine report that
it avoided paying taxes related to more than $3 billion of
revenue in France since 2009, saying inspections by fiscal
authorities at its French unit were routine. </p>
<p>The EU''s investigations of Apple, Starbucks and Fiat
Finance focus on so-called transfer-pricing arrangements on
taxing commercial transactions between company units. </p>
<p>The commission has said it will continue a wider inquiry
into those deals, including information gathering from the U.K.,
Belgium, Cyprus and Malta. Governments can be ordered by the
European Commission to claw back unfair aid. </p>
<p>The EU has also sought details from Belgium, Spain, France,
Hungary, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the U.K., Cyprus and Malta
on so-called patent boxes, which allow tax reductions on income
from patents. </p>
<p>The EU request for information on Amazon relates to whether
Luxembourg''s tax decisions on the company complied with state-aid rules, the FT said. Amazon''s press office in the U.K. didn''t
respond to a call for comment. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT) is turning to the
bond market to raise money that will allow the coal miner to pay
off a revolving loan that restricts its borrowing capacity. </p>
<p>Walter sold $320 million of debt in an add-on to its $650
million of 9.5 percent, first-lien notes due October 2019,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It will use the money
to repay borrowings on its revolving lines of credit, according
to a regulatory filing today. </p>
<p>The new notes, part of a deal initially offered to
investors in September 2013, were sold at 99 cents on the dollar
to yield 9.74 percent, Bloomberg data show. The securities
traded at 101.5 cents on the dollar yesterday to yield 9.12
percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of
the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. </p>
<p>The paydown will terminate the loan, ridding the
Birmingham, Alabama-based company of a corresponding leverage
test that prevented the highly indebted coal miner from
accessing the full amount of the revolver, according to Srihari Rajagopolan, a credit analyst at UBS AG. </p>
<p>The company will be left with $77 million of revolving
credit, down from $314 million before the transactions, and $43
million will be accounted for by letters of credit, according to
a statement from Moody''s Investors Service. </p>
<h2>Unsustainable'' Debt </h2>
<p>The new notes would add to Walter''s debt load, which
included $2.92 billion of long-term borrowings on March 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Standard  Poor''s
lowered its credit rating to CCC+ from B- on June 27, saying in
a ratings statement that Walter had an unsustainable amount
of debt because of the low price of the metallurgical coal it
produces. </p>
<p>Executives of the coal miner told bondholders and lenders
on a private teleconference today that after the notes were
sold, it would have no more capacity under its credit agreement
to sell first-lien debt, according to two people on the call who
asked not be named because it wasn''t public. Walter would also
give up its ability to issue new second-lien bonds if it acts on
an option to pay interest with more debt on its $350 million of
11 percent notes due April 2020, said the people. </p>
<p>The company told investors today that it would continue
considering requests to swap debt for equity, the people said.
Chief Financial Officer Bill Harvey didn''t immediately respond
to a phone message left for comment about today''s call. </p>
<h2>Debt Swap </h2>
<p>Walter swapped $35 million of its 9.875 percent of $520
million senior unsecured notes due 2020 for $3.15 million in
common stock during the first quarter this year, Harvey said
during in a public conference call on May 1. </p>
<p>Speculation that shares could be diluted helped send
Walter''s stock down 8.6 percent to $5.62 today. Shares have
dropped 66 percent this year. </p>
<p>Walter executives on today''s call laid out several cost-saving measures they expect to undertake. The company plans to
save at least $20 million in annual capital expenditures from
the $130 million it previously told debt investors it would
spend, the people said. </p>
<p>Walter began idling its Canadian mines in April after the
global benchmark price for metallurgical coal fell to a six-year
low of $120 per metric ton. The money-saving measure resulted in
a charge of about $7 million related to severance costs,
according to today''s filing. </p>
<h2>Force Majeure </h2>
<p>The coal miner said today it plans to assert a force
majeure defense against Ridley Terminals Inc. that would allow
it to skirt an otherwise obligatory payment set forth in a
logistics contract with the coal transportation company. It has
an agreement with Ridley requiring a minimum yearly throughput

<p>Industrial metals will probably be
the greatest beneficiaries of China''s intensifying policy-easing
measures in the third quarter, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Economic growth in China is set to improve, helped by
easing and stronger export markets, metals analysts including
Joel Crane wrote in a report today, citing the bank''s chief
economist for China, Helen Qiao. </p>
<p>The LMEX Index of the six main metals traded on the London
Metal Exchange has risen 3 percent this year. Beijing will step
up policy-easing measures this quarter to counter potential
property market weakness and strengthen growth momentum, Morgan
Stanley said. </p>
<p>Copper, lead, and zinc supply-demand balances are already
in deficit, the bank said, adding that nickel and aluminum are
headed in that direction. The bank maintained its positive
outlook on copper amid a global shortage and expects prices to
average $7,055 a metric ton in the second half of this year and
$7,397 in 2015. </p>
<p>Copper for delivery in three months rose 0.7 percent to
$7,171.25 a ton at 5:01 p.m. in Tokyo, paring this year''s loss
to 2.6 percent. The metal is the worst performer among six
metals on the LME this year. </p>
<h2>Qingdao Port </h2>
<p>A probe into metals warehousing in China''s Qingdao port
will not disrupt the copper market, the bank said, adding it
doesn''t believe inventory financing behavior will have any
lasting effect on supply and demand fundamentals. Bonded
warehouse stockpiles in Shanghai declined sharply to about
600,000 tons as a result of unwinding financing since Beijing''s
initial crackdown in March, the bank said. </p>
<p>An acute shortage of scrap will continue this year,
increasing demand for refined copper and driving the global
market to remain in a deficit, the bank said. Mined supply
growth is struggling, with about 3 percent, or 600,000 tons, of
mine production capability lost to disruptions and technical
difficulties, it said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley raised its nickel price forecast by 13
percent to $17,640 a ton for this year and 6 percent to $19,346
for 2015, anticipating a supply squeeze caused by Indonesia''s
ban on ore exports. </p>
<h2>Ore Exports </h2>
<p>Nickel has jumped 40 percent in 2014, the most among six
main metals on the LME, after Indonesia barred exports of
unprocessed ores in January. China is the biggest consumer of
the metal, with Indonesia its most important supplier of ore to
make nickel pig iron, a cheaper alternative to refined metal for
making stainless steel. </p>
<p>Prices caught a second wind in the second quarter after
production at two key projects in New Caledonia, Glencore
Xstrata Plc''s Koniambo and Vale SA''s VNC, failed to meet
expectations, likely accelerating the impending supply-demand
imbalance, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Global supply will exceed demand by 44,200 tons in 2014
before shifting to a deficit of 97,100 tons in 2015, the first
annual shortfall since 2010, the bank said. Nickel for delivery
in three months on the LME climbed 0.6 percent to $19,437 a ton. </p>
<p>Nickel ore and concentrate imports into China have slumped
36 percent this year, the bank said. China''s nickel pig iron
output will drop to 388,000 tons in 2014 and to 212,000 tons in
2015 from 472,000 tons in 2013, it said. Indonesia''s pig iron
production will rise from 1,000 tons this year to 46,000 tons in
2015 and about 150,000 tons in 2017, the analysts wrote. </p>
<p>Stainless steel orders in the U.S. remain strong, with some
mills booking as far out as November to December, the bank said,
citing Wood Mackenzie Ltd. In Europe, consumption of stainless
products is strong because of a substantial pick-up in demand
from the construction and auto industries, it said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley also raised its average price estimates for
aluminum by 7 percent to $1,830 a ton in 2014 and 6 percent to
$1,913 in 2015, while the bank increased its estimates for zinc
by 3 percent to $2,123 in 2014 and 1 percent to $2,348 in 2015. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank will be
better able to identify lenders with poor risk management than
any previous supervisor, according to the official soon to be
responsible for monitoring the region''s largest banks. </p>
<p>We are going to carry out Europe-wide, comparative
analysis of banks that have similar business models, Stefan Walter, director general for Microprudential Supervision I at
the ECB, said in a speech in Frankfurt today. That wasn''t
possible in the previous nationally oriented supervision system.
A comparative peer-group analysis like this is an effective
instrument for supervisors to identify banks which are lagging
behind the risk- and business-models of other banks. </p>
<p>The ECB will take up oversight duties on Nov. 4. and is
currently building a more detailed record of the balance sheets
of euro-area banks than has ever been available. Officials from
the 128 lenders covered by the health check, or Comprehensive
Assessment, are meeting ECB staff in Frankfurt this week for an
update. </p>
<p>I want to emphasize that we''re going to use a
multiplicity of methods to assess the risks in the banking
system, and use them to direct our approach to supervision,
Walter said. </p>

the notes a key part of plans to fuel growth in the region to

<p>Competition to arrange global bond
sales in Asia is heating up as Chinese banks take advantage of
their compatriots'' dominance of fundraising in the region. </p>
<p>Bank of China Ltd.''s 3.7 percent market share ranked 10th
in the first half as Chinese lenders comprised seven of the top
30 sale managers, the highest on record, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. HSBC Holdings Plc, Citigroup Inc. and
JPMorgan Chase  Co. were the top three arrangers, even as
Chinese issuers accounted for more than 50 percent of the $106.4
billion-equivalent of issues denominated in either dollars, euro
or yen in Asia ex-Japan. </p>
<p>The market has definitely become more competitive and
you''ve seen the new entrance of Chinese banks, said Mark Follett, the Hong Kong-based head of high-grade debt capital
markets for Asia ex-Japan at JPMorgan, whose 8.6 percent market
share trailed HSBC''s 12.8 percent and Citigroup''s 10.8 percent.
There''s still a clear separation between the top five or six
players and the rest, he added. </p>
<p>Banks from Asia''s largest economy have raised their share
of underwriting business to 9 percent from 4.4 percent five
years ago as Chinese companies involve them in their offshore
push. Dollar, euro and yen bond sales in Asia will set another
record in 2014, beating 2013''s $137 billion, the top five ranked
arrangers say. Sales of bonds in yuan outside China are also
heading for an all-time high. </p>
<h2>Leading Role </h2>
<p>We aim to maintain the leading role in the offshore
renminbi market and all the Chinese issues, leveraging our
relationships in the Dim Sum market into the G3 currencies,
Tony Wang, deputy general manager for global markets at Bank of
China (Hong Kong) Ltd., said in a July 10 interview. There are
more Chinese companies expanding in overseas markets and picking
Hong Kong as a funding platform. As a Chinese bank with
international experience, we''re able to understand their needs
and the global dynamics. </p>
<p>China''s influence in the region''s international bond market
has grown, with the country''s borrowers making up 60 percent of
sales last quarter versus 47 percent the first three months of
2014, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China''s 10 biggest
issuers make up 13 percent of JPMorgan''s Asia Credit Index,
which covers 324 companies around the region, Moody''s Investors
Service said in a June 23 report. </p>
<h2>Global Footprint </h2>
<p>This is further amplified when taking into account the
level of state ownership that exists behind many of the
country''s bond issuers, said Laura Acres, a Hong Kong-based
analyst at Moody''s. The China-based sub-index is skewed toward
real estate, oil and gas and quasi-sovereigns, which together
account for 20.4 percent of total exposure. </p>
<p>China Petrochemical Corp., the parent company of Asia''s
largest oil refiner, raised $5 billion in April in the biggest
offering of notes in the U.S. currency by an Asian issuer in
more than a decade. The amount matched a sale in November 2003
by Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., the Hong Kong conglomerate controlled
by Li Ka Shing, Asia''s richest man. </p>
<p>That same month, Cnooc Ltd., China''s largest offshore
explorer, sold $4 billion of bonds and Tencent Holdings Ltd.,
Asia''s biggest Internet company, priced $2 billion of debt,
making it the busiest month on record for dollar bonds in the
region. </p>
<p>Some banks counter that as transaction sizes swell, bond-sale managers increasingly need a global footprint. </p>
<h2>HSBC No. 1 </h2>
<p>Asian deals are being distributed more globally,
especially in the high-grade space where we''ve seen U.S.
investors in particular increasing their appetite for Asia,
said Hital Desai, a Hong Kong-based director in the Asia debt
syndicate team at Bank of America Corp.''s Merrill Lynch unit.
Having a global distribution platform really allows us to
connect the dots for both issuers and investors. </p>
<p>Bank of America ranked fifth the first six months of the
year, with a 6.9 percent market share that lagged Deutsche Bank
AG''s 7.4 percent. The next highest ranked Chinese bank after
Bank of China was Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd.
with 1.6 percent, followed by Citic Securities Co. with 1.1
percent. </p>
<p>HSBC has held the No. 1 place since 2010, helping to
arrange 11.4 percent of sales in all of 2013 and 13.9 percent in
2012. </p>
<p>Issuers across the region look to us for our consistency,
innovative financing ideas and the full global reach of our
platform, said Alexi Chan, the head of HSBC''s Asia-Pacific
debt capital markets team. We''re on track for another record
year in Asian G3 currencies, assuming the current stable market
conditions continue. </p>
<h2>More Banks </h2>
<p>Along with deal size, the list of banks on larger trades is
also getting longer. China Petrochemical, known as Sinopec
Group, picked 13 banks to underwrite its bond offering this year
compared with 10 in 2013. </p>
<p>The flow from Chinese borrowers looks set to continue into
the second half as property developers press on with their debt
offensive. Shenzhen-based Redco Properties Group Ltd., rated B,
five levels below investment grade, by Standard  Poor''s, began
bond-investor meetings in Hong Kong and Singapore last week,
people familiar with the matter said. The company hasn''t tapped
the U.S.-currency market previously, Bloomberg data show. </p>
<p>With ongoing low rates, the second half is going to be a
busier one for high yield, said Deutsche Bank''s Singapore-based Jacob Gearhart, the head of global risk syndicate for
Asia. I also wouldn''t rule out the class of 2011, five-year
non-call three, issuers seeking to refinance. </p>

<p>The U.S. dollar is poised to
strengthen versus its Canadian counterpart after a report showed
Canada''s labor market is lagging behind that of the U.S., Morgan
Stanley said. </p>
<p>The Canadian currency, called the loonie for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, dropped versus all of its 31
major peers today after the government reported the economy
unexpectedly lost jobs in June and the unemployment rate rose.
Hedge funds and other large speculators turned bullish on the
loonie this month after 70 weeks of betting against it. </p>
<p>The big picture is that Canada''s year-to-date labor
market performance has been dire compared to that in the U.S.,
Evan Brown and Calvin Tse, New York-based currency strategists
at the bank, wrote in a client note. The employment report
reinforces our conviction that Canada is not nearly as poised
to gain from U.S. growth as it was in the past. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said the greenback may rise to C$1.12, a
level last reached on March 25. A bet on it gaining should be
scrapped if the U.S. currency drops to C$1.055, the strategists
said. They couldn''t be reached for further comment. </p>
<p>The U.S. dollar rose 0.8 percent to C$1.0734 and touched
C$1.0737, a two-week high, in Toronto trading. It fell to
C$1.0621 on July 3, a six-month low, after data last month
showed inflation rising above the Bank of Canada''s 2 percent
target in May for the first time since 2012. The greenback
reached a 4 1/2 year high of C$1.1279 in March after Bank of
Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said he couldn''t rule out an
interest-rate cut to spur slowing growth. The BOC''s next policy
decision is due July 16. </p>
<p>The U.S. is Canada''s biggest trade partner. </p>
<p>Canadian employers eliminated 9,400 jobs last month, data
showed, versus a forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a gain of
20,000. The unemployment rate rose to 7.1 percent, versus a
projection it would stay at 7 percent. </p>
<p>U.S. payrolls increased by 288,000 positions in June, and
the jobless rate fell to 6.1 percent, data showed on July 3. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), Discovery Communications Inc. (DISCA) and CBS Corp. (CBS) are being asked for information by U.S. antitrust officials probing Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)''s planned purchase of Time Warner Cable Inc., according to three people familiar with the matter. </p> <p>The Justice Department has reached out to the companies as it investigates whether the cable-industry merger is anticompetitive, said the people, who asked not to be named because the review isn''t public. </p> <p>While none of the companies has publicly opposed the acquisition, some have said they want the U.S. to ensure that Comcast won''t favor its own programming over their content if the merger is approved. Other media companies have also been approached, one of the people said. </p> <p>Among other issues, the antitrust division is asking about most-favored-nation clauses, one of the people said. The contracts are used by Philadelphia-based Comcast and other pay-TV providers to ensure competitors can''t get better content-licensing deals with programmers. </p> <p>Media companies can help inform the Justice Department''s assessment of whether the Comcast-Time Warner Cable combination risks hurting competition, said Amanda Wait, an antitrust attorney at Hunton  Williams LLP in Washington. </p> <h2>Expanded Footprint'' </h2> <p>One of the big questions in the Comcast-Time Warner deal is how the expanded footprint of the cable company is going to affect its ability to deal with these content providers, Wait said. </p> <p>The Justice Department has been looking at most-favored-nation clauses, which stipulate that pay-TV operators such as Comcast can match subsequent deals networks get for their programming, for at least two years. In 2012, the antitrust division sent civil investigative demands, similar to subpoenas, to DirecTV and Dish Network Corp. about the agreements as part of a broader probe into whether pay-TV companies were squeezing out Internet-video competitors, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg News at the time. </p> <p>Most-favored-nation contracts were also targeted in the Justice Department''s 2012 lawsuit against Apple Inc. (AAPL) and five publishers over prices of digital books. </p> <h2>Individual Deals </h2> <p>Lions Gate Entertainment Corp. Vice Chairman Michael Burns criticized most-favored-nation clauses in April, saying contracts originally created to help smaller cable-TV companies compete now benefit larger players. The agreements prevent Lions Gate from doing individual deals, such as a promotion with one distributor, he said. That means consumers pay more, according to Burns. </p> <p>Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, said in February it would spend $45.2 billion for No. 2 Time Warner Cable. In addition to the Justice Department, the Federal Communications Commission is also reviewing the deal. The FCC yesterday started its nonbinding 180-day clock for finishing the review. The Justice Department, which considers the effects on competition, could sue to block the acquisition, approve it with conditions or clear it without requiring changes. </p> <p>We''re all trying to figure out consolidation, what does it mean for all of us in the industry, Discovery Chief Executive Officer David Zaslav said at Allen  Co.''s media retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, this week. </p> <h2>Higher Rates </h2> <p>Netflix Inc. and Dish, the second-largest U.S. satellite TV provider, oppose the deal. Netflix, the video-streaming service, has said Comcast is already dominant enough to capture unprecedented fees, and would gain more leverage combining with Time Warner Cable. Dish argues Comcast will extract lower prices from programmers, leading to higher rates for smaller competitors. </p> <p>Comcast already won approval for its acquisition of NBCUniversal from the Justice Department in 2011. The company agreed to certain conditions as part of the deal, including making sure NBC''s shows would be available on fair terms to pay-TV rivals such as Dish and DirecTV. Abiding by net neutrality rules were also a condition of the agreement. </p> <p>The Justice Department could extend those same terms as part of any approval for Comcast''s purchase of Time Warner Cable, one of the people said. </p> <p>Officials with Comcast, Disney, CBS, Discovery and the Justice Department declined to comment. </p> <h2>Equal Footing </h2> <p>CBS Chief Executive Officer Les Moonves told Bloomberg in May that equal access for his broadcast and cable channels on Comcast systems was an issue the company was studying. </p> <p>I am sure the DOJ will prevent NBC from getting any advantage or at least we assume so, Moonves said on Bloomberg TV on May 15. We will be equally competitive with them on that basis. </p> <p>21st Century Fox Inc. Chief Operating Officer Chase Carey told Bloomberg News in May his company wants to make sure its online programs could be viewed on an equal footing with those of other services. </p> <p>The Justice Department is using the interviews with the media companies to understand the issues in the merger and guide the investigation, said one of the people. Discussions with the companies will probably be ongoing, the person said. </p> <p>The Justice Department typically has informal talks with third parties and then later can gather testimony under oath, according to Wait, the antitrust lawyer. </p> <p>They have a very complicated industry they''re trying to understand, Wait said. They''re seeing a deal they may want to challenge in the future, so they''re starting to put their ducks in a row in the event they decide to do that. </p> <p> ', 'Disney, CBS Queried by U.S. in Comcast Merger', 'By David McLaughlin, Christopher Palmeri and Edmund Lee', 'Jul 11, 2014  6:00 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-11/disney-cbs-said-to-be-queried-by-u-s-in-comcast-merger.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s asset
management unit intends to quadruple its holdings of European
commercial property in need of renovations or new tenants as
well-occupied buildings in good condition become too expensive. </p>
<p>The company plans to raise its ownership of
opportunistic properties in the region to about 4 billion
euros ($5.4 billion) over three years, according to Peter Reilly, the company''s head of European real estate. During that
time, the New York-based investor will acquire less lower-risk,
or core, real estate. </p>
<p>In the next three years our buying activity will probably
be 80 percent opportunistic, whereas through 2012 it was 80
percent core, Reilly said in an interview. Our buy activity
shifts as the capital market shifts. </p>
<p>Investors like JPMorgan Asset Management, which holds about
$63 billion of real estate, rushed to the safety of Europe''s
most stable income-producing properties after the financial
crisis. Firms are now flocking to riskier office buildings,
shops and warehouses as prices for the safest assets in Europe
climb to their highest level since 2007. </p>
<p>Almost 60 percent of investors were searching for riskier
properties at the end of the first quarter, up from 47 percent a
year earlier, according to a study by London-based research firm
Preqin Ltd. The proportion of buyers seeking the highest quality
buildings with tenants in place dropped to 35 percent from 56
percent. </p>
<h2>International Investment </h2>
<p>JPMorgan Asset Management owns about 3 billion euros of
core properties in Europe, including offices, shops and
warehouses in the U.K., France and Germany, Reilly said. The
majority of its property holdings, about $45.5 billion excluding
real estate investment trusts, is in the U.S. Europe is second
at about $7.8 billion and Asia trails with around $1.1 billion. </p>
<p>Buying properties in need of investment to reach their
earnings potential is easier now because banks are more willing
to sell underperforming loans tied to real estate than they had
been in the aftermath of the financial crisis, he said. </p>
<p>Conversations with banks are more productive today than
they were a couple of years ago, when there was a big
difference between asking prices and bids, Reilly said. That
should accelerate through 2015. </p>
<p>Banks will sell loans with a face value of 83 billion euros
this year, 30 percent more than in 2013, as they clean up their
balance sheets to focus on new business, according to data
compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan unit will focus on buying offices in large
cities including Paris, Berlin, Hamburg, Munich, Frankfurt and
the English cities of Birmingham and Manchester. High prices in
London make it difficult to find profitable deals there, he
said. </p>
<p>We like troubled assets in really good markets, he
said. So when you fix the asset, you''ve got a core property. </p>

<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index will
climb 4.2 percent to 2,050 by the end of 2014 as economic growth
picks up, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. strategists led by David Kostin forecast, boosting an earlier projection of 1,900. </p>
<p>Stocks with lower valuations will outperform the market
before the Federal Reserve begins tightening interest rates, the
strategists wrote. Goldman Sachs''s year-end projections for the
SP 500 in 2015 and 2016 remained unchanged at 2,100 and 2,200,
respectively. </p>
<p>We expect the equity rally will continue, but the
trajectory will be shallow, the group wrote in a note to
clients dated July 11. Domestic economic growth is
accelerating, and earnings will continue to rise, but further
P/E multiple expansion is unlikely. </p>
<p>Kostin''s new forecast makes Goldman Sachs the fourth most-bullish out of 19 Wall Street firms tracked by Bloomberg. The
SP 500 has been trading above Kostin''s previous year-end
forecast of 1,900 for almost two months amid growing optimism
that the economy was accelerating following a first-quarter
slowdown. </p>
<p>The SP 500 trades for 18.1 times its companies reported
earnings, the highest level since March 2010. </p>
<p>Lower-valuation stocks and those with weak balance sheets,
low returns on capital and low margins will lead the market''s
gains before the Fed''s interest rate tightening, Kostin wrote. </p>
<p>Viewed in relation to bonds, the U.S. equity market still
appears attractively valued, the Goldman group wrote. </p>
<h2>Stocks Rebound </h2>
<p>U.S. stocks advanced today, with the SP adding 0.5 percent
to 1,977.10 at 4 p.m. in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average climbed 111.61 points, or 0.7 percent, to 17,075.42. The
Russell 2000 Index jumped 0.5 percent after its worst weekly
decline in more than two years. </p>
<p>The SP 500 rebounded today following its worst week since
April amid signs of financial stress in Europe and speculation
by firms including Raymond James  Associates Inc. that stocks
may be due for a pullback. </p>
<p>Improving macroeconomic data prompted Goldman economists
earlier in the month to predict the Fed will increase interest
rates in the third quarter of 2015, compared with an earlier
forecast for the first quarter of 2016. The Fed will lift its
benchmark rate to 4 percent by 2018, Goldman wrote. </p>
<p>Goldman is quite confident that the U.S. economy is
accelerating to an above-trend pace, chief economist Jan
Hatzius wrote in a report. </p>

company will book about a 100 million-euro ($136 million) loss,
while the transaction will add about 9 percentage points to its

<p>Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco sold the unit to focus
on the company''s main business, strengthen finances and boost
profitability. The company, which set a goal of 4 billion euros
of revenue from asset sales by 2015, will have 3.7 billion euros
with this sale, Greco said in the statement. </p>
<p>This sale completes the disposal process aimed at
strengthening the capital base of the group, resolving a key
issue for us, and allowing Generali to focus on driving forward
with its core insurance business, Greco said. This result is
a testament to our team''s ability and commitment to execute a
complex transaction in a challenging environment. </p>

to 15.49 euros as of 11:20 a.m. in Milan, giving the insurer a
value of 24.1 billion euros. </p>
<h2>U.S. Fines </h2>
<p>BTG, the Brazilian lender controlled by billionaire Andre Esteves, is expanding internationally as Brazil''s growth slows.
It''s added units in Mexico and Colombia, and in January Esteves
said he plans to open offices in Geneva, Houston and Singapore
as the firm expands in commodities. </p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale, which is scheduled to be completed
by the first half of 2015, may be reduced by any fine
established pursuant to the U.S. Department of Justice''s tax
amnesty program relating to Swiss financial banking institutions
payable by BSI, Generali said. </p>
<p>BSI is one of at least 36 Category 2 Swiss banks seeking to
avoid prosecution for handling undeclared American money by
joining the U.S. Justice Department''s voluntary disclosure
program. The U.S. is scouring Switzerland for names of tax
dodgers who used the world''s largest offshore haven to hide
money from the Internal Revenue Service. </p>
<h2>BSI Loss </h2>
<p>Under a program announced in August, about a third of Swiss
banks with reason to believe they violated tax laws asked
the Justice Department to forgo prosecution. In turn, banks must
hand over data on undeclared accounts and pay penalties. </p>
<p>BSI had a net loss of 722 million Swiss francs last year as
it took writedowns faster than planned because of new
regulations for accounting treatment of goodwill, the bank said
April 28. </p>
<p>Generali''s net income in the three months to March climbed
to 660 million euros from 603 million euros a year earlier, the
company said in May. The first-quarter pro-forma Solvency 1
ratio after the BSI sale will exceed the insurer''s 2015 target
of 160 percent, it said today. </p>
<p>Once the announced sale of BSI is concluded, Generali''s
period of balance sheet repair will be complete, Marcus Rivaldi, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a note today.
Focus now turns to how earnings and dividends can be
improved. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
to resubmit its capital plan this year after falling below a
minimum leverage ratio, used that experience as motivation to
cut lending through repurchase agreements. </p>
<p>The bank reduced total assets by $56 billion to $860
billion as of June 30, the lowest level since 2009. Goldman
Sachs is cutting back on businesses that have low return on
assets and $25 billion of the reduction came in the firm''s
matched book repo lending, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said today in a conference call with analysts after the
New York-based firm reported second-quarter results. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is facing pressure to reduce assets as the
bank is below the 5 percent minimum ratio in the proposed
supplementary leverage ratio, which measures equity capital
compared to assets unweighted by risk. In March, it also had to
reduce the amount of capital it planned to return in the Federal
Reserve''s stress test, known as CCAR, after dropping below the 4
percent minimum of a separate requirement. </p>
<p>We identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with
a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings
potential, Schwartz said. One of the significant inputs into
the process obviously was CCAR. </p>
<p>In a matched book, banks rely on repurchase agreements and
securities lending to fund clients while using the same
collateral and terms to borrow themselves, often overnight. </p>
<h2>Repo Failures </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s asset reductions also affect other secured
financing for clients, Schwartz said. While the firm didn''t
release a full balance sheet with its quarterly results today,
it had $355.9 billion in secured client financing and secured
financing agreements at the end of March, which represented
about 40 percent of its assets. </p>
<p>The bank hadn''t seen a pressing need to cut back on the
low-margin secured loans before the leverage ratio and stress
test because they were viewed as a low risk way to help clients,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm''s
discussions. Clients have been understanding of Goldman Sachs''s
decision to pull back, said the person, who asked to remain
anonymous because the talks were private. </p>
<p>Recent changes in borrowing rates and so-called failures in
the $1.6 trillion-a-day repo market suggest other participants
have trimmed their matched books, the person said. Failures to
deliver Treasuries in repo trades have increased this year and
repo rates on some debt have fallen as low as negative 3
percent. </p>
<p>A lot''s been written about the repo markets, Schwartz
said on the call. Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the
matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets,
but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves,
because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple
constraints. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s ratio under the proposed supplementary
leverage ratio is 4.5 percent and will reach 5 percent as the
firm reduces certain fund stakes to comply with the Volcker
Rule, Schwartz said. </p>

It was the lumpy transactions that really made the revenue stand out. </p> <h2>FICC Results </h2> <p>Fixed-income, currency and commodity trading revenue was $2.22 billion, surpassing estimates of $1.79 billion from Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co., and $2.1 billion from Goldberg at Barclays. </p> <p>The 9 percent second-quarter drop in bond-trading revenue, excluding an accounting adjustment, beat the 24 percent decline predicted by Burnell. JPMorgan Chase  Co. today posted a 15 percent drop in fixed-income revenue. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s revenue from the equities division declined 11 percent from a year earlier to $1.63 billion, excluding accounting adjustments. That compared with Hintz''s $1.54 billion estimate and Goldberg''s $1.71 billion projection. </p> <p>While the trading performance was better than expected, it still marked the lowest first-half revenue since the financial crisis in 2008. The bank earned a 10.9 percent return on equity in the quarter, a third of the level before the financial crisis. </p> <h2>Abnormal'' Trading </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn, 53, said in May that the current environment is abnormal and features trading clients that are the least active in years. He noted that the 10-year Treasury yield maintained the smallest range in 35 years in the three months ended in May. </p> <p>If markets never move or don''t move, our clients really don''t need to transact, Cohn said. </p> <p>The firm has cut 10 percent of its fixed-income workforce since 2010 and reduced the risk-weighted assets in that business by $90 billion in the past two years. It has also relied on other businesses for growth. </p> <p>Second-quarter revenue from investment banking, the business run globally by Richard J. Gnodde, David M. Solomon and John S. Weinberg, climbed 15 percent to $1.78 billion. That compared with JPMorgan''s $1.77 billion in investment-banking revenue and Citigroup''s $1.34 billion. </p> <p>The Goldman Sachs figure included $506 million of financial-advisory revenue, including fees for takeover advice, an increase of 4 percent. Revenue from underwriting climbed to $1.28 billion in the quarter, including $730 million from debt underwriting and $545 million for equity offerings. </p> <h2>MA Advice </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs held the top spot among arrangers of global equity, equity-linked and rights offerings in the first half, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It ranked first in advising on announced mergers and acquisitions and fifth in underwriting U.S. bonds, the data show. </p> <p>Investing and Lending posted total second-quarter revenue of $2.07 billion, up from $1.42 billion a year earlier. </p> <p>The firm has about $8 billion of stakes in private-equity funds that it must cut to comply with the Volcker Rule, which limits the amount banks can invest in such funds, Schwartz said. </p> <p>Revenue from asset management, run by Timothy O''Neill and Eric Lane, rose 8 percent to $1.44 billion. Total assets under supervision climbed $59 billion during the quarter to $1.14 trillion. </p> <p> ', 'Goldman Posts Surprise Profit Gain on Trading, Deal Fees', 'By Michael J.

<p>Craig Stuvland, former president of
Common Sense Investment Management LLC, lured four Morgan
Stanley brokers with $650 million in client assets to a new firm
that supports independent financial advisers. </p>
<p>The team left Morgan Stanley''s Portland office today and
immediately set up Encompass Wealth Advisors using trading
systems, research, lawyers and office space arranged by Tru
Independence LLC, also based in Portland. </p>
<p>Stuvland''s is the latest in a growing number of firms that
help wealth advisers leave large banks and go it alone. Dynasty
Financial Partners LLC, founded in 2010, has 22 companies that
manage $21 billion using its system. HighTower Advisors LLC in
Chicago and Focus Financial Partners LLC in New York also work
to pry brokers out of big firms. </p>
<p>Tru Independence will collect a percentage of Encompass''s
management fees as payment for its services. </p>
<p>You''re not going to go from being a wire-house money
manager to an entrepreneur just by thinking about it at night,
Colin Williams, an Encompass partner and ordained Episcopal
priest, said in an interview. It takes help, he said. </p>
<p>Stuvland is betting that the team''s clients will follow it
out of Morgan Stanley. The Protocol for Broker Recruiting, an
agreement among securities firms, banks and asset managers,
prohibits wealth advisers from telling clients about a move
until after it is completed. Then, they are allowed to take with
them only names, addresses, phone numbers and e-mail addresses,
according to the protocol. </p>
<p>Typically, 95 percent of the assets follow the adviser,
Stuvland, 58, said in an interview. </p>
<h2>Attrition Down </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley increased its target for profit margins in
the firm''s wealth-management division after the  unit''s pretax
profit jumped 62 percent last year. Greg Fleming, who oversees
the brokerage, has said the attrition among financial advisers
has fallen as the firm completed its technology integration
following the purchase of Smith Barney from Citigroup Inc. </p>
<p>Until last year, Stuvland was a senior partner at Common
Sense, a fund of hedge funds in Portland. He left after founder
James Bisenius was arrested in a prostitution sting in nearby
Tigard, Oregon, in August. The firm managed $3 billion before
the arrest. At the time, Common Sense said Bisenius would remain
at the company. </p>
<p>Before joining Common Sense, Stuvland spent 16 years at
Crabbe Huson Group, a mutual fund company in Portland that
managed $5 billion when he left in 1998. His co-founder in Tru
is Eric Warlick, with whom he worked at Crabbe Huson. Before
Tru, Warlick worked at Fidelity Investments, TD Ameritrade
Holding Corp. and Charles Schwab Corp., selling their services
to brokers going independent. </p>
<p>In addition to Williams, Encompass''s other partners are
advisers Derrick Clouser, 45, Matthew Presjak, 55, Walter Urban,
63, and administrator Mary Minshall, 46. </p>
<p>While at Morgan Stanley, Clouser''s team called itself the
Encompass Group at Morgan Stanley. His is the second broker
departure in Portland this year. David Christian, Jeffrey Krum
and Brian Hefele left Merrill Lynch, a unit of Bank of America
Corp., with $700 million in March. </p>
<p>Clouser built his clientele in part by partnering with
older brokers and then taking over their books of business and
compensating them as they retire, he said. He intends to
continue that strategy as part of Tru. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) has created the
first U.S. index of its type to measure returns of
collateralized loan obligations, which are on pace for a record
year of issuance. </p>
<p>The CLOIE gauge will be available for use today, according
to Gloria Kim, the head of global index research at the bank in
New York. The measure will allow users to track the price and
total return of CLOs and their debt portions, according to the
bank. </p>
<p>JPMorgan forecasts that as much as a record $100 billion of
the funds that bundle junk-rated loans into securities with
ratings as high as AAA may be sold in the U.S. this year. There
has been $66.6 billion arranged in 2014, according to data from
the bank. CLOs helped finance some of the biggest leveraged
buyouts during the last credit boom. </p>
<p>This is the first time anyone has tried to create a
realistic index with rules that track the price performance and
total return of CLOs, Rishad Ahluwalia, global head of CLO
research at JPMorgan in London, said in a telephone interview.
We want to challenge the market to improve transparency and
while this will evolve over time, we want to help move it
forward as the market develops. </p>
<p>The CLOIE tracks floating-rate CLO securities for deals
dating back to 2004, according to information from the bank.
Additional sub-indexes are divided by ratings AAA through BB.
Pricing for the index is provided by PricingDirect Inc., an
affiliate of JPMorgan, according to the bank. </p>
<h2>Transparent Benchmark'' </h2>
<p>For a while we wanted to create a transparent benchmark
for investors that tracked returns, Ahluwalia said. </p>
<p>The AAA rated portion of CLOs raised after the credit
crisis has returned 1.07 percent this year, according to the
JPMorgan CLOIE Index. That compares with 0.31 percent for all of
2013 and 3.86 percent in 2012. </p>
<p>The CLO measure follows the introduction of the JPMorgan
Asset-Backed Securities Indices in 2013, according to the bank. </p>
<p>CLOs pool high-yield corporate loans and slice them into
securities of varying risk and return, typically from AAA
ratings down to B. The lowest portion, known as the equity
tranche, offers the highest potential returns and the greatest
risk because investors are the first to see their interest
payouts reduced when loans backing the CLO default. </p>

<p>The personal-computer industry showed signs of improvement last quarter as businesses bought enough machines to revive sales growth at Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and fuel Intel Corp. (INTC)''s biggest revenue gain in more than two years. </p> <p>Intel''s sales increased 7 percent in the quarter that ended in June, according to the average of analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Microsoft is likely to report that revenue rose 10 percent after stagnating the previous period, the projections show. The software maker may also announce job cuts related to the acquisition of Nokia Oyj''s handset unit, people with knowledge of the matter have said. </p> <p>Corporations are replacing older computers at a faster clip, spurring a 6.9 percent increase in U.S. PC unit sales last quarter, according to researcher IDC. That''s good news for Intel, Microsoft and other companies that rely on demand for PCs and have been slow to adapt to the shift toward mobile devices and software delivered via the Internet. </p> <p>A lot of the growth is in big companies, said Loren Loverde, who heads PC market research at IDC. </p> <p>Intel releases results today, while Microsoft will report earnings on July 22. </p> <p>The smartphone boom, meantime, is benefiting Apple Inc. (AAPL), the largest U.S. maker of these handheld computing devices, as well as Facebook Inc. and Twitter (TWTR) Inc., which make money from ads shown to users of mobile gadgets. Apple will probably report a 7 percent increase in sales, analysts predict. Revenue probably rose 55 percent at Facebook and may have more than doubled at Twitter, according to the projections. </p> <h2>Semiconductors Lead </h2> <p>Among industry groups in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, semiconductors are projected the post the strongest revenue growth for the second quarter, with 12 percent. That compares with 4.9 percent sales growth estimated for the broader information-technology group. </p> <p>While PC shipments declined in 2012 and 2013, some markets, such as the U.S., are seeing growth again as companies upgrade Intel-based PCs to get newer versions of Microsoft''s Windows. </p> <p>Intel, the world''s biggest chipmaker, raised its forecast for second-quarter sales last month on improving business demand for PCs, to $13.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Analysts are projecting, on average, revenue of $13.7 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Santa Clara, California-based company may report revenue of more than $14 billion for the third quarter, projections show, surpassing that threshold for only the second time ever. </p> <h2>Microsoft Jobs </h2> <p>Microsoft is projected to post sales of $22 billion for its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended in June, according to the average of analysts'' estimates. The Redmond, Washington-based software maker in recent quarters has been benefiting from increasing sales in its newer Internet-based programs for the cloud. Since much of Microsoft''s Windows and Office software is used on desktop computers, a recovery in those products could bolster results. </p> <p>A stabilizing PC market could, we believe, drive higher than expected Windows sales, said Mark Moerdler, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. who has the equivalent of a buy rating on Microsoft. </p> <p>Much of the focus will be on what Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella reveals about the financial and staffing implications of his first mission memo, issued last week. </p> <p>Microsoft is planning its biggest round of job cuts in five years, in divisions such as engineering and marketing, as well as areas of overlap with Nokia Oyj''s handset business, which it acquired this year. The restructuring -- which may be announced as soon as this week -- may end up being the biggest in Microsoft''s history, topping the 5,800 jobs cut in 2009, two of the people said. Some details are still being worked out, two of the people said. </p> <p>Nadella declined to comment about job cuts or any specific steps resulting from the note, saying he''d discuss implementation when Microsoft reports earnings. </p> <p>The cuts could involve 5 percent to 10 percent of a workforce that swelled to about 127,000 employees with the addition of Nokia, according to Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Securities who has a buy rating on Microsoft. </p> <h2>Apple Products </h2> <p>Apple, the world''s largest technology company by market value, will also report on July 22. Apple''s stock has gained 20 percent this year on investor optimism about a new batch of products on the horizon. Pent-up demand for bigger-screen iPhones will lead to record sales later this year, according to Michael Walkley, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity Group Inc. who has a buy rating on Apple. </p> <p>Analysts project Cupertino, California-based Apple will post an 8 percent rise in net income to $7.45 billion as sales climb to $37.8 billion, fueled by steady demand for the iPhone, which accounts for about half the company''s revenue. </p> <p>The rebound in PCs has coincided with a slowdown in sales of Apple''s iPads as the market becomes increasingly saturated. Bigger smartphones are also partly responsible for the drop and sales of larger iPhones could cut further into tablet purchases, Walkley said. </p> <h2>IBM Challenges </h2> <p>While Microsoft, Intel and Apple are waiting to see if consumer demand will pick up in the second half of the year, technology companies that depend on corporate spending are contending with the growth of cloud computing. Customers are increasingly storing data and software on the Web, rather than on their own hardware, curbing the need for servers and mainframes from International Business Machines Corp. and other computer makers. </p> <p>IBM, reporting on July 17, is projected to post its ninth straight quarterly sales decline, according to the average of analysts'' estimates, as it faces weaker demand for hardware and waning sales in developing countries like China. </p> <p>To meet profit targets, CEO Ginni Rometty is moving IBM''s focus to cloud services and data analytics, while offloading less profitable businesses, such as its low-end server unit. Lenovo Group Ltd. has agreed to buy that division for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S. national security review. She''s cut jobs and reduced the Armonk, New York-based company''s tax rate to help boost earnings. </p> <h2>Web Sales </h2> <p>The transition to mobile computing remains both an opportunity and a challenge for Web companies that depend on advertising to fuel sales. With ads command lower prices on mobile devices than they do on desktop computers, Google Inc. (GOOG) has is boosting the volume of ad sales. The Mountain View, California-based Web-search giant, which will report earnings on July 17, is projected to post second-quarter sales, excluding revenue passed to partners, of $12.3 billion, an 11 percent increase from a year earlier. </p> <p>In the first quarter, Google''s average price per click on an ad slipped 9 percent even as the number of hits on the promotions rose 26 percent. While Google''s search engine is a common tool for surfing the Web on desktop computers, alternative applications are attracting users on smartphones and tablets. EMarketer Inc. predicts that Google''s share of the U.S. mobile-search ad market will decline to 64 percent in 2016, from 83 percent in 2012. </p> <h2>Mobile Ads </h2> <p>U.S. ad spending on tablets and smartphones, meanwhile, will rise 83 percent this year, according to EMarketer. </p> <p>Facebook is faring better in mobile ads, and is projected to make up 22 percent of the market this year, up from 5.4 percent in 2012, according to EMarketer. Ad sales on tablets and smartphones now deliver a majority of Facebook''s ad business, after contributing almost nothing a few years ago. </p> <p>Facebook has become one of the leaders in adapting to the most important Internet industry trend, Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note. He has the equivalent of a buy rating on Menlo Park, California-based Facebook. </p> <h2>Yahoo, Alibaba </h2> <p>Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)''s report today will provide an update on its turnaround under CEO Marissa Mayer, who has been at the helm for two years. She''s seeking to expand content and ad deals following earlier efforts to attract users and better staff. </p> <p>After adjusted sales fell 1 percent last year, Yahoo said revenue expanded by 1 percent in the first quarter, and analysts on average predict the Sunnyvale, California-based company will match that gain in the second quarter. </p> <p>Still, investors will keep their focus on Yahoo''s stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the largest Chinese e-commerce company, which is set to hold an initial public offering. Yahoo is projected to bring in about $10 billion from the deal, and shareholders will look for any comments on how much of that, after taxes, will be distributed through buybacks or dividends. Yahoo also could use the money to make acquisitions. </p> <p>The outcome of the highly anticipated Alibaba IPO in August, the tax treatment of the proceeds and use of the new cash are likely to drive the stock short-term, Youssef Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, wrote of Yahoo in a note on July 11. He has a buy rating on Yahoo. </p> <p> ', 'Microsoft, Intel to Benefit as Businesses Upgrade PCs', 'By Ian King, Dina Bass and Adam Satariano', 'Jul 15, 2014 12:01 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-15/microsoft-intel-to-benefit-as-businesses-upgrade-pcs.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Commodities from iron ore to copper
and Brent crude will drop over the next five years as global
supplies climb, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which
highlighted oil''s recent losses as a sign of increased output. </p>
<p>There will be substantial declines in some metals, energy
and bulk commodities, analysts including Chief Currency
Strategist Robin Brooks wrote in a report. The period of
continued year-on-year price rises for most commodities is over,
they said in the report, which was dated yesterday. </p>
<p>Banks from Citigroup Inc. to Deutsche Bank AG have called
an end to the commodities super-cycle, when China''s surging
demand combined with supply constraints to more than double
prices in the 12 years through 2010. Raw materials rallied this
year from three annual losses as a lack of rain in Brazil lifted
coffee and a ban of ore exports from Indonesia spurred a rally
in nickel. The drop in energy prices since last month showed the
impact of higher global output, Goldman said in the report. </p>
<p>A prolonged period of elevated commodity prices has
catalysed a supply response, the analysts wrote. We do not
expect a collapse in global commodity prices. But we do
anticipate substantial declines. </p>
<p>Copper was forecast to drop to $6,600 a metric ton over
five years, while iron ore was seen at $80 a ton and Brent may
be $100 a barrel, according to Goldman. The steel-making raw
material was at $98 a dry ton in Tianjin, China, today, and
copper traded at $7,123 on the London Metal Exchange today.
Brent was 33 cents higher at $106.35 on the ICE Futures Europe. </p>
<h2>Looser Supply'' </h2>
<p>The Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials climbed
3.4 percent this year. That compares with a 0.9 percent drop in
the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index and 5.3 percent advance in the
MSCI All-Country World Index of equities. </p>
<p>Against a looser supply backdrop, commodity prices should
be much less sensitive to fluctuations in global growth than
they were, Goldman said in the report, entitled Emerging
Market Forex and the End of the Commodity Market Super-Cycle. </p>
<p>Goldman said in a January report the cycle that spurred
higher commodities prices is reversing as increased U.S. shale
oil output keeps energy prices low, and that would eventually
drive raw materials into a bear market. The new cycle would be
the opposite of the super-cycle, it said then. </p>
<p>U.S. production of crude, along with liquids separated from
natural gas, surpassed all other countries this year with daily
output exceeding 11 million barrels in the first quarter, Bank
of America Corp. said in a report July 4. Output climbed as
hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling help producers to
pull record volumes of crude out of shale formations. </p>
<h2>Oil Supplies </h2>
<p>Brent rallied to as much as $115.71 a barrel last month as
military gains in Iraq by an al-Qaeda breakaway group stoked
concern that oil supplies from the region may be disrupted.
Prices posted a third weekly loss in the period to July 11, with
Iraqi shipments unaffected and Libya moving to boost exports. </p>
<p>Less than a month has passed since geopolitical risks in
Iraq pushed up oil prices on concerns over a potential oil
supply shock, and the market seems to have absorbed the related
risks reasonably well, Goldman''s analysts wrote. The
expansion in oil supply over the past few years -- primarily
from the expansion of U.S. shale production -- has minimized the
consequences from past disruptions in Libya and Iraq. </p>
<p>Iron ore entered a bear market in March on prospects for a
glut as supplies surged. Rio Tinto Group (RIO), the world''s second-largest mining company, said today iron ore production in the
three months to June gained 11 percent, while Fortescue Metals
Group Ltd. said its shipments were 57 percent higher on year. </p>
<h2>Surplus Market </h2>
<p>We remain bearish on iron ore, and expect a surplus
market to drive the longer-term price down, the Goldman
analysts wrote in yesterday''s report. We see limited upside
for agricultural commodities over the longer run. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank said last month commodity prices will remain
subdued for years as many of the factors and fears that drove
the super-cycle have dissipated. Citigroup said in April 2013
that death bells would ring for the commodity super-cycle. </p>
<p>Our long-term commodity forecasts suggest that
fundamentals for commodity currencies will deteriorate, the
Goldman analysts wrote. Relative shifts in terms of trade
between commodity importers and exporters will be a key input to
currency determination over the coming years. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), which had
to resubmit its capital plan this year after falling below a
minimum leverage ratio, used that experience as motivation to
cut lending through repurchase agreements. </p>
<p>The bank reduced total assets by $56 billion to $860
billion as of June 30, the lowest level since 2009. Goldman
Sachs is cutting back on businesses that have low return on
assets and $25 billion of the reduction came in the firm''s
matched book repo lending, Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said yesterday in a conference call with analysts after
the New York-based firm reported second-quarter results. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is facing pressure to reduce assets as the
bank is below the 5 percent minimum ratio in the proposed
supplementary leverage ratio, which measures equity capital
compared to assets unweighted by risk. In March, it also had to
reduce the amount of capital it planned to return in the Federal
Reserve''s stress test, known as CCAR, after dropping below the 4
percent minimum of a separate requirement. </p>
<p>We identified opportunities to reduce balance sheet with
a de minimis impact to our client franchise and earnings
potential, Schwartz said. One of the significant inputs into
the process obviously was CCAR. </p>
<p>In a matched book, banks rely on repurchase agreements and
securities lending to fund clients while using the same
collateral and terms to borrow themselves, often overnight. </p>
<h2>Repo Failures </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s asset reductions also affect other secured
financing for clients, Schwartz said. While the firm didn''t
release a full balance sheet with its quarterly results
yesterday, it had $355.9 billion in secured client financing and
secured financing agreements at the end of March, which
represented about 40 percent of its assets. </p>
<p>The bank hadn''t seen a pressing need to cut back on the
low-margin secured loans before the leverage ratio and stress
test because they were viewed as a low risk way to help clients,
according to a person with direct knowledge of the firm''s
discussions. Clients have been understanding of Goldman Sachs''s
decision to pull back, said the person, who asked to remain
anonymous because the talks were private. </p>
<p>Recent changes in borrowing rates and so-called failures in
the $1.6 trillion-a-day repo market suggest other participants
have trimmed their matched books, the person said. Failures to
deliver Treasuries in repo trades have increased this year and
repo rates on some debt have fallen as low as negative 3
percent. </p>
<p>A lot''s been written about the repo markets, Schwartz
said on the call. Certainly our $25 billion reduction in the
matchbook had no marginal impact in terms of the repo markets,
but I think this will be interesting to watch how it evolves,
because as mentioned earlier, large banks have multiple
constraints. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s ratio under the proposed supplementary
leverage ratio is 4.5 percent and will reach 5 percent as the
firm reduces certain fund stakes to comply with the Volcker
Rule, Schwartz said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM)''s second-quarter sales topped analysts'' estimates, getting
Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty closer to her profit
goals. </p>
<p>While revenue fell 2 percent from a year earlier to $24.4
billion -- the ninth straight quarterly drop -- declines for
products like mainframe servers and markets such as Brazil and
China were less severe than earlier this year, IBM said today in
a statement. The result surpassed the $24.1 billion that
analysts projected on average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings rose to $4.32 a share, 1 cent
higher than analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Rometty is banking on a strong second half of the year to
hit her targets for the company''s performance even as IBM adapts
to an industrywide shift to cloud computing, an area that
expanded 50 percent in the first six months of the year from the
same period in 2013. The company reiterated its projection for
2014 adjusted earnings of at least $18 a share. </p>
<p>IBM is contending with technology customers that
increasingly seek to store data and software on cloud-computing
networks, rather than on site. That''s limited clients'' need for
IBM''s servers and mainframes, making it more difficult to reach
profit targets. The company had said before today that it
expected mainframe sales to improve into next year. </p>
<p>IBM aims to reach $20 a share in adjusted earnings by 2015,
up from $11.67 in 2010 -- a pledge instated by former Chief
Executive Officer Sam Palmisano and sustained by Rometty, who
succeeded him in 2012. </p>
<p>Shares of Armonk, New York-based IBM fell 1.4 percent in
late trading. </p>
<h2>Profit Goal </h2>
<p>To meet this year''s projections, Chief Financial Officer
Martin Schroeter said in April that IBM would be 38 percent
toward its profit goal by the end of the second quarter. That
implied second-quarter earnings this year of $4.21 to $4.39 a
share, compared with the $4.32 a share reported today. </p>
<p>Revenue from emerging markets slid 7 percent in the second
quarter, compared to an 11 percent fall in the three months
prior. Sales to Brazil, Russia, India and China also pared
losses, declining 2 percent, compared with an 11 percent drop
last quarter. </p>
<h2>Chinese Market </h2>
<p>The company has faced difficulties in the Chinese market as
tensions over cyberhacking have risen between China and the U.S.
The Chinese government is reviewing whether domestic banks''
reliance on high-end servers from IBM compromises the nation''s
financial security, people familiar with the matter said in May.
IBM said then that it wasn''t aware of any government policy
recommending against use of its servers. </p>
<p>Sales of mainframe servers, the workhorse machines
corporate customers have used for decades to run their crucial
computing tasks, decreased 1 percent -- an improvement from the
40 percent decline in the first quarter. IBM had said it
expected those sales to improve because more customers were
preparing to upgrade their mainframes. </p>
<p>As Rometty tries to navigate the company through the
industry''s changes, she has shifted IBM''s own focus to cloud
services, along with data analytics, in which the company helps
clients mine the digital information they collect to identify
trends. Rometty has also tried to offload less profitable
businesses -- like the low-end server unit that Lenovo Group
Ltd. agreed to buy for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S. national-security review. </p>
<h2>Watson Technology </h2>
<p>In a deal unveiled this week, IBM will help develop more
than 100 mobile-centric applications for businesses catered to
Apple Inc.''s iPhones and iPads to help workers do more with the
devices than check e-mail or calendars. The companies foresee
corporate customers increasingly using handheld devices for
daily workplace tasks like supply chain management and human
resources functions. </p>
<p>Separately, IBM is spending more than $1 billion to create
a new group around its Watson technology, which lets customers
use plain English to analyze large troves of data. To remake its
cloud business, Rometty bought provider SoftLayer Technologies
Inc. in 2013 for $2 billion and this year committed an
additional $1.2 billion to bolster its data centers and
offerings. </p>
<p>Their success is going to be tied to the cloud over the
next five to 10 years, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR
Capital Markets. It''s more of a strategic focus of the
company. </p>
<h2>Cloud Growth </h2>
<p>Cloud offerings delivered as a service are now at an annual
run rate of $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion as of the
first quarter. That''s still a fraction of IBM''s total $100
billion in revenue last year. </p>
<p>As it reshapes itself, IBM will still have to rely on its
older global business services and software units, which
together make up about three-quarters of sales. To boost
earnings in the meantime, Rometty has also sold debt to fund
share buybacks, laid off workers and slashed the company''s tax
rate. </p>
<p>IBM ended the quarter with $9.7 billion in cash on hand,
even with the end of March, after spending $1.1 billion on
dividends and $3.7 billion on share buybacks. </p>
<p>Net income climbed to $4.1 billion, or $4.12 a share, from
$3.2 billion, or $2.91 a share, a year earlier. </p>

<p>Visa Inc. (V) and MasterCard Inc. (MA) lost
their bid to dismiss more than 30 lawsuits by retailers seeking
potentially billions of dollars in damages over fees for
processing transactions. </p>
<p>Merchants including Target Corp. (TGT) and Macy''s Inc. (M) pursued
their cases after dropping out of an earlier $5.7 billion
settlement over the charges known as swipe fees. Today, a
federal judge in Brooklyn, New York, refused to throw out those
lawsuits. He also rejected Visa''s request to dismiss a similar
lawsuit filed by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) seeking at least $5
billion in damages. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge John Gleeson said his decision was in
large part driven by the requirement that I accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true because the cases were in
the early stages of litigation. It isn''t a ruling on the merits
of the complaints. </p>
<p>Gleeson in December approved the card companies'' settlement
with merchants nationwide following years of antitrust
litigation over the fees. </p>
<p>Dozens of large retailers appealed the approval of the
accord. Many also dropped out of the deal and filed their own
lawsuits, contending it wasn''t enough compensation for the
hundreds of billions of dollars in fees paid. </p>
<h2>Market Power'' </h2>
<p>In a revised complaint filed this month, Target and Macy''s
said the card companies have obtained and maintained market
power in the market for merchant acceptance of credit cards
causing merchants to pay excessive interchange fees. </p>
<p>Wal-Mart alleged in its complaint that Visa''s monopoly
power has enabled it to dictate price and inhibit competition.
The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer announced in April that
MasterCard will handle transactions for store-branded credit
cards. MasterCard isn''t named in Wal-Mart''s swipe-fee complaint. </p>
<p>Visa and MasterCard argued that the merchants'' claims for
damages should be barred by legal releases in an earlier
settlement in 2003. They also said the claims should be thrown
out because the merchants don''t directly pay fees to banks that
issue Visa and MasterCard branded cards. The fees are deducted
from payments merchants receive after processing. </p>
<p>Separately, Gleeson also denied requests by Wal-Mart and
another group of merchants to dismiss lawsuits filed against
them by the card firms seeking to stop their litigation over the
fees in its tracks. The request the card firms are making in
those cases is properly invoked, Gleeson said. </p>
<h2>Tactical Advantage'' </h2>
<p>We''re not seeking an unfair tactical advantage, we''re
seeking finality, said Michael Shuster, a lawyer for Visa,
during the hearing today. </p>

<p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) reported a ninth straight quarter of declining sales as demand fell for hardware and computer services, underscoring the urgency of its plan to get more revenue from newer businesses like cloud computing. </p> <p>Second-quarter revenue dropped 2 percent from a year earlier to $24.4 billion, compared with the $24.1 billion that analysts projected on average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted earnings rose to $4.32 a share, 1 cent higher than analysts'' estimates, boosted by cost-cutting and share buybacks. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer Ginni Rometty is betting that businesses want to store their data and software applications remotely, in the cloud, and they need IBM to help mine the piles of data they''re accumulating. She''s preaching patience to investors, plying them with share repurchases to persuade them to wait for an inflection point where the new technology can propel the company back in the right direction. </p> <p>It''s become more of a show-me story, Bill Kreher, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co., said. It leaves investors to gauge how much faith they have in IBM''s ability to execute. At some point, investors look at the quality of earnings and would like to see business momentum at its core franchises. </p> <h2>Cloud Growth </h2> <p>The company maintained its forecasts for $18 a share in adjusted earnings this year and $20 a share next year. Part of that expansion is predicated on the growth of cloud computing sales, which grew 50 percent in the first six months of the year from the same period in 2013. </p> <p>Cloud offerings delivered as a service are now at an annual run rate of $2.8 billion, compared with $2.3 billion as of the first quarter. That''s still a fraction of IBM''s total $100 billion in revenue last year. </p> <p>There were signs of improvement in areas where IBM had been struggling. Sales to Brazil, Russia, India and China pared losses, declining 2 percent, compared with an 11 percent drop last quarter. </p> <p>Sales of mainframe servers, the workhorse machines corporate customers have used for decades to run their crucial computing tasks, decreased 1 percent -- an improvement from the 40 percent decline in the first quarter. </p> <p>Shares of Armonk, New York-based IBM were little changed at $192.50 at the close in New York. Global services sales, which typically make up more than half of IBM''s business, slid 1 percent to $13.9 billion. Software revenue was up 1 percent from a year earlier to $6.5 billion, a slowdown from 2 percent growth in the prior quarter. And even with the improvement in the mainframe business, total hardware sales dropped 11 percent. </p> <h2>Licensing Model </h2> <p>When companies move to cloud computing, software and data can be stored on remote servers, instead of installed on premise. In the past, many software offerings were sold to customers in a licensing model, where clients pay upfront for the right to use the tools for an allotted amount of time. With cloud-based services, many offerings are pay-as-you-use, giving customers the opportunity to be more efficient and lower the total payments. </p> <p>While IBM''s cloud business is growing, the fear is that it could take revenue away from its traditional sales model, said Amit Daryanani, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. </p> <p>How much of that is new wins and how much is cannibalistic? You don''t know how much of that is coming from cannibalizing their own software versus net new stuff, he said. </p> <p>Services revenue, meanwhile, has been hurt as customers put pressure on IBM to lower its fees. </p> <h2>Pricing Pressure'' </h2> <p>Our performance continues to reflect pricing pressure and client contract renegotiations, as well as a reduction in elective projects, IBM Chief Financial Officer Martin Schroeter said about the company''s outsourcing business on the earnings conference call. </p> <p>IBM''s contract signings for services -- an indicator of expected future revenue -- fell 33 percent from a year earlier to $11 billion, driven by declines in new business for consulting and outsourcing. That falls short of the 6.2 percent gain from rival Accenture Plc. </p> <p>The fall in contract signings could drag on IBM''s services revenue in the second half of the year, said Anurag Rana, an analyst for Bloomberg Industries. </p> <p>Before results were released yesterday, IBM shares had climbed 2.6 percent this year, supported by the company''s repurchases, which brought the number of shares in circulation under 1 billion at the end of June -- the first time they''ve been below that threshold at the close of a quarter since at least 1999. </p> <h2>More Buybacks </h2> <p>IBM ended the quarter with $9.7 billion in cash on hand, little changed from the end of March, after spending $1.1 billion on dividends and $3.7 billion on share buybacks. </p> <p>Net income climbed to $4.1 billion, or $4.12 a share, from $3.2 billion, or $2.91 a share, a year earlier. </p> <p>As Rometty tries to shift IBM''s own focus to cloud services and data analytics, she has also tried to offload less profitable businesses -- like the low-end server unit that Lenovo Group Ltd. agreed to buy for $2.3 billion, pending a U.S. national-security review. </p> <h2>Apple Deal </h2> <p>In a deal unveiled this week, IBM will help develop more than 100 mobile-centric applications for businesses catered to Apple Inc.''s iPhones and iPads to help workers do more with the devices than check e-mail or calendars. The companies foresee corporate customers increasingly using handheld devices for daily workplace tasks like supply chain management and human resources functions. </p> <p>Separately, IBM is spending more than $1 billion to create a new group around its Watson technology, which lets customers use plain English to analyze large troves of data. To remake its cloud business, Rometty bought SoftLayer Technologies Inc. in 2013 for $2 billion and this year committed an additional $1.2 billion to bolster its data centers and offerings. </p> <p>Their success is going to be tied to the cloud over the next five to 10 years, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets. It''s more of a strategic focus of the company. </p> <p> ', 'IBM''s Nine-Quarter Sales Slump Overshadows Cloud Growth', 'By Alex Barinka', 'Jul 18, 2014  4:23 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-18/ibm-s-nine-quarter-sales-slump-overshadows-cloud-growth.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>The largest job cuts in Microsoft Corp.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said it will
eliminate as many as 18,000 jobs, the largest round of cuts in
its history, as Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella integrates
Nokia Oyj''s handset unit and slims down the software maker. </p>
<p>The restructuring, amounting to about 14 percent of its
workforce, includes 12,500 Nokia factory and professional
positions -- half the number of employees added in the
acquisition. At Microsoft, cuts will be in sales, marketing and
engineering. The reductions are expected to be completed by June
30, 2015, and will result in a pretax charge of $1.1 billion to
$1.6 billion, Microsoft said in a statement yesterday. </p>
<p>Nadella, who took over from Steve Ballmer in February, is
retooling the company''s structure as it seeks to compete with
nimbler rivals offering mobile and Internet-based software and
services. He''s also working to wring a promised $600 million in
annual savings from Microsoft''s Nokia deal, which added 25,000
workers in April, bringing the total to about 127,100. </p>
<p>Microsoft needs to be a leaner tech giant over the coming
years in order to strike the right balance of growth and
profitability around its cloud and mobile endeavors, said
Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co. who rates
Microsoft stock the equivalent of a buy. The cuts are roughly
twice as big as Wall Street expected, Ives said in a note. </p>
<p>The shares rose 1 percent to $44.53 at yesterday''s close in
New York. They have advanced 19 percent this year. </p>
<h2>Streamline Management </h2>
<p>The company started with 13,000 cuts yesterday, and the
majority of eliminated workers will be notified in the next six
months, Nadella said in an e-mail to employees. Microsoft will
also have fewer layers of management and will make changes to
its outside vendor staff, he said. </p>
<p>The first step to building the right organization for our
ambitions is to realign our workforce, he wrote. </p>
<p>Last week, in his first mission statement, Nadella said the
Redmond, Washington-based software maker needs to become more
focused and efficient and requires changes to its engineering
teams. He pledged updates on the new plans later this month, and
said he would provide more details when the company reports
earnings on July 22. </p>
<p>Microsoft investors are likely to view the cuts as a
positive sign, illustrating that Nadella is trying to get costs
and headcount under control and that he understands the
challenges facing Microsoft, Ives said. </p>
<h2>Earnings Growth </h2>
<p>We view this as another step in the right direction from
the Street''s perspective, he said in an interview. Nadella
is not wearing rose-colored glasses. </p>
<p>The reductions may add 30 cents a share to Microsoft''s
profit in fiscal 2016, estimated Kirk Materne, an analyst at
Evercore Partners Inc., who rates Microsoft the equivalent of a
buy. </p>
<p>The company has needed to cut costs. Analysts on average
estimate that profit before certain items increased 1 percent in
the fiscal year that ended last month, after a decline in fiscal
2013 and little growth the prior year. </p>
<p>Given the stock''s gains in recent months on optimism about
Nadella''s plans, it''s time for the company to post earnings
growth that validates that enthusiasm, said Brent Thill, an
analyst at UBS AG, who recommends buying the stock. Microsoft
spends far more on product development and research than rivals
such as Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Google Inc. (GOOG) and gets a smaller return for
that investment, he said. </p>
<p>They have been spending on a lot of things that haven''t
come to fruition, he said. The Nadella era will be about
putting more money on bigger hits and not sprinkling a little
everywhere. </p>
<h2>Mobile Focus </h2>
<p>In appearances at company and technology events since he
took the helm, Nadella has reiterated that the company''s
priorities are mobile and cloud products, as he works to shift
Microsoft away from its longtime core business of software for
personal computers. Nadella has signaled a desire to produce
software for rival operating systems, like Apple''s iOS and
Google''s Android, and has shuffled management in areas like
marketing, business development and the Xbox game console. </p>
<p>While Microsoft has implemented smaller, intermittent job
cuts in individual businesses -- for example, trimming a few
hundred positions in advertising sales and marketing in 2012,
and some marketing jobs across the company earlier that same
year -- the 39-year-old company has only undertaken a
companywide restructuring affecting thousands of workers once
before, in 2009, at the start of the recession. Over the course
of that year, the company cut 5,800 jobs, or about 5 percent of
its workforce at the time. </p>
<h2>Cost Savings </h2>
<p>When Microsoft agreed to acquire Nokia''s device unit in
September, the software maker pledged $600 million in yearly
cost savings in the 18 months after the deal closed. While this
week''s layoffs are the company''s biggest ever, excluding the
12,500 positions being eliminated at Nokia, the 5,500 job cuts
at Microsoft are smaller than those in 2009. </p>
<p>Microsoft''s engineering teams have traditionally been split
between program managers, developers and testers. Now, with new
cloud-based methods of building software, it often makes sense
to have the developers test and fix bugs instead of a separate
team of testers, Nadella said in an interview last week after
releasing his memo. </p>
<h2>Nokia Shift </h2>
<p>The Nokia business, now part of Microsoft''s devices group,
will also undergo some product changes as Microsoft ends output
of phones running Google''s Android operating system and targets
the more affordable smartphone segments, wrote devices group
chief Stephen Elop, formerly the CEO of Nokia, in an e-mail
posted on Microsoft''s site. </p>
<p>Microsoft will switch the Nokia X, which uses Android, to
the Windows Phone operating system to broaden its products in
the cheaper smartphone category. It will also align future high-end smartphone releases with major products from Windows and
Microsoft''s applications team, Elop said. </p>
<p>The company will also combine what had been two units at
Nokia -- Smart Devices and Mobile Phones -- into one under
executive Jo Harlow. Phone engineering will be based in Salo,
Finland, for high-end devices, and Tampere, Finland, for cheaper
ones. Engineering work in Oulu, Finland, will be scaled down. </p>
<p>Engineering in Beijing and San Diego will see cuts, and
phone production will be focused mainly in Hanoi. Nokia will
shift repair and manufacturing operations from Hungary. The cuts
may affect 1,100 employees in Finland and about 1,800 in
Hungary, Microsoft said. </p>
<p>Elop''s memo was derided by publications from New York
magazine to the Guardian, which titled a blog How not to cut
12,500 jobs, for starting with the greeting Hello There,
and failing to get to the job cuts until the 11th paragraph of
14. </p>
<h2>TV Programming </h2>
<p>In the Xbox business, the company will shut down an
ambitious effort to create original television programming, just
one month after the debut of its first show. The Xbox
Entertainment Studio will close in coming months, Xbox chief
Phil Spencer said in an e-mail to employees. </p>
<p>Nancy Tellem, the ex-CBS executive brought in to lead the
effort two years ago, will stay on with some of her team to
complete shows in production, such as a Halo series, the
company said. Tellem was hired by former CEO Ballmer to draw
more entertainment consumers to Xbox by getting into original
programming, like Amazon.com Inc. and Netflix Inc. </p>
<p>As the technology industry increasingly shifts toward
mobile computing and cloud-based services, other technology
companies have also sought to keep up by streamlining and firing
workers. Hewlett-Packard Co. in May disclosed 16,000 more job
cuts after reporting an 11th straight quarter of declining
sales, on top of 34,000 in staff reductions already announced.
International Business Machines Corp. also started dismissing
workers earlier this year as part of a $1 billion restructuring
to help it adapt to the industry''s changes. </p>

<p>Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), the behemoths of the U.S. mortgage market, are surrendering more business to nonbank lenders. </p> <p>The nation''s two largest originators made 21 percent of home loans in the second quarter, the smallest combined share in more than a decade, down from 30 percent a year ago, according to regulatory filings. They''re ceding ground to companies like Quicken Loans Inc., which grabbed the No. 3 spot from Bank of America Corp. in the first quarter, and LoanDepot.com LLC, whose share surged more than three-fold in the following period. </p> <p>Big banks are exercising caution to avoid losses if their home loans sour and government-controlled Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac force them to repurchase the mortgages. This week, JPMorgan head Jamie Dimon escalated the buyback issue between lenders and the government, saying he questioned whether his bank should end its decades-old relationship with the Federal Housing Administration, a last resort for lower-income Americans seeking mortgages. Nonbank lenders, hungry for mortgages to service, are expanding rapidly to fill the void left by banks. </p> <p>Mortgage banking may just be a smaller players'' game now, said Paul Miller, a banking analyst at FBR Capital Markets Corp. in Arlington, Virginia. They''re able to be more flexible. </p> <p>JPMorgan, the No. 2 U.S. mortgage lender, reported this week that its second-quarter originations fell 66 percent to $16.8 billion, the lowest quarterly result since at least 2005, compared with the year-ago period. The New York-based bank''s share of the market dropped to 5.4 percent in the second quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, from 8.1 percent in the first period. JPMorgan''s market share averaged 10 percent in the prior five years. </p> <h2>JPMorgan Threat </h2> <p>Much of the decline came from a falloff in FHA lending, Dimon said on the bank''s call with analysts. Banks have been in a dispute with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and FHA over rules that force the firms to repurchase mortgages that go bad. </p> <p>Our FHA volume was way down and we studied FHA and based upon the lawsuits and the premiums and stuff like that we''ve lost a tremendous sum of money in FHA, Dimon said. The real question to me is should we be in the FHA business at all and we''re still struggling with that. </p> <p>JPMorgan''s loss of market share is part of its long-term plan to pull back from the mortgage business and focus on making loans to the most creditworthy borrowers, said Miller. </p> <h2>Wells Drops </h2> <p>They''re making a strategic decision to shrink, Miller said. They don''t want to do marginal loans they could end up paying the piper on. They''re saying we paid a lot of money and we''re done with it. </p> <p>Wells Fargo last week reported that originations fell 58 percent to $47 billion from a year earlier, the lowest second-quarter result in more than a decade. The San Francisco-based bank''s market share declined to 15.2 percent in the second quarter, based on data compiled by Bloomberg, from 15.9 percent in the first period. The bank''s share averaged 23 percent in the prior five years. </p> <p>Wells Fargo Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf said on a conference call last week that the bank wants to lend to more borrowers even if they don''t have pristine credit. He said Wells Fargo just needs clarity about what triggers a buyback demand. </p> <p>Bank executives are having meetings with Melvin L. Watt, the director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, about the rules, Stumpf said. FHFA oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, known as government-sponsored enterprises. Earlier this year, Watt introduced a sunset provision so lenders are not responsible in some cases if loans go sour after three years. </p> <h2>LoanDepot Advantage </h2> <p>You have low rates on one side encouraging borrowing and you have put-backs from the GSEs on the other side that make lenders less willing to lend money, Stumpf said. The goal is to get more credit appropriately to borrowers who want to own homes and who can afford homes. </p> <p>Nonbank lenders like LoanDepot.com that started after the housing crash in 2007 or didn''t make subprime loans are not burdened with the buyback issue, said Anthony Hsieh, chief executive officer of LoanDepot.com. The online lender, which is backed by private-equity firm Parthenon Capital Partners, began in 2010 in compliance with new mortgage regulations compared with established banks that had to adapt to the changes, Hsieh said. </p> <p>We had a clean canvas to build our organization post crisis in a new world of much heavier regulatory scrutiny, said Hsieh, a former president of LendingTree.com. The biggest banks have a much smaller footprint than before and that creates a lot of opportunity for nonbank lenders. </p> <h2>Share Soars </h2> <p>LoanDepot.com, which collects payments on the majority of mortgages it makes, originated $3 billion in loans in the second quarter, a 58 percent jump from a year earlier, according to Hsieh. The Foothill Ranch, California-based firm''s market share rose more than threefold to 1.1 percent in the second period, Hsieh said. </p> <p>Hsieh said the firm is selling products that are compliant with qualified mortgage guidelines, such as debt-to-income ratios below 43 percent. The company will soon announce an offering for loans without government backing to help sustain its rapid growth, he said. </p> <p>Stonegate Mortgage Corp. (SGM), which was founded by Jim Cutillo and his wife Barbara in 2005, survived the subprime meltdown by avoiding these risky loans. The Indianapolis-based firm has been ratcheting up its market share by expanding to states such as California and Virginia, said Cutillo, who was a director for GMAC Residential Funding. </p> <h2>Wholesale Business </h2> <p>The lender and servicer, whose biggest investor is private-equity firm Long Ridge Equity Partners, last year hired a team from Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. to expand its wholesale business -- lending through mortgage brokers. </p> <p>The company''s mortgage origination volume, which includes FHA loans, jumped 27 percent to $2.4 billion in the first quarter compared with a year earlier. Cutillo plans to build the firm''s business in jumbo loans in places like Washington with more expensive real estate. </p> <p>If all the big players were deconsolidating and some small and mid-sized players didn''t have enough capital to build size and scale in any industry, wouldn''t you think there would be a huge opportunity? Cutillo said. We''re arbitraging that and filling a big void the banks have left. </p> <h2>Refinance Plunge </h2> <p>Plaza Home Mortgage Inc. mostly provides wholesale lending -- a business that banks like Wells Fargo exited. Plaza Home Mortgage has been able to increase its originations by working with brokers who focus on purchases. </p> <p>That''s paid off as refinancing has waned, said Kevin Parra, Plaza''s co-founder. Refinancing, a traditional mainstay for banks, fell in April to the lowest level since 2008, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. </p> <p>The San Diego-based firm benefits from established relationships with mortgage brokers who in turn work with local realtors, Parra said. </p> <p>As the market has moved from refis to purchases, service becomes a bigger factor, and brokers will use us because they know us and trust we will get them to close on time, said Parra. </p> <p>Plaza Home originated $1 billion in mortgages for purchases in the second quarter compared with $780 million a year earlier, and increased its total market share to 0.6 percent, said Parra. </p> <p>The market-share gain of small lenders is increasing financial risks for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to a report yesterday from the FHFA''s Office of Inspector General. The companies, which were on the brink of insolvency in 2008 and seized by the government, buy mortgages from lenders and package them into securities that are sold to investors. </p> <h2>Limited Capacity'' </h2> <p>Some smaller lenders and nonbank mortgage companies have limited financial capacity, the report said. If loans later prove to have errors in them, the companies may lack the ability to make good on buyback demands, resulting in losses for taxpayers, it said. </p> <p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have recovered almost $100 billion from lenders stemming from buyback demands since the 2008 financial crisis, the report said. </p> <p>Banks may focus more on mortgage lending once there''s more clarity around buybacks and the housing recovery regains momentum, said Hsieh of LoanDepot.com. </p> <p>Wells will always be the 800 pound gorilla, but the nonbank upstarts will make headway and some will be here to stay, said FBR''s Miller. </p> <p> ', 'JPMorgan in Rules Dispute Cedes Loan Share to Nonbanks', 'By Kathleen M.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) reported profit that fell short of estimates in the fiscal fourth quarter, weighed down by the acquisition of Nokia Oyj''s handset unit, where about 12,500 jobs will be cut. </p> <p>Net income in the period that ended June 30 was $4.61 billion, or 55 cents a share, including adjustments related to Nokia, the company said in a statement today. Analysts were predicting, on average, profit of 60 cents a share, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Excluding the Nokia-related items and taxes, profit would have been 66 cents a share, beating the average prediction for 64 cents. </p> <p>Chief Executive Officer Satya Nadella, who took over in February, is struggling to cut costs at Nokia after Microsoft completed its 5.44 billion euro ($7.33 billion) acquisition of the mobile-phone operations in April. Microsoft''s main software business topped estimates, owing to strength in Internet-based cloud programs and corporate computer applications. </p> <p>Related: Microsoft CEO, Seeking Growth, Tells Managers: Step It Up</p><p>Nokia continues to be the black cloud over Microsoft, said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets  Co. who has the equivalent of a buy rating on the stock. This is the first quarter before the cost cuts. That''s why Nadella took the ax out. </p> <p>The shares of Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft rose 1.3 percent in extended trading following the report. They were little changed at $44.83 at the close in New York. The stock climbed 1.7 percent last quarter, compared with a 4.7 percent increase in the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index. </p> <h2>Nokia Challenge </h2> <p>The Nokia numbers underscore the challenges facing Nadella and his lieutenants as they seek to halt the decline of the handset business and turn it into an asset that can aid Microsoft''s mobile efforts. </p> <p>Satya has taken a number of exciting steps both to reposition the company and to energize it, Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Amy Hood said in an interview. </p> <p>Nadella will cut more costs and prioritize core areas, he said on a conference call today. He also pledged to make the money-losing Bing search engine profitable by fiscal 2016. Nadella said MSN websites, retail stores and hardware production are now considered supporting efforts, where costs will be watched carefully. Hood said Microsoft''s new phone unit, formerly the Nokia handset business, is on track to break even on an operating basis in 2016 as well. </p> <p>Microsoft plans to cut operating costs for the current fiscal year to $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion, Hood said. </p> <h2>Cloud, Enterprise </h2> <p>At the same time, cloud and enterprise software performed well, with revenue doubling for the Web-based versions of Office and Microsoft''s Azure cloud-based service for hosting applications. Commercial cloud products now have an annual run-rate of $4.4 billion, Hood said. Corporate demand for personal computers helped shore up sales of Office and Windows to businesses, with companies signing multiyear licensing deals. </p> <p>Cloud looked strong -- core PC seemed to get an uplift from improving PC demand, Ives said. Office 365 and Azure continue to be pillars of strength. I would call this in-line results. </p> <p>Unearned revenue, which comes from sales of multiyear deals that will be recognized in the future, was $25.2 billion for the quarter, compared with the $24.5 billion average analyst projection, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <h2>Restructuring Efforts </h2> <p>In addition to a plan to cut a total of 18,000 jobs as the company integrates Nokia, Nadella has discontinued unpromising products and placed more emphasis on cloud-computing software delivered via the Web. The restructuring will result in $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion in charges in the current fiscal year, according to Microsoft. </p> <p>The company as a whole is galvanized around Satya''s strategy, Hood said. </p> <p>Microsoft is also seeing signs of improvement in the PC market, which drives sales of Windows and Office software. PC shipments declined 1.7 percent in the second quarter, a smaller drop than estimated as businesses upgraded their equipment. Demand in the U.S., Europe and Canada also helped to make up for a drop in Asia, researcher IDC said earlier this month. </p> <p>Intel Corp. also released results last week that topped analysts'' projections. Microsoft''s Hood said the company is seeing similar trends to those reported by Intel. </p> <p>The strength in the enterprise and the comments on the refresh would seem to bode well for Microsoft continuing to have uptake with enterprise sales, said Michael Shinnick, a fund manager at South Bend, Indiana-based Wasatch Advisors Inc., which has $19 billion under management. </p> <p> ', 'Microsoft''s Quarterly Profit Hurt by Nokia Acquisition', 'By Dina Bass', 'Jul 22, 2014  6:52 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-22/microsoft-revenue-misses-estimates-on-weak-demand-from-consumers.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) won a role on what
may become Europe''s largest initial public offering this year,
the sale of Spanish airport operator Aena Aeropuertos SA, after
offering to charge the lowest fees among global banks, said
three people with knowledge of the matter. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley offered to charge 0.19 percent of the amount
raised in the IPO in fees, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because they weren''t authorized to speak publicly.
Spain''s government said today it will sell 49 percent of Aena,
including 21 percent to so-called anchor investors. The IPO may
value Aena at over 5 billion euros ($6.7 billion), the people
said. </p>
<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
which also won roles after presentations this week, offered to
charge fees of 0.24 percent and 0.45 percent respectively, the
people said. The advisers typically have to adjust their fees
based on the lowest winning bid. </p>
<p>Banks often offer lower fees on IPOs of large state assets
because they bring league table credit and the chance of repeat
business from companies once they are public. Aena''s IPO could
raise about 2.5 billion euros if the government sells 49
percent, making it the largest in Europe this year. </p>
<p>Banks managing the 2 billion-pound ($3.4 billion) sale of
state-run postal service Royal Mail Plc (RMG) in October were paid 0.7
percent in fees, according to data compiled by Freeman  Co., a
New York-based consulting firm. The 866 million-euro IPO of
Belgium''s postal operator bpost SA netted sale managers 1.5
percent in fees in June last year. Banks earned about 3 percent
on average in total IPO fees in Europe in 2013, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Goldman
Sachs declined to comment. </p>
<p>Spain''s government said 70 percent of the banks'' grading
would be based on their fee bid and 30 percent would be based on
their expertise, according to a company spokeswoman for Aena. </p>
<p>Listings in Spain have raised over $6 billion this year,
the most since 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show, as

about $14.6 million by a London judge in a dispute with a
Singapore-based investor over shares it held as collateral on a

<p>James Hong Gee Ho, former executive director of Blumont
Group Ltd. (BLUM), who''d initially sued Goldman Sachs for failing to
get the best price on his shares after a margin call, was
ordered to pay the money by Judge David Mackie today. The amount
included principal and interest on the loan. </p>

payment disputes with Goldman Sachs after shares of Blumont,
Asiasons Capital Ltd. (ACAP) and LionGold Corp. (LIGO) plunged during a stock
rout in October. </p>

team notified a law firm that had represented him that Goldman
would ask to have the case dismissed, said Rebecca Loveridge, a
lawyer representing the bank. </p>
<p>The law firm that had represented Hong, Wiggin LLP, didn''t
return a telephone message and Hong didn''t respond to an e-mail
sent to Blumont''s office in Singapore. </p>
<p>Loveridge said Hong''s lawsuit was a tactic to delay
paying the money he owed. She said Hong hadn''t shown any
interest in continuing the claim and a question had arisen about
whether Wiggin continued to represent him. His original suit
against the bank said Goldman Sachs failed to obtain the best
price for his shares, Loveridge said. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs vigorously denied those claims, Loveridge
said. There was never any dispute that he entered into that
agreement. </p>
<p>The judge declined to order Hong to make a payment toward
an estimated 1 million pounds ($1.7 million) in fees and costs
that Loveridge had requested because he said Goldman Sachs''s
lawyers hadn''t presented evidence. </p>

court to make an order of a million pounds? There''s been no

Norway to compensate for 11 billion cubic meters a year of
production cuts from the Dutch Groningen gas field. </p>
<p>Front-month gas on the U.K.''s National Balancing Point fell
46 percent this year to 37.15 pence a therm as Europe''s mildest
winter in seven years left high inventories, according to broker
data compiled by Bloomberg. Prices may fall to average 33 pence
in the next three months in order for coal to gas switching to
balance the market, Goldman forecasts. </p>
<p>Prices may decline further if balancing the market requires
power plants in northwest Europe to also switch to gas, the bank
said. That could happen if U.K. generators don''t switch to using
gas quickly enough or due to strong growth in renewables.
Prices would need to drop below 30 pence a therm before gas-fired units in northwest Europe could compete with coal on a
large scale. </p>
<h2>Price Forecasts </h2>
<p>U.K. gas prices will probably average 34.2 pence in the
third quarter, which will be sufficient to correct its storage
overhang, Goldman said. While the usage of gas at the expense
of coal in Germany starts to be profitable at 32 pence, prices
need to fall further to kick-start this demand in the short
run, according to the report. </p>
<p>Northwest European inventories have an excess of 4 billion
cubic meters (142 billion cubic feet) of gas over 2012 levels,
the bank said. Without coal-to-gas switching or an escalation in
tensions between Russia and Ukraine the surplus will be 2.7
billion cubic meters above 2012 levels at the end of October, it
said. It would take 24 million cubic meters a day of incremental
demand through October to alleviate the glut. </p>
<p>The U.K. has spare gas-fired power capacity to increase
demand for the fuel by 40 million cubic meters a day, according
to the report. Switching to gas for European power generation to
deplete excess gas inventories would result in thermal coal
demand loss of about 5 million metric tons, which could add
further pressure on prices already trading near a multiyear
low, the bank said. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) is putting its Watson natural-language technology to the
test with consumers on a wide scale for the first time. </p>
<p>On the website of financial-services firm USAA, military
customers will be able to use IBM''s tool to ask questions and
seek advice on transitioning back to civilian life. Famous for
being a Jeopardy! game-show champion, Watson analyzes
information and can answer questions in conversational English. </p>
<p>The USAA deal gives IBM its biggest test yet of whether
consumers will embrace Watson, a technology that''s become a
bigger focus of the company''s investments and marketing. IBM
sees data analytics tools like Watson as a source of growth to
counter declining demand for hardware that has led to nine
straight quarters of falling sales. </p>
<p>Traditional methods of providing advice and information
aren''t scaling, John Gordon, vice president of IBM''s Watson
Group, said in an interview. This is a fundamentally different
approach. </p>
<p>While Watson has previously been available to consumers in
some limited tests, such as a mobile application for home cooks,
this is the first service to be widely available, Gordon said. </p>
<p>IBM and USAA, based in San Antonio, worked for about nine
months to develop the tool to answer questions specific to
customers leaving the military, like whether to seek out
veteran''s benefits or how to buy a home, said Eric Engquist,
assistant vice president of military transitions at USAA. More
than 150,000 military members transfer to civilian life a year,
Engquist said. </p>
<h2>Behavior Change </h2>
<p>While persuading customers to turn to a technology for life
coaching will certainly require a change in behavior, the
tool could give customized, 24-hour access that wasn''t possible
with USAA''s website or its employees, Engquist said. It could
also be a test for expanding Watson''s use more broadly at USAA. </p>
<p>As sluggish demand for computer servers has hurt sales, IBM
has focused on more profitable, faster-growing areas such as
data analytics and cloud computing while selling hardware
businesses. </p>
<p>Last year, IBM boosted its expected sales from the data-analysis business to $20 billion in 2015, compared with an
earlier forecast of $16 billion. The company said in January
that it will spend $1 billion to create a new division around
Watson to help spur growth. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s private-equity arm and Abu Dhabi Investment Authority are considering
joining Gavea Investimentos Ltda. in a bid for Brazilian
medical-services company Fleury SA (FLRY3), people with knowledge of the
matter said. </p>
<p>In joining Gavea, the two investors would be wading into a
bid for a company that has been on the market for more than six
months. Fleury, which has a market value of about 2.6 billion
reais ($1.2 billion), said in March that it was in exclusive
talks with Gavea. </p>
<p>The deal has been held up, as Gavea''s partners in Instituto
Hermes Pardini Ltda. -- a closely held medical lab company that
would be merged with Fleury -- have sought a greater role in the
combined company, three people said, asking not to be identified
discussing private information. It''s still possible that a deal
won''t be reached, the people said. </p>
<p>Rising incomes in Latin America''s most populous country
mean more people are leaving the public health system in favor
of private care. That''s prompting investors to seek ways to
profit from the growing pool of health-care consumers, spurring
deals including the takeover of Amil Participacoes SA by
UnitedHealth Group Inc. last year. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Fleury, Gavea, Goldman Sachs, ADIA and Hermes
Pardini declined to comment. Gavea, JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s
Brazil private-equity and hedge-fund unit, owns a 30 percent
stake in Hermes Pardini. </p>
<p>Shares of Sao Paulo-based Fleury have retreated 10 percent
this year as the deal has dragged on. Amid the negotiations,
Fleury also posted a net loss in the fourth quarter and missed
sales estimates, further dragging on the stock. </p>
<h2>Pardini Family </h2>
<p>The Pardini family, which controls Hermes Pardini, wants a
higher valuation for their company and a greater role in running
the combined business, the people said. Aurea Pardini, a member
of the family, recently retained financial adviser Greenhill 
Co., while other Pardinis are working with Moelis  Co. to
negotiate those points, the person said. </p>
<p>The family stake at Hermes Pardini could be valued at 1.5
billion reais, one person said. </p>
<p>Banco Itau BBA SA is lining up a four-bank syndicated loan
for Gavea, Goldman and ADIA, one person said. JPMorgan Chase 
Co. is advising Core Participaes SA, the holding company that
controls Fleury. Any acquirer of Fleury would have to make an
offer to buy out the minority shareholders'' stakes at the same
price paid to the controlling stakeholders. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for Itau, Greenhill, and Moelis declined to
comment. Exame earlier reported that the Pardini family is
holding up the deal. </p>

disproportionately affects older people. About 100,000 people in
the U.S. are diagnosed each year with blood cancers, including
leukemia and lymphoma, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease

<p>Visa Inc. (V), the world''s largest

analysts'' estimates as card spending increased. </p>
<p>Net income for the three months ended June 30 rose 11
percent to $1.36 billion, or $2.17 a share, from $1.23 billion,
or $1.88, a year earlier, the Foster City, California-based
company said today in a statement. The average estimate of 30
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for adjusted profit of $2.10. </p>
<p>Visa is benefiting as consumers globally replace cash with
credit and debit cards. Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf,
49, has focused on strengthening relationships with retailers,
developing technologies to enable digital payments and working
with governments to expand the firm''s reach outside the U.S. </p>
<p>Visa''s business is characterized by recurring revenues,
high incremental margins, low capital expenditures and high free
cash flow, Tien-tsin Huang, a JPMorgan Chase  Co. analyst,
wrote in a July 23 note. The company is a relative safe haven
against macro uncertainty. </p>
<p>The shares rose 0.7 percent to $222.74 at 4 p.m. in New

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) had its credit rating
outlook raised to positive from neutral by Moody''s Investors
Service, two years after the ratings company cut the bank''s
grade by two levels. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which topped analysts'' estimates when it

improvements to profitability and lowered risk in its trading

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) may need to pay
more than the $4.5 billion it offered to settle investor claims
over faulty mortgages packaged into securities before the U.S.
housing crash, a report prepared for bond trustees shows. </p>
<p>Trustees should reject the accord struck last November with
a group of bondholders for 16 of the 330 deals included, and
it''s a close call for three others, according to the report
posted online this week by Daniel Fischel, president of Compass
Lexecon, which is among firms hired by the securities
administrators to help evaluate the offer. </p>
<p>Based on the reports by the expert advisors, there exists
a meaningful possibility that trustees may not accept the
proposed settlement offer for all 330 trusts, Nomura Holdings
Inc. analysts including Paul Nikodem and Pratik K. Gupta wrote
yesterday in a research note. </p>
<p>JPMorgan negotiated the proposed settlement with 21
institutional investors including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) and Pacific
Investment Management Co. in a bid to move past legal troubles
tied in part to the housing crisis. The accord was announced the
week before the largest U.S. bank agreed to a record $13 billion
settlement with government agencies over faulty mortgage
securities. </p>
<h2>Extended Deadline </h2>
<p>Trustees including Deutsche Bank AG, Wells Fargo  Co. and
Bank of New York Mellon Corp. must decide whether to accept
JPMorgan''s proposal by Aug. 1. The deadline has been pushed back
at least twice from an original date of March 16. </p>
<p>Brian Marchiony, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment, as did Jen Hibbard of Wells Fargo, Kevin Heine of Bank of New York and Renee Calabro of Deutsche Bank.
Kathy Patrick, a lawyer at Gibbs  Bruns LLP representing the
investors who negotiated the deal, didn''t immediately respond to
an e-mail seeking comment. </p>
<p>Hedge fund Fir Tree Partners has said it will seek to
continue separate lawsuits over some of the securities. Law firm
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan LLP is also representing a
group of investors objecting to the agreement for at least some
deals, according to Fischel, also a professor of law and
business emeritus at the University of Chicago Law School. </p>
<h2>Improper Servicing </h2>
<p>The accord sparked claims that JPMorgan and Bear Stearns
Cos., which it bought in 2008, needed to repurchase mortgages
whose quality was misrepresented, as well as pay for mishandling
loans once they''re made. Another expert, Boston Portfolio
Advisors Inc., said in its report the improper servicing boosted
losses by $4 billion and disclosed that many of the loans are
already managed by a separate subservicer, limiting the
benefits to investors of transfers to such entities as called
for by the deal, according to Nomura. </p>
<p> Bank of America Corp., the second-biggest U.S. bank, has
faced opposition in court over an $8.5 billion settlement that
it reached in 2011 with bondholders represented by Gibbs  Bruns
and Bank of New York, as the trustee for more than 500
transactions. A New York state judge largely approved the deal
in January, though the ruling is being appealed by investors
seeking a bigger payout. </p>
<p>The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said this month it
would pay $650 million to American International Group Inc., one
of the objectors to the agreement that had also filed a separate
suit over mortgage securities created by Countrywide Financial
Corp., the lender bought by Bank of America in 2008. </p>
<h2>No Windfall'' </h2>
<p>While the proposed JPMorgan settlement is relatively small,
compared with other mortgage-bond agreements, evidence from
markets suggest that it wouldn''t be a windfall for the bank,
Fischel wrote. </p>
<p>The amount offered represents 6.6 percent of past and
potential losses on loans underlying the bonds, compared with
10.8 percent in the Bank of America deal, Barclays Plc analysts
estimated in November. After a $55 million payment by Wells
Fargo to an individual bond trust this year, investors recovered
32 percent of past and future losses, according to Nomura. </p>
<p>Fatan Sabry, an economist at National Economic Research
Associates Inc., wrote in a report for trustees that JPMorgan''s
planned payment exceeds potential losses from violations of so-called representation and warranties under several estimation
methods. </p>
<p>Anthony J. Carpinello, a former New York State Supreme
Court justice, said in a report that the statute of limitations
for all the 330 deals has been extended, which could bolster any
separate demands from investors reluctant to take part in the
accord, according to Nomura. JPMorgan contends that the
extension only applies to some of the deals, according to a
website set up by trustees. </p>

next year following an ore-export ban in Indonesia. </p>
<p>The bank''s 12-month estimate is now $22,000 a metric ton,
up 38 percent from the previous projection of $16,000, analysts
led by Max Layton wrote in a report. They increased zinc and
aluminum by at least 11 percent to $2,500 a ton and $2,100 a
ton, respectively, saying iron ore, gold and copper have the
greatest downside among the mining commodities. </p>
<p>Goldman joins Morgan Stanley and Citigroup Inc. in boosting
the outlook for nickel, already the best-performing base metal
on the London Metal Exchange this year, as supplies are
declining after the Indonesian restriction in January. The
global nickel market will be in deficit of 201,000 tons next
year from an estimated 20,000 ton surplus this year, with demand
exceeding supply for aluminum and zinc this year, Goldman said. </p>
<p>Nickel is being boosted by the attempts of a large
producer (Indonesia) to encourage value-add capacity
domestically, the Goldman analysts said in the report dated
yesterday. We have raised out already bullish zinc, nickel and
aluminum forecasts, and lowered our copper forecasts, reflecting
a quick-than-anticipated shift in the relative fundamentals of
these commodities. </p>
<p>The ban by Indonesia, which accounted for more than 20
percent of global nickel supply in 2013, is unlikely to be eased
until the second half of 2015, Goldman said. </p>

percent to $19,180 a ton by 11:10 a.m. in Hong Kong, up 38
percent this year. The metal touched $21,625 a ton on May 13,
the highest since February 2012. </p>
<h2>Indonesian Ban </h2>
<p>Earlier this month, Bank of America Corp. raised its 2014
forecast to $18,616, citing the ban and the possible reduction
of Chinese nickel pig iron output. Citigroup raised its 2014
average forecast to $18,550 and Morgan Stanley said the metal
will average $17,640 this year and $19,346 next year. </p>
<p>The global aluminum market has moved into deficit of
579,000 tons this year, with the gap increasing to 619,000 tons
next year, while zinc will have deficit of 154,000 tons in 2015,
according to the Goldman report. </p>
<p>A cyclical upswing in demand in combination with low
supply growth, following years of underinvestment in new
capacity outside of China, has seen zinc and aluminum
outperform in the first half of 2014, said the Goldman
analysts. </p>
<p>Goldman cut the 12-month estimate for copper to $6,200 a

<p>Russia''s surprise interest rate
increase paves the way for policy makers to widen the band in
which the currency trades and reduces the need to intervene,
according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The ruble has tumbled almost 4 percent against the dollar
in the past month, the worst performance among 24 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg, after President Vladimir
Putin''s annexation of Crimea spurred violence along the border
with Ukraine. Bank Rossii boosted the one-week auction rate to 8
percent from 7.5 percent yesterday and may keep raising
borrowing costs as currency weakness spurs inflation, according
to a central bank statement. </p>
<p>The decision gives the bank room to make its exchange-rate
policy more flexible as it moves towards a free-floating rate by
year-end, according to New York-based Goldman Sachs. Enabling
the ruble to strengthen will aid the central bank in its fight
against price increases. </p>
<p>The surprise rate change makes it likely that the central
bank will proceed with further steps towards introduction of
currency flexibility in the short term, with a decision to
reduce the cumulative interventions needed to shift the
intervention corridor, for example, likely as early as next
week, economists led by Clemens Grafe at Goldman Sachs in
Moscow wrote in a note yesterday. </p>
<h2>Wider Band </h2>
<p>The central bank widened the corridor within which it will
not intervene to 5.1 rubles, up from 3.1 rubles last month. It
is required to buy or sell dollars to keep the ruble inside that
range. It aims to abolish the band by year-end. </p>
<p>Russia spent $30.7 billion between Feb. 28 and May 8 to
stem the ruble''s decline. Since then, it hasn''t sold dollars to

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is in talks to settle a U.S. regulator''s claims the investment bank sold faulty mortgage-backed securities to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and will probably pay $800 million to $1.25 billion, according to a person briefed on the discussions. </p> <p>The high end of the range would be on par with the agreement Morgan Stanley (MS) reached this year after being sued over a similar amount of mortgage bonds as New York-based Goldman Sachs. The final amount may change as an agreement is reached, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the settlement talks are private. </p> <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency sued 18 banks in 2011 seeking to recoup taxpayer costs from when the government took control of the failing mortgage-finance companies in 2008. Seven banks, including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and Deutsche Bank AG, agreed to pay a total of almost $8 billion last year to settle claims they made misrepresentations about mortgages underlying securities bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the lead-up to the credit crisis. </p> <p>The $800 million figure would surpass Goldman Sachs''s $550 million payment in 2010 to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission suit over the marketing of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation dubbed Abacus 2007-AC1. </p> <p>Still, Goldman''s cost could be lower than what rival banks paid, as a percentage of the face value of securities bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The FHFA said in its original suit that the two companies bought $11.1 billion from Goldman Sachs, and an $800 million settlement would be 7.2 percent of that total. Some banks have settled at amounts that represented between 12 percent and 20 percent. </p> <h2>JPMorgan, BofA </h2> <p>Morgan Stanley in February agreed to pay $1.25 billion as part of a settlement over $10.6 billion in securities. JPMorgan agreed last year to pay $4 billion to settle claims related to about $33 billion in mortgage bonds. </p> <p>Bank of America Corp. in March announced a $9.5 billion accord, including paying $6.3 billion in cash to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and buying back $3.2 billion of mortgage bonds from them. The housing finance companies bought about $57 billion of bonds from Bank of America and its predecessor firms. </p> <p>David Wells, a spokesman for Goldman Sachs, didn''t return messages after normal business hours seeking comment on the possible range of costs, which was previously reported by the Wall Street Journal. Stefanie Johnson, an FHFA spokeswoman, said the agency wouldn''t comment on the Goldman Sachs case. </p> <p>U.S. District Court Judge Denise Cote in Manhattan has set a Sept. 29 trial date for Goldman Sachs. All but four of the FHFA cases have settled, Cote said yesterday in a ruling. The remaining cases involve Goldman Sachs, HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Nomura Holding America Inc. and RBS Securities Inc., she said. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs said earlier this month that it set aside $284 million in the second quarter for litigation and regulatory proceedings, up from $149 million a year earlier. </p> <p>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken $187.5 billion in U.S. aid and have returned more than $200 billion under terms of their federal conservatorship. </p> <p> ', 'Goldman Sachs Said in Talks to Settle FHFA Mortgage Suit', 'By Michael J.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) denied
gender bias in compensation and tolerating a boys'' club
atmosphere of excessive drinking and strip-club trips as it
sought to quash a bid to unite female associates and vice
presidents in a class action for discrimination. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs rejected claims by former employees Cristina
Chen-Oster and Shanna Orlich, opposing their court request to
expand a lawsuit to represent more than 2,300 current and former
female associates and vice presidents who worked at Goldman
Sachs in the past decade. </p>
<p>To be clear: Goldman Sachs does not tolerate
discrimination of any kind, the firm said in papers filed July
25 in Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>Chen-Oster and Orlich, who sued in 2010, claim they have
expert statistical analyses that showed a pattern of
discrimination against women in earnings and promotions. They
alleged that the bank tolerated a work environment where women
are treated as second-class employees. </p>
<p>About 36 percent of professionals employed by New York-based Goldman Sachs are women, the firm said on its website,
citing August 2013 figures. Women constitute 23 percent of
officials and managers, and 21 percent of executive and senior
officials and managers, the firm said. </p>
<h2>Percentages </h2>
<p>The former Goldman Sachs employees cited their own
percentages in court filings. They claimed female vice
presidents earned 21 percent less than men, and female
associates made 8 percent less. About 23 percent fewer female
vice presidents were promoted to managing director relative to
their male counterparts, they said in their complaint. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs asked U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres to
rule that Chen-Oster and Orlich should pursue their claims
individually, rather than as representatives of all female
Goldmans Sachs associates and vice presidents. Plaintiffs have
more leverage in class actions because they can pool legal
resources, more easily forcing a settlement. </p>
<p>The bank argued that the women haven''t shown a general
policy of discrimination or evidence that women were affected
negatively as a class. Their allegations are individual claims
that don''t apply to the other women, Goldman Sachs said. </p>
<h2>Denials </h2>
<p>The bank also specifically denied many of the allegations
in the complaint, including claims that male employees took
clients to strip clubs. </p>
<p>The firm said it prohibits employees from business outings
involving sexually oriented entertainment, such as
entertainment at topless bars or lap-dancing bars. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also submitted statements from female
employees who said they haven''t been discriminated against or
subject to harassment. </p>
<p>The firm said it has conducted diversity training programs
for 20 years. </p>
<p>I have never heard anyone even mention the
possibility of going to a strip club, Samantha Davidson, an
extended managing director, said in a written declaration. I
do not feel excluded from social events, such as events with
clients and informal get-togethers after work with co-workers,
including golf events. </p>
<p>The case is Chen-Oster v. Goldman Sachs  Co., 10-cv-06950,

<p>When hurricanes come barreling toward land, people, airplanes and ships are relocated to avoid destruction. Now some of the world''s biggest technology companies are making advances in figuring out how to quickly move large amounts of critical data and software out of harm''s way, too. </p> <p>ATT Inc. (T), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), and Applied Communications Sciences have created a prototype technology to reduce the time needed to connect remote networks from days to seconds. Part of a seven-year program from the U.S. government''s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the latest innovation from the partnership could allow large amounts of information and software to be more quickly shifted between private and public data centers, as well as between cloud services from different providers. </p> <p>Moving data and software to another location could be crucial in coping with events like natural disasters and terrorist attacks as governments and companies have become increasingly reliant on servers, both on premise and in remote locations, to handle their information. The U.S. Department of Defense has expressed interest in the research, IBM said in an e-mail. </p> <p>The key idea here is to have a highly dynamic backbone network, said Adel Saleh, a research professor in electrical and computer engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a former DARPA project manager. If the network is under physical attack or cyberattack, you can recover from this quickly. </p> <h2>Remaining Hurdles </h2> <p>While many companies and governments already keep data remotely to have redundant systems, the companies'' prototype would let them reconfigure on the fly to handle changes in needs, such as computing bandwidth. </p> <p>The ability to use capacity only when needed could also make cloud computing less expensive, Saleh said in a phone interview. </p> <p>The partnership between ATT, IBM and ACS is a part of a DARPA program called Coronet that was started in 2007 to protect networks against catastrophic failures, in order to help keep the Internet and government services up and running. </p> <p>The technology is still in the proof-of-concept phase, said Dave McQueeney, vice president of computing as a service at IBM Research. Changes would have to be made to optical fiber networks -- including the addition of new switches -- for it to be adopted more broadly, he said. Work also needs to be done within cloud systems to accommodate the connections, McQueeney said. </p> <p>If these changes are made, the technology could be used in military technology infrastructures and eventually for commercial use. </p> <p>Every client I talk to doesn''t want to put all of their IT in one place, McQueeney said. One of the long poles of the tent that needed to get solved was very, very rapid provisioning of huge amounts of bandwidth. Now we can have a vision of a multiple-cloud, hybrid environment where the networking is likely not the main bottleneck. </p> <p> ', 'IBM, AT&amp;T Build Technology to Move Data Fast in Disaster', 'By Alex Barinka', 'Jul 28, 2014  3:00 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-28/ibm-at-t-build-technology-to-move-data-fast-in-disaster.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>It''s game on in China, as Microsoft Corp.''s (MSFT) Xbox One becomes the first entertainment console to hit the market after the end of a 13-year ban. </p> <p>Microsoft today began taking orders for its new game console from online retailer JD.com Inc. (JD) via Tencent Holdings Ltd.''s (700) mobile-messaging applications. The pair of Chinese Internet companies hold exclusive rights to pre-sell the locally made Xbox One until July 30, JD.com said in a news release. The console is slated to ship nationwide in September. </p> <p>Microsoft was the industry''s first big player to start production in the country after the Chinese government last year allowed console sales in the new Shanghai free-trade zone and opened up an estimated $10 billion market. The first Xbox didn''t even exist in 2000, when the Communist Party banned game systems over concern they would be bad for kids. It was released a year later. </p> <p>The potential market for Xbox in China is huge, there''s a lot of prospects for growth, said Bill Fan, a Hong Kong-based analyst at China Securities Co. Tencent could cooperate with Microsoft on games in the future, and Xbox can utilize Tencent and JD.com''s distribution channels to generate more sales. </p> <p>Tencent shares rose 3.2 percent to close at HK$128.90 in Hong Kong. Microsoft has gained about 19 percent this year, compared with a 7 percent rise for the SP 500 Index. Microsoft shares rose 0.2 percent to $44.50 in New York yesterday. </p> <h2>Entry Points </h2> <p>The Xbox One pre-orders on JD.com require a deposit of 499 yuan (US$81), and will only be available to those who use the Chinese versions of Tencent''s WeChat and QQ mobile-messaging apps. </p> <p>JD.com spokesman Josh Gartner wouldn''t disclose the number of Xbox Ones the company was selling nor the price. </p> <p>Launching Xbox One sales in China through JD.com''s Weixin and Mobile QQ entry points underscores the strength of these platforms with young and sophisticated Chinese consumers, Du Shuang, vice president of JD.com, said in the news release, using the Chinese name for Tencent''s WeChat. </p> <p>JD.com will begin directly accepting pre-orders for the new Xbox through its website and its exhibition booth at the ChinaJoy Expo in Shanghai on July 31, the company said. </p> <h2>Trade Zone </h2> <p>Game consoles were included on the list of items to be liberalized before Shanghai''s free-trade zone before its creation last September. </p> <p>Around the same time, Microsoft formed a $79 million joint venture with BesTV New Media Co. (600637), a unit of Shanghai Media Group Inc., to begin making Xbox consoles in the free-trade zone for the Chinese market. BesTV invested $40.3 million for a 51 percent stake in the enterprise, while Microsoft put in $38.7 million, according a September filing. </p> <p>The State Council, China''s cabinet, has since temporarily lifted the ban nationwide and announced plans to draft new rules on their sale. The country''s video-game industry will generate about $10 billion in sales next year, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. </p> <p>Sony Corp. (6758) has similarly agreed to form two ventures with the Shanghai Oriental Pearl (Group) Co., to start making PlayStation consoles in China. Nintendo Co. plans to expand in emerging markets with new devices starting next year, the company''s president, Satoru Iwata, said on May 8. </p> <p>Microsoft has been chasing Sony for dominance in the U.S. video-game console market. It introduced a lower-priced version of its Xbox One costing $399 on June 9 to narrow a $100 price difference with the PS4. </p> <p>Duncan Clark, the Beijing-based chairman of BDA China Ltd., which advises technology companies, said Tencent and JD.com were well-positioned to benefit from the lifting of the ban. For Xbox, Tencent is the most established games distributor, and, for JD, it''s logistics, shipping and quality control, Clark said.

<p>Nickel and palladium are set to
outperform iron ore and soybeans as supply outlooks for
commodities diverge amid a tentative acceleration in global
economic growth, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>The bank kept its 12-month recommendation for commodities
at neutral, analysts including Jeffrey Currie wrote in a report
dated yesterday. They expect the total return for the Standard 
Poor''s GSCI Enhanced Commodity Index to be 0.1 percent in 12
months helped by positive roll yields. </p>
<p>Citigroup Inc. said last month that interest is returning
to the asset class as Societe Generale SA called commodities a
really mixed bag across the sectors. Raw materials are
already trading independently, with a ban on ore exports from
Indonesia spurring a rally in nickel, while expectations for a
deepening global glut have sent iron ore into a bear market. </p>
<p>While cyclical recovery tends to see rising commodity
demand, prices will likely largely be determined by more
structural supply factors, the Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.
Accordingly, not all boats are expected rise with the tide
created by continued improvement in global macroeconomic data. </p>
<p>Commodities as measured by the enhanced index added 2.4
percent this year as global equities increased 5.6 percent and
the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index rose 3.5 percent.
Shortages are seen nickel, zinc, aluminum and palladium, while
most other raw materials including copper, iron ore, oil and
soybeans, are expected to be in surplus, Goldman says. Nickel
fell 1.2 percent today and palladium advanced 0.4 percent. </p>
<h2>Increasing Allocations </h2>
<p>We''ve seen increasing allocations from asset managers
this year and some new fund interest come into commodities,
Aakash Doshi, a Citigroup Global Markets vice president in New
York, said in a phone interview June 24. We''ve seen
geopolitics and weather really come to the fore this year. </p>
<p>Societe Generale is overweight agriculture, and energy to a
slightly lesser extent, and massively underweight precious
metals, according to Michael Haigh, head of commodities
research, in a June 17 interview. </p>
<p>While financial markets have reacted favorably to signs of
macroeconomic acceleration in both the U.S. and China, with the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index reaching a record, commodity indexes
have remained mostly flat on expectations for increases in
supplies in most raw materials, the Goldman analysts said.
Nickel, zinc, aluminum and palladium do not fit into this view
as deficits are predicted over the next three years, they said. </p>
<h2>Carry Return </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley also expects nickel, zinc and palladium to
advance. While nickel may have run ahead of itself, a
shortage next year may keep its uptrend intact, analysts
including Joel Crane said in a report yesterday. Zinc will
continue to outperform as the shortfall intensifies and solid
supply and demand fundamentals support palladium, they said. </p>
<p>The SP GSCI enhanced index has rebounded in 2014 from two
years of losses as key markets are in backwardation, a structure
where short-term supplies cost more than later deliveries, which
has provided so-called positive carry and continued to generate
returns, according to Goldman. </p>

<p>China should allow economic growth
to slow to below 7 percent to reduce reliance on investment
spending, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s Ha Jiming. </p>
<p>Achieving Premier Li Keqiang''s target of 7.5 percent gross
domestic product growth for this year could further aggravate
imbalances and a rate below 7 percent is roughly what China
needs, said Ha, the Hong Kong-based vice chairman and chief
investment strategist at Goldman''s investment management
division for China. Next year, I hope the target could be
lowered to reflect the need for economic rebalance, he said. </p>
<p>The ruling Communist Party, which last year laid out the
broadest economic changes since the 1990s, has been drawn back
into providing greater support for the economy as expansion is
threatened by a plunge in property construction and weaker home-price gains. The government has brought forward spending, cut
reserve requirements for some lenders and lowered taxes, helping
drive a gauge of manufacturing to an 18-month high. </p>
<p>It''s very difficult for China to strike a balance between
short-term growth and long-term reform needs, Ha said in an
interview yesterday in Sydney. According to my estimate, if
China wants to lower the share of investment in GDP over the
medium term, growth should not exceed 7 percent. </p>
<p>The risks embedded in the current Chinese growth model are
being exacerbated the longer the government seeks to maintain
growth at 7.5 percent, Angus Bell, an investment manager at
Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said yesterday in the same
interview. Goldman Sachs AM invests or advises on assets worth
more than $900 billion, according to its website. </p>
<h2>Slower Growth </h2>
<p>Economists surveyed by Bloomberg News predict that Chinese
GDP will expand by 7.4 percent this year, the slowest pace since
1990. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its forecasts
to 7.4 percent for this year and 7.1 percent for 2015, the
Washington-based fund said this month. </p>
<p>China''s leaders are seeking to rebalance the economy away
from exports and domestic investment, toward services and
consumption. To put the nation on a more sustainable growth
path, the government needs to prevent further excesses in
production capacity, debt and housing supply, according to Ha. </p>
<p>In the first half of this year, I would say the focus was
on safeguarding growth, said Ha. Given that the stimulus
policies are taking effect and growth is likely to be maintained
at the targeted level of 7.5 percent, in the second half of this
year some reform measures as announced a year ago could be put
in place. </p>
<h2>Housing Market </h2>
<p>Liberalization of interest rates and the currency and a
loosening of some regulations on foreign and domestic investors
will probably be among the initial changes considered, he said. </p>
<p>The key risks in China that concern Goldman Sachs Asset
Management center around housing, which is an important source
of demand for various industries and linked to local and central
government revenues, Bell said in Sydney. </p>
<p>Authorities are currently seeking to avert a collapse of
the real-estate market after data showed housing prices fell in
55 of 70 cities last month from May, the most since January 2011
when the government changed the way it compiles the statistics. </p>
<p>UBS AG estimates real-estate accounts for more than a
quarter of final demand in the economy when including property-generated needs for goods including electric machinery and
instruments, chemicals and metals. </p>
<p>The size is very big compared to many other countries,
said Ha, who predicts that home sellers will start to outnumber
buyers as China''s baby-boom generation retires. That
demographic inflection point will have very significant
implications for the Chinese property market and related
industries. </p>

He said shares will rally through October after the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI) entered a bull market on July 28. </p> <p>China''s central bank presided over a bigger-than-estimated surge in new credit in June and has cut reserve requirements for some lenders, while local media reported the PBOC set up a 1 trillion yuan ($162 billion) lending facility with the China Development Bank to fund housing projects.

(HSBA) </p> <p>The scale of monetary stimulus since June is a surprise, Mowat wrote. All these changes indicate a more aggressive approach to driving growth. </p> <p>Mowat is joining bulls, including Standard Chartered Plc''s Erwin Sanft and Templeton Emerging Markets Group''s Mark Mobius, who predict the rally will extend as low valuations lure investors and the government supports growth. Bears such as Bank of America Corp.''s David Cui say stimulus is delaying the economy''s shift toward a more sustainable model driven by consumption and services. </p> <h2>Winning Streak </h2> <p>The Hang Seng China Enterprises index fell less than 0.1 percent to 11,119.32 at the close in Hong Kong, snapping a sixth straight day of gains.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) lost its challenge
to a U.S. government search warrant ordering the software giant
to produce e-mails of an unidentified customer stored in a data
center in Ireland. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan today
upheld a federal magistrate''s decision requiring the company to
turn over e-mails in a drug investigation. Preska delayed the
effect of her ruling to give Microsoft time to appeal. </p>
<p>Preska rejected Microsoft''s argument that the warrant,
which requires the company to provide investigators with the
contents of the customer''s MSN.com Web-based e-mail, calls for
an illegal search and seizure outside the U.S. The nation in
which the customer lives wasn''t disclosed. </p>
<p>The judge delivered her ruling from the bench after a two-hour hearing, endorsing an April decision by U.S. Magistrate
Judge James C. Francis IV. Today''s ruling sets up an appeal that
may help dictate how courts apply legal protections to
electronic data, particularly information stored by Internet
service providers outside the U.S. </p>
<p>Congress intended in this statute for ISPs to produce
information under their control, albeit stored abroad, to law
enforcement in the United States, Preska said. As Judge
Francis found, it is a question of control, not a question of
the location of that information. </p>
<h2>Stored Communications </h2>
<p>During the hearing, lawyers for both sides argued over the
reach of the Stored Communications Act, or SCA, part of the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. The SCA allows
law enforcement agents to obtain information through subpoenas,
court orders or warrants, depending on the records sought. </p>
<p>The only issue that was certain this morning was that the
district court''s decision would not represent the final step in
this process, Microsoft''s general counsel, Brad Smith, said in
a statement after the hearing. We will appeal promptly and
continue to advocate that people''s e-mail deserves strong
privacy protection in the U.S. and around the world. </p>
<p>Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft argued that the
government should be required to get the e-mails through
procedures dictated by a law-enforcement treaty between the U.S.
and Ireland. </p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Serrin Turner told Preska that the
treaty process, which can be complicated and time-consuming,
isn''t legally required. </p>
<h2>Right Here'' </h2>
<p>We don''t need to go to a foreign country to get the
records, Turner said. The provider is right here. </p>
<p>E. Joshua Rosenkranz, a lawyer for Microsoft, argued that
the government is seeking to conscript Microsoft here in the
United States to search files abroad. He said that if other
countries required Microsoft to provide them with e-mails of
customers located in the U.S. we would consider that an
astounding infringement of our sovereignty. </p>
<p>That is a very, very dangerous principle that the
government is articulating, Rosenkranz said. </p>
<p>Rosenkranz told Preska that officials in China this week
demanded a password to seek e-mail information in the U.S. </p>
<p>Mr. Turner, what do you say to that? Preska asked.
It''s pretty scary. </p>
<p>Turner said concerns about what other countries may do
should be addressed through political and diplomatic
channels, not by ignoring the terms of the SCA. </p>
<h2>Company Support </h2>
<p>Preska also heard arguments from lawyers representing ATT
Inc. (T), Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Cisco Systems
Inc. (CSCO), which supported Microsoft''s position. </p>
<p>Today''s decision is a major blow not just for Microsoft,
but for the entire U.S. cloud-computing industry, Christopher Soghoian, the principal technologist for the American Civil
Liberties Union, said in a statement today. If these companies
wish to regain the trust of their global customers, they must
embrace security technologies such as cloud cryptography, which
can provide real privacy protections where the law does not. </p>

<p>Walter Energy Inc. (WLT), a metallurgical
coal producer that hasn''t been profitable in two years, said it
has enough liquidity to survive the weak market for the
steelmaking ingredient and that industry efforts to cut excess
supply are working. </p>
<p>Walter had $563.9 million in cash, cash equivalents and
available funds under its credit facilities at the end of the
second quarter, the company said in a statement today. </p>
<p>There''s no liquidity concerns in our company at this
point, Chief Executive Officer Walter J. Scheller III said in
a conference call. There will be no fire sale of assets, he
also said. </p>
<p>Walter is among metallurgical-coal producers contending
with global prices for the commodity that are at a six-year low
because of cooling Chinese demand and new mines coming on line.
Shares of the Birmingham, Alabama-based company have slumped 66
percent this year and Standard  Poor''s said last month that
Walter''s level of debt is unsustainable. </p>
<p>In April, the company started idling Canadian mines that
produced 3.6 million tons of coal in 2013. Industrywide, about
20 million tons of metallurgical-coal cuts have been announced
this year, helping to reduce excess supply, Scheller said. </p>
<p>Given the projects that are coming online and the
announced cuts, I think we might be pretty close to balanced
once it all works its way through, he said. </p>
<p>Most mining companies believe that 10 million to 15 million
tons of additional cutbacks are needed to achieve a balanced
market, Michael Dudas, an analyst for Sterne Agee  Leach Inc.,
said in a July 28 note. </p>
<h2>Forecast Cut </h2>
<p>Walter''s second-quarter net loss widened to $151.4 million,
or $2.33 a share, from $34.5 million, or 55 cents, a year
earlier. Excluding one-time items, the loss was $1.97 a share,
worse than the $1.69 average of 18 analysts'' estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Sales dropped 14 percent to $378.4 million,
beating the $376.6 million average estimate. </p>
<p>The company reduced its metallurgical-coal sales forecast
for this year to 9.5 million to 10.5 million tons, from 10.5
million to 11.5 million tons previously. Walter said the main
reason was the shutting in June of its principal coal
transportation provider at the Brule mine in Canada. </p>

level in almost five years, raising the stakes as it seeks to
pursue crude deposits in Russia. </p>
<p>The world''s largest energy company dropped 4.2 percent to
$98.94 at the close in New York, the biggest slide in almost
three years, after reporting second-quarter earnings that beat
analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>The company''s oil and gas output decreased 5.7 percent to
the equivalent of 3.84 million barrels a day, the lowest since
the third quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Exxon had been expected to post quarterly output
equivalent to 3.96 million barrels, based on six analysts''
estimates. Crude from Exxon wells in Europe and Asia dropped,
while gas production faltered in every region in which the
company does business except Africa and the South Pacific. </p>
<p>Exxon is going after crude in Russia''s Arctic regions in an
effort to extract some of the largest oil reserves and reverse a
trend of declining production for the company. Its allocating
$39.8 billion to capital projects this year, including hundreds
of millions for an exploratory well in Russia''s Kara Sea, as
part of a 29-year agreement signed with Moscow-based OAO Rosneft (ROSN)
in 2011. </p>
<p>Sanctions threaten to halt that progress after the U.S. and
European Union said July 29 they would restrict the export of
technologies for energy production to Russia. The oil-producing
nation holds an estimated $8 trillion worth of crude
underground. </p>
<h2>Profit Rise </h2>
<p>Exxon is awaiting further details on U.S. and EU sanctions
to determine any effects, Vice President David Rosenthal said on
a conference call today. He declined to comment on how the
recently completed Berkut platform, a joint venture with Rosneft
of Russia''s Far East coast, was financed. </p>
<p>Because these new oil technology sanctions imposed by
Europe and the U.S. governments do impose some restrictions on
Arctic drilling technology, it may have an effect on these
Arctic drilling plans, Pavel Molchanov, a Houston-based
analyst for Raymond James  Associates Inc., said in a phone
interview before the results were released. Molchanov rates
Exxon the equivalent of a buy and doesn''t own the shares. </p>
<p>The lower production figures came as the company reported
better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. Excluding one-time
items, per-share profit was 19 cents more than the $1.86 average
of 21 estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Net income climbed 28
percent to $8.78 billion, or $2.05 a share, from $6.86 billion,
or $1.55, a year earlier, the Irving, Texas-based company said
in a statement today. </p>
<h2>Higher Prices </h2>
<p>Earnings were driven by higher fuel prices. Brent crude
futures, a global benchmark, rose 6 percent from a year earlier
to average $109.76 a barrel in the second quarter. Natural gas
futures prices in New York rose 14 percent to average $4.579 per
million British thermal units. </p>
<p>Exxon''s performance has trailed competitors and the
Standard  Poor''s 500 Index for the past year, gaining 7.3
percent, less than half of the SP''s move. The company, which
has a market value of $432 billion, has 14 buy ratings from
analysts, 13 holds and five sells. </p>

<p>Calling for a correction in equities at the right time is about as easy as brushing your teeth with your mustache. Yet that didn''t stop many market watchers in July as U.S. benchmark indexes clung to records. </p> <p>From Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to Alan Greenspan, a fear of heights spread this month as the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index closed in on its third year without a significant dip. The benchmark gauge of volatility reflected the concern, with the VIX jumping 34 percent for its biggest monthly gain since January yet still holding well below its lifetime average. </p> <p>Many potential catalysts were proffered. However, as the final trades of the month hit the tape, none of them have yet proven to be the smoking gun. An interest rate spike caused by the slow drain of the Federal Reserve punch bowl? Treasury 10-year yields held pretty flat below 2.6 percent. An oil shock as the world goes up in flames? Both West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude lost more than 5 percent. </p> <p>But wait! Corn is poised for its biggest monthly decline in almost three years! What calamity could be causing this 13 percent drop and is it the catalyst everyone''s been waiting for to knock the chip off the stock market''s shoulder? Well, as Bloomberg News describes it, the reason for the drop is expectations supplies will be ample amid an outlook for a bumper harvest in the U.S., the top grower. </p> <p>OK fine. Whatever. </p> <h2>Long Time </h2> <p>The main rationale for many of the correction predictions is based on the logic that, well, corrections happen. And we haven''t had one in a long time. </p> <p>Yet the fundamentals are sort of getting in the way. U.S. gross domestic product surged 4 percent last quarter, earnings are up 10 percent for the SP 500 companies that have reported results for the latest quarter and sales have increased 4.9 percent. Signs of growth sent the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index up 1.9 percent in July, its biggest monthly gain in a year. </p> <p>Meanwhile across the pond, euro-area government bonds were up for a seventh straight month and headed for their longest streak of gains in nine years after weak data signaled the European Central Bank will have to soldier on with stimulus. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index is headed for a 1.8 percent July drop, its worst month since January, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 1.5 percent in July. </p> <h2>Yield Curve </h2> <p>And not all was flat in the Treasury market. Thirty-year bonds had a nice rally, while five-year notes fell. That sent the yield spread, or curve, between them to the lowest since 2009. That is likely a sign that people are taking this whole Fed tightening thing seriously, if not necessarily worried about inflation. </p> <p>Stocks are falling pretty sharply this morning as the month draws to an end, and there are new catalysts to blame: the Bank of Portugal''s order that Banco Espirito Santo SA must raise capital; Argentina''s default; a handful of lousy earnings reports from some big names. </p> <p>Ten-year Treasury yields surged 10 basis point yesterday and took an early jump today, then came back down to make a cool Sears Tower formation in the daily chart. </p> <p>Today''s drop has left the SP 500 down about 0.6 percent for July, which would mark its first monthly decline since January. However, dips have been bought reliably, so check back at the end of the day to see where the chips fall for July. </p> <p>It does make you wonder if this is the beginning of the correction that will fulfill all the pundit prophecies? Who knows. One thing is sure: people will likely obsess over it in August, just like they did in July. Oh, and in June too... </p> <p>Investors and analysts of all shades and sizes are obsessed with the idea of a correction, Birinyi Associates Inc. wrote in a note to clients at the end of June. We have always held that these efforts to foretell a correction are in vain. </p> <p>Anyway, come to think of it, there are some people who could brush their teeth with their mustache if they want: those with dentures. Hey, no one said coming up with market metaphors was any easier. </p> <p> ', 'Goldman to Greenspan Catch Equity Acrophobia in Flat July', 'By Michael P.

<p>A plan to start direct trading
between the won and China''s yuan will hurt the South Korean
currency by slowing the inflow of dollars, Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. said in a report. </p>
<p>Governments of the two Asian countries agreed on July 3 to
make their currencies mutually exchangeable in Seoul later this
year. The plan supports Goldman''s prediction that the won will
drop to 1,050 per dollar by the end of 2014, from 1,025.65
today, Kwon Goohoon, a Seoul-based economist at the U.S. bank,
wrote in today''s report. </p>
<p>This market will likely increase yuan settlement for
Korean exports to China and expand yuan investments by Korean
investors, weakening the won against the dollar in the
process, Kwon wrote. </p>
<p>South Korea''s trade surplus with China, its biggest export
partner, amounted to $24 billion in the first six months of this
year, according to a July 1 government report. With only 0.3
percent of trade payments settled in the Chinese currency, the
won-yuan market has the potential to grow rapidly, the Goldman
report said. </p>
<p>The value of South Korea''s yuan transactions with China and
Hong Kong has jumped by 5.6 times since June 2013, the Society
for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, or Swift,
said in a July 29 statement. Bank of Korea data show yuan
deposits in the country surged 80 percent this year as investors
sought higher interest rates. </p>
<h2>Global Payments </h2>
<p>China''s currency ranked seventh for global payments in
June, according to Swift. The won has appreciated 2.3 percent
against the dollar this year and advanced 4.3 versus the yuan in
the same period, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>The won, which can only trade onshore in South Korea at
present, may also be transacted in China in the future. The two
countries will seek to establish infrastructure enabling direct
trading in Shanghai, according to a July 3 statement by the Bank
of Korea and the finance ministry. </p>
<p>The agreement also awarded South Korea an 80 billion yuan
($13 billion) quota for domestic investors to buy securities in
China under the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional
Investor program. Bank of Communications Co. was appointed as
the yuan clearing bank in Seoul. </p>
<p>South Korea residents held $40.67 billion in dollar-denominated deposits at the end of June, while those in yuan
were equivalent to $11.97 billion, central bank figures show.
Goldman''s Kwon estimates yuan savings in the country can rise
2.5 times during the next 18 months. </p>

Bank said it traded 1-month forward contracts directly with
Barclays Plc on July 28, while Kookmin Bank said it settled a
transaction with the Industrial  Commercial Bank of China Ltd.

<p>Rio Tinto Group Chief Executive
Officer Sam Walsh last week signaled that mining investor
attitudes toward spending on expansion are starting to shift
after a recovery in metals and share prices. </p>
<p>Investors have started to refocus on growth and expansion
plans rather than concentrating only on returns, Walsh, 64, said
at an industry event in Perth, Australia last week. Mining
companies should retain their focus on giving back excess cash
to shareholders and shy away from mergers and acquisitions, two
of the industry''s largest investors said. </p>
<p>It does seem slightly baffling for him to have come out
with that statement so early on really, James Sutton, a
portfolio manager at JPMorgan Asset Management''s $1.9 billion
Natural Resources Fund in London, said today in a phone
interview. In terms of the worst culprits of capital ill
discipline, I don''t think they''re off the leash yet. </p>
<p>Mining companies have been reining in spending after a $250
billion investment spree marked by poorly timed acquisitions and
asset writedowns sparked investor criticism. As a decade-long
boom in metal prices petered out, producers have focused on
preserving capital and bolstering dividends. </p>
<p>If you look at investors globally, there was certainly a
time when global investors were more focused on returns, Walsh
said. Since the beginning of this year, we''ve actually seen a
shift. I think it''s far more balanced; that we''ve now got
investors refocused on growth, expansion, as well as shareholder
returns. </p>
<h2>Damaging Strategies'' </h2>
<p>Walsh replaced Tom Albanese at the head of the world''s
second-largest mining company in January last year following
failed deals in coal and aluminum. He cut $2.3 billion from
costs last year and is seeking to a further reduction of $1
billion this year. </p>
<p>BlackRock Inc.''s Evy Hambro, who manages the $8 billion
World Mining Fund, said mining CEOs should maintain their
commitment to rewarding investors. Rio is the fourth-largest
holding in Hambro''s Fund at 7.7 percent. The 101-member
Bloomberg World Mining Index advanced 5.4 percent in July to
reach the highest monthly close in 16 months. </p>
<p>Given the recent strength in the sector, the market is
starting to acknowledge managements'' focus on returns for
shareholders, Hambro said in e-mailed comments yesterday. It
would be foolish for the executives and boards to put this
nascent recovery at risk by reverting back to the damaging
strategies of the last cycle. </p>
<p>A London-based spokesman for Rio declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Shareholders Important </h2>
<p>There''s been no change of strategy at Rio, Walsh said at
last week''s event. The company raised its dividend 15 percent in
February after reporting a 43 percent gain in second-half
profit. </p>
<p>Shareholder returns are very important to me and to the
company, he said. That''s why we''re in business: to provide
returns to our shareholders. We should never lose sight of that.
But it''s also, you know, long-term shareholders as well as
short-term shareholders. We need to get that balance right. </p>
<p>Analysts widely expect BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) and Rio to
announce share buybacks in the next six months. Macquarie Group
Ltd. analysts have said they''re not convinced a buyback is due
or that it would be a responsible use of funds for BHP. </p>
<p>Rio Tinto this week drew a line under one of its most
disastrous deals by selling its Mozambique coal assets for $50
million. The company bought the projects as part of a $3.7
billion purchase of Riversdale Mining Ltd. in 2011 before
writing them down by $3 billion last year. </p>
<p>I don''t think that the large-cap mining companies have
got the mandate from the generalist investor to go on an
acquisition spree any time soon, JPMorgan''s Sutton said.
They always have to consider their pipeline and to consider
the reserve lives of their various commodity exposures. So it
can''t carry on indefinitely, this halt to capex and
acquisitions. </p>
<p>The JPMorgan Natural Resources has Rio as its fifth-largest
holding, with a 4.6 percent weighting. </p>

All of these need to use storage in a big way, and thermal storage is the low-hanging fruit. </p> <p>Getting thermal storage to take off has been a slog, though, as building owners don''t want to invest in power savings that will accrue to their tenants, and utilities exempt most customers, especially residential ones, from pricing based on peak demand periods. Without those pricing cues, government tax breaks or subsidies may be needed to boost the use of ice tanks, said Jim Lazar, a utility consultant in Olympia, Washington, who wrote a report on integrating more renewables in the electric grid. </p>

<p>Mobileye NV (MBLY), which makes software to
avoid car accidents, overcame the worst global stock-market
selloff in almost five months to raise $890 million last week, a
record for an Israeli company going public in the U.S. </p>
<p>The shares soared 48 percent to $37 in New York on their
first day of trading on Aug. 1 after the company and existing
shareholders sold 35.6 million shares for $25 each, according to
a Mobileye statement. That was above the high end of the $21 to
$23 marketed range. </p>
<p>The Jerusalem-based company weathered the biggest rout in
global equities since March and a weekly drop of 1.8 percent in
the Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index. Mobileye commanded more
money from investors while only three of four Israeli
biotechnology firms completed planned initial public offerings
last week, with all either downsizing or pricing below their
target range. </p>
<p>Some of these IPOs which are in special industries are
trading in their own world, Josef Schuster, the founder of

<p>Chief Executive Officer Muhtar Kent is expanding in Africa
to capitalize on a growing middle class with more money to spend
on high-end soft drinks and juices. Nigeria and Kenya, among the
major economies in the region, consume fewer than 50 servings of
Coke''s beverages per person each year, compared with the 745
servings per individual consumed in Mexico. </p>
<p>Even as we see tremendous growth potential in Africa, we
know that the strength and sustainability of our business are
tied directly to the strength and sustainability of the African
communities we proudly serve, Kent said in the statement. </p>
<p>Coca-Cola is increasingly relying on overseas markets to
maintain growth as it contends with sluggish demand for drinks
such as juice and Diet Coke in North America. </p>
<p>The new investment will also be channeled into Coca-Cola''s
cooling and distribution equipment and production, its supply
chain across the continent, as well as supporting programs for
safe water access, sustainable sourcing and the economic
empowerment of women, the company said. </p>
<p>Kent also announced that the Coca-Cola Africa Foundation
will expand its Replenish Africa Initiative to reach an
additional four million African people through 2020. The
program, which works with public and private partners, supports
clean water access and sanitation initiatives across the region.
The new target is in addition to an existing goal of reaching
two million people by 2015. </p>

<p>Gordon McCulloch resigned as a
managing director of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM)''s European emerging
markets equity unit after more than four years at the U.S. bank. </p>
<p>McCulloch, a Russia specialist, departed last month after
joining JPMorgan in January 2010 from Moscow brokerage
Renaissance Capital, where he was deputy chief executive
officer. He was previously managing director at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. (G) in Russia. </p>
<p>I will be back in a role in due course, London-based
McCulloch said in an e-mailed response to questions. I am
taking some time out with the family now. </p>
<p>Kate Haywood, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in London,
declined to comment by e-mail. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s Russia''s equities head Vladimir Bril and the
equity sales head Alexey Kaminsky departed last month amid a
round of job cuts, people with knowledge of the matter have
said. The bank, which opened a representative office in Moscow
in 1973, cut some jobs in equity trading and equity research in
the Russian capital, said a third person. McCulloch said his
departure wasn''t related to Moscow job cuts. </p>

sanctions from the U.S. and the European Union against companies
and Vladimir Putin''s inner circle. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. won dismissal of
claims by Los Angeles accusing the bank''s Washington Mutual unit
of targeting minority borrowers with predatory loans, while a
judge said the allegations could be refiled against the parent
company. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles ruled that
while claims related to Washington Mutual Inc. were barred, the
city could revise the lawsuit to focus on Chase''s lending
practices during and after JPMorgan bought WaMu in 2008. The
city lumped Chase and WaMu loan information together in the
original complaint and has 21 days to refile the lawsuit
focusing on non-WaMu loans, Wright said. </p>
<p>The lawsuit is one of at least four filed by Los Angeles
against banks for allegedly flooding minority neighborhoods with
subprime mortgages even when residents qualified for better
terms. The city alleged the subprime loans drove up the number
of foreclosures in the city. Wells Fargo  Co. (WFC) lost a court bid
in May to dismiss a similar case brought by Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Los Angeles and other cities have explored legal means to
hold banks accountable for urban blight in the wake of the 2008
collapse of the U.S. housing market and financial crisis.
Homeowners in Los Angeles lost about $78.8 billion in home value
as the result of 200,000 foreclosures from 2008 through 2012,
the city said last year, citing a report by Alliance of
Californians for Community Empowerment and the California
Reinvestment Coalition. The lost property tax revenue to the
city has been $481 million, according to the complaints. </p>
<p>We are pleased with this decision, and we will continue
to carry out our strong commitment to Los Angeles residents,
Suzanne Ryan, a spokeswoman for New York-based JPMorgan, said in
an e-mail. </p>
<p>Frank Mateljan, a spokesman for Los Angeles City Attorney
Michael Feuer, said the city is weighing whether to appeal the
ruling. </p>
<p>In the meantime we are aggressively pursuing our claims
against JPMorgan Chase, he said by phone. </p>

14-cv-04168, U.S. District Court, Central District of California
(Los Angeles). </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS), becoming as famous for Marvel superheroes as for Mickey Mouse, posted third-quarter profit that beat analysts'' estimates, fueled by box-office hits. </p> <p>Net income rose to $2.25 billion, or $1.28 a share, from $1.85 billion, or $1.01, a year earlier, Burbank, California-based Disney said yesterday in a statement. That beat the $1.16-a-share average of 28 analysts'' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Disney, the world''s largest entertainment company, had two of the biggest films for the quarter that ended June 30, with Marvel''s Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Maleficent, according to Box Office Mojo. Guardians of the Galaxy, also from Marvel, opened last weekend with $94.3 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters, the best ever for an August release. </p> <p>People said it came out of nowhere because those characters were not well known, Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said of the latest film, in an interview with Bloomberg Television yesterday. The title was not well known, but the Marvel brand has become something that, at least in the consumer''s eyes, really means something and should be trusted. </p> <p>Revenue increased 7.7 percent to $12.5 billion, surpassing the $12.1 billion estimate, Disney said. </p> <h2>Frozen'' DVDs </h2> <p>Operating income at the film studio more than doubled to $411 million, the biggest gain among the company''s five divisions. Frozen, the hit 2013 movie, continued to deliver profit in home video and international theaters. </p> <p>Disney''s consumer products unit, which also benefits from Marvel-themed products, posted a 25 percent rise in profit to $273 million, while revenue grew 16 percent. </p> <p>The acquisitions of Marvel in 2009 and Lucasfilm in 2012 has brought to Disney new material to attract teenage boys to its films, as well as characters for its toys, TV networks and theme parks. The film studio is well positioned for at least the next five years, Iger said. </p> <p>The results were strong across most of Disney''s businesses, according to Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst with Barclays Plc. </p> <p>While the media networks business was roughly in line with our estimates, the company''s parks, studio, consumer products and even interactive businesses showed strength, Venkateshwar wrote in a research note. </p> <h2>Theme Parks </h2> <p>Disney gets the bulk of its profit from its TV division. Operating income at the unit, which includes ESPN, ABC and the Disney Channel, was little changed at $2.3 billion, as sports programming costs increased. While ABC earnings increased, profit at the much larger cable operation fell 7 percent because of higher costs at ESPN, the sale of a U.K. unit at ESPN and the shift in the timing of some revenue. </p> <p>Profit at Disney''s parks increased 23 percent to $848 million, with attendance and guest spending up at its domestic resorts. The company raised daily admission prices at its Magic Kingdom park in Orlando, Florida, twice in the past year, to $99 from $89, and benefited from the later Easter holiday, which pulled business into the quarter. Disney also is in the second year of introducing electronic wristbands that make purchases easier in the parks. </p> <p>The interactive unit, which makes video games, reported a profit of $29 million, compared with a year-earlier loss, fueled by sales of the company''s Infinity gaming system. </p> <p>Disney''s shares fell 0.2 percent to $86.59 at the close in New York today, giving them a gain this year of 13 percent. </p> <p> ', 'Disney Profit Tops Estimates as Hit Films Spark Studio', 'By Christopher Palmeri', 'Aug 06, 2014  5:06 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-06/disney-profit-tops-estimates-as-hit-films-spark-studio.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Iron ore will extend a drop through
2015 when an increase in seaborne supply that''s spurred a global
glut is set to accelerate, said Goldman Sachs Group Inc. </p>
<p>While the expansion in supply will probably moderate in the
second half of 2014, the trend rate of growth in seaborne
cargoes exceeds demand by a ratio of three to one, the bank said
in a report dated today. Goldman kept its forecast for the
steelmaking raw material at an average of $80 a metric ton in
2015 from $106 this year. </p>
<p>Prices have tumbled 29 percent in 2014 as companies from
Rio Tinto Group to BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) increased output, betting
higher volumes will more than offset falling prices. Deutsche
Bank AG and Morgan Stanley see lower rates through 2016.
Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. has said it''s completed a $9.2
billion expansion to boost annual output to 155 million tons. </p>
<p>The shift to oversupply started barely six months ago and
the adjustment phase is far from over, said Goldman analysts
Christian Lelong and Amber Cai. Seaborne supply is set to
accelerate again in 2015 while Chinese steel production growth
slows further. </p>
<p>Ore with 62 percent content delivered to Tianjin increased
0.4 percent to $95.90 a dry ton today, according to data from
The Steel Index Ltd. Prices entered a bear market in March and
dropped to $89 on June 16, the lowest level since September
2012. China buys 67 percent of global seaborne supply. </p>
<h2>Labor Dispute </h2>
<p>While mining companies plan to boost shipments, a labor
dispute over leave and wages threatens to disrupt cargoes at
Australia''s Port Hedland, the world''s largest bulk terminal.
Tugboat engineers intend to strike for four hours each on Aug.
9, Aug. 11 and Aug. 13, says Teekay Shipping (Australia) Pty,
which is contracted by BHP Billiton Ltd. to tow vessels. </p>
<p>The action would mean that half of the day''s shipping is
lost, Ian Roper, a Singapore-based analyst at CLSA Ltd., said
by phone, estimating the strike would disrupt about 2.2 million
tons of supply. That''s not a great amount. Fundamental wise,
there''s still an awful lot of supply. </p>
<p>Fortescue and BHP estimate such a disruption may cost users
about $93 million a day. Port Hedland shipments made up 55
percent of Australia''s total ore exports last year and about a
quarter of global seaborne trade, Bloomberg calculations based
on Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics data show. Iron ore
is the country''s biggest export earner. </p>
<h2>High Tide </h2>
<p>Given the short duration of the stoppages and the glut, the
strike will probably not materially impact the seaborne market
or prices, Morgan Stanley said in a report today. If conducted
at high tide, each four-hour stoppage could affect as much as
500,000 tons, or 1.5 percent of monthly volumes, analysts
including Joel Crane said. </p>
<p>The outlook from Goldman contrasts with the view from
Westpac Banking Corp.''s senior economist Justin Smirk, who said
prices will rally and peak at $123 in the second quarter. </p>
<p>We are likely to see softer near-term growth in ore
supply overall as Chinese and other sources of ore moderate
production, Smirk wrote in a report today. Any near-term
upside surprise in demand will be a positive for prices. </p>
<p>Iron ore rose in July for a second straight month on
speculation that China''s demand for imports was improving,
helping to absorb a global surplus as local supplies in the
largest buyer are displaced. </p>
<p>Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. predicted a dramatic recovery in
prices in second half, saying that it''s now cheaper for steel
mills in China to buy seaborne supply rather than domestic
material. Citigroup Inc. said in June prices will rebound as the
daily closure of mines supplying high-cost output in China
boosts demand for seaborne shipments. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley beat Deutsche Bank (DBK) AG
to become the most profitable foreign securities firm in Japan
last fiscal year as the country''s stock-market rally boosted
brokerage commissions and underwriting fees. </p>
<p>The U.S. firm''s Japanese unit reported net income of 30.6
billion yen ($298 million) in the year ended March as revenue
jumped 20 percent from a year earlier to 127.2 billion yen, the
highest among 11 global banks operating in the country,
regulatory filings show. Deutsche Bank''s Japan profit surged
more than four times to 30.3 billion yen, driven by structured-product sales and cost cuts. </p>
<p>Combined revenue at the 11 foreign firms rose 23 percent as
overseas investors flocked to Japanese stocks after Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to revive the economy with stimulus
measures and deregulation. At the same time, the rally wasn''t
enough to persuade the banks to add employees, with staff levels
falling 6.4 percent to the lowest in at least three years,
according to the filings. </p>
<p>Foreign brokerages reaped the benefits of Abenomics last
year, thanks to overseas hedge funds that aggressively bought
Japan stocks, said Katsunobu Komizo, president of Tokyo-based
Executive Search Partners Co., Japan''s biggest banking
recruitment firm. </p>
<p>Despite posting higher revenue, Morgan Stanley (MS)''s net income
from Japan fell 7.8 percent in the fiscal year as personnel
costs rose and it moved into new headquarters in Tokyo. </p>
<h2>Higher Revenue </h2>
<p>Combined revenue climbed to 719.3 billion yen, according to
the filings from Bank of America Corp., Barclays Plc, BNP
Paribas SA, Citigroup Inc. (C), Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche
Bank, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS), JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM), Morgan
Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG. (UBSN) Total net
income more than tripled to 98 billion yen. </p>
<p>The banks'' headcount fell by 428 to 6,258, the statements
to the Financial Services Agency showed. New York-based Morgan
Stanley was the only firm to increase staff, boosting the number
by five to 680. </p>
<p>Komizo said global firms in Tokyo focused on reducing
senior banker and management positions last year to shed a
costly top-heavy structure. They are now seeking to add junior
staff for investment banking, including mergers advice, he said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley, which operates in Japan through ventures
with its largest shareholder, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group
Inc. (8306), was ranked second among managers of Japanese share sales
in the year ended March, trailing only Nomura Holdings Inc.
after arranging transactions including the global initial public
offering of Suntory Beverage  Food Ltd. (2587) Morgan Stanley was the
top adviser of Japanese mergers and acquisitions. </p>
<h2>Bearing Fruit </h2>
<p>The alliance with Mitsubishi UFJ continues to bear
fruit, Jonathan Kindred, chief executive officer of Morgan
Stanley MUFG Securities Co., said in an e-mailed statement. As
Japanese corporations and institutional investors become more
globally minded, we see substantial opportunities to serve our
clients as well as grow our businesses. </p>
<p>Revenue at Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank''s Japan brokerage
climbed 21 percent to 93.9 billion yen, the second highest of
the 11 firms. Operating expenses including personnel costs fell
8.1 percent, its filing showed. Sales in both fixed income and
equities businesses were strong, the unit said in a statement. </p>
<p>We see increasingly strong interest from Japanese
institutional investors in foreign assets, Makoto Kuwahara,
CEO of Deutsche Securities Inc., said in an e-mailed statement. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s Japan unit posted a 9 percent increase in
revenue to 84.7 billion yen, its filing showed. Net income more
than doubled to 9.8 billion yen. </p>
<h2>Investment Banking </h2>
<p>Bank of America''s revenue advanced 37 percent to 71.9
billion yen. Net income dropped 84 percent to 7.3 billion yen
after the sale of a stake in a private bank bolstered the
previous year''s earnings. </p>
<p>Foreign investors who traded through brokerages accounted
for 58 percent of transactions on the Tokyo Stock Exchange last
year, according to the bourse. While the Nikkei 225 (NKY) Stock
Average jumped 57 percent to a six-year high in 2013, it has
since lost about 7 percent as investors grow wary that Abe''s
economic agenda will deliver a sustainable recovery. </p>
<p>Investment banking remains promising for foreign firms as
Japanese companies look to expand abroad, said Komizo at
Executive Search Partners. Japan stock and bond sales rose last
fiscal year, while MA fell, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>There''s more room for activity to increase, Komizo
said. Companies need the expertise of foreign firms to help
them make global acquisitions and raise funds. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) and OAO Rosneft (ROSN),
the world''s largest publicly traded oil companies by output,
will start drilling a $700 million well in the Arctic Ocean
today, undeterred by the crisis in U.S.-Russian relations. </p>
<p>Vladimir Putin, Rosneft Chief Executive Officer Igor Sechin, who''s subject to U.S. sanctions, and Exxon''s Russia head
Glenn Waller will bless the start of Russia''s northernmost well,
the government said yesterday. It''s the first step in a quest
for new oil resources to help maintain oil production near a
post-Soviet high of more than 10 million barrels a day. </p>
<p>The European Union imposed a third round of sanctions last
week, restricting the export of equipment used for offshore oil
production to Russia after its relations with Europe and the
U.S. deteriorated to the lowest point since the Cold War over
the conflict in Ukraine. That hasn''t stopped Exxon because the
contract to hire the rig was signed before the measures were
announced. </p>
<p>In the area of oil, the sanctions are more symbolic
perhaps at this stage, but if they remain in place for a long
period then they will have some significant consequences, said
John Lough, a London-based associate fellow at Chatham House, a
London-based foreign policy research group. </p>
<p>The partners plan to drill the Universitetskaya prospect
after more than two years of planning. Exxon, where output fell
to a five-year low in the second quarter, isn''t the only western
oil company involved. BP Plc, the U.K.''s second-largest oil
company by value, has an interest through its 20 percent stake
in Rosneft. </p>
<h2>West Alpha </h2>
<p>Universitetskaya is the first of as many as 40 offshore
wells Rosneft plans by 2018 to test the potential of the
unexplored the Arctic Ocean. The geological structure targeted
by the drilling is roughly the size of the city of Moscow and
may contain as many as 9 billion barrels of oil, according to a
presentation on Rosneft''s website. </p>
<p>The West Alpha rig, leased by Exxon from Bermuda-based
Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL), is currently in the Kara Sea about 72 miles off
the coast of Novaya Zemlya, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Drilling will take about 70 days, a period that should be
sufficient to assess the reserves of any discovery, Rosneft''s
head of offshore, Zeljko Runje, said on a call with analysts
last week. The area is relatively free of icebergs, meaning work
is ready to start, he said. </p>
<p>Tensions with Russia will make companies pay more attention
to risk, said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects
Ltd. in London. </p>
<h2>Ecologically Sensitive'' </h2>
<p>In addition to the political background, drilling in the
Arctic Ocean is controversial because campaigners say it
threatens a unique ecosystem. </p>
<p>The West Alpha platform is fast becoming the most
controversial oil rig in the world, Gustavo Ampugnani, an
Arctic campaigner at Greenpeace, said in an e-mailed statement.
The companies'' plan to drill in the ecologically sensitive
Arctic is nothing less than absurd. </p>
<p>The Exxon-Rosneft cooperation also includes a $300 million
investment in Russian shale pilot projects, which now risk being
suspended, Rosneft Chairman Alexander Nekipelov said on July 29.
The partners have also invested in a new platform this year to
expand oil production at the Sakhalin-1 project in Russia''s Far
East. </p>

<p>The Securities and Exchange
Commission is reviewing whether conflicts of interest led
JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) to sell certain investment products to
individual clients, according to a person briefed on the matter. </p>
<p>The review is at an early stage, said the person, who asked
to remain anonymous because the inquiry isn''t public. The Wall
Street Journal, in a report on the review earlier today, said
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has conducted a
similar probe into whether JPMorgan inappropriately steered
private-banking clients into its own products. </p>
<p>Banks can capture a greater portion of fees by having
clients invest in their own products. In some cases, they can
also offer better-than-average performance. New York-based
JPMorgan said in February that 80 percent of its fixed-income
assets under management and 81 percent of its equity assets were
in funds that were in the top 40 percent of peers over the
previous 10 years. </p>
<p>We manage a variety of portfolios based on a client''s
investment objectives, and the mix of solutions varies, is
dynamic and transparent, said Darin Oduyoye, a JPMorgan
spokesman. Our clients have countless options in selecting
financial providers. They come to JPMorgan because of our long-term investments track record and the depth and breadth of our
platform. </p>
<p>Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the SEC, couldn''t be
immediately reached for comment. Bryan Hubbard, an OCC
spokesman, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Unit Performance </h2>
<p>Private banking, which caters to wealthy individual
clients, generated more than half of JPMorgan''s $5.73 billion in
asset-management revenue in the first six months of this year.
The unit accounted for $383 billion in assets under management,
or 22 percent of the division''s $1.7 trillion total. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s asset-management business, led by Mary Callahan Erdoes, generated $993 million of net income in the first half
of 2014, the lowest among the largest U.S. bank''s four major
divisions. The unit''s 22 percent return on equity was the
highest of the four. </p>
<p>JPMorgan set aside $669 million for legal expenses in the
second quarter. The lender agreed to pay $23 billion in
penalties and settlements last year, leading to its first
quarterly loss under Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon. </p>

<p>IBM''s engineers have come up with a way computer chips can think more like humans. </p> <p>International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) said it''s produced a chip that more closely replicates the way the human brain operates than traditional processors do. The new architecture is better at tasks like image recognition in video data -- which could be a new way to help computers sense movement. On top of that, the chip uses less energy than traditional designs. </p> <p>If the design eventually turns into a product, it could help the processor industry, which is searching for new ways to make its products run computers faster. It''s increasingly turning to new methods of trying to perform multiple tasks at the same time, since traditional designs that simply counted faster have led to overheating. </p> <p>IBM said that traditional computer science, which uses linear logic to process data, is inefficient. Processors basically perform one operation at a time, then react to the result of the previous calculation. The computer chip IBM has developed, described in a paper in the journal Science, has 1 million programmable neurons based on 5.4 billion transistors. Its neurosynaptic cores can each compute and communicate in parallel, rather than in a row. </p> <p>IBM''s statement on the chip design didn''t contain information about when the technology would go into commercial production or go on sale. </p> <p>The company''s labs are so renowned in the industry that titans like Samsung use its technology for their production. That reputation in research hasn''t translated to a leadership position in the chip business, which is dominated by Intel Corp. </p> <h2>Balancing Needs </h2> <p>IBM has had to balance two distinct needs when it comes to its semiconductor business: having control over chip design to make its hardware products better and more efficient, though wanting to get the money-losing manufacturing unit off its books. The division loses as much as $1.5 billion a year, a person familiar with the matter said in June. </p> <p>The company was willing to pay Globalfoundries Inc. about $1 billion to take the chip-manufacturing unit of its hands -- an offer that was turned down for being $1 billion too short, a person familiar with the talks said this month. </p> <p> ', 'IBM Chip Inspired by Human Brain Can Sense Images, Cut Energy', 'By Ian King and Alex Barinka', 'Aug 08, 2014 12:16 PM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-08/ibm-chip-inspired-by-human-brain-can-sense-images-cut-energy.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>The days of paying different prices
for the same stock in Hong Kong and Shanghai are numbered,
according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Valuation gaps between dual-listed shares will disappear as
an exchange link between the two cities leads to the creation of
a one-China market, Jonathan Garner, the head of Asia and
emerging-market strategy at Morgan Stanley, said in a Bloomberg
Television interview in Hong Kong today. Yuan-denominated A
shares on the mainland are valued at a discount of about 7
percent versus Hong Kong counterparts, known as H shares,
according to the Hang Seng China AH Premium Index. </p>
<p>We''re looking for A-H stock price convergence, Garner
said. Over time, the gaps will effectively come down to
zero, he said. </p>
<p>While the Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) has rebounded 11 percent
since mid-March on speculation government stimulus will revive
growth in the world''s second-largest economy, the gauge has
lagged behind a 20 percent surge in the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI) of H shares. The planned tie-up, scheduled to
start around October, will give foreign investors unprecedented
access to the mainland market while opening a route for wealthy
Chinese investors to buy Hong Kong stocks. </p>
<p>Trading rules for A shares through the exchange link needs
to be more similar to Hong Kong for investors to be interested,
the city''s brokers told Shanghai bourse executives at a meeting
today, said Martin Sin, an assistant to lawmaker Christopher
Cheung, who represents securities firms. Hong Kong brokers want
day trading of A shares when the link starts, he said. </p>
<h2>Bourses Link </h2>
<p>The Shanghai Composite dropped 0.1 percent to close at
2,221.60 today, while the Hang Seng China index added 0.2
percent. The Hang Seng China AH Premium Index slid 1 percent to
92.32, signaling a widening gap between dual-listed stocks. </p>
<p>The $5.5 billion iShares China Large-Cap ETF, which tracks
Hong Kong-listed securities, slipped 0.4 percent to $40.86 at
9:51 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>The Shanghai measure jumped to an eight-month high
yesterday as a report showed inflation was subdued last month,
giving policy makers more scope to ease policy. Data tomorrow
will probably show industrial output growth in July kept pace
with June''s 9.2 percent gain, which was the biggest for a single
month since December, while growth in fixed-asset investment
excluding rural households picked up to 17.4 percent in the
first seven months, according to Bloomberg News surveys. </p>
<p>Valuation gaps between the two exchanges reached the widest
since 2006 on July 23 as mainland investors exited the stock
market and international money managers awaited details of the
exchange tie-up. </p>
<h2>HSBC, AIA </h2>
<p>A survey conducted by CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets of 401
mainland investors showed 77 percent of them aren''t interested
in investing in Hong Kong stocks through the link. The biggest
obstacle is the minimum account requirement of 500,000 yuan
($81,222), CLSA analysts David Murphy and Lei Chen wrote in a
report dated yesterday. </p>
<p>Nearly half of them say the threshold is too high, the
analysts wrote. If there were no funding threshold, the share
of potential investors could expand to over 90 percent. </p>
<p>While the system won''t be perfect, the exchanges are
pushing forward because the tie-up will help open up China''s
markets and boost Hong Kong''s role as a global financial hub,
Charles Li, the chief executive officer of Hong Kong Exchanges 
Clearing Ltd., wrote in a blog posting this week. </p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and billionaire Li Ka-Shing''s Cheung Kong

mainland investors, CLSA and Morgan Stanley (MS) said. Cheung Kong

Group Ltd. (1299), the second-largest Asia-based insurer, offer very
interesting geographic exposure that you can''t get onshore,

the financial products it bought for the church, even as the
trusts bore all of the risk. During one seven-year stretch

were worth as much as $39.2 million, declined to $31.6 million,
according to the filing. </p>

<p>     Aug. 13 (Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Chevron has taken
another step away from its renewable-energy efforts, putting a
pair of solar projects at its Kapolei refinery in West Oahu,
Hawaii, on indefinite hold. </p>
<p>The tabled projects, first reported earlier this week by
Pacific Business News, include a farm of solar panels that would
have spanned almost five acres, supplying as much as 1 megawatt
of electricity to the local utility. Chevron also shelved a
demonstration solar thermal project, which would have covered
about 15 acres and used mirrors to generate steam to help power
the Hawaii refinery. </p>
<p>In recent months, Chevron, the second-biggest oil company in
the U.S., has quietly been pulling back from renewable-energy
endeavors, despite a long-promoted commitment to develop what its
corporate website calls newer, cleaner ways to power the world. </p>
<p>In May, Bloomberg Businessweek reported that Chevron
shuttered a business unit that had surpassed internal profit
targets by helping to launch large-scale solar and geothermal
power projects. In June, we wrote about the sale of its key
renewable-energy subsidiary, Chevron Energy Solutions, to Oaktree
Capital Management. </p>
<p>Each of the Hawaii projects would have reduced carbon
dioxide emissions by about 5,000 tons and contributed to Hawaii''s
goal of generating 70 percent of its energy from renewable
sources by 2030, according to Chevron''s filings with the state. </p>
<p>Instead, they''re being put on hold as the oil company
focuses its resources on other projects, such as its $54 billion
liquefied natural gas plant in Australia, a company spokesman
told Pacific Business News . </p>
<p>Reached by e-mail, Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson
confirmed that the company has put its Hawaiian solar plants on
hold. </p>
<p>Chevron''s pullback on renewables has come amid increasing
concern that climate change and carbon constraints threaten
fossil-fuel companies. Many organizations, including the
International Energy Agency, estimate that as much as two-thirds
of fossil-fuel reserves will need to remain unburned if the world
is to avoid the most severe consequences of climate change.</p>

<p>Russian companies are set to seize
on sliding asset prices to buy back their bonds, helping stem
the third-biggest rout in emerging markets, according to Morgan
Stanley and Erste Sparinvest. </p>
<p>Steelmaker OAO Severstal and Far East Shipping Co., whose
cash piles both amount to 1.1 times short-term debt obligations,
are among companies with an incentive to buy back bonds,
Morgan Stanley said in a report two days ago. Corporate notes
slid 5 percent since new U.S. penalties limited access of some
Russian companies to dollar funding on July 16, the most after
Ukraine and Venezuela among more than 50 countries in the
Bloomberg USD Emerging Market Corporate Bond Index. (BEMC) </p>
<p>European Union sanctions late last month further curbed
appetite for Russian assets amid a worsening of the crisis in
Ukraine, leaving companies grappling for new funding sources.
Severstal, which in May repurchased $288 million of two
Eurobonds, is considering using about $1 billion of proceeds
from an asset sale to lower debt, including possibly a buyback,
Chief Executive Officer Alexey Mordashov said on July 30. </p>
<p>It could put a very strong floor in the market, Peter Varga, who manages $750 million in emerging-market corporate
bonds at Erste Sparinvest in Vienna, said by e-mail yesterday.
It''s basically a good option to buy back bonds trading at a
discount. </p>
<h2>Bond Selloff </h2>
<p>Severstal''s $750 million of securities due in October 2022
slid as much as 4.37 cents from July 16 to a three-month low of
94.50 cents on Aug. 7, sending the yield up to 6.79 percent. The
2018 debt of Far East Shipping lost 14.9 cents to 67.5 cents in
the period. </p>
<p>There will be some cash-rich, non-sanctioned corporates
using this opportunity to buy back debt, thus providing some
support for Russian corporate credit, Morgan Stanley said in its
research note. </p>
<p>The press office for Far East Shipping declined to comment
in e-mailed responses to questions from Bloomberg News.
Severstal''s press service declined to comment. </p>
<p>Buybacks will help companies lower debt and boost
accounting gains, particularly if they expect the conflict in
Ukraine will get resolved, Lutz Roehmeyer, who helps manage
about $1.1 billion of emerging-market assets at Landesbank
Berlin Investment GmbH, said by e-mail yesterday. </p>
<h2>No Visibility'' </h2>
<p>In the market rout that followed President Vladimir Putin''s
annexation of Ukraine''s Crimea peninsula in March, companies
including Severstal turned the slump in asset prices to their
advantage by repurchasing debt. </p>
<p>While companies may benefit in the short term, a prolonged
standoff poses risks, according to Roehmeyer and Dorothea Froehlich, a Zurich-based money manager at MainFirst Schweiz AG. </p>
<p>Russia retaliated last week against sanctions with a food-import ban on products from the U.S., EU, Australia, Canada and
Norway. Tension escalated yesterday as Ukraine blocked a Russian
aid convoy from crossing into its territory. </p>
<p>There is no visibility on how long the standoff with the
West will continue, Froehlich, who helps oversee $750 million
in emerging-market assets, including Russian corporate bonds,
said by e-mail yesterday. In such an environment, you don''t
want to spend cash. You hoard it. </p>
<p>OAO Gazprom Neft, which was listed in Morgan Stanley''s
note, sees no benefit from buying back bonds, Chief Financial
Officer Alexey Yankevich said on a conference call yesterday.
OAO Phosagro, another company cited in the report, doesn''t plan
to buy back Eurobonds, the company''s press service said
yesterday. The fertilizer producer''s bonds due in February 2018
fell 4.1 cents on the dollar this month to 94.8 cents by 3:22
p.m. in Moscow. </p>
<p>It''s basically a good option to buy back bonds for
companies with surplus funds, or those having low indebtedness
with good cash flow and with good access to financing, Varga of
Erste Sparinvest said. </p>

<p>There are simple exchange-traded
fund strategies (buy gold) and more-ambitious exchange-traded fund strategies (dynamically allocate across a basket
of assets based on historical price momentum and volatility.) </p>
<p>ALPS Distributors Inc. offers simple ETFs like the U.S. Oil
Fund (strategy: buy oil, basically) as well as the more-ambitious varieties, such as those of the dynamically allocating
persuasion. Except investors weren''t allocating funds to those
ambitious ETFs in a dynamic fashion, even though they were
advertised as a way to gain access to Goldman Sachs''
expertise. As a result ALPS is euthanizing them. </p>
<p>So here is their obituary: The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder
Index ETF series, an ambitious group of securities that
attempted to outsmart the market by licensing Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. strategies based on historical price momentum,
volatility and correlation, died this month after a lifelong
battle with investor disinterest. They were less than 2 years
old. </p>
<p>None of the four ETFs has more than about $3.4 million in
assets. While not all of them performed terribly, neither did
they perform, uh, dynamically. Which is kind of sad, really, if
you believe in old-fashioned notions like the powers of math and
that the biggest brains on Wall Street can outfox the mailman
who puts his whole 401(k) into the Vanguard 500 Index Fund. </p>
<h2>Wet Screens </h2>
<p>Now, some may shake their fists in the air and curse at a
market perceived to be hypnotized into marching in a straight
line by the magic wand of the Federal Reserve. And maybe that''s
a fair reaction, but at the end of it all you''re left with is
tired fist and maybe some spittle on three or four of your
computer screens. </p>
<p>Anyway, here''s what the back of the baseball cards would
look like for the Goldman-inspired funds (for comparison, note
that the SP 500 -- arguably not the best benchmark to compare
each of these to, but let''s do it anyway --  has returned about
40 percent including dividends since these ETFs started trading
in December 2012): </p>
<p>*The ALPS/GS Risk-Adjusted Return U.S. Large Cap Index ETF (GSRA)
did the best since inception, returning 38 percent, less than
the 41 percent gain in the Russell 1000 Index from which it
picks its stocks. Selection criteria included average analyst
price estimates adjusted by volatility, with sectors showing
lower anticipated risk getting a higher allocation. Its expense
ratio is 0.55 percent, compared with 0.15 percent for the
iShares Russell 1000 ETF. Top holdings: Pharmacyclics Inc.,
Cameron International Corp., Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc. and
Madison Square Garden Co. (Goldman''s risk modelers are,
presumably, not Knicks fans.) </p>
<h2>Baseball Cards </h2>
<p>*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Multi-Asset Index ETF (GSMA)
returned 9.5 percent since inception and had an expense ratio of
0.68 percent. This is an ETF squared since it only holds
four other ETFs tracking real-estate, emerging markets stocks,
Treasuries maturing in more than 20 years and Latin American
equities. </p>
<p>*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Growth Markets Equities and
U.S. Treasuries Index ETF. This baseball card will not be a
collector''s item: the fund has returned negative 11 percent
since inception. It holds ETFs tracking stocks in India, Brazil,
Turkey and Indonesia and just a dash (0.2 percent) of long-maturity Treasuries. </p>
<p>*The ALPS/GS Momentum Builder Asia ex-Japan and U.S.
Treasuries Index ETF lost 2.7 percent on a total-return basis
since inception. </p>
<p>On consideration of current market conditions, as well as
prospects for growth in the funds'' assets, the board determined
that it was in the best interests of the funds and their
shareholders to liquidate the funds'' shares, ALPS said
yesterday in statement. </p>
<p>For sure, the ALPS/GS offerings aren''t the only momentum
funds struggling to catch lightning in a bottle from past high-flying stocks. The $12.4 million SPDR SP 1500 Momentum Tilt ETF (MMTM)
has returned 42 percent since its inception in 2012, which is
pretty sweet but not as sweet as the almost 44 percent return
for the SP 1500 itself. Neither have the $313 million iShares
MSCI USA Momentum Index ETF or the AQR Momentum Fund blown the
doors off large, mid and small-cap benchmarks since their
inceptions. </p>
<p>The 16 U.S. momentum ETFs have a total of $3.7 billion in
assets yet have only taken in $57 million this year, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The lesson to take away, if it''s not obvious by now, is
that catching lightning in a ETF jar is not easy no matter how
dynamically you allocate. </p>

<p>An Indianapolis church sued JPMorgan
Chase  Co. (JPM), accusing the bank of fraud, self-dealing and
mismanagement of its trust accounts. </p>
<p>The Christ Church Cathedral claimed the world''s fourth-biggest bank selected unsuitable and poorly performing
investments to further its own financial interests and, as a
result, breached both state and federal securities laws. </p>
<p>The bank caused the church trusts to lose approximately
$13 million in value as a result of JPMorgan''s decisions to
purchase over 177 different investment products, mostly from
itself, using church funds, from July 2004 to December 2013,
the plaintiffs said in the complaint filed yesterday. </p>

<h2>Compliance Action </h2>
<h2>U.S. Banks Said to Get Enforcement Letters in FX-Rigging Probes </h2>
<p>Banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co., Citigroup Inc. (C) and
Morgan Stanley (MS) have been notified that regulators are preparing
enforcement actions on currency rigging, people familiar with
the investigation said. </p>
<p>Talks are progressing between banks, the U.S. Federal
Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to
settle investigations into alleged manipulation of foreign-exchange markets, according to two people who asked not to be
identified because the discussions are private. Some firms have
received so-called 15-day letters outlining the agencies''
findings and warning that enforcement actions are likely, the
people said. </p>
<p>Enforcement actions can range from cease-and-desist orders
to fines to banning bankers from the industry. The letters
typically detail the investigators'' findings and give recipients
about 15 days to offer a written defense. Such notices usually
open a final stage of settlement negotiations. </p>
<p>U.S. regulators are coordinating with the U.K.''s Financial
Conduct Authority to settle some of the probes by November,
according to two people. The FCA is in settlement talks with
firms including Barclays Plc, Citigroup, HSBC Holdings Plc,
JPMorgan, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) and UBS AG. It
scheduled meetings with some banks for as soon as next month to
discuss penalties, the people said. </p>

<h2>Corinthian Subpoenaed for Records on Student Outcomes, Debt </h2>
<p>Corinthian Colleges Inc. (COCO), the for-profit chain in the
process of selling or shutting its campuses, received a federal
grand jury subpoena seeking records on student-loan defaults and
job placement. </p>
<p>The Aug. 8 subpoena also seeks information on graduation
rates, the transferability of student credits and marketing
materials, according to a regulatory filing yesterday. </p>
<p>Corinthian, which served about 72,000 students as of last
month when it agreed to a government plan to shut down or sell
its 107 campuses, is facing allegations in multiple states of
falsifying job placement and marketing data. The Santa Ana,
California-based company is evaluating the subpoena and intends
to cooperate fully with the request, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Corinthian''s downfall accelerated in June when the U.S.
Education Department imposed a 21-day waiting period for it to
draw on the federal student aid that accounts for almost all its
revenue. </p>
<p>There can be no assurance that the company will be able
to obtain any such additional needed liquidity on a timely

<h2>Barclays Seen Facing $2 Billion More in 2014 Conduct Charges </h2>
<p>Barclays Plc (BARC) faces costs of as much as 1.2 billion pounds
($2 billion) for its alleged rigging of currency markets, lying
to clients about its U.S. dark pool and mis-selling interest-rate swaps, Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd. said. </p>
<p>The U.K.''s second-largest lender may incur a 700 million-pound charge to settle a foreign-exchange probe with regulators
and a further 200 million pounds relating to a U.S.
investigation into its private-trading venue, Chirantan Barua,
an analyst at Bernstein in London, said in a note yesterday. The
bank might reach settlements by the end of 2014, he said. </p>
<p>Barclays is part of a group of banks in talks with the
U.K.''s Financial Conduct Authority to reach a settlement in the
currency-rigging probe, while fighting a U.S. lawsuit accusing
it of falsifying marketing materials to hide the presence of
high-frequency traders in its dark pool. </p>
<p>The scandals are undermining Chief Executive Officer Antony
Jenkins''s attempts to reform the culture of a bank after it was
fined 290 million pounds in 2012 for rigging the Libor benchmark
interest rate. </p>
<p>London-based Barclays may also set aside 300 million pounds
in the second half to compensate customers improperly sold
interest-rate hedging products, Barua estimates. The bank didn''t
make further provisions for redress in the first half. </p>
<p>Other British lenders are also struggling with rising
provisions for misconduct. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc,
Britain''s largest state-owned lender, may face as much as 1
billion pounds in charges to settle the allegations of currency
market manipulation, Barua wrote in an separate Aug. 11 report. </p>

court filing this week. </p>
<p>In April, a federal judge ruled that SP could seek

<h2>Paul Singer Gets OK to Follow Argentina Money Trail to Nevada </h2>
<p>Billionaire Paul Singer, the hedge fund founder seeking to
collect on more than $1.5 billion in judgments over Argentina''s
defaulted bonds, may search Nevada for some of that money, a
judge ruled. </p>
<p>Singer asked a Las Vegas court in April to order 123
companies in Nevada to turn over information about assets
belonging to Argentine businessman Lazaro Baez, who is accused
in that country of embezzling $65 million from government
contracts. U.S. Magistrate Judge Cam Ferenbach in Reno granted
that request Aug. 11, ruling that Singer''s hedge fund was
attempting to execute a valid judgment against Argentina. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that the 123 companies are shell
corporations, Ferenbach said in an order. Similarly, there
is no doubt that shell corporations are routinely formed to
commit fraud. </p>
<p>Singer''s decade-long quest to recoup on investments in
Argentina''s debt peaked last month when the country went into
default for the second time in 13 years after talks broke down
with some creditors. Singer leads a group of hedge funds owed
more than $1.5 billion from the country''s 2001 default. A
federal judge in New York barred Argentina from paying on
restructured debt until it satisfies Singer''s group. </p>
<p>In his order, Ferenbach wrote that Argentina''s failure so
far to satisfy judgments won by Singer''s NML Capital has caused
the company to travel the globe in search of property owned by
Argentina. </p>

<h2>Amazon''s Prices Seen Holding Regulators at Bay in Hachette Spat </h2>
<p>Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)''s treatment of customers means more to U.S.
antitrust authorities than how the largest Web retailer
pressures publishers and movie studios. </p>
<p>Typically it''s seen as a good thing for a retailer to
pressure suppliers to trim prices, as that can lead to better
deals for shoppers, David Balto, a former policy director at the
Federal Trade Commission, said in an interview with Bloomberg
News. </p>
<p>The antitrust cops clearly would be on Amazon''s
doorstep if it was also pushing those suppliers to charge
competing retailers more, he said. Successfully going after
Amazon at this stage would be breaking new territory under the
antitrust laws. </p>
<p>That hasn''t damped debate about the tactics Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Bezos is using against Hachette Book Group, Walt
Disney Co. and film studio Warner Bros. The question is whether
he''s pushing Amazon toward the same monopolistic territory that
tripped up Microsoft Corp., Standard Oil and ATT Inc. </p>
<p>They are getting very close to the line, said Joseph
Tabacco, a former senior trial lawyer at the Justice Department
who has worked on federal monopoly and price-fixing cases
against mining, electronics and pharmaceutical companies. </p>
<p>A phone call left at Seattle-based Amazon''s press office

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) cleared a U.S. national-security review for the sale of
its low-end server business to China''s Lenovo Group Ltd. (992),
letting the $2.3 billion transaction go forward even amid
tensions between the two nations. </p>
<p>The conclusion of the review by the Committee on Foreign
Investment in the U.S., or Cfius, is good news for both IBM
and Lenovo, and for our customers and employees, Armonk, New
York-based IBM said yesterday in a statement. While Cfius placed
some conditions on the deal, they don''t significantly affect the
business, and terms of the transaction didn''t change as result,
a person with knowledge of the matter said, without specifying
the conditions. </p>
<p>The sale drew scrutiny because of disputes between China
and the U.S., the world''s two largest economies, over
cyberintrusions. By completing the deal, IBM can jettison a less
profitable business to focus on growing areas, such as cloud
computing and data analytics, while giving Lenovo a bigger piece
of the global computing-hardware market. </p>
<p>This is part of IBM''s process moving away from hardware
manufacturing to a more service-oriented product line and more
profitable product lines, Ivan Feinseth, chief investment
officer at Tigress Financial Partners LLC, said in an interview.
They are trying to change the direction they are going. He
has a neutral rating on IBM stock. </p>
<p>Spokesmen for IBM and Lenovo declined to comment on whether
the Cfius clearance included any requirements or concessions.
Holly Shulman, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which
leads Cfius, declined to comment. </p>
<h2>Essentially Commodities </h2>
<p>The IBM servers, known as x86 for the type of chips they
use, link computers on corporate networks and are essentially
commodities in the information technology world, Christopher Padilla, IBM''s vice president for governmental programs, said in
January. Most of IBM''s x86 servers are made in Shenzhen, China,
he said. </p>
<p>The clearance of the national-security review may also bode
well for Lenovo''s separate $2.91 billion purchase of Google
Inc.''s Motorola Mobility unit. </p>
<p>We continue to work through a number of regulatory and
business processes to ensure an effective and timely closure on
both deals, Lenovo, which has its headquarters in Beijing and
Morrisville, North Carolina, said in a statement. We remain on
track to close both deals by the end of the year. </p>
<h2>Maintenance Continues </h2>
<p>U.S. agencies, including the Defense Department and the
Department of Homeland Security, buy the IBM servers, according
to Bloomberg Intelligence. The companies were able to head off a
lot of government concerns on the x86 deal because IBM has
agreed to continue maintenance on existing servers for five
years, said the person with knowledge of the matter, who asked
not to be identified because the process was private. </p>
<p>The Cfius review took 150 days to complete, with the
companies forced to resubmit the transaction after an initial
75-day investigation expired, the person said. Cfius asked
hundreds of questions during the probe, primarily focusing on
maintenance of installed IBM servers and Lenovo''s access to
them, while also paying heed to heightened concern and scrutiny

<p>South Korea''s record current-account
surplus will boost the won to levels prior to the 2008 global
credit crisis, JPMorgan Chase  Co.''s Seoul branch manager said. </p>
<p>The won will climb past 1,000 per dollar as local equities
attract inflows, Managing Director Lee Sung Hee said in an Aug.
14 interview, without specifying a timeframe. The U.S. bank''s
Singapore-based strategist Daniel Hui predicts a 1.8 percent
gain to 1,000 by end-December. The median estimate in a
Bloomberg survey of 31 analysts is for a 0.7 percent decline to
1,025 in the same period. </p>
<p>The currency has advanced 3.1 percent this year as global
funds pumped $27.7 billion into South Korean bonds and stocks.
The central bank last month raised its 2014 forecast for the
current-account excess to an unprecedented $84 billion from $68
billion. The Bank of Korea''s decision last week to lower
borrowing costs in support of the government''s efforts to revive
economic growth won''t deter capital inflows, Lee said. </p>
<p>It would be difficult for the won to weaken given a
current-account surplus of this size, Lee, who is also
JPMorgan''s head of global emerging markets in Korea, said in his
office in Seoul. Gains in the stock market will spur inflows,
adding appreciation pressure on the won. </p>
<p>The won rose 0.3 percent from Aug. 14 to 1,017.75 per
dollar as of 12:19 p.m. in Seoul, according to prices from local
banks. Korean financial markets were closed for a public holiday
on Aug. 15. The currency rallied 0.8 percent on Aug. 14, the
most since April, as the central bank cut its key interest rate. </p>
<h2>Currency Forecasts </h2>
<p>The nation''s currency last traded at 1,000 per dollar in
July 2008, before Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed for
bankruptcy, triggering a crisis in global credit markets. </p>
<p>Hui, the JPMorgan strategist, predicts that after reaching
1,000 by September, the won will remain at that level through
the end of 2014 before climbing to 995 by March and to 985 in
June. The median forecasts in the Bloomberg survey are for the
currency to reach 1,020 in the first quarter of 2015 and 1,017
in the second. </p>
<p>South Korea''s finance ministry unveiled a 11.7 trillion won
($11.5 billion) spending program on July 24 after cutting its
2014 growth forecast to 3.7 percent from 3.9 percent. The
ministry plans to encourage companies to boost dividend payouts. </p>
<p>One of the government''s policy goals is to raise the
wealth effect by boosting prices of asset such as equities,
JPMorgan''s Lee said. </p>
<p>The benchmark Kospi (KOSPI) index of shares gained 2.7 percent this
quarter, more than the 1.5 percent increase in the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of regional equities. </p>
<h2>Stimulus Measures </h2>
<p>The central bank reduced its key interest rate from 2.5
percent to 2.25 percent on Aug. 14, the first cut since May
2013. The move will help boost the effectiveness of the
government''s stimulus, Governor Lee Ju Yeol said the same day. </p>
<p>The fiscal spending package, along with the central bank''s
policy easing, will encourage foreign inflows by supporting
growth and boosting equities, Morgan Stanley strategists
including Geoffrey Kendrick in Hong Kong wrote in an Aug. 14
report. </p>
<p>Lower borrowing costs won''t discourage overseas bond
investors as central banks and sovereign wealth funds tend to
focus on long-term economic fundamentals, according to the
report. Global central banks accounted for 42 percent of foreign
investment in South Korean bonds as of end-2013, data from the
finance ministry show. </p>
<h2>Volatility Seen </h2>
<p>While the won will appreciate over the long term, the
currency may face increased volatility due to geopolitical
tension in Ukraine and slower economic growth in Europe,
according to JPMorgan''s Lee. </p>
<p>One-month implied volatility in the won, a gauge of
expected swings in the exchange rate used to price options, has
risen 125 basis points, or 1.25 percentage points, this quarter
to 5.90 percent today. </p>
<p>A certain amount of foreign-exchange volatility can be
beneficial to traders and companies, Lee said. Too little
volatility tends to lead to overreactions by investors if the
exchange rate moves beyond a certain range. </p>

<p>Long before the Ukraine crisis ruptured U.S.-Russian relations, Vladimir Putin and his right-hand man, Igor Sechin, hosted then-Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer John Mack at an exclusive reception at Putin''s Novo-Ogaryovo estate outside Moscow. </p> <p>According to the Kremlin, Putin thanked Mack and a few other foreign bankers at the October 2006 gathering for leading the $10 billion initial public offering of OAO Rosneft, the state-controlled oil giant headed by Sechin. He then chatted with the bankers for an hour in a formal meeting room. </p> <p>Putin and Sechin have a lot more to thank Morgan Stanley for. The American investment bank helped transform state-owned Rosneft from a business the Russian government failed to sell three times in 1998 into the world''s biggest publicly traded oil producer by output. Morgan Stanley played a key role in saving it from being acquired, and Rosneft hired three consecutive chief financial officers from the bank. In 2013, Putin approved Mack''s appointment to Rosneft''s board. </p> <p>Since the Soviet Union broke up a quarter-century ago, Russia has become so closely entwined with the global economy that doing anything to unwind those ties -- or successfully impose sanctions for misbehavior -- is proving difficult for the U.S. and its allies, and awkward for western businesses that embraced Putin''s Russia. With Sechin and his oil company both under U.S. sanctions, a look at the courtship, marriage, and now separation between Morgan Stanley and Rosneft is a telling microcosm of this turnabout. </p>

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd., Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. are among the component stocks. </p> <p>Boosting Japan''s military capabilities has been one of the focuses of the Abe government, amid a territorial dispute with an increasingly assertive China. In 2013 Abe increased the defense budget for the first time in 11 years, and this year relaxed an effective ban on defense exports. Even with the changes, defense spending will account for less than 1 percent of gross domestic product, compared with 4 percent in the U.S. and 1.3 percent in China, according to estimates by Japan''s Ministry of Defense. </p>

the Libyan Investment Authority that alleged the New York-based

sovereign wealth fund said in a statement today. The bank has

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. bought about
$2.4 billion of Indian government bonds yesterday, leading
record purchases by international banks, according to three
fixed-income dealers in Mumbai. </p>
<p>Foreign lenders acquired a net 148 billion rupees ($2.4
billion) of sovereign debt yesterday, the most in Clearing Corp.
of India Ltd. data going back to 2006. JPMorgan may have
purchased the notes on behalf of institutional clients, the
dealers said, asking not to be identified as the information
isn''t public. Mollica Senapati, a spokeswoman in Mumbai for the
U.S. bank, declined to comment on the matter in an e-mailed

<p>Global funds pumped in an unprecedented $13.8 billion into
local government and corporate bonds in 2014 as India''s success
in reining in inflation and stabilizing the rupee added to
optimism the nation''s new government will spur economic growth.
JPMorgan''s purchases made up about 90 percent of the $2.76
billion pumped in by overseas money managers yesterday, exchange

<p>The purchases represent a significant amount for the bond
markets, said Anindya Das Gupta, Mumbai-based treasurer at

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) partners
cut their ownership of the firm to the lowest level since 2010
by exercising options dating from the financial crisis, as the

<p>The partners owned 8.52 percent of the New York-based

according to a regulatory filing today. Individuals exercised

<p>Hedge-fund managers, it turns out,
are really like a bunch of grown-up mall rats. </p>
<p>That''s the conclusion one could draw from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc.''s report on trends in the alternative-investment
industry. Managers continue to allocate about 20 percent of
assets to shares in companies dependent on discretionary
consumer spending. In the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index, their
weighting is only 12 percent. </p>
<p>That group of 85 stocks, from Walt Disney Co. to Nike Inc.
and Yum! Brands Inc., was up 2.4 percent this year compared with
an almost 8 percent gain in the SP 500 as of yesterday. As a
result, many hedge-fund managers, like teenagers who spent too
much time in the mall, are bringing home some lousy report
cards. The industry has returned 1 percent so far this year,
according to Goldman''s Aug. 20 report. </p>
<p>Consistent large allocations to retail and media stocks
in the consumer discretionary sector have been headwinds to
returns, Goldman strategists including Ben Snider and David Kostin wrote. </p>
<p>The smaller dispersion of returns within the group isn''t
helping matters, Goldman notes. There was a 94 percentage point
gap between the SP 500''s best performing consumer-discretionary
stock this year (Under Armour Inc.) and the worst (Coach Inc.)
as of today''s open. That sounds like a lot, but not really when
you compare it with the 217 percentage points that separated the
top winner from the loser at this time of year in 2013. </p>
<h2>First, Worst </h2>
<p>Still the current dispersion, second only to energy shares
among the 10 main SP 500 groups, makes it easy to see why this
is a tough group to quit. And, obviously, not everyone''s a bull,
especially after government data showed consumer spending
stalled in July. </p>
<p>Another report from research firm Markit this week showed
demand to borrow shares of retailers in the SP 500 has climbed
to a one-year high. As the back-to-school season kicks into full
gear, Abercrombie  Fitch Co., Kohl''s Corp. and Five Below Inc.
are among retail stocks showing increases in short interest,
according to Markit. </p>
<p>Goldman serves as sort of a Jane Goodall to hedge-fund
managers, journeying deep into the Excel jungles to learn more
about these exotic creatures and report back to us on their
mysterious ways. The additions and deletions to their indexes of
most-important longs and shorts shows where the action has been
in the consumer space. </p>
<h2>Longs, Shorts </h2>
<p>Dollar General Corp. and DirecTV were added to their basket
of very-important longs, while News Corp. and Constellation
Brands Inc. were dropped. In the very important short basket,
Keurig Green Mountain Inc. and Home Depot Inc. were added, while
DirecTV, Kohl''s and McDonald''s Corp. were dropped. </p>
<p>Perusing the full list, it''s clear that hedge-fund managers
are scattered out across the entire mall, rather than clustered
at a few stores. </p>
<p>Anyway, one theory for their 20 percent weighting in
consumer discretionary could be that hedge fund managers are
wisely getting in front of a pickup in spending and subsequent
rally in the shares. Another theory could be that one is not in
the best position to gauge retail traffic trends if they''re able
to take a helicopter to the mall. </p>

<p>Ikeafans Inc. of Colonial Beach, Virginia, brought the suit
May 20, seeking a declaration it wasn''t infringing the Swedish

the www.ikeafans.com website since 2005, and over the years
enjoyed a symbiotic relationship with the giant home furnishings
company. </p>

<p>Marina Silva''s performance in the
campaign''s first televised presidential debate helped establish
trust among voters and investors, reinforcing her status as the
front-runner in Brazil''s election, analysts from Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. to Nomura Holdings Inc. said. </p>
<p>The former environment minister showed in the debate aired
last night on Bandeirantes TV that she would be reliable and
not extreme in the changes she proposes, Tony Volpon, head of
emerging markets research for the Americas at Nomura, said by
phone from New York. It makes her the odds-on favorite to win
the election. </p>
<p>Silva, who captured the support of Brazilians dissatisfied
with the political establishment and deteriorating growth when
she entered the race, now is capturing enough backing from her
competitors to beat President Dilma Rousseff in a runoff, two
polls published this week show. Equities rallied on speculation
Silva would do a better job managing the economy than Rousseff. </p>
<p>Silva has 43.7 percent support in a possible Oct. 26 second
round vote versus 37.8 percent for the incumbent, according to
an Aug. 21-24 MDA survey published today, which has a margin of
error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. </p>
<p>She has 45 percent of voters'' support, against 36 percent
for Rousseff,  according to an Aug. 23-25 Ibope poll published
yesterday. While both polls show Rousseff leading in the first
round, she doesn''t have the support needed to avert a runoff. </p>
<h2>Stocks Rally </h2>
<p>The Ibovespa stock exchange index rose 1.9 percent at 5:50
p.m. local time today and the real appreciated 0.6 percent to
2.2477 per U.S. dollar, the biggest increase among emerging
market currencies after the South African rand and Turkish lira. </p>
<p>Silva criticized Rousseff''s handling of the economy last
night, saying the incumbent has failed on pledges to slow
inflation and is poised to turn over the country in worse shape
than she found it. </p>
<p>She handled the debate well, Alberto Ramos, chief Latin
America economist at Goldman Sachs, said in a phone interview
when asked about Silva. Based on the polls, it''s her election
to lose. </p>
<p>Before the debate, Eurasia Group wrote in a note that the
challenge for Silva will be to transition from being a protest
vote candidate to someone voters are willing and able to trust
to govern. The political risk consulting firm wrote today the
candidate last night took a positive step toward
establishing her reputation as a credible leader. </p>
<h2>Confident, Prepared </h2>
<p>Silva was confident and prepared in going after Rousseff on
slowing growth while fielding questions on how she would forge a
majority in Congress, said Andre Cesar, director at public
policy and business strategy consulting company Prospectiva. </p>
<p>Silva said she could tap support from rival parties to form
a majority. She said she would select for her government some of
the country''s best politicians who have been forced onto the
sidelines by the ruling Workers'' Party and candidate Aecio Neves''s Brazilian Social Democracy Party. </p>
<p>She passed the first test, Cesar said. </p>
<p>Silva''s campaign team has pledged to slow inflation to 3
percent from 6.5 percent last month by the end of 2018, support
formal autonomy for the central bank and undo fiscal policies
that led to a sovereign debt rating downgrade this year. On the
social front, she says she would expand the government program
that transfers money to poor families, known as Bolsa Familia. </p>
<h2>Faster Inflation </h2>
<p>When Rousseff said that her policies have shielded the poor
and workers from the effects of an international economic
crisis, Silva retorted that faster inflation has undermined
confidence and purchasing power. </p>
<p>Silva would support inflation control, the floating
exchange rate and cut government spending, Luciano Rostagno,
chief strategist at Banco Mizuho do Brazil in Sao Paulo, said in
a phone interview. That is positive. </p>
<p>In the debate, Neves showcased his experience as the former
governor of Brazil''s second-most populous state, saying in a
reference to Silva that voters shouldn''t choose a president
whose proposals are unclear. </p>
<p>Brazil also can''t put up with new adventures, with
improvisation, said Neves, who is running third in polls. </p>
<p>She responded that voters were tired of the dominance of
her two rivals'' parties, which have ruled Brazil for 20 years. </p>
<p>We will respect the gains that were made in other
governments, she said. But we will correct the mistakes. </p>

income, is approaching the market. Just because yields on
speculative-grade debt are falling toward the lowest ever,
that''s not a good enough reason to avoid it, he said. </p>
<p>Ultimately there will be a bubble, Michele said in a
Bloomberg Television interview on Aug. 26. As for now, he said,
there''s only so long that you''re going to sit in cash earning
a zero percent return in the U.S., perhaps a negative yield in
Europe, before you go back into some form of bonds. </p>
<p>Michele isn''t alone in seeing value in junk bonds despite
Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen''s suggestion that the market
has gotten frothy. While high-yield notes in the U.S. posted a
1.3 percent loss last month, their first in almost a year,
they''ve bounced right back with a 1.5 percent gain in August,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>The reason yields are so low is because of the Fed''s easy
money policies, which are ongoing (even if a little scaled
back). </p>
<p>So why leave now when the party''s still good? </p>
<h2>Not Much Upside </h2>
<p>It''s understandable why investors would be wary of plunging
into less-creditworthy debt right now. Junk-rated bonds are
yielding 5.9 percent as measured by Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. That''s about 0.2 percentage point from the
all-time low, meaning potential returns are significantly less
than the historic average. </p>
<p>While mutual-fund investors yanked a record $7.1 billion
from the debt in the week ended Aug. 6, they''ve since had a
change of heart, plowing $2.9 billion back into the funds in the
two weeks since, according to data provider Lipper. </p>
<p>Everybody has been lulled into this comforting notion
that between a Goldilocks economy, not lifting off but not
collapsing, and the Fed being the market''s best friend, it''s OK
to leverage every risk factor, Mohamed El-Erian, former chief
executive officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. and
Bloomberg View columnist, said in an interview last week. </p>
<p>Everybody''s in the same trade, he said. If sentiment
changes, there''s no shock absorber in the system. </p>
<p>Call it a game of chicken, where investors wait as long as
they can before slipping out just before everybody else runs for
the exits. Or perhaps another case of don''t fight the Fed, which
has pledged to keep benchmark rates low for a prolonged period. </p>
<p>Typically you see bubbles at the end of Fed tightening,
when the Fed has withdrawn liquidity from the system, Michele
said. </p>
<p>That''s not happening yet. So for now, game on. </p>

<p>International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM) wants you to know that its Watson technology can do more
than win Jeopardy! -- it can now help accelerate scientific
research and discoveries. </p>
<p>IBM, in a peer-reviewed paper with Baylor College of
Medicine, used the Watson Discovery Advisor technology to map
connections within troves of scientific research. The ability to
point scientists toward new hypotheses and patterns in data is
also being used by Johnson  Johnson (JNJ) to help develop medicines
and find additional uses for existing drugs, IBM said in a
statement. </p>
<p>Since the Jeopardy! win in 2011 proved Watson can
answer questions and analyze data in natural human language, IBM
has been trying to commercialize the technology by showing how
it can be applied to customer service and financial planning. As
declining demand for IBM''s hardware has led to nine straight
quarters of falling sales, the company has turned to data
analytics tools like Watson as a new source of growth. </p>
<p>We''ve gone from co-creating with these early partners to
creating a commercial offering, John Gordon, vice president of
IBM''s Watson Group, said in a phone interview, referring to
Baylor and JJ. In the past we''ve talked about how Watson can
help people find answers to things that are known. We are
shifting to really helping innovators investigate the great
problems of our time. </p>
<p>IBM has been marketing different uses for Watson since the
company spent about $1 billion to create a new business unit
around the tool. Financial-services firm USAA said last month it
will use Watson on its website to answer military customers''
questions about transitioning back to civilian life -- the first
wide-scale test with consumers. </p>
<h2>70,000 Articles </h2>
<p>Watson''s new science applications identify potentially
unknown points of interest about a topic, instead of only
finding direct answers to specific questions. </p>
<p>Baylor used the tool to analyze the abstracts of 70,000
scientific articles on a specific cancer-related protein to
predict other compounds that may interact with it. Using
frequent words to rank and map relationships, the researchers
identified six proteins to investigate, more than the one that
scientists typically discover in a year. </p>
<p>Johnson  Johnson, whose Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky will join IBM''s board next week, will use Watson to
analyze drug data to potentially allow researchers to more
quickly ask questions about the effectiveness and side effects
of medical treatments. </p>
<p>This points them to the next great idea, Gordon said.
It''s kind of Watson becoming a scientist. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley extended purchases of
diesel in Europe to a 43rd day amid the region''s biggest
stockpiles in more than two years. </p>
<p>The bank bought 77 percent of the 807,450 metric tons that
traded on the diesel barge market in July and August in a
pricing window operated by Platts, a unit of McGraw Hill
Financial Inc. (MHFI), brokers'' data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
bank purchased every day since July 1, including 18,700 tons
today. </p>
<p>While Germans will buy diesel and gasoil for heating this
winter, the European country''s supplies will be replenished by a
glut in Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp where the fuels are
traded, according to Olivier Jakob, the managing director of
Petromatrix GmbH, a consulting firm in Zug, Switzerland. Prices
are in a pattern called contango that means later-month costs
exceed immediate ones. That can create an incentive for traders
to buy and store. </p>
<p>The curve is attractive to storage, so if you have the
flexibility and the empty tanks then it makes sense to be
stockpiling now, Robert Campbell, head of oil products
research at Energy Aspects Ltd., said by phone from New York
Aug. 27. Despite the contango there is an unwillingness on the
part of end-consumers to buy much, so end-user storage is not
that high but ARA levels are. </p>
<p>Campbell spoke in general terms and declined to speculate
specifically on Morgan Stanley (MS)''s reasons for the trades. Hugh Fraser, a London-based spokesman for the bank, declined to
comment. </p>
<h2>Heating Oil Glut </h2>
<p>Combined inventories of diesel and heating oil in
independent storage in Antwerp-Rotterdam-Amsterdam, Europe''s
oil-trading center, are at their highest since March 2012,
according to PJK International BV. Heating oil storage tanks at
commercial premises in Germany are 37.7 percent full, the second
highest for this time of year since Ipsos Loyalty GmbH began
recording levels in 2011. Diesel and gasoil have become
increasingly interchangeable in Europe because of the sulfur
limits imposed on the heating fuel, according to Jakob. </p>
<p>The price of diesel barges in northwest Europe has dropped
by $51 a ton, or 5.5 percent, since the start of July to $880.25
a ton yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc.''s forecast
for the euro to weaken to parity with the dollar comes as the
region confronts escalating deflation and the risk that some of
its biggest member states are falling back to recession. </p>
<p>Robin Brooks, the New York-based chief currency strategist,
cut his six-month forecast today to $1.25 from $1.34, saying the
European Central Bank will need to ease monetary policy further
to counter falling inflation expectations. The 18-nation
currency will weaken to parity by the end of 2017, he said.
Goldman isn''t alone in cutting its outlook -- JPMorgan Chase 
Co. also reduced its forecast today to $1.26 from $1.28 by the
end of June 2015. </p>
<p>The ECB will ease more, I don''t know what easing that
will be, but that the direction of policy is pretty clear,
Brooks said in a telephone interview. People had doubts
whether the ECB is going to take low inflation seriously, those
expectations are being updated. </p>
<p>The euro had staged a 16 percent rally after ECB President
Mario Draghi said he''ll do whatever it takes to save the
currency in July 2012. Since reaching the high for the year on
May 8, the euro has slumped 4.9 percent in the face of the
weakest inflation in almost five years, a recession in Italy and
zero growth in France. </p>
<p>Goldman cut the three-month estimate to $1.29 from $1.35
and the one-year forecast to $1.20 from $1.30. That''s one of the
most bearish views among banks surveyed by Bloomberg, with the
median forecast of $1.31 by the end of the year and $1.30 by the
end of the first quarter. </p>
<h2>Inflation Gauge </h2>
<p>The euro has slumped for seven consecutive weeks, the
longest stretch in more than a decade. The shared currency was
little changed at $1.3184 at 10:46 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>Draghi last week pushed the central bank closer to
quantitative easing by singling out the five-year, five-year
inflation break-even rate, his preferred gauge of inflation
expectations, sliding below 2 percent. Draghi previously said
that a worsening of the medium-term inflation outlook would
provide a reason for broad-based asset purchases. ECB officials
meet Sept. 4. </p>
<p>In contrast, the U.S. is moving closer toward raising
interest rates. The Federal Reserve has kept the benchmark rate
at a record-low zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008, while
futures traders saw about a 56 percent chance the central bank
will start raising rates by July 2015, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>The July Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed
policy makers discussed the possibility that jobs gains may lead
them to increase rates sooner than anticipated. </p>
<p>The longer-term forecast to parity is a pure view that
growth in the U.S. will outperform that that of the euro-zone,
Brooks said. In terms of our euro forecast, we''re clearly
signaling growth will be better in the U.S. </p>

<p>     Sept. 2 (Bloomberg Businessweek) -- Chevron has finalized
the sale of its renewable-energy subsidiary, Chevron Energy
Solutions, to OpTerra Energy Services, a Chevron spokesman
confirmed today. </p>
<p>The sale, on Aug. 29, marks the latest in a series of moves
away from renewables by the oil company. Earlier this year,
Chevron sold a 48-person division that builds renewable projects
and energy-savings retrofits for federal agencies such as the
U.S. Department of Defense. </p>
<p>OpTerra is backed by Oaktree Capital Management, a private
equity firm in Los Angeles, according to OpTerra''s website. It
develops energy-savings projects, as well as clean-energy systems
from technologies like solar and fuel cells. </p>
<p>Bloomberg Businessweek first reported the expected sale of
Chevron''s clean-energy subsidiary in June. </p>
<p>Chevron declined to comment on the price of the transaction
or the number of its employees moving to OpTerra. The company
said in a statement that the sale is part of an internal
strategic focus on supporting Chevron''s Upstream and Downstream
businesses. Chevron continues to believe that energy efficiency
and renewable energy are an important part of the overall energy
mix, and operates a portfolio of renewables, including wind,
geothermal and solar. </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Oaktree Capital declined to comment. An
OpTerra representative previously declined to comment about the
transaction and didn''t respond to a new request for comment
today. </p>
<p>Chevron Energy Solutions was first acquired by the oil
company in 2000 and has long been a centerpiece of Chevron''s
efforts to pursue renewable energy. A decade after acquiring the
division, Chevron boasted that the group had developed hundreds
of renewable and energy-efficiency projects that were reducing
greenhouse gas emissions by more than 3 million metric tons. </p>
<p>In addition, Chevron executives frequently touted the
division''s clean-energy work in speeches and in testimony (PDF)
before Congress. </p>
<p>Last month, though, Chevron confirmed that it had suspended
two solar projects at a refinery in Hawaii, which would have
spanned about 20 acres and reduced carbon dioxide emissions by
about 5,000 tons apiece. </p>
<p>And earlier this year, the company dismantled a renewable
power group whose mission was to launch large, profitable
clean-energy projects, Bloomberg Businessweek reported in May.
The group had almost doubled its internal profit targets in 2013,
while helping to launch solar and geothermal projects capable of
powering tens of thousands of homes.</p>

<p>Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) and Societe
Generale SA (GLE) are among lenders seen driving a 10 percent gain
among European banks by year-end as investor concerns over their
capital levels and legal bills ease, JPMorgan Chase  Co.
analysts said. </p>
<p>European bank shares, tracked by the benchmark Stoxx 600
Banks Index, will reverse their underperformance relative to the
broader market in recent months, the analysts including Kian Abouhossein wrote in an e-mailed report yesterday. The banks
index, down 3.2 percent in the six months through Sept. 1, today
rose 0.7 percent to 198.06 as of 11:15 a.m. in Frankfurt. </p>
<p>The European Central Bank is leading an unprecedented
regulatory scrutiny of the financial health of the region''s
biggest lenders as it prepares to assume their supervision, an
effort to restore confidence in the industry. European banks
have also faced investor concerns that fines and settlements
would erode capital after France''s BNP Paribas SA (BNP) paid a record
$8.97 billion penalty for breaking U.S. sanctions in July. </p>
<p>The ECB stress test should be a positive event, the
analysts wrote in the report. All 34 European banks JPMorgan
tested passed its own assessment, which used the same 5.5
percent minimum capital ratio the ECB will employ in the more
adverse of two stress test scenarios, they said. </p>
<p>The ECB is scheduled to release the results of its tests
and examination of the balance sheets of 128 euro area lenders
next month. Firms will have six months to raise equity to cover
any shortfalls identified in its balance sheet review or the
milder stress-test scenarios, and nine months to address
deficiencies resulting from the more-adverse scenario. </p>
<p>JPMorgan added Deutsche Bank, Germany''s biggest bank,
Societe Generale of France and Amsterdam-based ING Groep NV (INGA) to
its list of top picks, according to the report. The analysts
removed Caixabank SA (CABK) after the Barcelona-based lender rallied 21
percent this year, the analysts wrote. </p>

<p>Mobileye NV (MBLY), a maker of driver
assistance systems, climbed to a new high since going public
last month after Morgan Stanley said the company''s powerful
growth may lead the shares to double. </p>
<p>Mobileye jumped 9.2 percent to $46.97 at 4 p.m. in New
York, after gaining as much as 15 percent in intraday trading.
That''s the third-biggest increase on a closing basis since Aug.
1, when the stock surged 48 percent on its first day of trading. </p>
<p>The shares could reach $100 under the most optimistic
scenario, according to Morgan Stanley''s Ravi Shanker,
reiterating a similar prediction from a week ago. The New York-based bank was among those that led Jerusalem-based Mobileye''s
IPO. While Shanker has an overweight rating on the stock, the
equivalent of buy, his share-price target is $46 for the next 12
to 18 months. </p>
<p>The path to $100 does not involve heroic assumptions,
Shanker wrote in the report dated today. If MBLY can hold its
own and just retain its current position, let alone make further
inroads from here, the stock is likely to be closer to our $100
bull case. </p>
<p>To reach this level, Mobileye needs to hold its current
pricing and profitability, keep market share close to 80 percent
and see quicker-than-expected adoption of autonomous driving
programs in China, Shanker wrote. </p>
<h2>Earnings Report </h2>
<p>Some investors may be buying the stock ahead of the
company''s earnings report tomorrow, according to Jason Ader, an
analyst at William Blair  Co. Mobileye earned 5 cents a share
in the three months ended June, according to the average of
eight analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. On an annual
basis, the company is forecast to double its profit by next
year. </p>
<p>It''s a pretty unique story with high growth and high
profitability that distinguishes it from most of the tech
companies you see that are growing 60 to 100 percent and losing
money, Ader said via phone from Boston. It''s clearly a
momentum stock right now, it''s a darling. </p>
<p>Mobileye''s image-sensing technology stands apart from
competitors because it uses a single camera to capture and
display a vehicle''s surroundings, according to Ader. Other
vision-based driver assistance software that employ radar or
dual-camera systems have difficulty capturing stationary or far-away objects, he said. </p>
<p>Yonah Lloyd, chief communications officer at Mobileye, did
not immediately respond to an e-mail sent after working hours in

<p>Here''s a grim forecast to consider:
It may be 2021 before you make any money on investment-grade
bonds again. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) Wealth Management''s Jonathan Mackay predicts
the securities will post annual returns of between 1 percent and
2 percent for the next seven years -- which means you''ll lose
money after accounting for inflation. That''s a big shift
considering the debt gained 8.7 percent annually on average in
the 30 years through 2012. </p>
<p>Investors should have a lower average allocation to bonds
than you would have in the previous cycle because they just
don''t provide the income and return, said Mackay, senior
market strategist at Morgan Stanley''s $2 trillion wealth
management unit. While central-bank stimulus is supporting bond
values, the collateral damage is going to be lower portfolio
returns. </p>
<p>The way to get around this is to buy higher-yielding
assets, he said. While higher-rated bonds have been
outperforming their riskier counterparts in 2014, that may be
poised to reverse. </p>
<p>What we''re suggesting is that you just have less of your
bond allocation in the perceived, or formerly perceived, safe
havens of bonds, Mackay said. </p>
<h2>Falling Yields </h2>
<p>About 45 percent of all government bonds are now yielding
less than 1 percent, according to a report yesterday by Bank of
America Corp. analysts led by Michael Hartnett. The Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate Index has gained 6.5
percent this year, with yields on the notes plunging to 2.6
percent, within 0.17 percentage point of the record low set last
year. </p>
<p>Investors have already been plowing into junk-rated debt as
well as equities and less-traded assets like real estate and
private equity. </p>
<p>There''s also always the possibility of boosting leverage to
juice returns, which debt investors have been doing with credit
lines and credit-default swaps. </p>
<p>Outstanding bets on a credit-swaps index tied to North
American junk bonds have soared to the highest level since at
least 2011. Net wagers on the latest Markit CDX North America
High Yield Index rose to $34.4 billion as of Aug. 29, compared
with a peak of $29.1 billion on the last series in March,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<h2>Choosing Hubris </h2>
<p>All of this risk-taking has been paying off lately, as
credit investors largely shrug off escalating geopolitical
conflicts and with the speculative-grade default rate less than
half its long-term average. High-yield bonds globally are on
track to gain 8.9 percent this year, building on the 142.7
percent return during the previous five years, Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data show. </p>
<p>Of course, not everyone''s as sanguine about just reaching
for more and more yield. Bank of America analysts recommended
yesterday that bond buyers be on the lookout for signs of
investor hubris, especially with the Federal Reserve set to
stop its monthly asset purchases. </p>
<p>But when the other option is losing money, as Morgan
Stanley''s Mackay suggests, it''s easy to understand why investors
might choose hubris. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank will buy
as much as 40 billion euros ($53 billion) of asset-backed
securities as part of a program to stimulate the region''s
economy, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The central bank will limit purchases to the new-issue
market over a three-year period and focus on securities with the
highest credit ratings, JPMorgan analysts led by Gareth Davies
wrote in a note. About 47 billion euros of asset-backed debt has
been sold in the region this year, according to data from the
New York-based bank. </p>
<p>The ECB is preparing to buy ABS as it strives to revive
lending to small-and medium-sized businesses that employ about
70 percent of the European Union''s private-sector workers. While
the region''s outstanding ABS market is as large as 1.2 trillion
euros, a purchase program of this magnitude would necessitate it
being expanded beyond SME-backed loans, the analysts said in the
note. </p>
<p>The purchase plan is important for a number of reasons,
but broadly because it puts downward pressure on the cost of
issuing ABS, and ultimately feeds into lower product margins on
real economy lending, Davies said by e-mail today. </p>
<p>The Frankfurt-based ECB has hired BlackRock Inc. (BLK) to provide
advice as it thrashes out the final design of its plan,
including how much, which assets, and what ranking of bonds it

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) Chief Executive

compliance and cybersecurity. That''s not stopping regulators
from treating the bank as if it were riskier than ever. </p>

devised by regulators that determines how much capital the bank
needs to hold against potential losses from human error,
external threats, fraud and litigation, rose 6.7 percent in the
second quarter to $400 billion, according to an August filing.

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) is planning
its first foray into Islamic capital markets three years after
starting a sukuk program that it never used. </p>
<p>Five banks including the New York-based lender will manage
the dollar-denominated offering via JANY Sukuk Co., four people
with knowledge of the deal said. A benchmark-sized sale may
follow, they said, asking not to be identified as the plan is
private. Goldman Sachs in 2011 created a $2 billion program that
faced criticism from some Islamic advisers for not ensuring debt
would be traded at par value, as required by Shariah. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs is joining a growing number of issuers
seeking to tap demand among Muslim investors in an industry that
Ernst  Young LLP forecasts will double in the five years
through 2018 to $3.4 trillion. The U.K. became the first non-Muslim country to issue Islamic bonds in June with a sale that
lured bids for more than 10 times the amount offered. Luxembourg
and Hong Kong are also planning investor meetings for similar
offerings. </p>
<p>There''s so much pent up demand in the sukuk space,
Thomas Christie, the Dubai-based head of fixed income at
Prometheus Capital Finance Ltd., said by phone. Given the
controversy in the past, it would be interesting to see what
structure they''re going to use, how they''re going to use the
funds and how the Islamic community reacts to it. </p>
<h2>Previous Attempt </h2>
<p>The planned security will take the form of Sukuk al Wakala,
a Shariah-compliant structure in which one party entrusts
another to act on its behalf. Standard  Poor''s rated the issue
A-, the seventh-highest investment grade, the company said in an
e-mail today. </p>
<p>The lender established a sukuk program three years ago
based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
plus mark-up transaction, that was approved for listing on the
Irish Stock Exchange by the Central Bank of Ireland. Murabaha
certificates can only be bought and sold at par value because
they represent a future claim on the underlying assets. </p>
<p>The program, blessed by eight of the world''s top Islamic
scholars, became entangled in a debate on whether it met
Shariah-compliant guidelines and over lack of clarity on how
Goldman Sachs planned to use the funds it raised. </p>
<h2>Pent-Up Demand </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs will hold investor meetings in the Middle
East on Sept. 10 and 11 and a so-called Regulation S
transaction, which exempts overseas offerings from registration
requirements under the SEC Securities Act of 1933, may follow,
the people said. A benchmark-sized sale usually raises at least
$500 million. </p>
<p>The notes would probably price tighter than Goldman
Sachs'' conventional bonds due to the pent-up demand in the
sukuk space, Christie of Prometheus said. The average yield on
debt that complies with Muslim tenets dropped 63 basis points
this year to 2.78 percent yesterday, the lowest since May,
according to the Deutsche Bank Sukuk Bond Index. </p>
<p>Islamic lenders will have 70 million customers by 2018, up
from 38 million last year, according to Ernst  Young forecasts.
Shariah-compliant banking assets will double in that period,
according to the advisory company. </p>
<h2>South Africa, Bangladesh </h2>
<p>South Africa last month picked banks for its debut sale of
Islamic notes, while Bangladesh and the Russian region of
Tatarstan are planning inaugural sales. In addition to itself,
Goldman Sachs hired Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank PJSC, National Bank
of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd. and NCB Capital to
manage the offering, the people said today. </p>
<p>Demand for Islamic bonds is surging helped by ample
liquidity at banks. Al Hilal Bank PJSC, an Islamic lender owned
by the Abu Dhabi government, received about $5 billion in bids
for its $500 million sale of perpetual sukuk in June. </p>
<p>Clearly, this is a good time and the demand for sukuk is
still there, Apostolos Bantis, credit analyst at Commerzbank
AG in Dubai, said by phone. This does actually indicate that
the asset class of sukuk is expanding and diversifying. </p>
<p>JANY Sukuk will enter a murabaha agreement for 49 percent
of the issued amount and a wakala agreement for the remaining 51
percent with J. Aron  Co., a Goldman Sachs subsidiary,
according to SP. </p>

<p>A win for Scottish nationalists seeking a breakaway from the U.K. may have severe consequences in the short term and spark a pound selloff, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Kevin Daly. </p> <p>The uncertainty about whether Scotland will leave the sterling monetary union could create a crisis similar to the one that almost splintered the euro area, Daly said today in an interview with Anna Edwards on Bloomberg Television''s On The Move program in London.

People realize increasingly that the undecided camp is big enough to swing this and that is why volatility is picking up, he said. </p> <h2>Volatility Surge </h2> <p>Implied one-month volatility in sterling against the dollar surged 23 percent after the survey was released, the most since 2008. Sterling has declined since then and today fell 0.2 percent to $1.6432 today, having reached $1.6440 yesterday, the weakest since Feb. 12. </p> <p>The question of whether a go-it-alone Scotland will be able to keep the pound in partnership with the remaining parts of the U.K. has dominated the independence debate with all the major parties in Westminster saying they would oppose it. Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond has argued they would change their view once negotiations began after a Yes vote and has said Scotland would refuse to pay its share of the U.K. national debt if they didn''t give in. </p> <p>The aftermath of a vote for separation will be absolutely chaotic, Andy Brough, executive director at Schroder Investment Management in London, said on Bloomberg Television.

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), at its own request,
was found in contempt of a court order to comply with a U.S.
warrant for e-mails stored in a data center in Ireland, so that
it can promptly appeal the ruling. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan today
granted a joint request by Microsoft and the government to hold
the software maker in contempt. The judge imposed no further
sanctions and said the order permits the company to immediately
appeal her July 31 ruling that it has to produce e-mails of an
unidentified customer sought in a drug probe. </p>
<p>The judge in her July ruling rejected Microsoft''s argument
that the warrant,which requires the company to provide
investigators with the contents of the customer''s MSN.com Web-based e-mail, calls for an illegal search and seizure outside
the U.S. The nation in which the customer lives wasn''t
disclosed. </p>
<p>The government should be required to get the e-mails
through procedures dictated by a law-enforcement treaty between
the U.S. and Ireland, Microsoft attorney E. Joshua Rosenkranz
argued. The Redmond, Washington-based company is the world''s
largest maker of computer software. </p>
<p>Lawyers for both sides argued over the reach of the Stored

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s third-quarter earnings stand to get a boost from a 2007 investment in an automated-driving technology company that''s more than doubled since a July initial public offering. </p> <p>The bank owned 17.5 percent of Jerusalem-based Mobileye NV (MBLY), mostly through its Goldman Sachs Investment Partners hedge fund, before it helped take the firm public in July, according to filings related to the IPO. The shares priced at $25, above the initial range of $17 to $19, and rose as high as $53.91 today. That advance may lead to a third-quarter gain for New York-based Goldman Sachs of more than $200 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>While calm markets have suppressed Goldman Sachs''s trading business, they have been a boon to investments the firm makes with its own money. The investing and lending unit earned the most profit of Goldman Sachs''s four major business segments in the 12 months ended in June, and gains in companies that went public drove better-than-expected earnings last quarter. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs has successfully established a strategy that should allow the firm to continue in the principal-investing business in the coming years, Brad Hintz, a Sanford C. Bernstein  Co. analyst, said in a July note. The wisdom of that strategy is clear, Hintz said, as such gains in the second quarter once again provided an unanticipated boost to performance. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs invested $100 million in Mobileye in 2007, the first year the company had its driver-assistance EyeQ chip and algorithms put in new cars. The firm hasn''t said whether it added to that investment. Mobileye''s image-sensing technology uses a single camera to capture and display a vehicle''s surroundings, and anticipates potential collisions, according to the company. </p> <h2>Honda, Tesla </h2> <p>Mobileye, whose customers include Honda Motor Co. (7267) and luxury electric-carmaker Tesla Motors Inc., has leaped from a $1.5 billion valuation in July 2013 to a market capitalization of $10.8 billion today. Its $1 billion IPO on July 31 was the biggest in the U.S. by an Israeli company. </p> <p>The investment shows the potential of Goldman Sachs''s strategy of serving as adviser and principal with key clients. The bank generated about $18 million from its role as lead underwriter of Mobileye''s IPO, according to a regulatory filing, and advised the company last year when it received investments from firms including BlackRock Inc. (BLK) </p> <p>Michael DuVally, a spokesman for the company, declined to comment on the firm''s holdings. </p> <p>The investing and lending unit includes direct investments in debt and equity, stakes in private equity and hedge funds, and loans to corporate and individual clients. The unit earned $4.26 billion before taxes in the 12 months ended in June, or 37 percent of the firm''s total, on $7.14 billion in revenue. </p> <h2>Equity Gains </h2> <p>Gains from equity investments drove better-than-expected earnings last quarter and in the final three months of 2013. Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz said in July that two-thirds of the $1.25 billion in equity gains for the second quarter came from companies that went public or experienced an event that resulted in a new valuation. </p> <p>A $200 million gain would represent about a quarter of equity investment revenue for the average of the past 10 quarters. The firm had $18 billion of investments in private equity and $4.33 billion in public stock as of June 30. </p> <p>Analysts including Citigroup Inc.''s Keith Horowitz have said that shareholders give Goldman Sachs less credit for investing and lending gains because they''re seen as volatile and difficult to predict. Schwartz has said the activities are core competencies of the firm. </p> <h2>ELQ Investors </h2> <p>Eighty-six percent of Goldman Sachs''s stake in Mobileye before the IPO was held by Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, a hedge fund that includes client money and the bank''s own capital. The other 14 percent was a principal investment held through a subsidiary named ELQ Investors II Ltd. </p> <p>ELQ sold $36 million of its stake in the IPO, leaving it with 1.7 percent of Mobileye''s shares. The remaining stake would be worth $176 million at the Sept. 5 closing price if ELQ didn''t sell more shares after the IPO. GSIP sold $105 million of Mobileye stock in the IPO, leaving it with 12.3 percent of the company, which would be worth $1.3 billion. </p> <p>The third-quarter gain for Goldman Sachs will depend on a number of factors, including how Mobileye''s stock trades in September and whether ELQ and GSIP maintain their post-IPO stakes. </p> <p>The shares gained as much as 7.9 percent today, after General Motors Co. said it would introduce a Cadillac model in two years that uses automated-driving technology. Detroit-based GM didn''t name potential technology suppliers. </p> <h2>Mobileye Valuation </h2> <p>Goldman Sachs, which marks its investments to the current market price, hasn''t disclosed at what price it valued Mobileye on June 30. If it marked at $18, the midpoint of the original IPO range, ELQ would currently have a gain of $122 million. GSIP would have a $842 million gain, and Goldman Sachs would receive some cut of that as an investor in the fund. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s own money accounted for about 35 percent of the $7.5 billion in the fund in October 2009, according to marketing documents at the time. Since then, the assets have shrunk and Goldman Sachs has pulled money from hedge funds to eventually comply with the Volcker Rule, which sets a 3 percent limit for how much of a fund can be a bank''s own capital. </p> <p>The fund, which is managed by Kenneth Eberts, Raanan Agus and Nick Advani, had about $5 billion in assets at the end of June, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. DuVally declined to say how much of the fund is the bank''s own money. </p> <h2>Volcker Rule </h2> <p>Part of the unpredictability of investing and lending stems from Goldman''s need to exit $12 billion of the $14 billion in fund investments it had at the end of 2013 to comply with the Volcker Rule, Hintz wrote in June. The bank has said it will make those sales at a pace that won''t hurt other investors in the funds. </p> <p>Gains like the one from GSIP''s stake in Mobileye may provide an incentive for Goldman Sachs to take its time in redeeming its capital. Mobileye has jumped more than 35 percent since the start of trading on Aug. 26. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs''s own research analyst, Alexander Duval, issued his first recommendation of the stock that day. He rated the shares neutral. </p> <p> ', 'Goldman Sachs Earnings to Get Boost From Mobileye Stake', 'By Michael J.

<p>The European Central Bank''s decision
to boost stimulus measures was enough to make Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. change its mind about the short-term fate of the
global equity market. </p>
<p>The bank raised its three-month rating on stocks to
overweight, the equivalent of buy, according to a report from
its portfolio strategy group. Higher bond yields pose less of an
imminent threat to equities following the ECB''s decision last
week to unexpectedly lower key interest rates and implement an
asset-buying plan, the firm said. </p>
<p>The upgrade is a reversal of a call made by Goldman Sachs
on July 26, when the firm cut its three-month rating on stocks
to neutral amid expectations that government bond yields would
increase. The bank maintained its 12-month overweight rating for
stocks. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs sees lower risk from bonds following the
ECB decision, analysts led by chief global equity strategist
Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a Sept. 5 client note. The net
effect of the policy action from here will be positive for
equity markets, they said. </p>
<p>The MSCI All-Country World Index has rebounded 3.6 percent
over the last month since falling to an 11-week low on Aug. 7.
The gauge declined 0.4 percent at 10:39 a.m. in New York. </p>
<p>The global equity measure climbed 0.2 percent last week as
the ECB reduced its three main interest rates by 10 basis
points, lowering the benchmark rate to 0.05 percent and the
deposit rate to minus 0.2 percent. ECB President Mario Draghi
said the central bank will announce details of an asset-backed
securities program after its October rate-setting meeting. </p>
<p>The Stoxx Europe 600 Index gained 1.1 percent on the day of
the Sept. 4 announcement as two-year note yields fell below zero
in eight countries. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs isn''t alone in getting more bullish on

David Bianco increased his year-end SP 500 target to 2,050 from

<p>Like many of us who''ve been in the
vicinity of an FM radio or Jersey Shore club in the past month,
the strategists at Morgan Stanley have Meghan Trainor''s song
All About That Bass stuck in their heads. </p>
<p>Unlike the rest of us, however, Adam Parker and company
managed to re-interpret the hit into a reason to be bullish
about U.S. stocks. In a report that reads as if Weird Al
Yankovic had taken a weird career turn and become a market
strategist, Morgan Stanley''s All About That Base (No
Trouble) note announced an increase in the firm''s 12-month
forecast for the Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) to 2,125. </p>
<p>The base case in Morgan Stanley''s view is earnings
growth of 7 percent in 2014 and 2015 and the low probability of
a bear case that would result in flat profits this year and
only a 2 percent increase next year. Hence the No Trouble
part of the title, playing off the no treble lyrics of the
song. </p>
<p>It wasn''t just the song title that caught the strategists''
attention. Here are the other lyrics that spurred the
imagination of Weird Adam Parker and crew: </p>
<h2>Small Caps </h2>
<p>*Momma told me not to worry about my size. The
strategists apply this piece of advice to market capitalization,
saying small-cap stocks are poised to do better than larger
companies between now and the end of the year. This would follow
some serious underperformance: The Russell 2000 Index (RTY) was up 0.6
percent in 2014 through last week, compared with an 8.6 percent
gain in the SP 500. The main reason, according to the report,
is the potential for greater profit-margin expansion among
smaller firms. </p>
<p>*All the right junk in all the right places. That right
place, apparently, is not in your portfolio right now, in Morgan
Stanley''s view. Instead, they recommend these high quality
small-cap stocks: Valmont Industries Inc., AmTrust Financial
Services Inc., Meredith Corp., UniFirst Corp., Texas Roadhouse
Inc. and Chemed Corp. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s not the only firm raising its forecast
today. Deutsche Bank AG strategist David Bianco increased his
year-end SP 500 target to 2,050 from 1,850 and his 2015
projection to 2,150. That leaves Wells Fargo  Co.''s Gina Martin-Adams alone at the bottom rung of the strategist table
with an 1,850 forecast for the end of 2014, which would require
a 7.7 percent slide from last week''s close. </p>
<p>Anyway, All About That Bass is currently No. 2 on
Billboard''s Hot 100 chart, right behind Taylor Swift''s Shake
It Off. Come to think of it, that one has lyrics applicable to
this bull market too: The players gonna play, play, play,
play, play. And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate. </p>
<p>The best the bears can do is probably No. 12, Ariana
Grande''s Problem in which guest rapper Iggy Azalea warns:
Smart money betting I''ll be better off without you. </p>

<p>Get set for one of the longest global economic expansions on record. </p> <p>That''s the view from Morgan Stanley''s chief international economist, Joachim Fels. He sees recovery from the great recession potentially lasting as long as a decade thanks in part to loose money. He issued a contrarian call yesterday that some of the world''s central banks will keep monetary policy easier for longer than many are betting. </p> <p>While the expansion is already five years old, it could easily extend another five, Fels wrote. </p> <p>The bad news is built into the forecast: Fels says weak growth and inflation are forcing policy makers to stand pat or consider even more stimulus. He cut his forecast for world growth this year to 3.1 percent from his 3.2 percent of June. He expects 3.5 percent in 2015 and 3.8 percent in 2016. </p> <p>Compared to earlier expansions, growth is decidedly sub-par and expected to remain so despite the projected pick-up, but then again this could help to make it one of the longest economic expansions on record, said Fels. The glass is half full. </p> <p>The sustained stimulus -- six years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. slammed the world into recession - - is one of three reasons Fels reckons the subsequent period of growth is poised to be a record-breaker. The others are that the world is out of synch so economies aren''t at risk of overheating at the same time and that slack remains worldwide with inflation below where many central banks would like it to be. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) will
probably succeed in its latest attempt to sell sukuk as
investors clamor for Islamic bonds, according to the manager of
the Middle East and Africa''s best performing sukuk fund. </p>
<p>Buyers have to look at different opportunities with
demand outpacing supply, according to Abdul Kadir Hussain, who
oversees about $700 million as the chief executive officer of
Mashreq Capital DIFC Ltd. Goldman Sachs will meet investors in
the region this week before potentially selling a dollar-denominated, benchmark-sized issue through its unit JANY Sukuk
Co., people with knowledge of the deal said last week. </p>
<p>The New York-based lender''s first foray into the Islamic
capital markets three years ago ended without a sale amid
criticism from scholars about the structure of its sukuk program
and the use of funds raised. This time the planned security will
be a Sukuk al Wakala, where one party entrusts another to act on
its behalf. </p>
<p>We''ll definitely look at it, Hussain said in a phone
interview from Dubai yesterday. The structure was an issue
last time and there were a lot of other issuers in the
market, he said. Now the market is a lot tighter and there
is more capital. </p>
<p>Investors bid for 10-times the 200 million pounds ($327
million) that the U.K. sold in its debut offering in June. </p>
<h2>Best Funds </h2>
<p>Mashreq''s Capital DA01 and Al-Islami Income Fund are the
two best performing Islamic fixed-income funds in the Middle
East and Africa this year among 19 tracked by Bloomberg. They''ve
returned 7.7 percent and 6 percent respectively, compared with
5.6 percent for third placed Al Hilal Bank''s Global Sukuk Fund,
the data show. </p>
<p>Like the U.K. issue, the Goldman Sachs deal is a
broadening of the sukuk market issuer base, and like that issue
this deal isn''t about the pricing or the valuation, Hussain
said. It''s about the signal that it sends. </p>
<p>Average global sukuk yields declined 64 basis points this
year to 2.78 percent last week, according to an index from
Deutsche Bank AG. That compares with a 61 basis-point decline to
5.08 percent in average yields for emerging-market corporate
debt tracked by JPMorgan Chase  Co. indexes. </p>
<h2>Remaining Shy </h2>
<p>Goldman Sachs established a $2 billion program in 2011
based on a so-called commodity murabaha structure, or a cost
plus mark-up transaction. The program, blessed by eight of the
world''s top Islamic scholars, became entangled in a debate on
whether it met Shariah-compliant guidelines because it didn''t
ensure debt was traded at par, and it didn''t clarify how it
planned to use the funds raised. </p>
<p>This time Goldman Sachs along with Abu Dhabi Islamic Bank
PJSC, National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC, Emirates NBD Capital Ltd.
and NCB Capital will manage the new offering, the people said.
It plans to meet investors in the Middle East for two days
starting Sept. 10. </p>
<p>If the investors conclude that Goldman Sachs is going to
take this money into their books and use it to finance their
conventional activities, then the investors are going to remain
a little bit shy, Harris Irfan, managing director at European
Islamic Investment Bank, said by phone from London yesterday,
noting the new structure has solved the par-value obstacle, but
not issues with transparency. I do hope they will be more
transparent on the flow of money, he said. </p>
<h2>Main Critic </h2>
<p>Still, the presence of ADIB on the deal is very
positive as it was one of the main critics of Goldman Sachs''
earlier plans, Irfan said. The Shariah boards of ADIB and EIIB
share one scholar, according to the lenders'' websites. ADIB''s
outsourced public relations company didn''t answer e-mailed
questions yesterday, and Sophie Ramsay, spokeswoman for Goldman
Sachs in London, declined to comment by telephone. </p>
<p>About $72 billion of sukuk have been sold globally in the
year through yesterday, compared with $80 billion in the same
period in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>Islamic finance is a growing market both in terms of
issuers and investors, Hussain said. Goldman Sachs clearly
has decided that they want to play a role in this market both as
an issuer and I am sure also as an arranger and adviser. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), which has pledged to
shrink its fixed-income trading unit, said it can cut $25
billion of risk-weighted assets that are losing money in that
business even after it reaches its size target. </p>
<p>The bank won''t hit a brick wall once it reduces risk-weighted assets to $180 billion from the $192 billion it had at
the end of June, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said today
at an investor conference in New York. The firm will let the $25
billion of RWAs roll off and may replace them with other assets
that earn a return of more than 10 percent, she said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is seeking to boost the return on equity in
its fixed-income trading business as the firm''s profitability
trails competitors. While Chief Executive Officer James Gorman,
56, has cut the amount of capital used by the fixed-income unit
by about half over the past three years, the firm''s ROE was
about 8 percent in the first half, below his goal of 10 percent. </p>
<p>The $25 billion of risk-weighted assets are primarily
structured-credit products and long-dated uncollateralized
derivatives, Porat said. The reduction will mostly come from
passive roll downs and the offsetting growth may be in corporate
credit and securitized-products trading, she said. </p>
<p>We have a number of franchises within fixed income where
there is an opportunity to continue to place capital and support
client activity where we''re already generating an attractive
return, Porat said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is reducing its balance sheet in interest
rates and currency trading, and reshaping its commodities
business to look more like it did in the 1990s, after those
units produced returns on equity of less than 5 percent last
year, Porat said. The firm''s credit and securitized-products
divisions each produced ROEs of more than 15 percent, she said. </p>

Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. are rushing to issue U.S.
dollar bonds in Taiwan after a rule change unlocked $586 billion
of funds held by the island''s insurance companies. </p>
<p>Goldman sold $974 million of 30-year notes last month in
the largest such issuance on the island, leading $7.3 billion in
greenback debt offers this year, versus zero a year earlier.
J.P. Morgan Securities LLC estimates U.S. issuers can obtain
lower costs than they would at home, after lawmakers in May
excluded locally issued foreign-currency bonds from a 45 percent
cap on the amount insurance firms can invest in overseas assets. </p>
<p>Taiwanese insurers'' yearly premium income has more than
doubled in the past decade as China''s export-manufacturing boom
boosted the island''s wealth. Their hunt for fixed-income
investments has cut the 10-year sovereign yield 116 basis points
in the past 10 years to 1.71 percent, the 13th-lowest globally,
compared with 2.49 percent in the U.S. </p>
<p>With Taiwan''s very low benchmark-rate environment, a lot
of domestic-currency investments have low yields, said Godwin Chang, head of Taiwan at Societe Generale AG, which sold $1.21
billion of bonds in the territory this year. Life insurers are
better off having more foreign-currency investments. </p>
<h2>Negative Spread </h2>
<p>The central bank cut its policy rate to a record low 1.25
percent in 2009 and maintained it at 1.875 percent in the past
13 quarters. As domestic rates fell, life insurance firms
boosted holdings of foreign assets to 44 percent as of June 30
from 38 percent at the end of 2011, according to the Taiwan
Insurance Institute. </p>
<p>The insurance industry''s 3.8 percent weighted average
liability cost was significantly higher than its recurring
investment yield of 2.8 percent in 2013, according to a June
presentation by the financial regulator. </p>
<p>Goldman issued its zero-coupon, 30-year bonds at a price to
yield 4.96 percent last week. Morgan Stanley''s notes due 2044
paid a coupon of 4.7 percent and Citigroup''s similar-maturity,
zero-coupon debt was sold at 4.88 percent. All of the dollar
notes sold on the island since May''s amendment are callable by
the issuer and mature in 20 or 30 years, while 74 percent pay
zero coupon, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Foreign-currency notes issued in Taiwan are called Formosa bonds. </p>
<p>Callable notes are popular among insurers, which can demand
higher yields to boost returns, J.P. Morgan strategists led by
Joshua Younger wrote in an Aug. 22 note. </p>
<p>Because they are considered domestic investments from a
regulatory perspective, Formosa bonds are generally compared
against Taiwan dollar-denominated fixed-income products, the
strategists wrote. With Taiwan dollar rates quite low by
comparison, yield-sensitive investors are likely to lower their
return targets for U.S. dollar callable Formosa bonds relative
to those registered overseas. </p>
<h2>Bond Sales </h2>
<p>The May 20 amendment also spurred issuances in yuan bonds,
with lenders such as Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of
China Ltd. selling 9.3 billion yuan ($1.5 billion) of debt in
Taiwan since then, compared with 1.5 billion yuan in the first
four months of 2014. </p>
<p>Local insurers'' total annual premium income grew an average
8 percent in each of the last 10 years to NT$2.7 trillion ($90
billion) in 2013 from NT$1.2 trillion in 2003, according to
Financial Supervisory Commission data. Premiums collected added
up to 17.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2013, the
world''s highest penetration rate, a Swiss Re Ltd. report shows. </p>
<h2>Insurer Interest </h2>
<p>For insurers whose investments abroad haven''t yet neared
the 45 percent limit, the locally issued foreign-currency bonds
are not the most attractive. Cathay Life Insurance Co. (2882), the
largest in the industry with NT$4.3 trillion of assets, has
bought very few of the foreign-currency notes as they offer
rates lower than similar securities overseas, executive vice
president Joseph Wang said at an Aug. 29 briefing. </p>
<p>Other companies have been more enthusiastic. Shinkong
Insurance Co. (2850) has spent NT$42.8 billion on locally issued
foreign debt and plans to buy more to boost returns, according
to an Aug. 28 presentation. Fubon Life Insurance Co. aims to
increase its holdings to NT$100 billion within a year, the
Economic Daily News reported on Aug. 22. </p>
<p>All of the dollar debt sold in Taiwan since May''s rule
change has been bought by the insurance industry, according to
Mark Liu, Taipei-based head of global markets at Societe
Generale. The French bank is speaking with European companies
both in and outside the financial sector regarding bond
issuances in Taiwan, Chang said. </p>
<h2>Expectations Tempered </h2>
<p>This may be a good time to sell debt as borrowing costs
will probably rise. Eight of 18 analysts in a Bloomberg poll
expect Taiwan to raise its policy rate at least once by the end
of this year. The island''s economy is showing signs of a
recovery this year. Data yesterday showed exports grew 9.6
percent in August, the most in 20 months. Sixty-six percent of
Taiwan''s shipments went to China, which this week posted a
record trade surplus for August. </p>
<p>In the U.S., 62 of 74 economists in another survey see a
Federal Reserve interest-rate increase by the third quarter of
next year. </p>
<p>Investors have already tempered their expectations for a
rate increase, according to Cosmas Lu, chief executive officer
at the Taipei branch of Barclays Plc, which lists its $600
million of 30-year bonds on the bond exchange GreTai Securities
Market today. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields have declined 54
basis points in 2014 as Fed Chair Janet Yellen signaled the
monetary authority''s commitment to low borrowing costs amid
mixed U.S. economic data. </p>
<p>Taiwan''s investors have been pretty quiet in the first
half of the year, waiting for interest rates to rise, which
didn''t happen, Lu said in an Aug. 27 phone interview. So
they''re very cash-rich and they realize they can''t wait forever.
There''s definitely very big demand from investors. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s asset-management arm is the lead investor in a transaction to purchase stakes in two older distressed-debt funds overseen by a former unit of Carlyle Group LP''s TCW Group Inc., two people with knowledge of the deal said. </p> <p>Goldman Sachs Asset Management agreed to lead a syndicate that will buy stakes from investors in 2002 and 2005 funds run by Crescent Capital Group LP, which separated from TCW in 2011, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the information is private.

<p>Iron ore declined sooner than
expected this year as supplies exceeded demand and prices are
unlikely to recover, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
which said 2014 will mark the end of a so-called iron age. </p>
<p>This year is the inflection point where new production
capacity finally catches up with demand growth, and profit
margins begin their reversion to the historical mean, analysts
Christian Lelong and Amber Cai wrote in a report today titled:
The end of the Iron Age.  The 2016 forecast for seaborne ore
was cut to $79 a metric ton from $82 and the 2017 outlook was
reduced to $78 from $85, according to the New-York based bank,
which stuck with a forecast for $80 next year. </p>
<p>The raw material tumbled into a bear market this year as
the biggest producers including Rio Tinto (RIO) Group expanded low-cost output, betting higher volumes would more than offset
falling prices while less competitive mines were forced to
close. The decline in prices came sooner than expected,
according to Goldman, which said in November that iron ore would
probably drop at least 15 percent this year. The commodity is
seen in a structural downtrend, JPMorgan Chase  Co. said today. </p>
<p>The price decline has been dramatic, but a weak demand
outlook in China and the structural nature of the surplus make a
recovery unlikely, Lelong and Cai wrote. Lower prices for
iron ore and steel are unlikely to boost demand in a material
way. Instead, the day when steel production in China will peak
gets ever closer. </p>
<h2>Lowest Level </h2>
<p>Ore with 62 percent content at the Chinese port of Qingdao
fell 39 percent to $82.22 a dry ton this year, the lowest level
since September 2009, according to data from Metal Bulletin Ltd.
The Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM), which doesn''t include iron ore as
a member, lost 2 percent in the period. Within the index,
soybeans fell the most. </p>
<p>Before the surplus emerged, iron ore supplies were tight
and producers had above-trend profits even as costs increased,
according to Lelong and Cai. That period, dubbed by the bank as
the Iron Age, is now ending, they wrote. </p>
<p>The current exploitation phase in iron ore could last for
a decade, the analysts wrote. Iron ore markets went through
a 20-year period of declining prices in real terms during the
previous exploitation phase that ended in 2004. </p>
<p>The global surplus will more than triple to 163 million
tons in 2015 from 52 million tons this year, according to
Goldman. The glut was seen expanding to 245 million tons in 2016
295 million tons in 2017 and 334 million tons in 2018. </p>
<h2>Producers'' View </h2>
<p>The biggest suppliers see higher prices. Ore may increase
as the higher-cost output exits the market, Nev Power, chief
executive officer of Perth-based Fortescue (FMG) Metals Group Ltd.,
said in an Aug. 20 interview on Bloomberg Television. Vale SA
also sees prices rebounding as supply growth slows and mines
close, Jose Carlos Martins, the Rio de Janeiro-based company''s
head of ferrous and strategy, said on July 31. </p>
<p>Iron ore may see a dramatic recovery this half, Paul Gait,
an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a report on July 9,
citing factors including a seasonal increase in the second six
months and an end to China''s policy tightening. Asia''s largest
economy accounts for about 67 percent of seaborne demand. </p>
<p>Credit growth in China missed estimates in July and new-home prices fell in almost all the cities the government tracks,
putting pressure on policy makers to step up stimulus as they
seek to meet an economic growth target of 7.5 percent. </p>
<p>About 110 million tons of global supply will close next
year and a further 75 million tons in 2016, Goldman estimated in
the report. While the majority of closures would be in China,
seaborne producers will not go unscathed, it said. </p>
<h2>Exceed Demand'' </h2>
<p>New seaborne iron ore supply delivered into China is
expected to exceed demand growth over the next three to four
years, Daniel Kang, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase  Co. in Hong
Kong, said by e-mail in response to Bloomberg questions. In
short, we see iron ore in a structural downtrend. </p>
<p>Rio Tinto, the biggest supplier after Vale, plans to boost
output to more than 330 million tons in 2015, according to a
company estimate. Vale will raise production 8.4 percent to 348
million tons in 2015. BHP Billiton Ltd. sees an 8.9 percent
increase from its Western Australian mines in the year from July
1, while Fortescue may boost shipments by 25 percent. </p>
<p>Fortescue''s stock declined 32 percent in Australia this
year, while in London Rio shares lost 5 percent and BHP rose 0.4
percent. In Brazil, Vale dropped 23 percent. </p>
<p>The shift into structural oversupply is barely six months
old but seaborne prices have already declined 38 percent year-to-date, Lelong and Cai wrote. Rather than representing the
trough for this cycle, we believe the downward pressure is set
to continue. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has
scrapped its forecast for the Reserve Bank of India to raise
borrowing costs after a pickup in monsoon rains and a drop in
oil prices tempered the inflation outlook. </p>
<p>The U.S. lender, which had expected a 50-basis-point
increase in the benchmark repurchase rate this year followed by
a reduction of the same magnitude in the second half of 2015,
now sees the RBI staying on hold through the end of next year,
it said in a report. Consumer-price (INFUTOTY) gains slowed to 7.8 percent
in August, from as high as 11.16 percent in November, the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey shows before data due Sept. 12. </p>
<p>Near-term risks to inflation have receded due to weaker
oil prices and a significantly improved monsoon, Tushar Poddar, an economist at Goldman in Mumbai, wrote in the report
dated yesterday. While our base case is now for the RBI to
remain on hold, the probability of a rate hike is higher than
that of a rate cut. The biggest change under the new government
has been a more investor-friendly mindset. </p>
<p>Measures taken by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took
office after a landslide election win in May, will spur economic
growth, lure capital inflows and support the rupee, Goldman said
in the report. A shortfall in India''s annual rains, crucial for
crops from sugar to rice and cotton, has narrowed to 11 percent
from more than 40 percent in June, official data show, and Brent
crude prices have retreated 14 percent from this year''s high of
$115.71 per barrel in June. </p>
<h2>Quickening Growth </h2>
<p>Goldman predicts Asia''s third-largest economy will expand
5.6 percent in the fiscal year through March 2015. Gross
domestic product increased 4.7 percent in the previous period, a
pace that was near the decade-low 4.5 percent recorded the year
before. The U.S. lender still sees the rupee weakening to 61 per
dollar, 62 and 63 in three, six and 12 months. The currency fell
0.4 percent to 60.8225 as of 9:21 a.m. in Mumbai, according to
prices from local banks. </p>
<p>RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, who raised borrowing costs
three times in the past year to combat inflation, has left them
unchanged since January. The central bank will hold the
benchmark rate at 8 percent through the end of 2014, according
to 16 of 26 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Four see a reduction
to 7.75 percent, while five estimate a 25-basis-point increase
and one expects an advance to 8.5 percent. </p>
<p>Modi''s decisions to cut red tape and allow more foreign
investment in industries including railways and defense have
buoyed investor confidence, Goldman said in the report. The
rupee has rebounded 13 percent from a record low of 68.845 per
dollar reached in August 2013, the world''s best-performing
emerging-market currency over that period, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>We think the Indian rupee will continue to trade in a
narrow range, with the RBI intervening to prevent any sharp
appreciation, Goldman''s Poddar wrote. </p>

<p>MD Medical Group Investments Plc,
which runs Russia''s largest chain of maternity centers, gained
for the first time in a week as JPMorgan Chase  Co. raised it
to buy, citing cheap valuation relative to regional peers. </p>
<p>JPMorgan''s recommendation on the company, which has a
market value of $620 million, comes as Aberdeen Asset Management
Plc sees Russian small-capitalization stocks as ridiculously
cheap after a sell-off. The MSCI Russia Small Cap Index is
down 22 percent this year, following a broad decline in the
country''s securities amid concern sanctions against Russia over
the Ukraine war will squelch economic growth. The U.S. and
European Union enforced new measures last week. </p>
<p>MD Medical gained 3.1 percent to $8.25 in London on Sept.
12, reducing its loss this year to 27 percent. Trading volume of
67,016 shares was 4.2 times the average of the past three
months. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index rose 0.4 percent as
energy exporters including OAO Surgutneftegas and OAO Gazprom
Neft gained on speculation a weaker ruble will boost profits. </p>
<p>JPMorgan cited the stock''s compelling 30 percent
discount to peers in eastern Europe and the Middle East when
it raised MD Medical from the equivalent of hold. Analyst Elena Jouronova forecast compound annual revenue growth of 26 percent
through 2017 as regional expansion gathers pace, according to an
e-mailed research note. </p>
<h2>GDP Slowdown </h2>
<p>Growth in Russia''s $2 trillion economy has been slowed by
the international sanctions intended to punish President
Vladimir Putin for allegedly supporting the rebellion in eastern
Ukraine, a claim he denies. Barclays Plc., which projects a 0.1
percent decline in gross domestic product this year and a 0.6
percent contraction in 2015, said in a Sept. 11 research note
that new measures imply downside risks to that forecast. </p>
<p>Luis Saenz, head of equity sales and trading at BCS
Financial Group in London, said MD Medical isn''t as vulnerable
to the slowdown as other companies whose revenue comes from
domestic spending. </p>
<p>They focus on high-end maternity health care and are
diversifying operations throughout Russia, Saenz said by
phone. Even as the economy slows, people won''t cut spending on
maternity health care because it''s so critical. </p>
<h2>Sales Estimates </h2>
<p>MD Medical, which has 17 medical centers throughout Russia
including in Moscow, St.Petersburg, Perm, Samara and Irkutsk,
said on Aug. 20 that it bought Avicenne Medical Center in
Novosibirk for $45.5 million. The acquisition will help the
company increase revenue, according to JP Morgan''s Jouronova and
Saenz of BCS. </p>
<p>JP Morgan raised MD Medical''s revenue forecast by as 4.6
percent to $204 million for 2014 and increased its 2015 sales
estimate by 5.6 percent to $265 million, according to the bank''s
research note. </p>
<p>Their business model is beautiful, but low liquidity in
Russian small-capitalization stocks is a problem Saenz said.
Investors are worried about the geopolitical risks and want to
be able to get in and out of the market quickly. </p>
<p>The Micex Second-Tier Index of companies with lower market
capitalization fell 1 percent to 2,959.65 last week, extending
the decline this year to 4.9 percent. The benchmark Micex Index
dropped 1.1 percent last week to 1,458.52 and is down 3 percent
this year. The Bloomberg index of the most-trade Russian stocks
in the U.S. slid 3.3 percent to 85.46 in the five days through
Sept. 12 and has retreated 16 percent in 2014. </p>
<h2>Fund Flows </h2>
<p>Within the Russian space, the small-caps have sold off
ridiculously, Peter Taylor, a senior investment manager for
global emerging markets at Aberdeen Asset Management in London,
said in an interview on Sept. 5. Liquidity has completely
dried up. There are Russian small caps that are decent
businesses that are just looking ridiculously cheap. </p>
<p>MD Medical is a nice business, Taylor said. The
management team impresses us and the business model is an
attractive structural story in Russia and yet that stock has
just gone so off year-to-date. </p>
<p>Futures (VEA) on the dollar-denominated RTS index expiring this
month gained 0.7 percent to 122,230 in U.S. hours on Sept. 12.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
futures, declined 1.2 percent to 32.19. </p>
<p>The Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX), the biggest U.S. exchange-traded fund that tracks the nation''s stocks, fell 3 percent last
week to $24.57. It gained 0.5 percent on Sept. 12. </p>
<p>Russia-dedicated funds attracted about $140 million in the
week through Sept. 10, after outflows in the previous week,
Cameron Brandt, research director at EPFR Global, a Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based company that tracks fund flows, said by e-mail. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley says Australian
bonds, the worst-performing government debt in the past month,
have further to decline as investment-grade securities globally
will stagnate for the next seven years. </p>
<p>Australian sovereign debt due in more than a year lost 0.7
percent in the month ended Sept. 12, the most among 26 indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Bond prices will fall in tandem with
benchmark U.S. Treasuries as the Federal Reserve prepares to
raise interest rates, according to Morgan Stanley. </p>
<p>Higher borrowing costs would complicate Prime Minister Tony
Abbott''s efforts to sustain growth in an economy with decade-high unemployment and his goal of reining in the country''s
record A$337.7 billion ($306 billion) debt. The government''s
focus on sales of long-term securities will also help push
yields higher, Morgan Stanley says. </p>
<p>We''re bearish on bond markets generally as we get closer
to the Fed starting their tightening cycle, Geoffrey Kendrick,
head of Asian currency and interest-rate strategy at Morgan
Stanley in Hong Kong, said in a Sept. 10 telephone interview.
In Australia, that clearly will flow through to local bond
selling as well. </p>
<h2>Rising Unemployment </h2>
<p>Abbott won election a year ago after pledging in his
campaign to work toward turning the government budget deficit
into a surplus. He''s now battling rising unemployment, with the
jobless rate climbing to 6.4 percent in July, the highest level
in 12 years. The rate retreated to 6.1 percent in August as the
economy added a record 121,000 jobs, most of them part time. </p>
<p>Debt issuance will fall to an estimated A$67 billion in the
fiscal year that began July 1, from about A$85 billion in the
previous financial year, the Australian Office of Financial
Management said in May. Sales for 2014-2015 will cover A$27
billion of maturing bonds, A$36 billion of new securities and
A$4 billion of inflation-linked securities. </p>
<p>The nation''s government debt had a modified duration of
5.18 years at the end of June, compared with 4.85 a year
earlier, according to the AOFM website. Sales of longer
maturities extend duration, which is a gauge of bond volatility
used by investors. </p>
<p>You have still relatively large issuance, Kendrick
said. That probably means there''s going to be some pressure on
the back end of the maturity range particularly as global
bonds are somewhat softer, he said. </p>
<h2>Rising Yields </h2>
<p>Australia''s 10-year bond yield was at 3.61 percent at the
close of trading in Sydney last week, having climbed from this
year''s low of 3.28 percent set on Aug. 8. </p>
<p>The securities yielded about 104 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, and the spread should stay at about
110 for the next year, Kendrick said. U.S. 10-year yields will
rise to 2.95 percent in 12 months, Morgan Stanley said in a
report Sept. 7, from 2.56 percent. The company is one of the 22
primary dealers that trade directly with the Fed. </p>
<p>Australian government securities due in 10 years and longer
have a correlation of 0.94 with their U.S. counterparts, the
Bloomberg and EFFAS data show. A figure of 1 would mean the two
move in lock step. </p>
<p>The decline in Australia''s bonds accelerated after 10-year
futures contracts dropped below a support level last week
according to John Gorman, head of dollar interest-rate trading
for Asia and the Pacific at Nomura Holdings Inc. in Tokyo. </p>
<h2>Getting Out'' </h2>
<p>Using a chart of the contract price, Gorman drew an
ascending trend line connecting lows set in April and June and
extrapolated it out to today. The price fell below the line on
Sept. 5 and the decline quickened from there. </p>
<p>It broke that trend line, he said in a phone call Sept.
10. People who bought it before are getting out. </p>
<p>Declines in Australian bonds may be limited from here
because yields of more than 3 percent are still attractive to
investors, said Peter Jolly, head of research in Sydney at
National Australia Bank Ltd., the nation''s biggest lender as
measured by assets. </p>
<p>Australian government bonds will be a good investment,
he said by phone on Sept. 10. The RBA is on hold and the
Federal Reserve is on the path to raising interest rates. </p>
<p>Reserve Bank of Australia''s Governor Glenn Stevens repeated
this month the most prudent thing to do is keep the benchmark
interest rate, the target for overnight loans between banks, at
a record low of 2.5 percent. </p>
<h2>Fed Tightening </h2>
<p>The Fed is set to raise its target for overnight lending
next year, federal fund futures show. Thirty-day contracts for
delivery in September 2015 yielded 0.54 percent, signaling
traders are pricing in that the central bank will increase its
rate from the current range of zero to 0.25 percent by then. </p>
<p>Jonathan Mackay at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management in New
York said a three-decade decline in bond yields has come to an
end. Investors should seek risker securities such as high-yield
bonds, he said in an interview on Bloomberg Television this
month. The company manages $2 trillion. </p>
<p>What we''re suggesting is that you just have less of your
bond allocation in the perceived, or formerly perceived, safe
havens, he said. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), maker of the Xbox video-game console, agreed to acquire Mojang AB, the software company behind the popular game Minecraft, for $2.5 billion, in a bid to boost its Xbox and mobile businesses. </p> <p>Microsoft, the world''s largest software maker, said Stockholm-based Mojang will join its game-studio division, though the company''s founders will move on to other projects.

<p>Morgan Stanley was fined $280,000
for ignoring numerous red flags in opening an account tied
to a multimillion-dollar Ponzi scheme, a U.S. regulator said. </p>
<p>The bank''s Smith Barney unit was cited for improper
supervision and records violations, the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission said today in a statement. The New York-based
company also failed to enforce trading limits it assigned to the
account and adequately respond to regulators'' requests for
documents, the CFTC said. </p>
<p>The accounts were used by Benjamin Wilson, the owner of
SureInvestment, to continue a $35 million Ponzi scheme based in
the U.K., according to the statement. Wilson was sentenced to
seven years in prison this year after pleading guilty to charges
brought by that country''s Financial Conduct Authority, the CFTC
said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley ignored warning signs even as the
account should have received special scrutiny because two
SureInvestment entities were based in the British Virgin
Islands. </p>
<p>The warning signs included documents that showed
SureInvestment had returns of 2,850 percent from 2003 to 2009
and 45 consecutive profitable months, according to the CFTC''s
order. SureInvestment also submitted an audit that included
numerous typographical errors, the regulator said. </p>
<h2>Fully Cooperated'' </h2>
<p>A simple Internet search would have revealed that neither
the SureInvestment entity that was the subject of the audits nor
the purported B.V.I. auditing firm and its principals actually
existed, the CFTC said in the order. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) didn''t admit or deny the charges, while
consenting to the entry of the CFTC''s findings. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley takes its regulatory responsibilities
seriously, Christine Jockle, a company spokeswoman, said in an
e-mailed statement. The firm fully cooperated with the CFTC''s
investigation. The events described in the settlement involve a
single account that traded for less than three months. CFTC did
not conclude that the firm''s conduct in this matter was willful,
intentional or fraudulent. </p>

<p>Coca-Cola Co. (KO)''s newest social-media campaign reaches back to a time when even MySpace didn''t exist. </p> <p>Surge, a citrus-flavored Mountain Dew knockoff that was discontinued by Coke about 12 years ago, has reappeared in limited supply today. The only place to get it: Amazon.com. </p> <p>Billed as the company''s first ever e-commerce reintroduction, the news was announced by the Facebook Fan site Surge Movement, whose 128,000 members lobbied for its return and paid for a billboard in Atlanta. Coke gave the drink a Twitter account, too, so loyalists can follow the brand''s journey. </p> <p>Surge is back, the Facebook page''s organizers said, urging readers to buy and spread the word. The Movement does not end here! </p> <p>At the website listserv.com, Surge is listed as No. 7 on a Top 10 list of discontinued sodas, beating out Hubba Bubba Soda. Surge, a sweet and caffeinated green pop, will be sold in 12-packs of 16-ounce cans printed with the original graphics for $14. Coke said it may expand the drink to other retailers and add to the campaign, depending on how consumers react. </p> <p>This will be a great learning experience for us and a refreshing opportunity for fans, Wendy Clark, Coke''s president of North America Sparkling  Strategic Marketing, said in a statement. </p> <p>Scott Williamson, a Coke spokesman, declined to say how much of the drink the company has produced intially. </p> <h2>Extremely Rare'' </h2> <p>Coca-Cola has struggled for decades to counter PepsiCo Inc. (PEP)''s Mountain Dew juggernaut. Surge was one of those efforts. Introduced in 1996, the last bottles and cans were offered in 2001, two years before the social-networking site Myspace debuted. Facebook would come even later. </p> <p>At the Surge Movement Facebook page, founded just before Christmas 2011, fans shared a 1997 commercial for the drink. Another post showed a way to get extremely rare Surge syrup on Ebay.com. One fan photo shows an artifact that was discovered at a flea market in Okoboji, Iowa: a giant Surge bottle once used at events to ice down drink samples. </p> <p>I stole one of these when Surge first came out, one commenter responded. Sadly, it was lost at the top of Happy Jack Mountains outside of Laramie Wyoming when someone got in it and tried to ride it down a mountain. It was a prize possession. </p> <p>The group sold The Surge Movement t-shirts, and it crowdfunded a $4,000 billboard near Coke headquarters in Atlanta that read: Dear Coke, We couldn''t buy Surge so we bought this billboard instead. It''s the largest to pledge for the revival of any discontinued product. </p> <h2>Mountain Dew </h2> <p>The site''s managers urged fans to call Coca-Cola routinely with reminders like, Did you make your call today? A mysterious undated video posted yesterday showed the Facebook page''s administrators meeting at a hotel in Atlanta. Users wanted to know why but they weren''t saying. </p> <p>It''s no wonder Coke keeps trying. Mountain Dew, the fourth-best-selling soft drink in the U.S., has been one of the few bright spots in PepsiCo''s soda lineup in recent years as consumers drink less soda. Popular with teens, video gamers and extreme sports enthusiasts, Mountain Dew outperformed both the soda category and Pepsi-Cola last year, according to Beverage Digest data. </p> <p>Coke may have found its opening, though. Dew''s volume sales declined last year. Sales volume for regular Dew fell 2.2 percent, compared with declines of 3.6 percent for Pepsi-Cola and 3 percent for the category. </p> <p> ', 'Coca-Cola Brings Back Surge Soda to Tap 1990s Nostalgia', 'By Duane D.

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS), which has set a
goal of attracting $10 billion of client assets to sustainable
investing products over the next few years, is adding two such
portfolios for its wealth-management customers. </p>
<p>The accounts invest with a range of outside managers who
either screen to avoid certain companies or actively seek out
businesses that have shown success in environmental or social
issues. The Investing with Impact portfolios feature one
balanced and one equity offering. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley already has about $3.5 billion in more than
100 products aimed at providing social benefits along with
financial returns, said Hilary Irby, who leads the New York-based bank''s so-called impact investing effort. The new
offerings may accelerate that growth by providing clients a pre-selected mix of holdings that are diversified while following
principles of sustainable investing. </p>
<p>These portfolios can absolutely be a client''s full
portfolio, Irby said in an interview. As the bank creates
products that allow customers to satisfy impact objectives,
and not necessarily have to give up those financial goals, then
we can move more of our clients'' resources to help address some
of the sustainability issues the world is facing broadly. </p>
<p>The biggest U.S. banks have sought to help allocate capital
to efforts such as community development, education and
environmental preservation both in response to client demand and
in the wake of public outrage and government rescues resulting
from the financial crisis. </p>
<h2>Affordable Housing </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley Chief Executive Officer James Gorman pledged
$1 billion last year to help improve affordable housing as part
of the bank''s push into sustainable investing that included
promoting research and developing new products. The broader
trend has spanned public and private markets and has also been
called social-impact investing or socially    responsible
investing. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage, the world''s largest by number
of financial advisers, has 4 million clients with $2 trillion in
assets at the firm. </p>
<p>The bank constructed the portfolios to reduce the biases
typically associated with sustainable strategies, notably that
they are predominantly in small-cap growth companies, said Chad
Graves, who oversees impact investing for wealth management. The
equity portfolio should have similar risk and return
characteristics to broader indexes such as the Standard  Poor''s
500 (SPX) and the Russell 1000, he said. </p>
<h2>Steady Income </h2>
<p>We don''t think about this as a separate asset class, we
don''t think about this as something that has to sit off in a
corner because it''s a unique way of investing, Graves said.
It''s not unique in that the objectives of this are exactly the
same as they would be for a portfolio that wasn''t invested for
impact. We want to get the same financial returns. </p>
<p>The portfolios may also aid Morgan Stanley''s push to move
more clients into fee-based managed accounts that provide steady
income to the bank. The firm had $762 billion of client assets
in fee-based accounts at June 30, up 21 percent from a year
earlier, and it has set a goal of $1 trillion such assets. </p>
<p>The balanced portfolio, which invests about 60 percent in
equity and 40 percent in debt, has a minimum investment of
$750,000, while the equity portfolio has a $400,000 minimum,
Graves said. The bank is seeking to develop a similar donor-advised fund with a $25,000 minimum investment, said Jim Tracy,
who runs the brokerage''s consulting group. </p>
<p>This is an emerging opportunity for investors, and we
want to be known as the firm that when people see what we''re
doing, they know that we''re serious about it, Tracy said.
And it''s not just something we''re doing for the ultra-rich. </p>

Other companies in the market include Deliveroo, which supplies foods from restaurants and charges for delivery. </p> <p>Parekh''s partners are Humberto Ayres Pereira, who was at McKinsey  Co. and founded the Skin online cosmetics business in his native Portugal; and Torben Schulz, an entrepreneur who plans to start an EatFirst in Berlin, where he is based. </p> <p>EatFirst is backed by Berlin-based Rocket Internet AG, which invests in companies related to the Internet industry. </p> <h2>Two Dishes </h2> <p>The company currently offers a choice of two dishes, one of them vegetarian. They both change daily and are prepared in a kitchen in Farringdon, near the City of London. Recent options include chorizo and chicken jambalaya; Thai massaman curry; and goat cheese ratatouille. Each costs 7 pounds ($11.32). </p> <p>The executive chef is Jane Tran, who previously worked at Bar Boulud. A third option will be added in coming months. Customers may pay by debit or credit card or via an app. </p> <p>Parekh, 28, was born in Manchester, England, to a family that was originally from Gujarat, in India. His parents were born in Kenya. EatFirst is initially delivering in part of the City of London financial district. It''s a crowded market. </p> <p>At Goldman, I used to cycle between Itsu on a Monday, and a Pret on a Tuesday, and a Leon on a Wednesday and a Pod on a Thursday and it just gets so boring after a couple of weeks, he said. That''s what we really wanted to change with EatFirst so people can have a varied diet and don''t have to look elsewhere. </p> <p>Natalie Berg, global research director at Planet Retail Ltd. in London, said that while the trend toward healthy convenience food isn''t new, technology is changing things. </p> <h2>Working Lunch </h2> <p>Food delivery has been limited to pizza and other fast food without high-quality options, she said in a telephone interview. But technology is changing this and there''s an opportunity to tap into a very lucrative working-lunch market. </p> <p>What is especially interesting with EatFirst is that it''s based on simplicity -- just a couple of dishes -- which helps them to keep costs down and reinforces the ethos of high-quality, freshly prepared food. </p> <p>Parekh declined to disclose financial details or profit targets. He said the company plans to expand aggressively. </p> <p>In a place like London, which is so vast and so densely populated, the sky''s the limit, he said. Even the City, which is a tiny area, there''s almost 400,000 people during the day, so there''s no reason we can''t be pushing towards thousands a day and be the biggest food-delivery company in London. </p> <h2>Food Has Lagged </h2> <p>For the first year, I''d imagine within London we can get over 1,000 meals a day and that would be serving the City and central London and also expanding to Canary Wharf. We have a pretty aggressive expansion plan. We are working on a number of new kitchen locations and expanding our delivery network </p> <p>I see this as the future for food delivery. As other retail products move online, food has really lagged. Our expansion plan is realistic given the future that we expect for the food industry and the online-delivery landscape. </p> <p>Most Britons ordering food online currently do so through a restaurant''s own website such as Pizza Hut, according to Helena Childe, senior food service analyst at Mintel. </p> <p>Third-party sites such as Just Eat are increasing in popularity, she said. </p> <p>Most online restaurant habits (from online ordering to mobile payments) are most common among Londoners and the tech-savvy youth market (under-35s), Childe said in a Mintel report, Eating Out: The Decision-Making Process, earlier this year. </p> <h2>Small Cog </h2> <p>EatFirst leases its kitchens and delivery bikes, seeking to keep down costs while it expands. Fair enough but was it wise to quit Goldman to pursue such a venture? </p> <p>I had a fantastic experience at Goldman but everything we do now has a huge impact on the future of the business, he said. It''s different to working in an organization like Goldman Sachs, where you can feel like a small cog in a massive machine. </p> <p>This is a totally different thrill: There''s new things every day to do. I''ve been in the kitchen, cleaning dishes with the chefs. I''ve been handing out flyers with the marketing team. I''ve been involved in fund-raising meetings. There''s so much to do and it''s an all-round business experience. </p> <p>Information: https://www.eatfirst.co.uk/; the app is here: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id907506298. </p> <p>(Richard Vines is the chief food critic for Bloomberg.

<p>Companies in Brazil are shunning
the local bond market on speculation President Dilma Rousseff,
who''s presided over an economy plagued by surging inflation and
a lack of growth, will be re-elected. </p>
<p>Corporate borrowers have issued 35.44 billion reais ($15.24
billion) of bonds in the first eight months of the year, a 7.8
percent decrease from a year ago and the least since 2010,
according to the most recent data from Anbima, Brazil''s capital
markets association. </p>
<p>With the first round of elections less than three weeks
away, polls show Rousseff is regaining the popular support she
lost earlier this month. That''s revived concern a victory by the
incumbent will mean four more years of fiscal policies that led
to Brazil''s first recession since 2009, which may deter
companies from borrowing to expand, according to JPMorgan Chase
 Co. and Banco Votorantim SA. This month, companies have issued
2 billion reais of bonds, less than half as much as a year ago. </p>
<p>Companies are waiting until there is more clarity on what
the next government will be like, Ricardo Leoni, the head of
Brazil''s debt capital markets at JPMorgan, said in a telephone
interview from Sao Paulo. </p>
<p>Officials from the president''s office didn''t reply to e-mails and a call seeking comment. </p>
<p>Assuming Rousseff is one of the top finishers in first-round voting on Oct. 5, she would then probably garner 41
percent of the vote in an Oct. 26 election runoff, according to
a Vox Populi poll released Sept. 15. </p>
<h2>Dead Heat </h2>
<p>That puts her in a statistical tie with opposition
candidate Marina Silva, who received support from 42 percent of
those polled. The Sept. 13-14 survey of 2,000 people has a
margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. Silva''s lead was seven
percentage points in an Aug. 31-Sept. 2 poll. </p>
<p>An Ibope poll published yesterday showed a runoff between
Rousseff and Marina Silva would be too close to call while
backing for third-place candidate Aecio Neves increased.
Rousseff would win 36 percent of voter support in the first
round, with 30 percent for Silva and 19 percent for Neves,
according to the Sept. 13-15 survey. In an Oct. 26 runoff, Silva
would have 43 percent of voter support, compared with 40 percent
for Rousseff, according to the poll published on Jornal Nacional
television. </p>
<p>In the past three weeks, Rousseff has stepped up attacks
against Silva, saying the former environment minister doesn''t
have the experience to lead and would reduce investments in
offshore oil and gas reserves. Silva says the incumbent''s
policies contributed to a recession in the first half of this
year and quicker inflation. </p>
<h2>Government''s Role </h2>
<p>Since taking office in January 2011, Rousseff has increased
the government''s role in companies, changing concession-renewal
rules to lower electricity rates and capping gasoline prices to
tame inflation that last month exceed the 6.5 percent limit of
the central bank''s target range. Policy makers raised the
benchmark interest rate by 3.75 percentage points over nine
straight meetings through April before holding it at a two-year
high of 11 percent for the past three. </p>
<p>Latin America''s largest economy shrank 0.6 percent in the
April-June period from the previous three months, after
contracting 0.2 percent in the first quarter, the national
statistics agency said Aug. 29. </p>
<p>The real declined 0.3 percent to 2.3388 per dollar today as
of 2:40 p.m. in New York. </p>
<h2>Average Rates </h2>
<p>Silva has promised to cut inflation by half and called for
a fiscal-responsibility body to independently monitor budgets
and spending to verify that the government is complying with
fiscal targets. </p>
<p>The average interest rate on floating-rate local bonds with
maturities longer than 12 months issued this year was 10.99
percent, 0.12 percentage point above the average in the same
span last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p>
<p>This has been a tough year for local companies, with all
the concerns regarding politics and the economic scenario we''ll
have starting next year,Carolina Lacerda, the head of
investment banking at UBS AG''s Brazil unit and a director at
Anbima, said in an interview in Sao Paulo. Companies are
cautious, especially because the cost of funding, in general, is
at a very high level. </p>
<p>While Brazilian companies are staying away from the local
debt market, they''re boosting overseas offerings to lock in
borrowing costs before U.S. policy makers raise interest rates.
They have issued $42.7 billion this year, a 45 percent increase
from the same period in 2013, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<h2>Growth Outlook </h2>
<p>Ricardo Carvalho, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, said that if
economic growth begins to recover later this year, issuance in
the local market will probably rebound. </p>
<p>Brazilian companies aren''t selling bonds because they are
not spending much, he said in an interview in Sao Paulo.
That could change once the economy starts to improve, which
could happen before the end of this semester. </p>
<p>While Carvalho sees the potential for growth to accelerate,
Moody''s Investors Service cut the outlook on Brazil''s credit
rating to negative on Sept. 9, saying the economy is unlikely to
rebound in the short term. </p>
<p>Companies seem to be waiting for what will happen in the
macroeconomic scenario and after elections before selling more
debt, Reinaldo Lacerda, who helps manage 43 billion reais in
assets as the investment director at the wealth management
division of Banco Votorantim SA, said in an interview in Sao
Paulo. </p>

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s Brazil
unit returned to profitability in the fourth quarter as the
departure of several managing directors helped cut costs and
fixed-income gains offset an investment-banking revenue drop. </p>
<p>We made the right decision in anticipating that this year
would be less vibrant for investment banking, and had some
opportunities for cost reductions when some executives left
after receiving good job offers, Paulo Leme, named Goldman
Sachs''s president and chief executive officer for Brazil today,
said in an interview in Sao Paulo. Leme, 59, didn''t say how long
the New York-based company had been losing money in Brazil. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs eliminated bonuses for some bankers in Brazil
this year, contributing to the departures of five executives in
January, people familiar with the matter said in February. The
company reduced employees in investment banking to 25 from 45,
the people said. Fabio Bicudo, the former co-head of investment
banking, left in January to become CEO of Rio de Janeiro-based
power company Eneva SA, Leme said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs began trading Brazil Treasury bonds in the
second half of last year, and now we are the most active bank
in the primary market and one of the top four in the secondary
market, competing head-to-head with local players, Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, whom Leme is replacing, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Vollbrechthausen will move to New York after Leme''s
appointment is approved by Brazil''s central bank, to become
Goldman Sachs''s head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities
sales for Latin America. Leme was previously chairman for
Brazil, a position that will be eliminated. </p>
<h2>Private Equity </h2>
<p>The drag from lower investment-banking revenue is also
being offset by gains in private equity, structured credit,
mezzanine financing and non-performing loan acquisitions, said
Vollbrechthausen, who is a Goldman Sachs partner, a nod to the
firm''s history as a private partnership before going public in
1999. Leme is a managing director, one level below partner. </p>
<p>With about 300 employees in Brazil, about the same as the
level at the start of last year, the bank is well-staffed
for now, Leme said. </p>
<p>At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
Sachs''s revenue from investment banking had been falling in
Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
people familiar with the matter said last year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) shares rose to the
highest since the financial crisis and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)
closed at an almost five-year peak as U.S. stocks climbed to a
record. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley jumped 1.6 percent to $36.13, the highest
since Sept. 12, 2008, the last business day before Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. went bankrupt. Goldman Sachs rose for a
seventh straight day, the longest streak since 2006, to $187.89. </p>
<p>The two investment banks, which converted to bank holding
companies during the 2008 financial crisis, have overcome doubts
about their survival as an improving economy helps U.S. stocks
reach record levels. Surging deal fees and booming markets have
helped allay concerns that lower trading volumes and stricter
capital rules are pressuring returns. </p>
<p>America comes back, it''s always come back. Frankly it''s
done better than I might have expected in the depths of the
financial crisis, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. Chairman Warren Buffett said today in a Bloomberg Television interview where he
sat next to Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein. Policy makers got the locomotive back on the
tracks. And it started from a dead start, but it has moved a
long way and it continues to move, Buffett said. </p>
<p>Berkshire has 13.1 million Goldman Sachs shares, valued at

Goldman Sachs in 2011 redeemed a $5 billion preferred stake on
which Berkshire earned a 10 percent annual coupon. </p>
<h2>Enjoying Payoff </h2>
<p>Morgan Stanley has sold investors on a safer business model
more dependent on its retail brokerage, while Goldman Sachs has
produced higher returns and says it will benefit when markets
become more active. Both are based in New York. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley is enjoying the payoffs from years of
investment to fix and rebuild the business, Christian Bolu, a
bank analyst at Credit Suisse Group AG who has a neutral
rating on the stock, wrote in a note to investors this week.
Morgan Stanley is well positioned to benefit from an improving
operating environment and a more favorable interest-rate
backdrop. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley has boosted margins in its wealth-management
division, which more than doubled in size from the firm''s 2009
purchase of Smith Barney from Citigroup Inc. It also shrank its
fixed-income trading business and has pledged to return more of
the capital that supported that business to shareholders. </p>
<h2>Tepid Support </h2>
<p>Still, the firm''s return on equity, a measure of
profitability, was about 8 percent in the first half of the
year, below Chief Executive Officer James Gorman''s target of 10
percent. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs''s 11 percent gain since Aug. 7 has come amid
tepid support for the shares among analysts. Just nine of the 34
analysts covering the bank recommended buying the shares,
compared with more than 80 percent four years ago. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn has said that
abnormal markets featuring low rates and low volatility have
crimped trading revenue, which fell 12 percent in the first half
of the year to the lowest since the crisis. </p>
<p>Still, rising markets and an increased number of mergers
have boosted its three other units, which all had revenue
increases in the first six months. The firm produced an 11
percent return on equity, ahead of Citigroup and Bank of America
Corp. and on par with JPMorgan Chase  Co. </p>
<p>We expect GS will continue to deliver fundamental results
that are at the high end of peers, Bolu wrote in a note last

<p> Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)''s Brazil
unit returned to profitability in the fourth quarter as the
departure of several managing directors helped cut costs and
fixed-income gains offset an investment-banking revenue drop. </p>
<p>We made the right decision in anticipating that this year
would be less vibrant for investment banking, and had some
opportunities for cost reductions when some executives left
after receiving good job offers, Paulo Leme, named Goldman
Sachs''s president and chief executive officer for Brazil today,
said in an interview in Sao Paulo. Leme, 59, didn''t say how long
the New York-based company had been losing money in Brazil. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs eliminated bonuses for some bankers in Brazil
this year, contributing to the departures of five executives in
January, people familiar with the matter said in February. The
company reduced employees in investment banking to 25 from 45,
the people said. Fabio Bicudo, the former co-head of investment
banking, left in January to become CEO of Rio de Janeiro-based
power company Eneva SA, Leme said. </p>
<p>Goldman Sachs began trading Brazil Treasury bonds in the
second half of last year, and now we are the most active bank
in the primary market and one of the top four in the secondary
market, competing head-to-head with local players, Alejandro Vollbrechthausen, whom Leme is replacing, said in an interview. </p>
<p>Vollbrechthausen will move to New York after Leme''s
appointment is approved by Brazil''s central bank, to become
Goldman Sachs''s head of fixed-income, currencies and commodities
sales for Latin America. Leme was previously chairman for
Brazil, a position that will be eliminated. </p>
<h2>Private Equity </h2>
<p>The drag from lower investment-banking revenue is also
being offset by gains in private equity, structured credit,
mezzanine financing and non-performing loan acquisitions, said
Vollbrechthausen, who is a Goldman Sachs partner, a nod to the
firm''s history as a private partnership before going public in
1999. Leme is a managing director, one level below partner. </p>
<p>With about 300 employees in Brazil, about the same as the
level at the start of last year, the bank is well-staffed
for now, Leme said. </p>
<p>At least nine managing directors in Brazil left Goldman
Sachs during 2013 after the bank halted its growth plans when
the economy expanded less than analysts estimated. Goldman
Sachs''s revenue from investment banking had been falling in
Brazil while trading and wealth-management fees increased,
people familiar with the matter said last year. </p>

<p>Morgan Stanley (MS) will swallow some
losses incurred by customers who bought mutual funds after the
bank failed to make the fund prospectuses accessible online. </p>
<p>Brokerage clients who elected electronic delivery of
documents can rescind purchases of mutual funds they bought from
Nov. 8, 2013, through Aug. 14, New York-based Morgan Stanley
said in a letter addressed to fund companies and obtained by
Bloomberg News. Customers who have already sold such holdings at
a loss can be made whole, the bank said. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s brokerage, the world''s largest by
financial advisers, has 4 million clients with $2 trillion in
assets. While the bank didn''t provide an estimate of what it
would cost to cover client losses, doing so may shield the
company from litigation, according to the letter. </p>
<p>By conducting the rescission offer, the bank wrote,
clients should be precluded in the future from requiring us to
repurchase fund shares or maintaining an action against Morgan
Stanley. </p>
<p>The brokerage offers more than 4,000 mutual funds from more
than 300 companies, according to its website. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley''s costs may be muted by the fact very few
sectors lost money during the period, said Russell Kinnel,
director of research at Morningstar Inc. Commodities and
precious metals were among those areas that saw declines in the
past year, Kinnel said. </p>
<h2>System Issue'' </h2>
<p>The Standard  Poor''s 500 Index (SPX) rose in eight of the past
10 months, and U.S. corporate bonds have returned 6.24 percent
since Nov. 8, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
data. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley better just hope the market holds up the
30 days of the rescission period, Kinnel said. </p>
<p>A system issue, which was fixed as of Aug. 15, caused a
failure to deliver the prospectuses in a timely manner, Morgan
Stanley said. The bank said it has notified the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority about the mishap. </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley bought Smith Barney from Citigroup Inc. in
2009, more than doubling the size of its wealth-management unit.
The firm completed the integration of the brokerage''s technology
platform in 2012, and last year Greg Fleming, 51, who runs the
business, pledged to spend $500 million to improve the systems
after flaws frustrated employees. </p>
<p>The issue was caused by an inadvertent error, Christine Jockle, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, said in a statement.
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management discovered this problem,
corrected it, and is offering clients the opportunity to rescind
affected purchases. </p>
<p>Jockle declined to estimate the cost to cover client
losses. </p>

<p>Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) said the U.S. government is giving the company more time to shut its Russian Arctic well beyond the deadline for sanctions aimed at halting the $700 million project. </p> <p>Exxon asked Washington for an extension to allow it to continue performing shut-down work on the Universitetskaya-1 (University-1) well in Russia''s Kara Sea to make sure the well was safe before it''s temporarily abandoned. The Irving, Texas-based company already had ceased drilling the offshore well after U.S. sanctions set a Sept. 26 deadline for ending the work. </p> <p>The U.S. Treasury Department, recognizing the complexity of the University-1 well and the sensitive Kara Sea arctic environment, has granted a license to Exxon Mobil and other U.S. contractors and persons involved to enable the safe and responsible winding down of operations related to this exploration well, Exxon said in a statement today. </p> <p>The most-recent round of sanctions intended to punish Russia for its involvement in separatist violence in Ukraine barred U.S. and European Union companies from helping Russia exploit oil resources in the Arctic, deep seas and shale formations. </p> <p>Waging Financial War</p><p>The measures had prompted Exxon and its partner OAO Rosneft (ROSN) to temporarily halt drilling at the well, which lies about 260 feet (79 meters) beneath the sea surface off Siberia''s northern coast, according to three people familiar with the project. The well is aiming to tap a resource estimated to hold as much as 9 billion barrels of crude, worth $880 billion at current prices. </p> <h2>More Time </h2> <p>Exxon sought the exemption from the deadline after engineers involved in the project warned they needed more time to properly plug the well with cement and conduct tests to ensure there are no leaks, cracks or faults that could damage the reservoir or allow environmental contamination, according to a source with knowledge of the matter who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. </p> <p>Exxon and Rosneft are exploring a geologic formation never before drilled by humans, which means the pressure changes, layer densities and temperatures at various depths are unknown, increasing the risks of unexpected collapses or pressure bursts. For that reason, the engineers closing the well need to map the formation a foot at a time as they back out of the well, a process that can take weeks. </p> <h2>Slowing Progress </h2> <p>The halt at Universitetskaya-1 is a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin''s quest to find a new generation of oil fields to replace declining output from some of the country''s Soviet-era reserves. The Russian oil industry is dependent on expertise and equipment from the U.S. and Europe to penetrate crude reservoirs that are deeper, denser and more remote than anything they''ve attempted before. </p> <p>The disruption also is a setback for Exxon as the company seeks to lift production that touched a 4-year low in 2013 as the rate it''s replacing output with new discoveries tumbled to the lowest in half a decade. </p> <p>Exxon''s $3.2 billion exploration pact with Moscow-based Rosneft is a linchpin of the U.S. company''s bid to spur production and reserves growth in the next decade, said Brian Youngberg, an analyst at Edward Jones  Co. in St. Louis. </p> <h2>Enormous'' Potential </h2> <p>The Arctic drilling potential for Exxon is really enormous, said Youngberg, who has a hold rating on Exxon shares. It''s one of the key growth areas they''re looking to post-2020. </p> <p>Rosneft''s press office in Moscow declined to comment. Hagar Chemali, a U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson, declined to comment and referred a Bloomberg News inquiry to Exxon. </p> <p>Exxon is using the West Alpha rig owned by Seadrill Ltd. (SDRL)''s North Atlantic (NADL) Drilling unit at the Universitetskaya-1 site about 70 miles offshore. The rig departed a Norwegian shipyard in July and sailed around the northern coast of Scandinavia and into Russian territory right before the U.S. and EU prohibited exports of gear for Arctic, deep-water and shale drilling. </p> <p>Within weeks, the U.S. and EU moved to close loopholes in the sanctions by also banning the export of services such as engineering expertise and geological analysis for Russian Arctic, deep-water and shale projects. </p> <p>Exxon rose 0.5 percent to $97.12 at the close of trading in New York.

<p>Chevron Corp. (CVX), the world''s third-largest oil producer by market value, is seeking a buyer for one
of its smallest refineries, the Kapolei plant on the Hawaiian
island of Oahu. </p>
<p>The sale of the the 54,000-barrel-a-day Kapolei complex is
part of a larger plan to divest $10 billion worth of assets over
the next three years. Closing the plant would leave Hawaii with
a single 93,500-barrel-a-day refinery, which Par Petroleum Corp. (PARR)
bought from Tesoro Corp. (TSO) last year. </p>
<p>Chevron shares were up $1.03, or 0.8 percent, at $125.17 at
2:42 p.m. New York time. Par Petroleum Corp., which operates the
only other plant in Hawaii, gained 6 percent to $16.58. </p>
<p>Chevron has decided to engage an investment banking firm
to identify potential parties interested in the purchase of our
assets in Hawaii, Braden Reddall, a spokesman at Chevron''s
headquarters in San Ramon, California, said by telephone late
yesterday. No decision has been made at this time other than
to determine the level of interest of potential buyers. </p>
<p>Deutsche Bank has been hired by Chevron, two people with
direct knowledge of the situation said, while asking not to be
identified because the information isn''t public. </p>
<p>Al Chee, a Chevron spokesman at the refinery, declined by
telephone to comment. Ari Cohen, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank
in New York, declined by e-mail to comment. </p>
<h2>Fourth-Smallest </h2>
<p>Chevron previously considered turning the Kapolei complex
into a terminal. After a review three years ago, the company
decided to continue to run it as a refinery. It''s Chevron''s
fourth-smallest by capacity, data compiled by Bloomberg show. </p>
<p>Selling the refinery in 2011 was not as competitive as
improving its value, Michael Wirth, Chevron''s executive vice
president of downstream and chemicals, said in a conference call
with analysts at the time of the review. </p>
<p>Everybody realizes that''s a small refinery, he said.
It''s not an especially complex refinery. It''s got a somewhat
isolated and finite market. And so we''re really in the space of
optimizing every dimension of performance there. </p>
<p>The refinery ran 39,000 barrels a day in 2013, down from
46,000 in 2012, the company said in its 10-K annual report. Last
year, the plant imported 87 percent of its oil from Indonesia,
Thailand and Vietnam, Energy Information Administration data
show. </p>
<p>Earlier this month, Chevron extended a supply contract with
Hawaiian Electric Co. Inc. for low-sulfur fuel. Meanwhile, Par
Petroleum said it was losing its contracts with the utility in
December and was aggressively pursuing other outlets. </p>

<p>Mark Buche, 28, is just the type of
guy Harley-Davidson (HOG) (HOG) wants buying its bikes. </p>
<p>He wears vintage selvedge denim and Persol sunglasses. He
trims his tawny long hair at an old-style barbershop in Long
Beach, California, and camps in Big Sur with his 1975 Honda CBR
and a few similarly inclined twentysomething friends. </p>
<p>Hog-riding fat cats they''re not. But with their old cafe
racers and leather jackets scuffed more from use than the
demands of fashion, they''re far from dilettantes. And motorcycle
companies like Harley are targeting them with a provocative
idea: Why not make an electric motorcycle that is as fast and
good-looking as its conventional counterparts? </p>
<p>Everybody is very concerned with getting this new young
rider, said Mark Hoyer, the editor-in-chief of Cycle World, on
a recent phone call. And younger people are realizing these
electric bikes are genuinely fast. In fact, with the kind of
performance electric motorcycles have these days, anybody who
rides would be impressed. </p>
<p>No one thinks electric bikes will save the industry -- or
that the industry even needs saving, although sales have been
gradually declining since record highs in the early 2000s -- but
they will be a key factor in attracting the next generation of
enthusiasts. The folks at Harley-Davidson certainly think so:
Earlier this year they unveiled Project LiveWire, a futuristic
74-horsepower electric motorcycle prototype that goes 53 miles
between charges and hits 92 miles per hour at top speed. If 53
miles seems paltry as far as road trips go, that''s because it
is: You can barely get out of town on that, Hoyer pointed
out. But Harley says it''s a start. Company reps are testing
reactions to the bike from enthusiasts and prospective riders
alike over the next few months, but doesn''t plan to actually
produce LiveWire in volume. </p>
<h2>Mixed Reviews </h2>
<p>For many young riders, the aesthetic of the bike is
essential, and response on LiveWire''s low-slung body has been
mixed. </p>
<p>I''m not completely sold on the design, but I definitely
want to try it, Adam Kallen said recently outside his
Brooklyn-based motorcycle coffee shop, Jane Motorcycles. Kallen
owns a Ducati and offered one caveat: It has to sound good.
That''s non-negotiable. Until then, the jury is still out. </p>
<p>It''s true. While the near silence of Tesla''s Model S
affords it a certain futuristic lan that bolsters the sedan''s
appeal, the low whir of electric motorcycles, on the other hand,
can act as a detractor. Many people buy motorcycles precisely
because they like their guttural roar. They like to feel the
rumble of the handlebars as they release the clutch and open
that throaty engine. </p>
<h2>Hear The Roar </h2>
<p>Critics of electric motorcycles say the sound of a
traditional bike''s engine alerts drivers and pedestrians about
its proximity, while a silent bike is easily overlooked.
Proponents counter that if a rider plans to rely simply on the
sound of the engine to protect him from a collision, he''s
already not riding safe enough. What''s more, they add, the quiet
nature of electric bikes makes them perfect for riding through
close-quartered city streets and back-road trails because they
don''t disturb the neighbors, whether human or animal. </p>
<p>Harley-Davidson has fabricated a distinctive sound for the
LiveWire bike so as to uphold that audio covenant with hog
loyalists. And it''s hardly alone in this battle to become the
Tesla (TSLA) (TSLA) of motorcycles. Within the last year, electric
bikes have become significantly more powerful, smoother and
longer-lasting than the first electrified attempts that started
appearing five years ago -- those early Zeros, Brammos, and
obscure Chinese makes were closer to glorified Vespas than
anything Ducati or Triumph would build. </p>
<h2>Increasing Power </h2>
<p>In contrast, Zero''s latest, the $17,000 SR, has highly
tuned suspension and power-train technologies, not to mention a
motor that hits 60mph in 3.3 seconds. A seven-hour charge gets a
range of around 130 miles. Brammo''s $11,000 Enertia Plus gets
434 MPGe (that''s electric miles-per-gallon equivalent) with a
top speed of 60mph, and the $30,000, 160hp Mission R racer has a
top speed of more than 150mph with a sub-3-second, 0-60mph
sprint time. Earlier this year the Italian firm Energica, led by
its young CEO, Livia Cevolini, debuted the $68,000, 134hp Ego 45
superbike (0-60mph in 2.9 seconds). It charges in just three
hours. </p>
<p>The electric bike does all of the things I ride for --
without any of the drama. Scot Harden, vice president of
global marketing for Zero Motorcycles said last month in New
York. I ride for the excitement, the thrill, the acceleration,
the sense of control, the sense of freedom. The Zero
Streetfighter gives me all of that. What it doesn''t give me is
loud noise, vibration, heat, exhaust fumes, or oil stains in the
garage. Plus I don''t have any routine maintenance on the power
train. I don''t have to work on it. I just basically ride it. </p>
<h2>Room For Growth </h2>
<p>The idea is that these electrics, with their 100-plus-mile-range, zero emissions, and gearless twist-and-go acceleration
are perfect both for urban and off-road fun. And that their
silent, maintenance-light sensibility might attract new riders,
particularly women, intimidated by the heavy clutches and grimy
responsibilities associated with caf racers and street bikes. </p>
<p>There''s certainly room for growth: Even though their
numbers have increased by double digits since 2003, women
represent only 25% of motorcycle riders nationwide, according to
the Motorcycle Industry Council. Last year BMW, Harley-Davidson,
Honda, Kawasaki, KTM, Piaggio, Suzuki, Triumph, and Yamaha sold
561,000 bikes nationwide, up from 557,000 in 2012 but down a
staggering 53% from the 1.2 million sold in 2006. This year
motorcycle sales remain relatively unchanged, according to MIC,
which tallied 139,922 new units sold in Q1, 17 units higher than
the same period in 2013. </p>
<h2>A Delicate Balance </h2>
<p>But if electric bikes hope to play a real role in boosting
the bottom line, they''ll have to reach that delicate balance
between batteries that can offer enough power for long rides but
that are also relatively lightweight and affordable enough for
regular consumers. Current price premiums on the smallest,
strongest, best lithium-ion batteries pump MSRPs up tens of
thousands of dollars, forcing those bikes far out of reach for
the average consumer. Add to that the fact that gasoline-powered
motorcycles are already fuel-efficient -- a Ducati Monster 696
gets 40 MPG on a 4-gallon tank, plenty of room for long
adventures without frequent pit stops -- leaving some to
question whether an electrified bike is even necessary. </p>
<p>Of course, for young riders with discretionary income and a
thirst for novelty, those things don''t matter so much. Just ask
Buche. </p>
<p>There is a different tool for each job, he said
grinning over coffee in a West Hollywood cafe. Some
motorcycles are magic bullets that do everything really well,
like a Swiss Army knife. But even if it''s your favorite bike,
you''re going to park it sometimes. Electric motorcycles are
really fun. I want them to come in a serious way -- and
quickly. </p>

It''s the fourth U.S.-based issuer to sell the securities. Borrowers raised $2 trillion from all bond sales in America last year, more than 46 times the amount sold in the Shariah market and more than the value of Islamic financial assets globally. </p> <h2>Negative Perception </h2> <p>Hong Kong, the U.K., South Africa and Sharjah, one of seven sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates, are among borrowers that have sold Islamic bonds for the first time this year. New York-based Goldman Sachs''s five-year notes yielded 21 basis points more than similar maturity non-Shariah compliant debt it issued in January at 3:21 p.m. in Dubai. The bank attracted orders for three times the $500 million it sold. </p> <p>Islamic finance''s level of awareness and depth of knowhow in general in the U.S. is at best at its infancy, with negative connotations stemming misconceptions, Rizwan Kanji, a Dubai-based partner at King  Spalding, said by telephone from Dubai Sept. 18. </p> <p>Islam is the most negatively perceived religion in the U.S., followed by atheism, according to a study by the Washington-based Pew Research Center published in July. About 1.9 million Muslims live in the country, the seventh-biggest religious group among about 319 million people, according to CIA World Factbook data. </p> <h2>Risk Premium </h2> <p>While Goldman Sachs''s sukuk won''t create a market of new issuers in the U.S., frequent conventional issuers will start to see sukuk as a new avenue for tighter pricing or diversification of their investor base, Kanji said. Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase  Co. were among the biggest issuers of debt last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. </p> <p>Rob Julavits, a spokesman for Citigroup, Zia Ahmed from Bank of America and Jessica Francisco from JPMorgan declined to comment last week on whether the lenders will be pursuing Islamic financing deals. </p> <h2>Stamp Duties </h2> <p>Borrowers using sukuk need assets to underlie the debt and there''s an additional cost of hiring Shariah scholars or boards to structure the securities. </p> <p>If you''re a U.S. corporate that doesn''t have tangible assets it can utilize, it''s more challenging to structure a sukuk, Mohammed Dawood, HSBC''s Dubai-based global head of sukuk financing, said in a Sept. 11 interview. The U.S. hasn''t passed sukuk-specific legislation, unlike Hong Kong and the U.K., which have passed legislation to address tax and legal impediments. </p> <p>To adhere to Islam''s ban on interest, the bonds pay a return on assets and may attract double charges on stamp duties because of the sale and purchase of goods to back the debt. Profits or capital gains incur taxes, whereas interest is tax deductible. </p> <p>Islamic finance is too new for U.S.-based issuers, and the structures and impediments are too complicated, Conboy said. </p> <p>Anything with Shariah attached to it carries a small risk premium, he said. </p> <p> ', 'Goldman Sachs Sukuk Seen as Too Risky for U.S. Imitators', 'By Daria Solovieva and Dana El Baltaji', 'Sep 22, 2014  7:30 AM ET', '0') AS tmp WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT url FROM collect_news WHERE url= 'http://bloomberg.com/news/2014-09-22/goldman-sukuk-seen-too-risky-for-u-s-imitators-islamic-finance.html') LIMIT 1;

<p>Poland''s top three coal companies,
burdened by losses amid communist-era benefit payments and a
market glut, are hiring banks including JPMorgan Chase  Co. and
BNP Paribas SA to sell debut Eurobonds to raise cash. </p>
<p>Barclays Plc and BNP Paribas were picked by Katowicki
Holding Weglowy SA, the third-biggest coal-miner, to manage a
euro-denominated debt sale, two people familiar with the plan
said on Sept. 18, asking not to be identified because the
details are private. Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG
were also hired by the miners, separate people said. </p>
<p>The unprecedented rush for international financing is
occurring as mining unions prepare protests against plans by the
state-controlled companies to restructure operations and clamp
down on benefits. Kompania Weglowa SA, the European Union''s
largest producer, said this week it will scrap free coal
allowances for 160,000 retired employees, which cost it about
260 million zloty ($79.1 million) annually. </p>
<p>Foreign issues are the only way for these companies to
gain funds, Mariusz Zarod, a money manager at BZ WBK Asset
Management in Poznan, Poland, with the equivalent of $3.7
billion under management, said by e-mail yesterday. If they
manage to pull it off, they will probably sell high-yield notes,
even though some investors won''t go near them. </p>

<p>Kompania, which had a 675.7 million-zloty net loss last
year, chose Barclays, BNP and Deutsche Bank for its offering,
according to separate people familiar with the plan. The company
aims to meet three rating companies by early October, spokesman
Tomasz Zieba said last week, declining to comment on the sale. </p>

March 2009, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Waning demand is

unions, Zarod said. Scrapping the free coal benefits will help
Kompania avoid bankruptcy and pave the way for long-term
financing, the company said in the Sept. 23 e-mail. </p>
<p>Miners ran up a combined 772.3 million-zloty net loss in
the first half, compared with profit of 15.6 million zloty a
year earlier, the Economy Ministry said. </p>
<h2>Industry Headwinds </h2>
<p>Katowicki Holding will seek to raise 500 million euros
($636 million) of bonds in November to refinance existing debt
and boost working capital, Chief Financial Officer Artur Trzeciakowski told PAP newswire on Sept. 18. The company earlier
held talks with most banks in Poland and failed to convince
them to increase their funding, he said. </p>
<p>The Polish debt offerings come as some eastern European
miners face headwinds. Russia''s economy minister said last week
he saw no alternative to bankruptcy for OAO Mechel, the
country''s biggest producer of coking coal, following nine months
of unsuccessful efforts to refinance its debt. New World
Resources Plc, a Czech miner, is restructuring 775 million euros
of bonds after falling coal prices hit it with seven consecutive
quarterly losses. </p>
<p>Polish government debt has attracted investors seeking less
risky regional assets amid the fallout from the Ukraine crisis.
The yield on the 2019 euro-denominated sovereign bond declined
to a record low of 0.61 percent today. </p>
<p>It should be possible for Polish miners to place
Eurobonds (BEMC) as long as they are state-controlled, Clemens Hansmann, a money manager at Gutmann Kapitalanlage AG in Vienna,
which oversees 7 billion euros of assets, said by e-mail
yesterday. There is a structural decline in global demand for
thermal coal. For the Polish coal mines, this pressure will
continue and investors are well aware of these structural
issues, he said. </p>

drawings were work-for-hire and the family couldn''t terminate
the publisher''s copyright to the characters. </p>
<p>Disney acquired Marvel for $4.2 billion in 2009. Since
then, characters such as Iron Man and Thor have proved box
office gold for the Burbank, California-based company. </p>

2012. This year''s Guardians of the Galaxy, based on lesser-known Marvel characters, also led the domestic box office with
$315 million in tickets sold since its August release. </p>
<h2>Spider-Man Fees </h2>
<p>Licensing fees from merchandise tied to Marvel characters
such as Spider-Man have boosted the results of Disney''s
consumer-products division. </p>
<p>In 2009, Kirby''s adult children sent 45 notices to Marvel
to terminate license renewals for the characters in comics
published from 1958 to 1963. Marvel sued in January 2010,
seeking a judgment that the termination notices were invalid. </p>
<p>Kirby, who died in 1994, also created or co-created the
Fantastic Four and the Avengers. His heirs said their father was
a freelance artist paid by the page who received no benefits
from Marvel. Stan Lee, who worked for Marvel as an editor, is

the three refused to join four other lenders including Deutsche
Bank AG (DBK) and Societe Generale SA (GLE) who paid a total of 1 billion
euros ($1.3 billion) to settle the case. The delays -- including

antitrust probe into credit derivatives trading by 13 of the
world''s biggest banks. </p>
<p>It''s clear that Almunia has accepted that he won''t be
able to finalize several cases and Euribor is just one more
on his list, Giraud said. The officials working on the case
aren''t therefore in as much of a hurry. </p>
<p>The EU ombudsman, the internal EU watchdog, opened a case
on July 31 after Credit Agricole complained that public comments
made by Almunia indicated he had already made up his mind about
the conclusion of the Euribor investigation, Bloomberg News
reported this week. </p>
<p>Almunia''s stance explains the banks'' determination to try
to delay the case until after his departure, said the people. </p>
<h2>Fairness and Transparency'' </h2>
<p>His successor, former Danish Economy Minister Margrethe Vestager, is scheduled to take over the EU antitrust brief and
deal with the EU ombudsman''s inquiry at the start of November. </p>
<p>Vestager said this month that all cases should be treated
with fairness and transparency. </p>
<p>Aside from examining Euribor, Vestager will inherit a
preliminary probe into suspected rigging of foreign-exchange
markets, which is part of a global scandal that tarnished the
reputation of some of the world''s biggest lenders. Oil
benchmarks are also under scrutiny. </p>
<p>JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole were accused on May 20
by the commission of colluding to rig Euribor rates. </p>
<p>The so-called statement of objections was the next step in
the EU enforcement process after the banks dropped out of
settlement talks last year. The EU procedure allows them to
respond to the complaint in writing and request a hearing. If
companies fail to deflect accusations in antitrust cases they
are then usually fined. </p>
<p>The Euro Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, and Libor, the
London Interbank Offered Rate, gauge banks'' estimated cost of
borrowing over different periods of time. Libor alone is the
benchmark interest rate for more than $300 trillion of
securities. </p>
<h2>Banks Prejudged </h2>
<p>While JPMorgan, HSBC and Credit Agricole haven''t yet been
found liable, the December settlements spell out their role in
helping to manipulate Euribor, said another person familiar with
the confidential EU documents. This suggested the EU had
prejudged the three banks before they were given their full due-process rights, said the person who is familiar with the
reasoning of a settling bank and raised the issue with the
commission. </p>
<p>The commission shouldn''t make any allusion to the
liability of companies in a final decision -- such as the
December Euribor settlements -- before the firms are given a
chance to fend off charges, according to EU case law. </p>
<p>The companies could argue their case has been decided
before they had the chance to defend themselves, said Alfonso
Lamadrid, a lawyer at Garrigues in Brussels who''s not involved
in the case. This would give them new procedural ammunition to
challenge an eventual sanction in court. </p>

<p>Pfizer Inc. (PFE)''s Xalkori for advanced
lung cancer shrunk tumors in those with a rare genetic mutation,
according to a study that may provide the first targeted
treatment for these patients. </p>
<p>Xalkori reduced the size of tumors in 36 of 50 patients in
the study while halting tumor growth in another nine, according
to company-funded research released today at the European
Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Madrid and online in the
New England Journal of Medicine. </p>
<p>About 15,000 people, or 1 percent of the estimated 1.5
million annual new cases of non-small-cell lung cancer, have an
abnormality to the ROS1 gene, according to New York-based
Pfizer. Today''s findings also showed that Xalkori was effective
for about 18 months in patients, longer than the average eight
to 12 months seen for some other targeted treatments, said Alice
Shaw, a lead study author. </p>
<p>We''re seeing much longer durations of remissions, Shaw,
an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said in a telephone
interview. This points to being a very good target in lung
cancer and this drug being a very effective targeted therapy for
these patients. </p>
<p>Xalkori helps shut off the ROS1 gene that is causing cancer
tumors to grow, she said. It was approved in 2011 to treat non-small-cell lung cancers in patients with mutations to the ALK
gene, which has structural similarities to the ROS1 gene. The
National Comprehensive Cancer Network, an alliance of 25 cancer
centers, already recommends that doctors use Xalkori in patients
who have this gene defect. </p>
<h2>More Testing </h2>
<p>Pfizer continues to support clinical research of Xalkori
in patients with ROS1 rearrangements to better understand the
compound''s activity in this population, Sally Beatty, a
company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail. </p>
<p>The cancer drug generated $282 million in 2013 sales,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The drug may produce
revenue of more than $812 million in 2017, according to the
average of five analysts'' estimates. </p>
<p>Patients with a mutation to the ROS1 gene are often younger
and usually aren''t smokers, Shaw said. </p>
<p>Today''s study is an expansion of the original Phase 1
clinical trial of Xalkori in patients with the ALK gene
mutation. Researchers enrolled 50 patients who were ROS1
positive starting in late 2010 through August 2013. Those in the
study received Xalkori two times daily. </p>
<p>By the end of the trial, half of the patients were still
getting Xalkori and had no signs of their tumors growing, the
authors said. </p>
<p>We''re hopeful that because of showing how well this drug
works in ROS1 patients, this will let pathologists know they
need to screen their patients for this genetic abnormality,
Shaw said. In lung cancer there''s been a lot of progress made
in targeted therapies. </p>

<p>The European Central Bank will
start its asset-purchase program with covered bonds because
large trades in the debt are easier than for asset-backed
securities, according to JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) </p>
<p>The new-issue market for covered notes is more active than
for asset-backed debt and investors typically hold larger
amounts than ABS buyers, JPMorgan analysts led by Gareth Davies
wrote in a note to clients. With 791 billion euros ($1 trillion)
of covered bonds outstanding, compared with 251 billion euros of
ABS, the central bank will also find it easier to expand its
balance sheet, Davies said. </p>
<p>Policy makers are seeking to spur economic growth by
encouraging lending and will disclose the size and details of
the program after policy makers meet this week. ECB President
Mario Draghi, who has made the revival of the ABS market a top
priority this year as he seeks to channel credit to businesses
by freeing up bank balance sheets, mentioned purchases of
covered bonds for the first time this month. </p>
<p>The ECB is likely to begin its purchase program in the
covered bond space as it is unlikely to be able to do meaningful
size in the ABS market, London-based Davies said in a
telephone interview today. If the ECB wants a strong sentiment
change by making large purchases it''s hard to do that in the
secondary or new-issue ABS markets as there quite simply aren''t
enough bonds. </p>
<p>The debt-buying plans have been greeted with skepticism by
investors who suggest the central bank will struggle to buy
enough securities after the market contracted more than 40
percent since 2010. Covered bond purchases are being considered
to expand the amount of assets available to purchase. </p>
<h2>Retained ABS </h2>
<p>Draghi said earlier this month the Frankfurt-based central
bank will buy a broad portfolio of simple and transparent
securities that will include ABS and covered bonds. While
declining to disclose the size of the program, he signaled a
willingness to grow the ECB''s balance sheet by as much 1
trillion euros. </p>
<p>Europe''s public ABS market isn''t big enough to achieve that
goal and purchases of the 635 billion euros of notes created and
retained by banks to use as collateral for central bank funding
during the financial crisis wouldn''t effect the ECB''s balance
sheet, said Davies. </p>
<p>Banks create asset-backed securities by bundling individual
loans such as mortgages, auto credit and credit-card debt.
Covered bonds are guaranteed by the issuer and have a designated
pool of assets, such as mortgages and public sector loans, which
can be used to meet payments if the issuer can''t. </p>

<p>JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM) lost a bid to
block buyers of $10 billion worth of residential mortgage-backed
securities it packaged in 2007 to proceed as a group with their
lawsuit alleging the bank misled them. </p>
<p>U.S. District Judge J. Paul Oetken in Manhattan today ruled
that the claims of investors in nine separate offerings of the
securities were similar enough for them to move forward as a
class on the question of whether JPMorgan is liable for making
false and misleading statements in the offering documents. </p>
<p>The ruling only applies to liability. Oetken said he wasn''t
convinced at this stage that there''s a damages calculation that
would cover the claims of all the investors included in the
group. </p>
<p>JPMorgan last year agreed to a $13 billion settlement with
the U.S. to resolve allegations the bank misled investors in
mortgage-backed securities about the soundness and risks of the
investments that helped bring on subprime-mortgage crisis of
2008. </p>
<p>Because the class is currently certified for liability
purposes, this phase of litigation will focus on the issue of
whether defendants made material false statements or omissions
in the offering documents that affected the value of the
certificates owned by the plaintiff class members, the judge
said. </p>
<p>Joe Evangelisti, a spokesman for New York-based JPMorgan,
declined to comment on today''s ruling. </p>
<p>Class certification will allow individual investors who
haven''t filed a lawsuit to be represented by the lead plaintiff
in a single case because their experiences and legal claims are
similar. Class-action status is less expensive for plaintiffs
than filing multiple lawsuits and provides leverage in
settlement negotiations. </p>

<h2>Earnings Boost </h2>
<p>JPMorgan''s physical commodity business, formerly led by
Blythe Masters, has previously generated annual operating profit
before compensation costs of $750 million, according to people
who have seen documents related to the unit''s sale. That would
bring Mercuria, which posted net income of $273 million last
year, closer to earnings achieved by competitors Vitol Group and
Trafigura Beheer BV. </p>
<p>Mercuria competed with Macquarie Group Ltd. and Blackstone
Group LP to enter exclusive negotiations for the unit in
February, people with knowledge of the bidding said at the time.
The JPMorgan unit, put up for sale last year, was slated to give
Mercuria gas and power trading operations on both sides of the
Atlantic, physical assets spanning about 40 locations in North
America and 6 million barrels of storage leases in the Canadian
oil sands. </p>
<p>Mercuria also gets Henry Bath  Sons Ltd., a 220-year-old
metal-warehouse operator based in Liverpool, England, that will
be operated as a stand-alone subsidiary separated from
Mercuria''s trading operations. Henry Bath was a founding member
of the London Metal Exchange, and handles products that include
aluminum, steel and copper as well as cocoa and coffee,
according to its website. </p>
<p>Mercuria, which is registered in Cyprus and has its main
trading operations in Geneva, offered jobs to about 200 people,
or about half of the unit''s staff, a person familiar with the
matter said in March. </p>

<p>Walt Disney Co. (DIS)''s board found a way
to keep Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger in place
until 2018 while maximizing the chances the internal candidates
most likely to succeed him stick around. </p>
<p>Disney, based in Burbank, California, yesterday extended
Iger''s contract by two years to June 2018. The move keeps in
place a manager who has spearheaded high-profile acquisitions
like Marvel, turned around the company''s historic animation
business and tripled Disney''s stock price. </p>
<p>At the same time, the company has decided to name a chief
operating officer next year -- and that executive, most likely
coming from within, would be Iger''s heir apparent, according to
a person close to the company. Giving a time frame to the
internal candidates, Chief Financial Officer Jay Rasulo and
Parks  Resorts Chairman Thomas Staggs, makes them less likely
to bolt before a decision is made. </p>
<p>There''s no doubt Bob Iger has been performing at an
outstanding level, said William Simon, an executive recruiter
who heads the entertainment industry practice at Korn Ferry (KFY) in
Los Angeles. Asking a potential successor to wait four years
could prove to be difficult. </p>
<p>The company said in a filing today that Iger could earn a
retention bonus of $60 million if Disney''s operating income
increases to a cumulative $78.3 billion for the five years
ending in September 2018. He will earn a smaller bonus if that
number tops $76 billion. For the year that ended in September
2013, the company generated operating income of $10.7 billion. </p>

<p>Goldman Sachs Group Inc. says it''s
losing confidence in its forecast that Brent crude will recover
to $100 a barrel next year. </p>
<p>While the Wall Street bank is maintaining its projection
for now, it says that a lack of signs of accelerating global
economic growth and uncertainty over OPEC''s production plans
amid rising Libyan output are weakening its conviction. Brent,
the benchmark for more than half the world''s oil, closed at
$93.42 a barrel yesterday, the lowest in more than two years. </p>
<p>Prices slumped as U.S. crude production climbed last month
to the highest level since 1986 and the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries pumped the most oil in a year. The
International Energy Agency cut its projections for global
consumption growth through next year due to a weakening economic
outlook while Saudi Arabia lowered prices this week, signaling
the world''s biggest exporter is prepared to let them fall rather
than cede market share. </p>
<p>Given the lack of strong catalyst for higher prices, the
path of least resistance seems for further declines, Goldman
analysts including New York-based Jeffrey Currie said in an e-mailed report. However, the downside from here starts to
become limited as further declines in Brent prices would help
rebalance the oil market, incentivizing stronger demand growth
and weighing on production growth in the U.S. </p>
<p>Brent for November delivery was 39 cents higher at $93.81 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, at 3:29
p.m. Singapore time. Futures plunged 16 percent in the three
months to Sept. 30, the worst quarterly performance since June
2012. They have declined 15.3 percent this year. </p>
<h2>WTI Spread </h2>
<p>West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark grade, for
November delivery was at $91.52 a barrel in electronic trading
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, bringing its decline this
year to 7 percent. </p>
<p>WTI''s discount to Brent shrank to $2.41 yesterday based on
settlement prices, the smallest since August 2013. The spread is
far too narrow given logistic economics and needs to
widen, Goldman said in its report. </p>
<p>At this level, the spread will boost U.S. imports,
increasing inventories on the Gulf Coast and at Cushing,
Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, Goldman said. The bank
forecasts the difference will rebound to $10 a barrel in 2015. </p>
<p>Goldman''s conviction in its 2015 Brent forecast is waning
due to lack of tangible signs of sequential acceleration in
global economic growth, including in China, during the second
half of 2014, it said in the report. </p>
<p>Economists have cut estimates for this year''s gross
domestic product growth in China after data on industrial
profits, factory output and credit showed a deteriorating
outlook. </p>
<p>The Asian nation will account for about 11 percent of
global oil demand this year, compared with 21 percent for the
U.S., forecasts from the IEA in Paris show. </p>
<h2>Brent Recovery </h2>
<p>The chance of a price recovery to Goldman''s $100 forecast
for 2015 may also be capped if longer-term prices, which have
risen this year, catch up with the slide in prompt contracts,
the bank said. </p>
<p>Stabilizing geopolitical risk and growing perception of a
demand-constrained oil market could well combine to reverse some
of this remaining $4 a barrel year-to-date rally in five-year
forward Brent prices, it said. </p>
<p>Brent''s decline probably isn''t sustainable, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. On the weekly chart, the relative strength
index has dropped to 27.4, the lowest level since June 2012,
when futures fell to an 18-month low of less than $90 a barrel.
Readings below 30 typically signal a market is oversold and may
rebound. </p>

<p>Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) said in a patent
lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co. that the South Korean
smartphone maker paid it as much as $1 billion in royalties last
year under a now-disputed 2011 licensing agreement. </p>
<p>The payment was disclosed for the first time in a court
filing in Microsoft''s complaint alleging Samsung breached an
agreement to share patents. The seven-year accord requires
Samsung to pay Microsoft royalties for phones and tablets that
use the software maker''s patented technology, according to the
filing yesterday in Manhattan federal court. </p>
<p>Samsung has refused to pay $6.9 million in interest owed
under the agreement, according to the filing. </p>
<p>Samsung has suggested that Microsoft has breached the
business collaboration agreement, David Howard, Microsoft''s
deputy general counsel, said yesterday in a blog post. We
disagree, and that''s why we asked the court to rule that
Microsoft is not in breach. </p>
<p>Microsoft claims Samsung is using Microsoft''s acquisition
of Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)''s phone business as an excuse to stop complying
with the contract. The license agreement contains explicit
provisions that grant a patent license to both companies''
subsidiaries, including Nokia, Microsoft said in the complaint. </p>
